Likewise, other data collected (functional demographic, comorbidities,\n      home treatment, anxiety and depression and quality of life).\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the administration of roflumilast by a\n      gradual pattern varies the incidence of discontinuations due to adverse events when compared\n      with the usual dosage."
