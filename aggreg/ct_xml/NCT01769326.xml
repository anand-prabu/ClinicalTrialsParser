    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare different methods for training hand
      movement at home after stroke. This study involves research because it will test two
      experimental devices, the MusicGlove and the Resonating Arm Exerciser (RAE), compared to
      conventional hand and arm exercises.  The MusicGlove is a glove that measures finger
      movements and allows its user to play a musical computer game using those movements. The RAE
      is a lever that attaches to a manual wheelchair with elastic bands and can be pushed back
      and forth to exercise the arm.
