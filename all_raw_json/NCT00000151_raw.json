            "textblock": "ETDRS was a multicenter, randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate argon laser\n      photocoagulation and aspirin treatment in the management of patients with nonproliferative\n      or early proliferative diabetic retinopathy.  A total of 3,711 patients were recruited to be\n      followed for a minimum of 4 years to provide long-term information on the risks and benefits\n      of the treatments under study.\n\n      The eligibility criteria for the ETDRS were designed to include a broad range of macular\n      edema severity, from a few small hard exudates within a disc diameter of the fovea with\n      normal visual acuity to extensive cystoid spaces with a visual acuity of 20/200.  All study\n      patients had one eye randomly assigned to immediate photocoagulation and the other eye to\n      deferral of photocoagulation until high-risk proliferative retinopathy developed.  During\n      followup, additional photocoagulation was allowed for any degree of macular edema within the\n      eligibility range, but additional photocoagulation was required only for edema involving or\n      threatening the center of the macula.  The term \"clinically significant macular edema\" was\n      coined to designate this level of severity.\n\n      The trial use of aspirin therapy was based on clinical observation and on aspirin's possible\n      mechanisms of action.  Previous observations of diabetic patients who were taking large\n      doses of aspirin for rheumatoid arthritis showed that the prevalence of retinopathy in this\n      group was lower than the prevalence that would be expected in the diabetic population at\n      large.  Evidence suggested that diabetic patients have altered platelet aggregation and\n      disaggregation, which may contribute to the capillary closure seen in retinopathy.  This\n      abnormality is reversed by aspirin  in vitro .  However, because of aspirin's other possible\n      mechanisms of action and its well-known side effects, such as allergic, idiosyncratic, and\n      intolerance reactions, the use of this therapy in the ETDRS was carefully controlled and\n      monitored."
