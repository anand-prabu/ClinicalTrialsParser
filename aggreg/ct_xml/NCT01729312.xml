    <textblock>
      To make reading this consent form easier, the word &quot;you&quot; refers to you or your child (if a
      minor) throughout the consent form. This research is being done to study the effects of an
      eighteen-session strengthening program and to see if there is a relationship between the
      female athletes improving their landing techniques which has been proven to decrease
      anterior cruciate ligament injuries.

      You have been asked to take part in a research study because you are a female athlete
      involved in a sport that has an increased anterior cruciate ligament injury rate. The
      purpose of this research study is to find out if an eighteen-session strengthening program
      will decrease your anterior cruciate ligament injury rate.

      There will be approximately ninety-four (94) people in this research study at Henry Ford
      Health System (HFHS).

      The purpose of this research program is to use Dartfish technology and Functional Movement
      Screen to assess female athletes pre- and post injury prevention program.The study will
      include ninety-four females: forty-seven who complete a nine week program focusing on
      neuromuscular and proprioceptive exercises to improve landing techniques, and forty-seven
      who go about their normal preseason training regimen. This program has no more risk than if
      each athlete were to work out at their own gym. Each athlete will be given two
      questionnaires before and after completing the program in order to determine their level of
      activity has changed as well as uncover any underlying knee issues. They will also go
      through a series of functional and movement tests to reveal any imbalances, and determine
      whether or not they have improved by going through the prevention program.

      All functional and movement tests will be video recorded. These recordings will only be used
      for the purpose of conducting this research study and will only be viewed by the HFHS people
      participating in the study. We will follow-up with each athlete one year later to see if
      there are any lasting effects from the program and re-test each athlete at that time to
      validate any results
