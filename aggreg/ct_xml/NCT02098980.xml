  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an association between elevated Type II Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) risk and low serum
      levels of vitamin D. It is important to examine whether Vitamin D can enhance oral glucose
      tolerance in individuals at risk for developing T2DM. As such, the hypothesis suggested is
      that Vitamin D supplementation (4,000 IU/day) for 24 weeks in pre-diabetic individuals will
      decrease insulin resistance and the associated metabolic indices linked to the later
      development of T2DM.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epidemiologically, there is an association between elevated T2DM risk and low serum levels
      of vitamin D and suggest that it may protect against the diseases through the improvement of
      insulin sensitivity as well as secretion and reducing chronic inflammation. Although some of
      these effects were shown in clinical studies, no study permitted the inference that vitamin
      D can reduce blood glucose and attenuate inflammation. Post-prandial glucose is the most
      sensitive to alterations in insulin sensitivity. Therefore, it is rational to examine
      whether vitamin D can enhance oral glucose tolerance in individuals at risk for developing
      T2DM and to elucidate the mechanism by which this occurs, i.e. via improved insulin
      sensitivity or improved insulin secretion, or both. Furthermore, identifying a distinct
      proteomics-based signature that can be used to distinguish responders to supplementation
      from non-responders is critical to define the bases for inter-individual variation in
      response and the effect of vitamin D on the prevention of T2DM. Identification of this
      proteomics-based signature will enable us to tailor alternative preventive measures to
      adjust the vitamin D dose to non-responders, leading to more effective and precise
      intervention protocols.
