  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective in this pilot study is to test the combined effect of a) replacing office
      workers' sedentary workstations with active workstations (LifeBalance Station) and b)
      optimizing computer workstation ergonomics on daily occupational sedentary time,
      cardiometabolic risk factors, musculoskeletal symptom health outcomes and work productivity.

      Primary Aim: To compare the effects of providing sedentary employees with seated active
      workstations in combination with an ergonomic intervention and regular motivational emails
      (experimental group) against the ergonomic intervention and regular emails only (active
      control group) on occupational sedentary behavior over 16 weeks.

      Hypothesis: The addition of a seated active workstation will result in significant
      reductions in daily occupational sedentary time compared to the active control group.

      Secondary Aims: To compare the effects of the experimental group against the active control
      group on secondary measures of cardiometabolic disease risk factors, musculoskeletal
      discomfort, cognitive function and work productivity.

      Hypothesis 1: The experimental group will result in reduced cardiometabolic disease risk,
      musculoskeletal discomfort and work limitations compared to the active control group.

    <description>Occupational sedentary behavior (primary outcome) will be measured objectively with the GENEActiv physical activity monitor. The monitor will be worn on the right ankle and will be worn for 5 working days during all non-bathing hours. We will also objectively measure daily pedaling time via a Bluetooth enabled device (Wahoo Fitness Blue SC sensor) and accompanying iPod application.</description>
