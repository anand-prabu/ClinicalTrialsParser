  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial of grocery-store based nutrition counseling visits for weight management
      vs. in-office visits. The investigators will test pre- and post-intervention
      individual-level dietary quality, knowledge, self-efficacy around dietary choice, and cost
      of shopping, measuring difference between intervention and control arms. At the study's end,
      the investigators will also conduct focus groups with a subset of 20 patients (10 from each
      arm) and do a structured interview with the dietitian to better understand the feasibility,
      strengths and shortcomings of this approach. Patients who complete the main portion of the
      trial will be randomly selected for recruitment into a focus group and consented separately
      for that focus group at the end of the study.

      The investigators hypothesize that, compared to office-based visits, the KP Personal Shopper
      visits will result in higher member diet quality scores, better nutritional knowledge
      scores, higher self-efficacy and confidence around food purchasing decisions, and more
      favorable perception of the visit by both dietician and member. The KP Personal Shopper
      approach may also result in increased grocery store costs for some members. Long-term, the
      investigators hypothesize that improvements in member perception, knowledge and dietary
      quality will lead to improved health outcomes.

    <description>A modified version of the Parmenter-Wardle Nutrition Knowledge Questionnaire (1999, UK) has been created based on present-day guidelines and eating patterns in the Southeast U.S., and will be administered at baseline and scored, then re-administered after the intervention and re-scored to determine whether or how the score improved after the intervention with the dietitian.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Receipts from a typical week's worth of grocery shopping will be collected from all participants at baseline. Then, the same process will be repeated each month during the intervention phase to see what effect participation has on costs of grocery shopping for participants (e.g. if buying more produce because shopping with dietitian - will shopping be more expensive?)</description>

    <description>25 participants will be randomized to this arm. They will receive a baseline 30-minute phone call with the study dietitian to determine their current health problems, dietary patterns, shopping and cooking habits and health goals. They will then have 3 in-person visits with the dietitian conducted during grocery shopping trips at a local supermarket. These in-person visits will be conducted monthly over a 3 month period. The information delivered in the visits will be similar in content to that delivered in an in-office visit, including how to pick the best types of foods or ingredients for a given health condition, how to read and understand food labels, healthy recipes, how to track food and drink intake, and basic nutritional knowledge.</description>

    <description>25 participants will be randomized to this arm. They will receive a baseline 30-minute phone call with the study dietitian to determine their current health problems, dietary patterns, shopping and cooking habits and health goals. They will then have 3 in-person visits with the dietitian conducted in an office at one of our medical office buildings. These in-person visits will be conducted monthly over a 3 month period. The information delivered in the visits will include how to pick the best types of foods or ingredients for a given health condition, how to read and understand food labels, healthy recipes, how to track food and drink intake, and basic nutritional knowledge.</description>
