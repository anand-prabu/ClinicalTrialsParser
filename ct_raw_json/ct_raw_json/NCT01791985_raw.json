            "textblock": "This study is looking at a new drug called AZD4547 which is being tested for the treatment\n      of oestrogen receptor positive breast cancer. AZD4547 is a drug which specifically \"blocks\"\n      proteins called fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1) that are involved in the\n      processes that help cancer cells to grow. These proteins may also be responsible for the\n      development of resistance to hormonal therapies used to treat some breast cancers. AZD4547\n      is not yet approved for use in breast cancer and is therefore being used in this study as a\n      research drug.\n\n      The investigators will also test the theory that it is not necessary for high levels of\n      FGFR1 to be present in the body to see benefit from AZD4547.\n\n      The study will be carried out in two stages. Stage 1 is to find a suitable dose of AZD4547\n      which can be used together with a class of drugs called nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors\n      (e.g. anastrozole or letrozole) i.e. a dose which does not cause too many unacceptable side\n      effects.\n\n      Stage 2 will then compare this new treatment of AZD4547 and nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitor\n      against the current standard treatment using a steroidal aromatase inhibitor (exemestane) to\n      see if the new treatment can either stop the cancer from growing or cause a reduction in the\n      size of the tumour. Patients will be randomly selected to receive either:\n\n        1. Exemestane (control arm) or\n\n        2. AZD4547+letrozole or anastrozole (experimental arm).\n\n      In both stages, the study will look at how well the new treatment is tolerated. Each patient\n      is only allowed to take part in either stage 1 or 2.\n\n      Patients with hormone sensitive (oestrogen receptor positive) breast cancer, whose current\n      treatment with anastrozole or letrozole has recently stopped working properly will be\n      eligible for this study. The study will be run in 9 Hospitals across England and Scotland."
