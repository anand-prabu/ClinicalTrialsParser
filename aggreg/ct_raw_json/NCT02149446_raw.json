            "textblock": "Resection of the distal pancreas is often done due to a localized tumor in the body or tail\n      of the pancreas. During later years the mortality after pancreatic resections have been\n      reduced but there still is a substantial risk of severe complications mainly due to leakage\n      from the pancreatic division line which could lead to suffering, longer hospital stay,\n      higher costs and sometimes death. Leakage from a tail resection is probably more common than\n      thought of before. Frequencies of above 30% and even up to 60% have been reported.\n\n      The use of somatostatin to reduce the production of pancreatic juice or comparison between\n      stapled division, suturing of the remaining part of the cut pancreas or covering it with\n      glue or available surrounding tissue have not showed significant superiority for any of\n      these methods except for a positive trend regarding the stapling technique. Staple line\n      reinforcement with resorbable mesh has in some studies showed a both negative and positive\n      effect on pancreatic fistula frequency. These studies have been small and non-randomized. A\n      larger randomized single blinded study by Hamilton et al on the other hand showed a\n      significant positive effect on pancreatic fistula frequency after distal pancreatic\n      resection using an absorbable reinforcement device put on the stapler, when only regarding\n      type B and C fistulas as defined by the ISGPF (International Study Group on Pancreatic\n      Fistula) pancreatic leak grading system.\n\n      Although all these endeavors the problem of pancreatic fistulas remain and therefore all\n      these operations are concluded with the deposit of one or more drains to the area of the cut\n      pancreas.\n\n      There is therefore of importance to continue the work of reducing complications in high risk\n      pancreatic surgery using scientific procedures of high quality as in blinded randomized\n      controlled trials (RCT). The use of reinforced stapling techniques has been used in lung\n      surgery and bariatric surgery to reduce air leakage and strengthen anastomoses. The material\n      used is processed submucosa from the small bowel of the pig, produced by COOK\u00a9 Medical to\n      fit endoscopic staplers from Ethicon\u00a9 or Covidien\u00a9.\n\n      After the promising result from Hamilton et al we plan to study if the reinforcement made by\n      COOK\u00a9 could reduce the frequency of pancreatic fistula after stapled distal pancreatic\n      surgery in a single blinded RCT."
