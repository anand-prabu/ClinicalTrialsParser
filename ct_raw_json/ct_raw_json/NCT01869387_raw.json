It is known that NIV improves respiratory mechanics, so the\n      primary outcome will be respiratory muscle function.\n\n      All patients admitted to the hospital for COPD exacerbation and hypercapnic respiratory\n      failure without acidosis will be included for a period of 12 months. The patients will be\n      randomized into two groups (conventional treatment or conventional treatment plus NIV).\n      Clinical data, blood gases, muscle strength parameters will be collected at the inclusion\n      time and 24h after starting NIV. Quality of life and hospital stay will be measured at\n      discharge. All patients will be followed for a year."
