The effectiveness of various systemic\n      antibiotics, particularly the fluoroquinolones, in treating infected DFUs has been\n      demonstrated.\n\n      An alternative or adjunct to systemic antibiotic treatment of infected DFU's is topical\n      antibiotic treatment. Topical treatment would have the advantages of avoiding systemic\n      adverse effects, providing increased target site concentration, and allowing the use of\n      antibiotics not approved for systemic treatment.\n\n      AppliGel-G is a topically applied hydrogel formulation of gentamicin sulfate (GMS).  Once in\n      place the product remains in contact with the wound bed and releases Gentamicin to the wound\n      bed."
