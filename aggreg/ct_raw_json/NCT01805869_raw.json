            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - The third molars (wisdom teeth) normally grow in during late adolescence or early\n      adulthood. Many people need or choose to have these teeth removed with oral surgery.\n      Normally, the removed teeth and tissue are thrown away as medical waste. However, oral\n      health researchers want to collect the teeth and tissue for research. They also want to\n      encourage dentists at the National Institutes of Health to improve their skills in oral\n      surgery. This study will collect the teeth and tissue of people who need to have oral\n      surgery to remove their wisdom teeth.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To provide continued dental skills training for dentists at the National Institutes of\n           Health.\n\n        -  To collect teeth and tissue samples following wisdom tooth removal surgery.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals between 18 and 50 who need to have their wisdom teeth removed.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This study will involve a minimum of three visits. There will be a screening visit, a\n           surgery visit, and at least one follow-up visit.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. A full dental\n           exam with x-rays will be given to evaluate the need for surgery.\n\n        -  At the second visit, participants will have oral surgery to remove their wisdom teeth.\n           The teeth and tissue removed during the surgery will be collected for study.\n\n        -  Participants will receive drugs to control the pain after surgery. They will also be\n           able to contact a dentist if there are any problems.\n\n        -  Between 7 and 21 days after surgery, participants will have a followup visit to check\n           the healing. If they are having no problems, this will be the last visit. If there are\n           any postsurgery issues, they will be scheduled for additional visits as needed."

Subjects will receive standard\n      evaluation and treatment for clinically indicated, routine extraction of third molars.\n      Subjects will report to the NIDCR dental clinic for at least three visits.  The first visit\n      will be a screening evaluation to determine the clinical need for third molar extraction and\n      protocol eligibility.  Eligible subjects will return for a second visit for third molar\n      extraction.  Oral specimens removed during the standard procedure of third molar extraction\n      will be distributed for research.  A third visit will be scheduled approximately one week\n      after surgery for a post-operative clinical evaluation.\n\n      Outcome Measures\n\n      No research outcome measures will be tracked in this study."
