      The purpose of this study is to determine whether metformin causes lactic acidosis in
      diabetic patients with preserved kidney function, undergoing coronary angiography or
      angioplasty with new contrast media.

      In other words is it necessary to discontinue metformin before these procedures, even when
      Iodixanol is used as contrast media, which is isosmolar agent and much more safer than
      urografin which was the main agent in the previous studies that were the base of present
      guidelines?

    <textblock>
      Although metformin is not directly nephrotoxic, it has been postulated that can impair
      gluconeogenesis from lactate, which may lead to lactate accumulation under circumstances
      such as acute renal failure. In diabetic patients receiving metformin, this condition can be
      encountered in the setting of acute renal failure following contrast media administration,
      during coronary angiography i.e. contrast-induced nephropathy. As a result, it has been a
      part of routine clinical practice to discontinue metformin before angiography to prevent
      metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA). However, there is no general consensus
      regarding the incidence of MALA and evidence for such intervention is poor. On the other
      hand, discontinuation of metformin can be associated with detrimental effects on glycemic
      control and thereby may increase cardiovascular risk in diabetic patients undergoing
      percutaneous coronary interventions. Consequently, questions have been raised recently
      regarding the routine discontinuation of metformin, in low-risk patients undergoing coronary
      angiography.

      The present study was designed to assess the role of metformin in lactate production in a
      group of diabetic patients with normal renal function; and to address the questions about
      significance of routine discontinuation of metformin in low risk patients undergoing
      coronary angiography.

      Iodixanol will be the only contrast media in all patients, because of its low
      nephrotoxicity. Serum blood urea nitrogen and creatinin; as well as arterial blood gases
      will be evaluated prior to angiography, and repeated 24 and 48 hours after the procedure.
      Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is calculated using Cockcroft-Gault formula {GFR= 0.85 (for
      women)}.

      Contrast-induced acute kidney injury is defined as a 25-50% or 0.3-0.5 mg/dl net increase in
      creatinine concentration compared to the baseline values. Metformin-associated lactic
      acidosis (MALA) is defined as an arterial pH (potential of hydrogen)&lt;7.35 and plasma lactate
      concentration &gt;5 mmol‚ÅÑL. In the M (-) group metformin will re-started 48 hours after
      angiography, albeit in the absence of evidence of lactic acidosis and GFR of &gt;60 mL/min per
      1.73 m2.

      A written informed consent is taken from all participants and institutional review board has
      already  approved the trial.
