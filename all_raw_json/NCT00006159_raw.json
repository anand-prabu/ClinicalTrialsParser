We recruited Native\n      American people living in 8 Pueblo communities served by 3 Indian Health Service clinics.\n      Forty percent of people living with diabetes in those communities participated in an\n      interview and had height, weight, blood pressure and hemoglobin A1c measured at the\n      beginning.  Then they received a lifestyle program in either groups or one-on-one, or\n      another group which got the intervention after one year (comparison group).  The program was\n      developed using input from community members, tribal leaders, and clinic staff, and was\n      taught by community members in or near the participating communities.  After each session,\n      participants were asked for feedback about the curriculum.  After the program ended, the\n      interview and clinical measures were repeated.  Feedback to tribal leaders and clinical\n      staff is ongoing."
