Metformin will be continued in all patients. To evaluate the effect of\n      linagliptin on insulin sensitivity and beta cell function, independent of changes in HbA1c,\n      the voglibose group is included.

Both patients and physicians will be blinded to the treatment.\n\n      After having written informed consent, a detailed history and a thorough clinical\n      examination will be done in all subjects including measurement of height, weight, body mass\n      index and waist circumference. Hemoglobin, liver function tests, renal function tests, lipid\n      profile, HbA1c, fasting plasma insulin , C-peptide, homeostasis model assessment-insulin\n      resistance index(HOMA-1R) and homeostasis model assessment-beta cell function index (HOMA-\u03b2)\n      will be done at baseline. A euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp study and a mixed meal test\n      will be performed in all patients (on different days) at baseline and after 6 months of\n      follow up. Biochemical parameters will be measured again 6 months after therapy. Fasting and\n      post-prandial blood glucose will be done  monthly for 6 months."
