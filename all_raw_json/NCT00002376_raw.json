Treatment modification is based upon CD4 count, viral RNA levels (group 1\n      only) and clinical evaluation. Patients receive one of the three antiretroviral treatments:\n\n        1. No antiretroviral therapy.\n\n        2. Double reverse transcriptase inhibitor (RTI) therapy consisting of any two therapy\n           combinations of: didanosine (ddI), lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T) or zidovudine\n           (ZDV), based upon the treating physician's judgment. The preferred combinations are ZDV\n           + 3TC, d4T + 3TC or ddI + d4T.\n\n        3. Triple antiretroviral therapy consisting of double antiretroviral therapy plus\n           indinavir.\n\n      Treatment decisions are based upon a standardized algorithm as follows:\n\n      CD4 count 500-750 + viral RNA < 10,000:\n\n      Group 1: No retroviral therapy.

Group 2: Double retroviral therapy.\n\n      CD4 count 300-499 + viral RNA >= 10,000:\n\n      Group 1: Triple therapy. Group 2: Double retroviral therapy.\n\n      CD4 count 200-299 + viral RNA < 10,000:\n\n      Group 1: Maintain same retroviral therapy unless: there is a CD4 count decrease of 25-49%\n      within 24 weeks of the count falling in the range of 300-499 in which case both retroviral\n      therapies are changed, there is a CD4 count decrease of >= 50% within the 48 weeks of\n      therapy from the time the CD4 count fell within the range of 300-499 in which case triple\n      therapy is initiated, or there is an AIDS-defining illness in which case triple therapy is\n      initiated.\n\n      Group 2: Same as Group 1.\n\n      CD4 count 200-299 + viral RNA >= 10,000:\n\n      Group 1: Triple therapy.
