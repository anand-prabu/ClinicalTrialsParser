Treatment repeats every 21 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 or more of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are\n      treated at the dose level immediately preceding the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for phase I and 15-46 patients\n      will be accrued for phase II of this study."
