Determine the principal and dose\n      limiting toxicities of this treatment regimen in terms of duration and reversibility in this\n      patient population. III. Determine the preliminary evidence of antitumor activity with this\n      treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX23-7553 for\n      5 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ILX23-7553 until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 6 or 2 of 10 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are\n      followed monthly for at least 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 46 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
