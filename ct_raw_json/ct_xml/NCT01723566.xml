      Understanding the clinical practice of treatment of cardiac rhythm disorders all over the
      world and understanding the clinical outcomes of the treatment with its cardiac rhythm
      products in real world patient population is essential for Medtronic to be able to
      effectively develop new products and adjust existing products. In addition Medtronic is
      committed to monitor the safety of its products throughout the entire life cycle to ensure
      maximum product reliability.

      The Panorama 2 registry will enable Medtronic to increase data collection of clinical
      practice with Medtronic implantable Cardiac Rhythm and Disease Management (CRDM) devices in
      various regions across the world and on product reliability of its CRDM devices.
