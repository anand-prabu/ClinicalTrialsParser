            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is used to study the brain. It takes a series\n      of pictures that can be used to look at how the brain processes information. It is used to\n      study problems with thinking, language, and movement, among other things. Researchers are\n      working to develop new and better fMRI techniques. To test these techniques, they want to\n      perform fMRI scans on healthy volunteers.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test different fMRI techniques in healthy volunteers.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.\n\n        -  Participants will have fMRI scans of the brain. During these scans, they will be asked\n           to perform simple tasks. These tasks may involve language, thinking, or motor skills.\n           The scanning sessions will last up to 2 hours.\n\n        -  Participants may be asked to return for additional fMRI scans over several years."

            "textblock": "Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a non invasive imaging technique that\n      enables scientists to understand the biological basis of higher order cognitive functioning\n      such as emotions, attention, language and visual processing.  It has been used as a research\n      tool since the 1980   s. Recently, fMRI has received approval by the Center for Medicare and\n      Medicaid Services (CMS) to be used clinically which we believe will drastically increase its\n      use in clinical decision making by physicians in the very near future. However, currently\n      implemented imaging techniques have technical and physiologic limitations such as\n      susceptibility artifacts, image distortions, physiological noise, and MRI induced energy\n      deposition from radiomagnetic waves typically used in fMRI acquisitions that may potentially\n      reduce the clinical effectiveness of this imaging modality. This protocol is a unique\n      technical development pilot study being conducted jointly by researchers at the National\n      Institutes of Health (NIH) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to evaluate the\n      performance of physiologic and technical factors of fMRI imaging methods and equipment that\n      may affect image quality, reproducibility, and reliability in the clinical setting. These\n      studies are an important basis upon which improved regulatory evaluation of new functional\n      imaging technologies can be performed as these technologies become increasingly used in\n      patient care in the future."

Examples:\n\n               -  Aneurysm clip, implanted neural stimulator,\n\n               -  Implanted cardiac pacemaker, defibrillator, or certain other implanted\n                  electrical or metallic devices,\n\n               -  Cochlear implant, ocular foreign body (metal shavings),\n\n               -  Any implanted device (pumps, infusion devices, etc.),\n\n               -  Shrapnel injuries,\n\n               -  History of metal in head or eyes or other parts of the body.\n\n               -  Vagus Nerve Stimulators (VNS)\n\n               -  Subjects with tattoos that contain metal.\n\n          -  Pregnant women\n\n          -  Over 350 lbs because of the weight limit of the MRI table\n\n          -  Prior surgery that may render performing the MRI to be unsafe.\n\n          -  Untreatable claustrophobia otherwise requiring anesthesia or antianxiety medications\n             that may alter the subject   s ability to perform the tasks during fMRI scanning.\n\n          -  Subjects will be asked to refrain from drinking or eating caffeinated foods or drinks\n             the morning of the scan that can result in vessel vasoconstriction prior to the scan.\n\n          -  Any contraindications that the Physician identifies from the Subject   s reported\n             history, MRI Safety Questionnaire and/or medical record."
