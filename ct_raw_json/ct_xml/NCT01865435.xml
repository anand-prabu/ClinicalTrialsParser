  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Actually, there is an increasing number of arguments for a premature origin of chronic
      adult's diseases, as the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Several factors
      interacting with the foetal or postnatal lung growth are associated with early and
      long-lasting respiratory functional changes susceptible to contribute very significantly to
      the arisen of a COPD in the adulthood. It is possible that these situations reflect
      phenomena of premature cellular senescence, recently involved in the physiopathology of the
      COPD. An in utero exposition to cigarette smoking is one of these situations, because it is
      known to induce, not only functional respiratory changes, but also multiple diseases in the
      child which could testify of cellular ageing phenomena.

      Our project aims to demonstrate that in utero smoking is associated with markers of
      premature cellular senescence in newborn children

      The study will be driven in human newborn child's, with comparison of the length of the
      telomeres in circulating lymphocytes (umbilical blood is collected), according to the
      exposure in in utero smoking and also according to the degree of hypotrophy. This study will
      be a pilot study completed by an animal experimental study.
