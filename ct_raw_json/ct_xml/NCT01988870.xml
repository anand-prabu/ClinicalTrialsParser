  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate an investigational way to provide radiation therapy
      to treat breast cancer at the time of surgery.

      Traditionally, the recommended treatment for early stage breast cancer is surgery to remove
      the tumor, followed by whole breast radiation therapy to decrease the chance of recurrence
      of the cancer. Whole breast radiation involves daily radiation treatments for 4-6 weeks and
      can be associated with damage to other tissues including the skin. Recent technological
      advances have made it possible to provide radiation treatment during the breast cancer
      surgical procedure. This procedure is called intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT). The
      University of Virginia has a unique IORT system which allows for the inclusion of cutting
      edge imaging technology into the IORT procedure in order to provide delivery of radiation
      directly to the needed areas and to avoid radiation to other tissues.
