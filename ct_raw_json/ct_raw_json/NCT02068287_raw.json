A recent mono\n      centric, double blind, randomized clinical work in septic shock patients has shown that\n      Esmolol administration is  safe and reduces effectively heart rate. However there are only\n      sparse data on 1) regional  and micro-circulation, 2) inflammation modulation in human\n      resuscitated septic shock patients treated by esmolol."
