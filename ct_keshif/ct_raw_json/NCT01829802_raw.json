All the participants will be assigned to\n      receive RAL+ATV/r or TDF/FTC+ATV/r. Patients will be evaluated at screening, randomization\n      (day 0), and on weeks 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48.\n\n      At the screening visit, subjects must be willing and able to give written (signed and dated)\n      informed consent prior to any study specific procedures. They will receive a unique\n      screening number and will undergo the study procedures associated with the screening visit.\n      The investigator will evaluate whether the subject meets all eligibility criteria specified\n      and record the details of the informed consent process and the results of this assessment in\n      the subject's medical records. Two forms of the ICF will be signed, one for the subject and\n      the other to file at the site.\n\n      At baseline visit, enrollment criteria will be reviewed and subjects who meet all of them\n      will undergo study procedures. Subjects will receive instructions about study medications\n      and dosing schedule. Subjects should start study medication within 24 hours of the baseline\n      visit. Subjects will return to the investigator\u00b4s site for study visits and procedures.\n      Subjects who prematurely discontinue the study must return for a discontinuation visit and\n      undergo the study procedures identified for the discontinuation visit."
