Courses\n      repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with responsive or stable disease receive additional courses of therapy for a\n      maximum of 1 year.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of vincristine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of\n      3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 4 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
