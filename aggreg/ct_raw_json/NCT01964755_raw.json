Most therapies for aggressive B cell\n      lymphomas are based upon intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, expensive modalities (bone\n      marrow transplant, Rituximab), or experimental approaches (gene therapy, cytotoxic T cell\n      infusion) that are difficult to implement in heavily pre-treated patients. Therapy for\n      relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas is very poor.  Even curable lymphomas such as Burkitt\n      Lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin lymphoma are extremely difficult to treat in relapse and/or after\n      stem cell transplant failure.  The investigators propose a novel therapeutic approach that\n      exploits the presence of EBV in lymphomas; antiviral mediated suppression of NF-kB and\n      disruption of viral latency."
