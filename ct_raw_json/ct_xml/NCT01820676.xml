        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical condition included in the approved Indications For Use

          -  Unicompartmental osteoarthritis of the medial or lateral tibiofemoral compartment

          -  Willingness to participate in the clinical study, to give informed consent, and to
             attend all follow-up visits

          -  &gt; 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Simultaneous bilateral procedure required

          -  BMI &gt; 35

          -  Treatment for cancer within the past 5 years, with the exception of skin cancer

          -  Poorly controlled diabetes

          -  Neuromuscular conditions which prevent patient from participating in study activities

          -  Active local or systemic infection

          -  Immunocompromised

          -  Fibromyalgia or other general body pain related condition

          -  Advanced tricompartmental osteoarthritis

          -  Symptomatic patellofemoral disease

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis or other forms of inflammatory joint disease (excluding Gout
             unless it is in the treated knee or limiting overall function)

          -  Loss of bone or musculature, osteoporosis, osteonecrosis, neuromuscular or vascular
             compromise in the area of the joint to be operated to an extent that the procedure is
             unjustified. Osteoporosis is defined by more than -2.5 standard deviations from the T
             score as measured on a Dual Energy X-Ray Absortiometry Scan (DEXA) within 2 years of
             surgery.

          -  Advanced loss of osteochondral structure on the affected femoral condyle

          -  Compromised ACL, PCL or collateral ligament

          -  Severe (&gt;15º) fixed valgus or varus deformity

          -  Extension deficit &gt; 15 º

          -  Prior history of failed implant surgery of the joint to be treated

          -  Unwilling or unable to comply with study requirements

          -  Participation in another clinical study which would confound results
