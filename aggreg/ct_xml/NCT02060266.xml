    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to investigate the absorption,
      metabolism and excretion after a single subcutaneous dose of [3H]-semaglutide in healthy
      male subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male subjects, based on an assessment of medical history, physical
             examination, ECG (electrocardiogram) and vital signs, as determined by the
             investigator

          -  Age between 45-64 years (both inclusive) at the time of signing inform consent

          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 20 and 30 kg/m^2 (both inclusive)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Donation of any blood or plasma in the past month or in excess of 100 mL within the 3
             months preceding screening, or surgery or trauma with more than 100 mL blood loss
             within the 3 months preceding screening

          -  Use of prescription or non-prescription systemic or topical medicinal products
             (except routine vitamins, acetylsalicylic acid and paracetamol) within 3 weeks (or
             within 5 half-lives of the medicinal product, whichever is longest) prior to visit 2,
             Day 1

          -  History of drug/chemical substance abuse within 1 year from screening, or a positive
             result in the urine drug test

          -  History of alcohol abuse within 1 year from screening, or a positive result in the
             alcohol urine test, or consumption of more than 21 units of alcohol weekly (one unit
             of alcohol equals about 250 mL of beer or lager, one glass (120 mL) of wine, or 20 mL
             spirits)

          -  Smoking or use of any nicotine (including nicotine patches, gum, etc) in the last 3
             months prior to screening or a positive nicotine test
