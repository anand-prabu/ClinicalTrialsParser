  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part, randomized, multi-center, blinded study in adolescents with Tourette's
      Disorder. There will  be an up to 21-day screening period in which subject eligiblity willl
      be determined. In Part 1 of the study, the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      AZD5213 will be assessed during a 1- week period.

      In Part 2 of the study,  the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of two doses
      (depending on tolerability in Part 1 of the study) of AZD5213 and placebo will be assessed
      through six consecutive four-week crossover periods. Each subject will receive both AZD 5213
      and placebo. A follow-up vist will take place at 14 (±) 7  days following the last dose of
      study drug.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, two-part study of AZD5213 in adolescents (ages 12-17
      years) with TD.

      In Part 1 of the study, following an up to 21-day screening period, on Day 1, after baseline
      procedures are performed, eligible subjects will receive a single, low dose of AZD5213,
      in-clinic.

      After study drug dosing on Day 1, safety and tolerability will be assessed in-clinic, and
      blood samples will be taken for pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis.   On Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7
      subjects will take study drug, and will be contacted via telephone and adverse events and
      concomitant medications will be assessed. On Day 8, safety, tolerability, and blood sampling
      for PK analysis (predose and 2-4 hours post-dose) will be performed in-clinic.  Part 2 of
      the study will consist of six consecutive crossover periods.  In Part 2 of the study, each
      study drug will be administered in two 4-week periods (six treatment periods, total).  Each
      study drug will be received in one of Periods 1-3, and again in one of Periods 4-6.
      Approximately 24 subjects will receive study drug in Part 1 of this study in order to
      complete approximately 18 subjects in Part 2.

    <description>The TTS will be analyzed using a mixed linear model with &quot;Subject&quot; as a random main effect factor, &quot;Period&quot; as a fixed main effect factor with six levels and &quot;Treatment&quot; as a fixed main effect factor with three levels. In the main (primary) analysis model, there will be no interactive effects.There will be two primary contrasts of equal interest: that comparing the high dose of AZD5213 and placebo, and that comparing the low dose of AZD5213 and placebo. The Bonferroni-Holm procedure will be used to control a 5% error rate (two-sided) overall. In this manner, the smaller of the two unadjusted P-values will be compared to the 2.5% level (two-sided), and, if that is significant, the remaining P-value will be compared to 5% (two-sided).</description>

    <description>This will be done by augmenting the Bonferroni-Holm model by fitting a random subject-by-treatment interaction term. The equivalent mixed linear model used for the primary analysis of the TTS will be used to analyze the YGTSS total score, the YGTSS motor tic severity score, the YGTSS vocal tic severity score, the YGTSS impairment score, the PUTS, the CY-BOCS, and the CGI-TS (Severity). These analyses will be carried out in an exploratory manner and supplemented by applying the method of basic estimators as described in Senn (2002).</description>

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects should not enter the study if any of the following exclusion criteria are
        fulfilled:
