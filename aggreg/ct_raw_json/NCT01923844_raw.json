During the procedure, the tube was disconnected from the ventilator. The patient's head was held in a neutral position and surfactant preparations were given in two bolus fractions. Manual ventilation was given for 2 min after each dose. After the second dose, the endotracheal tube was reconnected and the physician (D.T.) observed the infant for 30-60 s until the oxygen saturation reached > 90% on pulse oximetry. Thereafter, the peak inspiratory pressure of the 6 ventilator was reduced by 1-2 mmH2O.",
