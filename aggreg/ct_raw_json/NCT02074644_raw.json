All patients will be\n      invited to participate in a 6 months post-trial extension study.\n\n      Patients over 45 years-old with a diagnosis of BPH associated with severe LUTS defined by an\n      IPSS>=20 after a minimum of 6 months treatment with alpha-blockers and with a prostate\n      volume \u2265 40 mL will start a two weeks screening period. Eligible patients will be started on\n      tamsulosin 0.4 mg q.d. and have the intervention scheduled for the following 2 days (study\n      day 0), when they will be randomized to PAE or to a sham procedure if the procedure is\n      technically feasible\n\n      Those patients in whom angiography has shown that PAE is technically feasible will be\n      randomized to one of the study arms on a 1:1 ratio.

At 1 month a pelvic NMR\n      will be performed to evaluate prostate volume and the degree of ischemia.\n\n      Patients completing the 6 month follow-up period will be invited to enter a 6 months\n      extension study.
