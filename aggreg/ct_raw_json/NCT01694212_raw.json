Among many other\n      consequences it speeds up the cataract formation and that is why diabetic patients need\n      cataract surgery very often. The known side effect of cataract surgery even in otherwise\n      healthy patients is postoperative edema of the back of the eye (what causes decrease of\n      vision), which has greater incidence especially in patients who have diabetic eye problems.\n      The cause of that might be the intraocular inflammation which was previously demonstrated to\n      be significantly more prominent in patients with untreated diabetic eye problems. Therefore\n      we will examine if the 7 day use of anti-inflammatory eye drops prior to the cataract\n      surgery prevent the formation of the edema of the back of the eye."
