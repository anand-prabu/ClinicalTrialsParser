      Vitamin D has an immunomodulatory role. the aim of the present study is to assess the effect
      of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate of COPD patient with a vitamin D
      deficiency.

      Rationale: Although vitamin D is well known for its function in calcium homeostasis and bone
      mineralisation, several studies have shown immunomodulatory effects of vitamin D. Vitamin D
      deficiency is a common problem in patients with COPD..

      Objective: To assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation on exacerbation rate in
      patients with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency.

      Study design: Randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study.

      Study population: 240 patients aged 40 years and older with COPD and a vitamin D deficiency
      (25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration(25OHD)&lt;50 nmol/l) with a COPD exacerbation. An
      exacerbation is defined as sustained worsening of respiratory symptoms during 48 hours and
      requiring oral corticosteroid, antibiotic or combination treatment that was initiated by a
      physician. Respiratory symptoms include at least one of the Anthonisen criteria (increased
      dyspnoea, sputum volume or purulence). Patients with a severe vitamin D deficiency (25OHD&lt;15
      nmol/l), known osteoporosis and/or use of vitamin D supplementation &gt; 400 IU per day will be
      excluded.

      Intervention: Participants will be randomly allocated to receive vitamin D3 16800 IU or
      placebo orally once a week during 1 year.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is exacerbation rate.
