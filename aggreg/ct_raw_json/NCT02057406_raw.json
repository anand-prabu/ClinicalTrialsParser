If female\n             patients are of childbearing potential, they must use an effective and accepted means\n             of contraception, such as oral contraceptives or a double-barrier method (condom and\n             diaphragm) to protect against pregnancy\n\n          -  Documented history of hypersensitivity or intolerance to omega 3 products; or use of\n             omega 3 supplement for greater than or equal to 3 months at an equivalent or greater\n             dose of the proposed study\n\n          -  Treatment with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic stimulation\n             (TMS) within 90 days*\n\n          -  Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism\n\n          -  Treatment with any investigational agent within 1 month before randomization\n\n          -  Acute coronary syndrome, i.e., MI or unstable angina, revascularization procedure\n             within the preceding month, or planned cardiac surgery within 3 months\n             postrandomization\n\n               -  The exclusion of patients who received ECT or TMS within 90 days is adopted from\n                  other depression-intervention trials and meant to eliminate confounders.
