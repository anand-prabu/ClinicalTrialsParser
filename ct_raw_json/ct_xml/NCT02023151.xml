  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to test whether differences in blood cells at baseline (start of
      the study) can be used to predict how well omalizumab will work in a patient. Omalizumab
      (Xolair) is a drug approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat asthma.
      Studies show that omalizumab improves the symptoms of asthma but some people experience
      better improvement than others.

    <textblock>
      From a therapeutic perspective, the study will determine whether changes in the peripheral
      blood basophil response to crosslinking anti-IgE Ab during treatment with omalizumab
      predicts the clinical efficacy of treatment with the drug. Secondary outcomes measures would
      focus on whether the starting level of anti-IgE-mediated histamine release, or the changes
      syk expression or its starting level would be sufficient to predict the clinical outcome.

      The study is a single-site trial to evaluate the utility of baseline basophil measures to
      predict the efficacy of subcutaneously administered omalizumab as an add-on therapy for the
      treatment of adult patients 18âˆ’75 years old who have been diagnosed with moderate to severe
      asthma according to current approved guidelines. Patients will be treated with omalizumab
      according to the standard FDA approved dosing table for a period of 16 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with moderate-to-severe asthma; male and females aged 18-75 who are
             symptomatic despite treatment with inhaled corticosteroids if they also had an asthma
             duration &gt; 1 year.

          -  Positive blood testing to at least one common allergen (including must mite, D. F.
             and D. P., cockroach, dog or cat)

          -  Serum IgE within the bounds of the dosing table (&gt;30 IU/ml to &lt; 700 IU/ml)

          -  Reversibility of &gt; 12% within 30 minutes after administration of albuterol or history
             of reversibility in past or history of positive methacholine in past

          -  Baseline FEV1 of &gt; 0% and &lt; 80% of predicted

          -  Treatment with 400 to 800 ug day of beclomethasone dipropionate or its equivalent.

          -  Patients must be willing to give written informed consent and be able to adhere to
             dose and visit schedules and meet trial requirements.

          -  Patients will be excluded if they have prior sensitivity to omalizumab, and acute
             respiratory tract infection prior to or during the run-in period, or a need for
             regular B-agonist use.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with an investigational agent within 30 days of screening

          -  Previously treated with omalizumab within a year prior to screening
