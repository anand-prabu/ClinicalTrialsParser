CEASE integrates evidence-based tobacco-use screening, cessation\n      assistance, and referral to outside services into visits with families in pediatric clinics.\n      Elements include (1) Identification of smokers and self-assessment of quitting preferences;\n      (2) Counseling (brief motivational messaging elements include collaborative goal setting,\n      set quit date, personal barriers to quitting, problem-solving strategies, implementing\n      smoke-free homes and cars, and social support, strategies shown to increase satisfaction\n      with the pediatric visit.(3) Medication (NRT prescription and free 1 week supply (while\n      supplies last)\u2014including for those cutting down to quit as recommended in latest\n      guidelines); (4) Quitline enrollment via faxed enrollment form; and (5) Review of CEASE\n      action sheets at each visit until the family is smoke-free.
