The differences between PASTOR and MOR are characterized by, a) an integrative combination of profession related modules within a comprehensive and consistent treatment approach, b) an interprofessional and collaborative teamwork based on profession related modules, c) the use of standardized methods, media and materials by all professions in the therapeutic team d) a highly structured and detailed manual for the entire treatment process.

The investigators hypothesize that in adults with CLBP the rehabilitation program\n      PASTOR would result in a significantly higher increase in functional ability 12 months after\n      completion of the program in comparison to the standard inpatient MOR. The investigators\n      further hypothesize that PASTOR would lead to significantly larger improvements regarding\n      pain-related cognitions, pain coping strategies, physical activity, health-related quality\n      of life, and back pain episodes compared to the standard inpatient MOR."
