To evaluate the tolerance of oral ZDV\n      in this population, defined as the ability to take oral doses and lack of vomiting within 30\n      minutes of receiving oral study doses.\n\n      The worldwide use of constant intrapartum ZDV infusions to prevent transmission is not\n      practical or feasible. Approximately 18% of the women in the ACTG 076 trial missed their IV\n      ZDV infusions, even at experienced ACTG sites.
