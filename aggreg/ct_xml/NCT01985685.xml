    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of thiamine therapy on oxygen
      consumption (VO2) in critically-ill patients.  We will evaluate this by measuring VO2 before
      and after thiamine or placebo administration in patients admitted to the ICU and requiring
      mechanical ventilation. A secondary aim is to evaluate the effect of thiamine vs. placebo on
      the metabolic profile of the patients.

    <textblock>
      Extensive research has been done over the past two decades looking at the role of oxygen
      delivery (DO2) and oxygen utilization (VO2) in critical illness.   VO2 depends on cardiac
      output, arterial oxygen content, and the body's ability to extract oxygen effectively from
      the blood.  Oxygen demand rises in critical illness as the body goes into a catabolic state,
      and lower VO2 has been associated with higher lactate levels and with poorer outcomes.
      Although increasing DO2 was shown in past studies to raise VO2 in some patients, other
      investigators have found that many critically-ill patients failed to demonstrate a rise in
      VO2 in spite of achieving supranormal values of cardiac index (CI) and DO2.  This group, in
      contrast to patients whose VO2 rose with the increase in CI and DO2, had exceedingly poor
      outcomes, suggesting that an inability to extract oxygen from the blood confers a poorer
      prognosis.

      Thiamine deficiency can manifest in several ways, but the syndrome of wet beriberi, caused
      by thiamine deficiency, includes lactic acidosis, cardiac decompensation and vasodilatory
      shock, similar to sepsis and other forms of critical illness.  The mechanism by which
      thiamine deficiency causes dysfunction rests upon the vitamin's essential role in the Krebs
      cycle and Pentose Phosphate Pathway.  Lack of adequate thiamine results in the failure of
      pyruvate to enter the Krebs Cycle, thus preventing aerobic metabolism.   The resulting
      decrease in aerobic metabolism and increase in anaerobic metabolism leads to decreased
      oxygen consumption by the tissues and increased lactic acid production.

      Our group has found previously that upwards of 20% of critically ill patients with sepsis
      are thiamine deficient within 72 hours of presentation.  In a dog model of septic shock,
      Lindenbaum et al have shown that, regardless of thiamine levels, supplementation with
      thiamine improved not only lactate clearance and mean arterial pressure, but increased VO2
      as well.   An increase in VO2 max after administration of thiamine to healthy volunteers has
      also been described.   In our prior open-label study, we found that the administration of a
      single dose of 200mg of intravenous thiamine to critically ill patients led to a
      statistically significant increase in VO2 in those with normal or elevated cardiac output,
      suggesting that thiamine may increase the extraction component of VO2, even in the absence
      of absolute thiamine deficiency. This effect was not seen in patients with low cardiac
      output.

      VO2 is known to rise in inflammatory states, reflecting increased energy expenditure.  Prior
      studies have shown that VO2 will decrease with interventions such as fever control.  In
      spite of VO2 being higher than normal in critically-ill patients, however, the end-organ
      damage and lactic acidosis suggest that it is not high enough to meet the metabolic demands
      of the critically-ill body.  If we are able to increase VO2 further in critically-ill
      patients, we could potentially help maintain aerobic metabolism and decrease tissue hypoxia
      and the resulting end-organ damage. Our hypothesis is that administering thiamine
      intravenously to critically-ill patients who do not have abnormally low cardiac index will
      increase VO2.

      We will use an anesthesia monitor with a gas exchange module to measure VO2 continuously
      over a 9 hour period. After 3 hours of baseline VO2 data are collected, baseline thiamine
      level, lactate, and central venous O2 saturation will be obtained.  A single dose of 200mg
      of IV thiamine will then be given, and 6 hours of post-thiamine data will then be collected.
      We will screen all consenting patients for whom we do not know the cardiac index with a
      non-invasive cardiac index measurement using the Cheetah non-invasive cardiac output monitor
      (NICOM). We will not include patients with a cardiac index less than or equal to
      2.4L/min/m2, due to our preliminary data showing these patients did not increase VO2 in
      response to thiamine. All patients enrolled will have cardiac index monitored continuously
      during the study by the NICOM, in order to assess whether or not there is any relationship
      between VO2 and cardiac index. Patients will also have blood drawn for a metabolomic panel
      before and after thiamine or placebo to assess whether thiamine has an effect on the
      metabolome.
