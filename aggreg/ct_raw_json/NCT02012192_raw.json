            "textblock": "Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is the most lethal gynaecological malignancy causing 41900\n      deaths annually in Europe. The predominance of aggressive Type II tumours, which are\n      characterised by a high frequency of p53 mutations, and primary or acquired resistance to\n      platinum-based chemotherapy profoundly contribute to the high mortality rate. With current\n      standard therapy the median overall survival of metastatic platinum-resistant (Pt-R) ovarian\n      cancer patients is only 14 month. There is a pressing need for more effective, innovative\n      treatment strategies to particularly improve survival in this subgroup of EOC patients. This\n      is a drug strategy targeting a central driver of tumour aggressiveness and metastatic\n      ability, namely mutant p53, via an innovative new Hsp90 (heat shock protein 90) inhibition\n      mechanism. The most advanced, second-generation Hsp90 inhibitor will be used, Ganetespib.\n      The first part (Phase I) of the GANNET53 trial will test the safety of Ganetespib in a new\n      combination with standard chemotherapy (Paclitaxel weekly) in Pt-R EOC patients. The second\n      part (randomised Phase II) will examine the efficacy of Ganetespib in combination with\n      standard chemotherapy versus standard chemotherapy alone in EOC patients with Pt-R tumours."
