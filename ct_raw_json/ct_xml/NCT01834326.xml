      The purpose of this study is to improved the current standard of care of repairing mouth
      soft tissue defects.  This study will test a tissue equivalent ex vivo produced oral mucosa
      equivalent(EVPOME), which is your own cells grown on top of a piece of AlloDerm (a
      commercially available freeze dried human cadaver tissue that is routinely used in present
      day surgical reconstructive procedures) to create a new piece of soft tissue for use only in
      your body.  The tissue equivalent product will be tested against a non-experimental method
      of grafts, the  gold standard a piece of palatal oral mucosa (POM) to see which works best.
      You will be randomly assigned to receive either the EVPOME or POM to cover the defect in
      your mouth.  The objective of the study is to assess the safety and efficacy for the use of
      human EVPOME for soft tissue intraoral grafting procedures compared to the &quot;gold standard&quot;
      palatal oral mucosa (POM) graft.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Deficient band (&lt;3mm) of keratinized mucosa prior to or following dental implant
             placement

          -  Surgery to increase width of keratinized mucosa is clinically indicated or requested
             by the patient to facilitate oral hygiene procedures or to improve esthetics

          -  Patients in need of a graft of approximately 15 x 10 x 20 mm in dimension

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with potential medical complications such as evidence of clinically
             significant (as described by investigators) renal, hepatic, cardiac, endocrine,
             hematologic, autoimmune, or any systemic disease which may complication execution of
             the protocol and/or interpretation of results

          -  Current radiation therapy or history of radiation therapy treatment to the intraoral
             donor biopsy site or recipient site for graft placement

          -  Documented history of syphilis, HIV, Hepatitis B or C virus

          -  Pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant or unwilling to abstain or use
             double barrier contraceptives during the course of the study
