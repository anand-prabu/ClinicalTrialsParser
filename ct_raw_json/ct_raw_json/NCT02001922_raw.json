Their aims were to explore the\n      needs and barriers to better care, as well as the shape of the targeted CDM elements for\n      better implementation in real life, from the point of view of COPD patients and healthcare\n      professionals.\n\n      The CDM intervention considered in the \"Soins int\u00e9gr\u00e9s BPCO en Valais - Mieux vivre avec ma\n      BPCO\" program is based on the \" Living well with COPD programme \" developed by Prof.\n      Bourbeau & al at McGill University, Montreal, Canada.
