The sample size\n      is based on 30 subjects per lancet size for a given depth setting.  Each subject is lanced 4\n      times with two lancet sizes at a single depth setting.  There will be 120 paired lancing\n      events for each lancet size within the group.\n\n      Null hypothesis (H0): there is a 90% success rate of attaining a minimum blood volume of\n      1.0\u03bcL for the 28g lancet across all depth settings.\n\n      Alternate hypothesis (H1): the success rate of attaining a minimum blood volume of 1.0\u03bcL for\n      the 28g lancet across all depth settings is less than 90%."
