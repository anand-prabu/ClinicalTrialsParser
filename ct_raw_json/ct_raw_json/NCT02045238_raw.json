            "textblock": "Acute viral bronchiolitis is a lower airway infection, caused manly by Respiratory Syncytial\n      Virus. Near 1% of children up to 2 years of age get it with sufficient severity to warrant\n      hospital admission, with an annual cost of about U$ 500 million in the US, superior, for\n      instance, than cystic fibrosis annual cost.\n\n      Despite the physiopathology and clinical course being well known among pediatricians, few\n      therapeutical options other than adequate hydration and oxygen supplementation have proven\n      to be effective Corticosteroids are not effective and bronchodilators are controversial, and\n      treatment is still mostly empiric and lacking evidence.\n\n      In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the use of nebulized hypertonic\n      saline (HS) as a promising approach. The rational is that HS would help reducing edema and\n      mucus viscosity, enhancing its rheologic properties. Recent studies suggest that HS could\n      reduce up to 1 day (25%) of time until discharge in admitted patients. In the Emergency\n      Department, HS was not superior to other forms of treatment, but these studies lack power\n      and similarities to draw further conclusions. Also, time of treatment and ideal interval\n      between doses are not known as yet.\n\n      To our knowledge, few if any studies have assessed patients with an intermediary (up to 24h)\n      time of stay, namely a short stay ward attached to an emergency department. Thus, we have\n      endeavoured to determine if repeated doses of nebulized HS are superior to nebulized normal\n      saline (NS) during the first 24 hour of treatment, when considered: rate of admission, time\n      until discharge, time until attain discharge criteria, and rate of readmission after\n      discharge.\n\n      Furthermore, most studies use HS associated to a bronchodilator, because of a theoretical\n      possibility that HS alone could induce bronchoconstriction and worsen respiratory symptoms.\n      However, recent studies have shown that HS use without bronchodilators have not caused any\n      worsening of symptoms in bronchiolitis patients. Therefore, we propose to study the effect\n      of HS alone, without the adding of bronchodilators, which would minimize bias in the\n      treatment group."
