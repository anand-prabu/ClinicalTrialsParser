      This study is designed to assess the effect of oligofructose administration for 12 weeks on
      Body Mass Index (BMI) of overweight and obese children.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of childhood overweight and obesity is reaching epidemic proportions.  There
      have been no effective methods for preventing or treating obesity in childhood so far
      prompting interest in new interventions.  One potential option for obesity prevention is the
      use of the prebiotic oligofructose. Data from research on rodents shows that a high-fat diet
      enriched with oligofructose causes a decrease in energy intake, less weight gain and a lower
      level of triglycerides . A similar effect has been observed in healthy adults.  Available
      evidence suggests that the addition of oligofructose to the diets of overweight or obese
      adults may increase satiety and thus reduce energy intake. Currently, there are no data on
      the effect of oligofructose in overweight and obese children.
