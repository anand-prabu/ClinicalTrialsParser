      This pilot randomized clinical trial studies palliative care intervention in improving
      quality of life, psychological distress, and communication in patients with solid tumors
      receiving treatment. Palliative therapy may help patients with solid tumors live more
      comfortably.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Test the effects of a palliative care intervention (PCI) on patients' quality of life
      (QOL), psychological distress and satisfaction with communication, comparing the
      experimental versus control groups.

      II. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' symptom intensity and symptom interference with
      daily activities, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

      III. Test the effects of a PCI on patients' hospital and palliative care resource
      utilization and clinical trial retention rates, comparing the experimental versus control
      groups.

      IV. Test the effects of the timing of PCI initiation (early versus delayed) on patient
      outcomes, comparing the experimental versus control groups.

      V. Describe patients' satisfaction with the PCI.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive part I of the PCI comprising quantitative surveys, comprehensive
      palliative care assessment by the Research Nurses, and goals of care discussions beginning
      prior to administration of the first dose of phase I treatment. Patients then receive part
      II of the PCI comprising recommendations from the interdisciplinary team, patent educational
      sessions, and supportive care referrals following the first dose of phase I treatment and is
      completed within one month of the first treatment.

      ARM II: Patients receive usual care until 12 weeks post-treatment initiation. Patients then
      receive both part I and II of the PCI.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 5 years.

    <description>To control for inflation of experimentwise error caused by analyzing four different QOL subscales, alpha will be set to .01.  A 2x2 multiply repeated measures ANCOVA (in which the within groups variables are QOL subscale scores at 4 and 12 weeks, the between groups measure is treatment group (control vs. PCI), and the covariate is baseline QOL) might be employed if the correlation between the four FACT-G subscale scores are high enough to warrant such an analysis.  The overall QOL score derived from the FACT-G will be tested individually using alpha=.05.
If subscale correlations are not high, outcome will be analyzed using four 2x2 repeated measures ANCOVAs in which the within groups variable is each QOL subscale, the between groups measure is group (PCI vs. control), and the covariate is the appropriate baseline QOL subscale (Physical well-being, emotional well-being, social well-being, and functional well-being).</description>
