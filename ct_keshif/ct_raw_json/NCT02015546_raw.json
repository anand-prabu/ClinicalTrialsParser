As vilazodone is\n      not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent the\n      recurrence of depression, for the purposes of this study it is considered investigational.\n      The word \"investigational\" means that the study drug is still being tested in research\n      studies and has not been approved for this use by the FDA.  During the course of this study,\n      there are times where you will receive vilazodone and other times where you may receive\n      vilazodone."

Inadequate response to  antidepressants: having a score of \u226514 on the 17-item HAMD or\n              a CGI-S score of \u2265 3 after  a retrospective confirmation of an adequate trial of a\n             single antidepressant (defined as an 6-week trial of acceptable therapeutic dose [40\n             mg of fluoxetine, paroxetine  30 mg of citalopram, 20 mg of escitalopram, 37.5 mg of\n             paroxetine CR, 150 mg of sertraline, 100 mg of fluvoxamine, 225 mg of venlafaxine XR)\n\n          6.

History of augmentation with atypical antipsychotics, lithium, T3 or another\n             antidepressant within 3 months of screening\n\n          9.

Subjects on concomitant mood stabilizers or atypical antipsychotics will\n             require a 2-week washout prior to screening visit. Subjects on a minimum of 3 month\n             of stable dose of hypnotics (e.g. zolpidem 10 mg per day or benzodiazepine dose of \u2264\n             2 mg per day of lorazepam or trazodone \u2264 100 mg per day or quetiapine \u2264 100 mg per\n             day) will be allowed to continue their hypnotic medication at the same dose.\n             Quetiapine at doses \u2264 100 mg per day is appropriate only for hypnotic effects. Over\n             the counter medications will be permitted if in the opinion of the investigator, they\n             are not considered to have any significant impact on the study. Any medication that\n             has the potential to cause a clinical significant drug interaction with vilazodone in\n             the judgment of the investigator will require a washout."
