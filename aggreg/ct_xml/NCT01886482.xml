      Background: Studies regarding the effects of high protein (HP) diet on cardiovascular (CVD)
      risk factors have reported contradictory results.

      Objective: In present study, the investigators aimed to determine the effects of HP diet on
      CVD risk factors among overweight and obese children.

      Design: In this randomized controlled trial, the investigators recruited 50 overweight and
      obese women, aged 6-11years into HP or control energy restricted diets for 10 weeks
      (protein, carbohydrate, fat: 25%, 45%, 30% vs. 15%, 55%, 30%, respectively). Total protein
      amount, divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed
      (half/half) between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, lipid profile, systolic
      and diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the
      standard guidelines.
