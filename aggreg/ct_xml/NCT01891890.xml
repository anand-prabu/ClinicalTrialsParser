  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seizures that arise in specific areas in the brain are called Localization Related Epilepsy
      (LRE) and are the most common seizure disorder in children.  Children that receive drug
      treatment for this disorder may suffer from treatment related side effects which impact
      their ability to think or concentrate and their ability to interact socially. These negative
      treatment effects can impact the child's performance in school and long term may impact
      employment and job options.

      This study will determine whether changes in attention and social interactions are seen in
      children treated for LRE using three of the most common medications used to treat pediatric
      LRE. Children who are newly diagnosed with LRE by their doctors and are between 6-12 years
      of age will be randomized to receive levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or oxcarbazepine.

      There will be 12 study sites throughout the US. Children will undergo evaluation of their
      thinking and ability to pay attention before and after starting drug treatment for LRE.
      Regardless of the specific findings, results of this study will provide the information
      needed to help parents and their clinicians choose treatment options that maximize cognitive
      abilities in children with LRE, and provide the data needed for practice guidelines to be
      established on the basis of cognitive side effect risks.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age of participant between 6 years, 0 months and 12 years, 11 months at the time of
             enrollment

          -  Weight is ≥ 15 kg and ≤ 65 kg at study entry

          -  Child has a diagnosis of Localization Related Epilepsy (LRE) with or without
             secondary generalization according to International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE)
             criteria and which may include Benign Rolandic Epilepsy and Benign Occipital Epilepsy
             or other LREs.

          -  Localization related seizures will be based upon at least one of the following: 1)
             focal EEG abnormalities (sharp waves, spikes, or slowing) and the absence of
             generalized spike waves discharges, 2) focal MRI abnormalities other than active
             cysticercosis, which may include temporal lobe sclerosis, dysembryoplastic
             neuroepithelial tumor , ganglioglioma, or focal malformations of cortical
             development, 3) focal neurologic abnormalities, or 4) clinical semiology, which may
             include Todd's phenomenon, unilateral dystonia, or fencing posture, or distinct aura
             consistent with localization related seizure onset (e.g., classic déjà vu or bad
             smell).

          -  Participants must be AED therapy naïve (excluding benzodiazepines).  Children may be
             on a stable dose of psychostimulants at the time of enrollment, but no change in
             medication, dose, or schedule in 3 months prior to study enrollment, with no
             anticipated dosing changes during the 6 months of the study.  If participants are
             taking psychostimulants at the time of study entry, they should plan on continuing
             them for the 6 month duration of the study protocol including the 3-month and 6-month
             cognitive and behavioral testing time points.

          -  Females of child bearing potential must agree to acceptable non-systemic form of
             birth control (i.e., are abstinent)

          -  The child's parent/guardian must be able to keep an accurate seizure diary and be
             able and willing to comply with instructions and study procedures.

          -  Informed consent from the child's legal guardian or legal representative.

          -  Assent will be obtained from children according to each site's institutional
             guidelines.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children with history of primary generalized seizures (absence, myoclonic, drop)

          -  Children with mixed seizure disorder (e.g., Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome)

          -  Children with sensory seizures only (i.e., auras)

          -  Children with 6+ seizures in the previous week

          -  Children with a history of status epilepticus

          -  Children with a history of neonatal seizures

          -  Children with diagnoses of pervasive developmental disorders (e.g., autism/autism
             spectrum disorders)

          -  Children with progressive neurological disease (e.g., degenerative, progressive
             neoplasm)

          -  Children with major medical disease (e.g., insulin dependent diabetes mellitus ,
             cancer, renal failure)

          -  Children with diseases with cognitive impact (e.g., inborn errors of metabolism, sick
             cell disease with history of stroke)

          -  Children with active cystercercosis documented on MRI

          -  Children with cognitive impairment of sufficient severity that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would diminish the likelihood of valid test performance (roughly
             corresponding to Full Scale IQ less than 70)

          -  Children using first generation antihistamines

          -  Children using recreational drugs (including alcohol)

          -  Children not fluent in either English or Spanish
