    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of either
      single-ascending intravenous (IV) doses or a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of BIIB059 in
      Healthy Volunteers (HV), and a single IV dose in participants with Systemic Lupus
      Erythematosus (SLE).

      The secondary objectives of this study are:  To estimate the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters
      of single-ascending IV doses of BIIB059 in Healthy Volunteers and a single IV dose of
      BIIB059 in participants with SLE; To estimate the PK parameters and bioavailability (F) of a
      single SC dose of BIIB059 in Healthy Volunteers; To evaluate the immunogenicity of BIIB059
      administered to Healthy Volunteers and participants with SLE.

             or at the time of randomization that would interfere with evaluations of the effect
             of study treatment on lupus skin disease. Participants with discoid lupus but without
             concomitant definite SLE diagnosis (having less than 4 of the 11 ACR criteria) will
             be excluded from this study.
