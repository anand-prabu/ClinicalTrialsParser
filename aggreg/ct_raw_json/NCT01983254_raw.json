            "textblock": "Public Summary of Research Project Why is this important?  Nearly 800,000 Americans receive\n      mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure in the ICU each year.  Afterward, over\n      half of both patients and their family caregivers suffer from psychological distress\n      (depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress [\"PTSD\"]) for over 1 year after discharge.\n      Patients and families told us that they need help with their distress because it worsens\n      their quality of life.  More specifically, patients said that learning how to adapt (that\n      is, how to cope) with the physical and emotional changes of critical illness would be\n      helpful.  In fact, most ICU survivors use coping skills infrequently, which worsens\n      psychological distress.  But patients also told us that they wanted more information about\n      critical illness, recovery, and what to expect.  A lack of information increases PTSD\n      symptoms.  However, there are few treatments for this distress that can overcome ICU\n      survivors' physical disability, great distance from expert medical centers, and concerns\n      about how much treatments would cost. Therefore, we developed two treatments to address\n      coping and lack of information.\n\n      What is the main goal? We aim to compare which of two treatments are more effective in\n      reducing psychological distress and improving quality of life.  One is a coping skills\n      training (CST) program provided by telephone.  The other is an education program about\n      critical illness that is accessed primarily online.  Also, we will determine if unique\n      groups of people with special characteristics have especially good improvement\u2014and if so,\n      what personal factors explain this response.\n\n      How will we know which treatment is better? We will determine which treatment is most\n      helpful by comparing participants' levels of psychological distress and quality of life with\n      surveys taken over 6 months.  We'll also record patients' own descriptions of how the\n      treatments impacted their daily lives.  The study will take 3 years and would be performed\n      at 5 medical centers across the US that treat patients with diverse backgrounds and\n      illnesses.  200 ICU survivor-family member pairs will be randomly assigned (like a coin\n      flip) to receive either the CST program or the education program.  Treatments consist of 6\n      weekly telephone calls with a trained staff member, web-based modules, and handouts.\n\n      How will this help others in the future? This research is important because it aims to\n      improve long-term recovery for entire families by focusing on a devastating, common, yet\n      inadequately addressed problem.  These treatments were developed with the direct input of\n      patients and families.  These treatments represent a new direction in treating critical\n      illness because they can be delivered inexpensively by phone, easily adapted to future\n      technologies, overcome barriers to care common to ICU survivors, and shared easily by phone\n      or computer with others in need across the world."
