A horizontal incision corresponding to the width of the recipient bed plus 4mm was made 3 mm apical to the gingival margin.   A small secondary vertical incision was tolerated on the mesial aspect of the surgical site to allow for a split thickness technique.  The flap was then positioned over the graft and sutured with attempts to cover the grafted tissue to 2mm coronal to the implant/abutment interface pending flap tension.    Follow up was monitored over 6 months at various time-points."

The preparation requires rehydration in 50ml sterile saline or Ringers Solution for five minutes and repeated twice.  The graft was then transferred to the recipient bed with the basement membrane side facing up and connective tissue on the periosteum.  The allograft was trimmed to cover the defect dimensions up to the implant-abutment interface. There was a 4mm margin added to the width on each side to account for lateral contraction as with the connective tissue. With sterile moist gauze, pressure was applied to the graft for proper adaptation to the wound bed.  The graft was sutured with a single sling and the flap with a double sling.  Simple interrupted sutures were used to close vertical releases."
