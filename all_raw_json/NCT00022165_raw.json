It is not yet known\n      which dose of selenium may be most effective in preventing cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized pilot study to determine the effectiveness of selenium in preventing\n      cancer in healthy people."

Determine whether daily supplementation with selenium significantly reduces\n      total cancer incidence and site-specific cancer incidence in the general population. II.\n      Determine whether this regimen has a beneficial effect on mood.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study.\n      Participants are stratified according to age (60-64 vs 65-69 vs 70-74). Participants are\n      randomized to one of four arms. Arm I: Participants receive oral placebo once daily. Arm II:\n      Participants receive low-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm III: Participants receive\n      moderate-dose oral selenium once daily. Arm IV: Participants receive high-dose oral selenium\n      once daily. Treatment in all arms continues for up to 2 years in the absence of unacceptable\n      side effects or diagnosis of cancer.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 510 patients (170 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 9-12 months."
