Demographic data, diagnostic criteria, clinical\n      measurements, and other respiratory pathogen data are collected using the Cystic Fibrosis\n      Foundation Patient Registry Questionnaire.\n\n      NTM-positive patients (cases) matched with NTM-negative controls identified in screening are\n      followed every 3 months for 15 months.  Cases are evaluated for NTM burden during the first\n      3 months.\n\n      Appropriate therapy is offered to consistently NTM-positive cases.
