The application of subthreshold micropulse laser spots in healthy\n      RPE in the vicinity of the area of GA may restore the imbalance in survival factors caused\n      by the disease (ie, the laser may decrease vascular endothelial growth factor and\n      RPE-derived transforming growth factor beta, upregulation of pigment epithelium-derived\n      factor). This may slow or even stop the enlargement of atrophy secondary to GA, and\n      therefore, avoid further vision loss."
