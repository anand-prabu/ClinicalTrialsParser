  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omegaven is an intravenous fat emulsion (IFE) comprised of omega-3 fatty acids derived from
      fish oil. It will be used in an open label compassionate use treatment protocol, as an
      alternative to soybean oil (omega-6), as the sole IFE source of parenteral nutrition in an
      effort to reduce and/or reverse parenteral nutrition associated liver disease. The study
      will evaluate the safety and efficacy of Omegaven use in pediatric patients with PN
      dependence and PNALD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients will be PN dependent (unable to meet nutritional needs solely by enteral
             nutrition) and are expected to require PN for at least another 30 days

          -  Parenteral nutrition associated liver disease (PNALD) as defined as a direct
             bilirubin of ≥ 2 mg/dL on the last two consecutive bilirubins while on PN.  Other
             causes of liver disease should be excluded. A liver biopsy is not necessary for
             treatment.

          -  Failed standard/conventional therapies to prevent progression of PNALD.

          -  Age newborn to 17 years of age

          -  Signed informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy to eggs and/or shellfish

          -  Female who is pregnant or lactating

          -  Severe hemorrhagic disorder

          -  Other causes of chronic liver disease (Hepatitis C, Cystic fibrosis, biliary atresia,
              and alpha 1 anti-trypsin deficiency,)

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Parent/legally authorized representative is unwilling to consent.
