            "textblock": "This is a research study of a vaccine for allergy to Japanese Red Cedar. The vaccine is\n      called CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine. This research study will determine how the vaccine is\n      tolerated and how research participants respond to the vaccine in various doses.\n      CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is investigational, which means it is not approved for use by\n      the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but is available in research studies\n      like this one. This is the first time that CryJ2-DNA-LAMP Plasmid vaccine is being given to\n      humans.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of an investigational vaccine intended\n      to treat allergy to Japanese red cedar. The vaccine is composed of DNA, which is the\n      material that cells use to provide instructions to make proteins. The DNA carries the\n      information necessary to make a special protein which is a combination of a protein found in\n      all cells, LAMP (lysosomal associated membrane protein), and the protein from Japanese red\n      cedar that causes the allergy known as Cry J2. This vaccine is intended to help re-educate\n      the immune system with respect to how it will respond to naturally occurring red cedar\n      allergen and eliminate the allergic symptoms. Another purpose of this study will be to\n      document the immune response to the vaccine\n\n      Subjects that are eligible to participate in this study will be assigned by whether they are\n      sensitive or non sensitive to CryJ2 or Mountain Cedar and chance (like flipping a coin) to\n      one of 3 study vaccine groups:\n\n      Group 1: will receive four (4) 4-milligram doses of the study vaccine. Group 2: will receive\n      four (4) 2-milligram doses of the study vaccine. Group 3: will receive four (4) 4-milligram\n      doses of the study vaccine.\n\n      The study vaccine is administered as an intramuscular injection. Enrolled subjects will\n      receive the study vaccine every 14 days (at day 0, 14, 28 and 42). Subjects will know their\n      study vaccine assignment. Participants who are not allergic to Japanese red cedar will be\n      assigned to Group 1. Participants who do have an allergy to Japanese red cedar or Mountain\n      Cedar will have an equal chance of being assigned to Group 2 or 3.\n\n      There will be between 18 to 30 men and women participating in the study at one location.\n      Your participation in this study will last approximately 72 days."
