    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to implement a substudy in approximately 120 rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) subjects to compare the steady-state serum trough concentration (Cminss),
      Cmax and AUC(TAU) of subcutaneous (SC) Abatacept injection of 125 mg via the autoinjector
      and via the BD Hypak™ Physiolis prefilled syringe.

      Study Classification:

        -  Safety: show if the drug is safe under conditions of proposed use

        -  Efficacy: measure of an intervention's influence on a disease or health condition

        -  Safety/Efficacy

        -  Pharmacokinetics: the action of a drug in the body over a period of time including the
           process of absorption, distribution and localization in tissue, biotransformation, and
           excretion of the compound.
