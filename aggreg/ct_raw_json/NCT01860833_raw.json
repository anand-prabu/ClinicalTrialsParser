            "textblock": "Central mechanisms may play a role in pain perception during osteoarthritis (OA).Local\n      inflammation (which involves production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin\n      (IL) 4 TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-8) is considered to be a major source of pain.\n\n      Certain therapies that specifically interfere with the expression or actions of\n      pro-inflammatory cytokines have been explored. NSAIDs have analgesic, antipyretic and\n      anti-inflammatory properties and are extensively prescribed for several musculoskeletal\n      disorders. Indeed, the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) recently\n      recommended the use of NSAIDs for management of knee and hip OA in symptomatic patients.\n      These drugs have been shown to influence cytokine metabolism in the synovial fluid of OA\n      patients with satisfactory relief of painful osteoarthritic joints.\n\n      The aim of the current study was to explore whether NSAID treatment inhibits TNF-alpha,\n      IL-6, IL-8, and VEGF secretion in the synovial fluid of osteoarthritic joints. In\n      particular, diclofenac, ibuprofen and celecoxib were studied. Under the hypothesis that\n      relationships between proinflammatory cytokines and the clinical status of OA patients are\n      possible, we also evaluated the association between the concentration of these molecules in\n      the osteoarthritic knee synovial fluid and the pain and functional status of patients with\n      OA. The effects of NSAIDS on signal transduction pathways in the synovial membrane were also\n      investigated."
