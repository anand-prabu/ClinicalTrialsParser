             Appendix 1).

          4. Patients enrolled in HDMTX course 3 or 5 must have a history of successful
             advancement from first to second HDMTX course within the same MAP cycle in all prior
             MAP cycles, i.e. fulfilling all of the following criteria 8 days after start of first

             HDMTX course within the same MAP cycle:

             dose in MAP regimen; must have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test (within seven
             (7) days before study enrolment) and must not be lactating.

          8. Sexually active males: Must be surgically sterile or compliant with a contraceptive
             regimen during and for six (6) months after last MTX dose in MAP regimen.

          9. Patient, parent(s), or guardian(s), as appropriate, is/are willing and able to
             provide signed informed consent.

         10. Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plan, laboratory
             tests, and other study procedures specified in the protocol.

         11. Patients who have undergone surgical resection of their tumor must have recovered
             from their surgery and be eligible to continue on the MAP regimen; any post-operative
             complications should be resolved to NCI CTCAE v4.0 Grade 1 or better.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects meeting any of the following criteria are not eligible for participation:

          1. Involvement in another clinical trial within 30 days before enrolment in the study.
