  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extended duration work shifts and long work weeks have been demonstrated to have adverse
      effects on health and safety. This phenomenon has not been fully investigated in
      firefighters, who typically work 24 and 48-hour shifts as well as overtime and often second
      jobs. The results of this study may lead to recommendations to improve the health, safety,
      quality of life and performance of firefighters and the safety of the public.

      The investigators propose to use a four tier approach (see attached schema) consisting of:
      1) a station-level, randomized experimental design; 2) a web-based training comparison
      groups non-randomized, before and after; 3) a train the trainer comparison groups study
      design, before and after; 4) a national training and survey only groups study design, before
      and after to test the hypotheses that implementation of a Comprehensive Firefighter Fatigue
      Management Program will:

        1. improve the mean total sleep duration and subjective alertness of firefighters;

        2. improve firefighter safety, as determined by:

             1. decreased rates of motor vehicle crashes;

             2. decreased on-the-job injuries;

        3. improve firefighter performance, as determined by decreased response time;

        4. improve firefighter health, as determined by:

             1. diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders

             2. improved general health indices

             3. decreased number of sick days

        5. improve firefighter job satisfaction and ability to cope with extended work hours

        6. to look at and compare the number of people who participate in training versus
           available to participate and to compare the proportion of people who complete the
           survey.

      The above aims will be achieved through a survey assessment. Additionally, a subset of
      participants will participate in up to 6 weeks of physiological monitoring that will provide
      objective data on sleep, alertness and performance.
