  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of an investigational drug
      called carfilzomib, including measuring the amount of the study drug in the blood at certain
      times following dosing. This study is being done in people with varying degrees of liver
      function to see if they respond differently to the study drug.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the influence of hepatic impairment on area
      under the curve (both area under the curve, from time 0 to the last concentration measured
      [AUC0-last] and area under the curve, from time 0 extrapolated to infinity [AUC0-inf]) of
      carfilzomib at Cycle 1 Day 16 (C1D16) in subjects with relapsed or progressive advanced
      malignancies.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Relapsed or progressive advanced malignancies (solid tumors or hematologic
             malignancies)

          3. Confirmed advanced solid tumor or hematologic malignancy

             worsening of liver failure within one month prior to enrollment. Hepatic impairment
             will be assessed as per NCI-ODWG schema and will fall into one of the following three
             categories:

                  aspartate aminotransferase (AST) &gt; ULN, but bilirubin ≤ ULN

               -  Cohort 3 (moderate): ≥ 1.6-3 × ULN; any AST

             All subjects enrolled with normal hepatic function (N=10) must meet all inclusion
             criteria as outlined with the exception of Inclusion Criterion

             #5, which should be substituted with the following criterion to be enrolled into the
             study:

          6. ECOG Performance Status 0-2

          7. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≥ 40%

          8. Adequate renal function (calculated creatinine clearance ≥ 30mL/min)

          9. Active congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association [NYHA] Class III to IV),
             symptomatic ischemia, conduction abnormalities uncontrolled by conventional
             intervention or myocardial infarction within the protocol-specified period prior to
             enrollment

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with symptomatic brain metastasis or central nervous system [CNS] disease

          2. Significant neurotoxicity (Grade 2 with pain or higher) at the time of enrolment

          3. Known HIV, Hepatitis B virus and Hepatitis C virus infection (Exception: Subjects

             [bilirubin, AST] will be allowed)
