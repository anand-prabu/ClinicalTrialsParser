  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this post-market clinical study is to compare one to three year post
      treatment results, range of motion, strength, patient related functional outcomes and
      patient satisfaction, of internal fixation using the Sonoma Orthopedic Products CRx™ as
      compared to nonoperative management (e.g. sling) of similar displaced midshaft clavicle
      fractures.
