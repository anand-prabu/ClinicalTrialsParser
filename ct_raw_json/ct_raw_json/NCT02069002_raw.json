            "textblock": "Indoor air -related respiratory and other multiple organ symptoms are common in work\n      environments in Finland. Symptoms effect on well-being and quality of life and may lead to\n      impaired social and cognitive functioning and reduced work capacity. All indoor air -related\n      conditions are not explained by underlying physical problem and remain medically\n      unexplained. Functional disorders are conditions where patients complain of multiple\n      medically unexplained physical symptoms or physical problems don\u00b4t correlate with symptom\n      severity. Indoor air -related symptoms and functional disorders are strongly associated to\n      each other but there are no well-established diagnostic criteria for the condition . So far,\n      there is no available treatment program to the indoor air -related symptoms to offer in\n      primary or occupational health care services in Finland.\n\n      In randomized controlled trials, cognitive behavioral treatment has shown to be effective\n      for patients suffering from functional disorders. In addition, a relaxation technique\n      entitled as applied relaxation (Tuomisto & al, 1996) has shown to been shown to been\n      effective to treat different kind of functional problems.\n\n      There are no published trials on treatment for individuals of indoor air related\n      symptomatology. The present study is designed as a pragmatic trial to investigate the effect\n      of three different treatment programs as compared to treatment as usual (TAU) for indoor\n      air- related problems in order to improve the (1) work capacity and (2) well-being. A\n      secondary aim of the study is to identify psychological factors affecting the patients'\n      response to the treatment.\n\n      The patients are recruited from occupational health care services to establish and to\n      evaluate the efficacy and usability of the treatment procedures. Participants will first\n      undergo baseline assessment including medical examination of the respiratory symptoms. Then\n      they are randomized to one of the study groups: TAU or one of the intervention groups. All\n      study patients receive TAU at occupational health care services for their medical problems\n      during the study. Patients randomized to the study groups receive also the intervention with\n      TAU."
