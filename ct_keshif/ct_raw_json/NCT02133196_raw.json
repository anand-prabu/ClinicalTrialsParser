Researchers want to know if TIL shrinks tumors in\n      people with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as they have for other types of cancer.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To see if TIL safely and effectively shrinks NSCLC tumors.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 18 and older with NSCLC.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have a sample of their tumor removed so TIL can be grown in the\n           laboratory.\n\n        -  Participants will have imaging procedures, heart and lung tests, and laboratory tests.\n           Women will have a pregnancy test.\n\n        -  Participants will have an intravenous catheter placed in their chest.\n\n        -  Participants will have blood removed through a needle in the arm and some of the white\n           blood cells will be extracted. The rest of the blood will be returned through a needle\n           in the other arm.\n\n        -  Researchers will use these blood cells to help grow the TIL.\n\n        -  Participants will have 7 days of chemotherapy. They will then receive the modified\n           cells via catheter for 20   30 minutes.\n\n        -  Participants will then get aldesleukin to help the cells live longer, through the\n           catheter for up to 4 days. They will also have a daily injection of filgrastim to\n           produce blood cells.\n\n        -  Participants will give several blood samples.\n\n        -  When stable, participants will be discharged from the hospital. Participants will take\n           two drugs for at least 6 months to prevent infections.\n\n        -  Participants will return approximately 6 and 12 weeks following treatment. Participants\n           responding to treatment will return 4 times the first year, twice the next year, and\n           then as determined by their doctor. Follow-up visits will take up to 2 days."

Assignment to this cohort will be made if there are concomitant medical\n           conditions that would preclude the use of high-dose aldesleukin\n\n        -  Clinical and immunologic response will be evaluated about 4-6 weeks after TIL infusion.\n\n        -  For both cohorts 1 and 2, using a Phase II design, 21 patients will be initially\n           enrolled in each group to assess toxicity and tumor responses. If two or more of the\n           first 21 patients per group shows a clinical response (PR or CR), accrual will continue\n           to 41 patients, targeting a 20% goal for objective response. In order to allow for a\n           small number of non evaluable patients, a total of 85 patients may be enrolled over 5\n           years."
