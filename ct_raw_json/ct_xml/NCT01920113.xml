  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate, safe sedation is essential for Endoscopic submucosal dissection. Dexmedetomidine
      is a potent and selective a2-adrenoceptor agonist used for sedative and analgesic effects,
      but it is limited to use alone. The investigators designed this study to compare the effect
      and safety of two sedatives, dexmedetomidine and propofol in Endoscopic Submucosal
      Dissection (ESD), when sufficient analgesia-remifentanil is administered all throughout the
      procedure.
