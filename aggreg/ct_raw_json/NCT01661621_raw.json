Study Visits and Evaluations\n\n      1.2.1 Screening Visit (Baseline, 1 day to 1 week of the first treatment day).\n\n      1.2.1.1 Explain the nature of the study and have patients to read and sign an Informed\n      Consent Form.1.2.1.2 Screen patients for inclusion/exclusion criteria.1.2.1.3 Medical\n      History of lower urinary tract symptoms and previous treatment modalities.1.2.1.4 Vital\n      signs monitoring, general physical examinations of all systems (including digital rectal\n      examination), serum PSA, and urinalysis.1.2.1.5 Record PPBC, IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS-V, and\n      IPSS-S), OABSS, and quality of Life index (QoL-I)scores.1.2.1.6 Obtain maximum flow rate\n      (Qmax), voided volume, postvoid residual volume (PVR), total prostate volume (TPV), and\n      transitional zone index (TZI).1.2.1.7 Randomized assigned patients into 2 groups; men in one\n      group received Doxazosin 4 mg QD, and those in the other group received Detrusitol 4 mg QD.\n\n      1.2.2 First Evaluation Visit (2 weeks after the initial treatment) 1.2.2.1 Vital signs\n      monitoring and record adverse events.1.2.2.2 Record PPBC, IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS-V, IPSS-S),\n      OAB-SS and QoL.1.2.2.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient has symptoms\n      suggestive of urinary tract infection.1.2.2.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and PVR.\n\n      1.2.3 Second Evaluation Visit (4 weeks after the treatment). 1.2.3.1 Vital signs monitoring\n      and record adverse events.1.2.3.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient\n      has symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection.1.2.3.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and\n      PVR.\n\n      1.2.4 Third Evaluation Visit (3 months after the treatment). 1.2.4.1 Vital signs monitoring\n      and record adverse events.1.2.4.2 Record PPBC, IPSS (IPSS-T, IPSS-V, IPSS-S), OAB-SS and\n      QoL.1.2.4.3 Check urinalysis for urinary tract infection if patient has symptoms suggestive\n      of urinary tract infection.1.2.4.4 Check Qmax, voided volume, and PVR.\n\n      1.3. Withdrawal Criteria\n\n      Patients with any of the following conditions may be withdrawn from the trial:\n\n      1.3.1. Patients decide to withdraw their consent. 1.3.2. Patients indicate the status of\n      lack of efficacy which is of clinical significance judged by the investigators that may lead\n      to permanent damage to the patients.1.3.3. Investigators consider that there is of safety\n      concerns for the patients to remain in the trial (such as development severe medical\n      disease).1.3.4. Lost of follow-up or death. 1.3.5. PVR\u2265300 ml\n\n      1.4. Concomitant Treatments Investigator will try to minimize the concomitant medications\n      for the patients during the trial duration. However, patients are allowed to continue taking\n      stable medication in stable dose for diseases other than genitourinary system.\n\n      1.5. Prohibited medication\n\n      Patients are not allowed to take any of the following medications during the study:\n\n        1. Anticholinergics other than test drug\n\n        2.
