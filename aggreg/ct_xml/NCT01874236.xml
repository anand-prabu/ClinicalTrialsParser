      The purpose of the trial is to confirm the validity and reliability of diagnostic SI joint
      blocks.

    <textblock>
      Subjects with suspected SI joint pain will undergo 3 SI joint blocks, 2 with local
      anesthetic and 1 sham block.

      The sequence of blocks is randomly assigned. This study examines both the test-retest
      reliability of response to diagnostic sacroiliac (SI) joint injection and the specificity of
      response to local anesthetic or sham block. The goal of the study is to validate the use of
      diagnostic SI joint block.

      Subjects with pain suspected to be generated by one SI joint will undergo three diagnostic
      SI joint blocks each separated by one week. Two blocks will be with local anesthetic (LA)
      and one will be a sham block (SB).  Both the Coordinator (collecting pain assessments) and
      subject will be blinded to the sequence of blocks (LA or SB each time).  The sequence of
      blocks will be randomly assigned for each subject on study. The subject's participation in
      the study is complete after 1-month post-procedure assessment.

             or right).

          3. Patient has positive Fortin finger test*.

          4. Patient has a current average SI joint pain rating of at least 5 on 0-10 numerical
             rating scale**.
