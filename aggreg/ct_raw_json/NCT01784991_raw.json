Appropriate\n      patients 60 years and older who present with a condition that causes moderate to severe\n      pain, according to the attending physician's judgment, in which the physician would order\n      the use of parenteral analgesia will be screened and randomized to one of two study arms,\n      \"1+1\" versus usual care group. Neither the research associate, nurse, or attending physician\n      will be blinded to the patients randomization. Patient pain score will be assessed at\n      baseline using VAS score. \"1+1\" patients will receive 1mg hydromorphone at \"timepoint 0\"\n      (baseline) followed by another 1mg after 15 minutes (along with repeat VAS pain score) if\n      the patient answers \"yes\" to \"Do you need more pain medicine?\" At 60 minutes, patient pain\n      will be assessed a final time and if patient needs more pain medicine, additional treatment\n      will be dictated by physician discretion.  Usual care group patients will also have VAS pain\n      scores assessed at timepoint 0, 15 and 60 minutes and will have pain treated per the\n      discretion of the attending physician. Patients will be placed on capnometer for continuous\n      monitoring of respiratory status to guard against any opioid induced respiratory depression.\n      Respiratory status, vital signs, and pain scores will be monitor to assess the efficiency of\n      pain control as well as the safety of pain medicine administration in terms of respiratory\n      depression. We propose that the \"1+1\" hydromorphone protocol is easy to implement, as it\n      includes a set timeline, a standard question, and a set dosage of a potent analgesic. We\n      hypothesize that it will provide adequate analgesia in the majority of patients without\n      causing the anticipated level of respiratory depression."
