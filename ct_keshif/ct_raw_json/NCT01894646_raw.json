            "textblock": "Currently, only three radiotracers, (2-[18F]FA, 6-[18F]FA and [18F]AZAN), are available for\n      studying \u03b14\u03b22-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (\u03b14\u03b22-nAChR) in human brain using PET\n      imaging. A crucial problem for 2-[18F] FA, 6-[18F] FA and ([18F] AZAN is low binding\n      potential (BP) in extrathalamic (ET) regions, including hippocampus, cortex and caudate\n      which have lower receptor densities than the thalamus. The importance of imaging\n      ET-\u03b14\u03b22-nAChRs (ET-nAChR) has emerged from the post-mortem demonstration of altered\n      densities of ET-nAChRs (but not thalamic nAChR) in neurodegenerative diseases and\n      schizophrenia. PET imaging of ET-nAChR may prove to be useful in both detecting early\n      changes and following functional deterioration in neurodegenerative diseases such as\n      Alzheimers disease.  Furthermore, PET imaging of ET-nAChR may allow investigation and\n      development of new therapies acting on the acetylcholine system.\n\n      The imaging drawbacks of the presently available nAChR radioligands have initiated the\n      development of radioligands with greater binding potential by several research groups.  The\n      available pre-clinical data on our new radioligand [18F](-)-JHU86428 ([18F]XTRA) suggest\n      that this radioligand is superior to 2-[18F]FA for quantitative PET imaging of \u03b14\u03b22-nAChR\n      (Gao, J. Med. Chem,  2008). In baboon PET studies [18F]XTRA exhibits 200% greater brain\n      uptake, 300% higher BPs and reaches steady-state in approximately 1.5 h in cortical regions\n      post-bolus administration versus 6-8 h for 2-[18F]FA. In vitro binding assays shows greater\n      binding affinity of XTRA and similar nAChR-subtype selectivity in comparison with 2-FA. Both\n      ligands bind selectively with the \u03b22-subtypes that are predominant nAChR subtypes in the\n      mammal brain and display little binding affinity at ganglionic \u03b13\u03b24-nAChR.\n\n      The current planned human protocol will be conducted to (1) determine brain distribution\n      (brain uptake) and test the reproducibility (in test-retest design) of [18F]XTRA brain PET\n      scans for validation of the radioligand; (2) generate estimates of the whole body and\n      internal organ radiation absorbed doses from exposure to single iv administrations of\n      [18F]XTRA in healthy human subjects; and (3) determine brain distribution of [18F]XTRA in\n      patients with Alzheimer's disease."
