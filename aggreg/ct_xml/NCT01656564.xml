  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Long-term survival with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is not well understood.
      Adults who were infected with HIV as children have lived with the virus for many years.
      However, the effect of HIV on this group of people has not been studied in depth.
      Researchers are interested in studying how HIV infection and the medicines used to treat it
      affect people who were infected early in life. They want to find out if there are any
      problems with how HIV-infected children grow and develop as adults, especially if they have
      developed heart problems. As part of this study, people with HIV will be compared with
      healthy volunteers.

      Objectives:

      - To study the effect of HIV infection and treatment on people who acquired HIV infection in
      early life.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age who were infected with HIV before age 10.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age who have no history of heart disease.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will have
           regular study visits about once a year for up to 10 years to collect health
           information.

        -  Blood and urine samples will be collected to look at kidney and liver function.

        -  X-ray scans will be used to look at bone density and the amount of fat and muscle in
           the body.

        -  Heart function tests and imaging studies, including ultrasound and echocardiograms,
           will be used to look more closely at the heart.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Background:

        -  Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has altered the natural history of HIV disease in
           children.

        -  Longterm survivors of pediatric HIV infection offer a tremendous opportunity to
           understand the effects of HIV and ART health outcomes.

        -  A thorough understanding of the impact of HIV and ART on these long-term processes is
           extremely relevant as ART programs for HIV-infected children expand globally.

      Objective:

      - To explore the clinical outcomes and the impact of HIV infection and ART on a cohort with
      HIV infection acquired in early life.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals greater than 18 yrs of age who acquired HIV infection in early life.

        -  Individuals previously enrolled in Protocol 07-C-0087 (A natural history study of HIV
           acquired in infancy or childhood) will be offered enrollment in this study.

        -  Healthy volunteers without HIV (&gt; 18 years of age) will serve as a control group.

      Design:

      - Annual evaluations of health status, immune function and other health parameters related
      to HIV infection will be conducted. In addition, a subset of participants will complete a
      detailed cardiac evaluation with imaging which may be repeated every 5 years.

        -  SUBJECT INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Previous enrollment in Protocol 07-C-0087, or

        HIV positive participants

          -  Known HIV infection, confirmed by laboratory testing and documented or believed to
             have been acquired during the first decade of life

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years, unless previously enrolled in Protocol
             07-C-0087

        Healthy volunteers

          -  HIV negative, documented by a negative ELISA

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years

          -  Free of any major underlying medical disorder

        For cardiac imaging sub-study:

        Previous enrollment in Protocol 07-C-0087 or,

        HIV positive participants

          -  Known HIV infection, confirmed by laboratory testing and documented or believed to
