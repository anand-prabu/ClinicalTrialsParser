It was our hypothesis that by using randomized,\n      prospective, blinded study methods, there would be no significant difference in clinical\n      outcome measures based solely on eversion of the patella during total knee arthroplasty.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      After an a priori power analysis was done, 120 primary total knee replacements indicated for\n      degenerative joint disease were included in the study and randomized to one of two patella\n      exposure techniques: lateral retraction or eversion.  Collaborating investigators and\n      patients were blinded to randomization."

All operations were performed\n             by three well-established arthroplasty-fellowship-trained orthopaedic surgeons using\n             surgical techniques based on that of a senior surgeon.  All implanted devices were\n             cruciate-substituting tricompartmental total knee replacements placed through a\n             medial parapatellar approach.  All patients were anaesthetized with spinal\n             anesthesia, received a peri-operative cocktail injection, and had tourniquet times\n             between 0 and 120 minutes.  Multi-modal post-operative pain management and\n             accelerated physical therapy were performed as previously described.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients were excluded from the study if on the operative side they had undergone\n             prior total knee replacement, prior knee arthrotomy, prior osteotomy at or about the\n             knee, or had preoperative angular deformity greater than 20 degrees."
