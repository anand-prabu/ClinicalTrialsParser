      The goal of this study is to estimate the prevalence of HIV, Hepatitis B and hepatitis C
      infection among newly diagnosed cancer patients presenting to community and academic
      oncology clinics.

      Primary Objective

      Among newly diagnosed cancer patients presenting to SWOG-affiliated community and academic
      oncology clinics, estimate the prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis B
      (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) infection. Prevalence estimates will be further stratified: by
      whether infection with the virus(es) is known, as reported by patients and/or their
      physician prior to study testing, vs. unknown; by presenting cancer type, and by
      self-reported risk factors for each virus.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  Evaluate known sociodemographic, clinical, and behavioral factors that are
           significantly associated with previously undiagnosed HIV, HBV, and/or HCV infection in
           a population of people with newly diagnosed cancer.

        -  Among patients who are identified as having HIV, HBV, and/or HCV, evaluate the timing
           and type of treatments received, both for the viral infections and the cancers.

        -  Evaluate type and rate of cancer treatment-related adverse events in patients with HIV,
           HBV, and/or HCV infection.

        -  Using simulation modeling that is directly informed by the data obtained from this
           study, determine the cost-effectiveness (expressed as cost per infection detected and
           cost per year of life gained) of (1) routine, universal screening and (2) risk
           factor-directed screening of newly diagnosed cancer patients for HIV, HBV, and/or HCV
           vs. current care.

      Tertiary Objective

      Create a biorepository of stored serum for future translational medicine studies that may
      include identifying genomic and viral factors that increase the risk of serious adverse
      effects among participants infected with HIV, HBV, and/or HCV being treated for invasive
      cancers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  presenting for evaluation or treatment of a new cancer malignancy(including
             hematologic)

          -  confirmed pathologic diagnosis must be within 120 days of registration (Patients
             presenting for &quot;second opinions&quot; of confirmed malignancies are eligible, including
             those who have started cancer treatment at other facilities)

          -  at least 18 years of age

          -  patient must have had their blood drawn for HIV, HBV and HCV testing prior to
             registration (Patients who have had HIV, HBV and/or HCV testing within 60 days prior
             to registration and who do not wish to be retested are eligible, provided supporting
             documents can be obtained confirming viral test results for all three viruses.
             Documentation must be obtained prior to registration.

        Patients who are viral positive for either HIV, HBV, and/or HCV and who do not wish to be
        retested are eligible, provided documentation of viral load within 120 days prior to
        registration can be obtained.  Note that these patients must be tested for or provide
        current viral load for all three viruses to be eligible. Documentation must be obtained
        prior to registration.)

             and federal guidelines

          -  Patients must be offered the opportunity to allow their blood specimens to be banked
