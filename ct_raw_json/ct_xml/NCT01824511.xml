  <brief_summary>

      The most widely-accepted animal model of nicotine withdrawal states stopping nicotine makes
      rewarding events become less rewarding.  The current study will test if this is true in
      humans.  If we find tobacco abstinence does make rewards less rewarding, this would suggest
      new symptoms to add to official descriptions of nicotine withdrawal.  It would also suggest
      we need to develop new behavioral and pharmacological interventions to correct this problem.
       If stopping smoking does not make rewards less rewarding, this would suggest this animal
      model does not apply to the human condition and we need to continue to search for an animal
      model of tobacco withdrawal that is relevant to smokers stopping smoking.

      Study design We will recruit until we have 120 current smokers who want to quit at two sites
      (Univ of Vermont and Dartmouth Medical School). In the first week, smokers will smoke their
      usual number of cigs/day.  They will then quit and are to remain abstinent for 4 weeks. We
      will use a schedule of escalating monetary contingencies based on breath and saliva and/or
      urine samples to encourage abstinence.  We will obtain dependent measures twice/week.  The
      primary measures  of reward responsivity will be the percent choosing the hard task and the
      amount of responding for a monetary reward on the EEfRT task and the score on our Rewarding
      Events scale.  Other outcomes will be delay discounting results and self-reports of
      anhedonia and apathy.

      The study will run for 1 week pre-cessation (2 visits)  and then for 4 weeks post-cessation.
      Measures and biochemical verifications will occur twice/wk.

      For the first week of abstinence, the cutoff for nonsmoking will be CO &lt;8 ppm. For the
      remaining weeks, abstinence will be verified with a score of 0 (&lt;10 ng/ml of cotinine) on a
      test strip in a saliva or urine sample  plus a CO &lt;8 ppm.

      At the initial session, completion of baseline surveys will describe the sample and also
      measure plausible moderators such as depression.

      We believe the most direct test of reward sensitivity is an evaluation of the influence of
      abstinence on operant responding for a reward.  Thus, we have chosen performance on the
      Effort Expenditure for Rewards Task (EEfRT), which examines responding as a function of
      response cost, reward magnitude and probability of reward, as one of our primary outcomes.

      For a self-report measure we will use our Rewarding Events (RE) scale that asks both about
      occurrence of presumed rewarding events and their anticipated pleasantness.  Our RE scale
      will ask participants to rate 58 items on frequency in the last week as well
      perceived/expected pleasantness of events.

      Secondary measures include the 18-item Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES), the Temporal
      Experience of Pleasure (TEPS), Minnesota Nicotine Withdrawal Scale-Revised (MNWS), and a
      measure of delay discounting (DD).
