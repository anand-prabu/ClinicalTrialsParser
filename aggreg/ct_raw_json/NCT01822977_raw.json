A baseline stool sample will be collected from the healthy individuals. They will then be given a PPI, omeprazole 20 mg, to be taken once (n=5) or twice (n=5) daily for 1 month.  Stool samples will be collected after 1 week and again after 1 month. A final stool sample will be collected 1 month after stopping the omeprazole.\nA stool sample will be collected from the CDI subjects before treatment of the infection and again 2 months after treatment to avoid enrolling those at risk for relapse (which most commonly occurs during the first 2 months after treatment)."

Inclusion Criteria for Clostridium difficile infection subjects:\n\n        1.    Newly diagnosed first episode of CDI prior to being treated.\n\n        Table 3.  Exclusion Criteria for Healthy Subjects:\n\n          1.

Chronic daily use of any medications that could alter gastrointestinal secretory or\n             motor function (see Table 2).\n\n          3. Gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, or other chronic disease likely\n             to affect gastrointestinal motility (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes mellitus).\n\n          4. Females of childbearing age who are not practicing at least one form of birth control\n             at least one month prior to starting the PPI or are pregnant or lactating (a\n             pregnancy test will be performed on female subjects prior to PPI use).\n\n          5. Significant untreated psychiatric disease.\n\n        Table 4.  Prohibited Medications:\n\n          1. Antibiotics within 2 months of the stool sample collection.\n\n          2. Probiotics (e.g., Florastor, Align, Flora-Q, VSL#3, lactobacillus, bifidobacterium)\n             within 2 weeks of the stool sample collection.\n\n          3. Fiber supplements (e.g., Metamucil, Citrucel, Benefiber), unless maintained on a\n             stable dose for the last 3 months.\n\n          4. Chronic use of medications that alter gastric pH: proton pump inhibitors (e.g.,\n             omeprazole, lansoprazole, esomeprazole, pantoprazole, rabeprazole, dexlansoprazole)\n             and histamine2 receptor antagonists (e.g., cimetidine, famotidine, ranitidine).\n\n          5. Chronic use of medications that affect gastrointestinal motility and/or transit\n             including prokinetic agents (e.g., metoclopramide (Reglan), tegaserod (Zelnorm),\n             domperidone (Motilium), erythromycin), narcotic analgesic agents (e.g., methadone,\n             fentanyl, oxycodone, codeine, morphine, hydromorphone), laxatives including mineral\n             oil, anticholinergic agents (e.g., Bentyl, Levsin), and antidiarrheal agents (e.g.,\n             Kaopectate (donnagel), Pepto-Bismol (bismuth subsalicylate), Imodium (loperamide),\n             Lomotil (atropine with diphenoxylate), codeine, tincture of opium)."
