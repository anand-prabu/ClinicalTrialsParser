      This study which is open to students at Arizona State University who require follow-up care
      after their visit to ASU Health Services.  Patients who are seen by a Mayo Clinic physician
      working at the ASU Health Services are randomized to either be seen for followup at the
      health center with the same physician or seen at the health center by the same physician at
      Mayo clinic utilizing telemedicine.

      After the visit, patients and the physician will fill out an patient satisfaction survey and
      the record will be reviewed by an independent investigator for determining quality of care
      by reviewing the record.
