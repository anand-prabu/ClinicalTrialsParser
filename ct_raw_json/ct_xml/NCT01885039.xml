      Background:

      - The Chinese University of Hong Kong and the National Cancer Institute are conducting a
      breast tissue study in connection with another study on breast health. This larger study
      will look at breast health in women who live in Hong Kong. Women in the breast health study
      will provide a breast tissue sample during biopsy surgery. Researchers want to use part of
      the sample to study changes in breast tissue that are related to breast diseases. This
      sample study is part of the larger study.

      Objectives:

      - To look at changes in breast tissue that are related to breast diseases.

      Eligibility:

        -  Women who are participating in the Hong Kong breast health study.

        -  Participants must be having a biopsy to remove breast tissue for study.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a biopsy to remove a breast tissue sample. Most of the sample
           will be used for diagnosis. A portion of the leftover tissue will be used for this
           study.

        -  No extra surgery will be required.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Background: Breast cancer incidence is increasing rapidly among many Asian populations
      primarily due to the adaptation of a Westernized lifestyle. However, Asian women seem to
      have a distinctive profile of breast cancer that differs from that seen in Western
      populations, such as earlier age at onset, more advanced stage, and higher frequency of
      ER-negative tumors. The disproportionally high rates among younger women were also seen
      among U.S.-born Asian women, such as Chinese, Filipina, Indian, and Pakistani women. These
      findings suggest that Asian breast cancer may have a distinct etiology that is not fully
      explained by adapting a westernized lifestyle. Recent molecular studies have suggested that
      breast cancers comprise several biologically and clinically distinct tumor subtypes.
      Epidemiologic evidence suggests that associations with breast cancer risk factors may vary
      by tumor subtype. However, most previous studies were conducted in Western populations;
      large, population-based epidemiologic studies characterizing molecular subtypes of breast
      cancer in Asian women are limited. In this study, we would like to characterize the
      molecular profile of breast cancer among Chinese women in Hong Kong and associate the
      molecular features with clinical and etiologic factors. An improved understanding of the
      inter-relationships among age, breast cancer subtypes, and race/ethnicity is critical for
      the development of targeted prevention and the best and most efficacious therapy.

      Objectives: To assess the technical feasibility of 1) collecting fresh frozen tissues and
      fixed tissue blocks from breast cancer cases in Hong Kong, and 2) conducting tumor profiling
      analyses in the collected tissues.

      Eligibility: Breast cancer cases who are participants in an ongoing breast cancer case
      control study among Hong Kong women (Night shift and breast cancer: a case-control  study
      among Hong Kong women, led by Dr. Tse at Chinese University in Hong Kong) and who will
      receive surgery at the North District Hospital, HK, in 2013.

      Design: In this feasibility study, we plan to collect fresh frozen and fixed tissues (tumor
      and adjacent normal) from ~100 breast cancer cases who have given consent to participate in
      our breast tissue collection pilot study. DNA and RNA will be extracted from frozen tumors
      and assessed for quality and yield. We will then conduct expression profiling analysis in a
      subset of cases (N~10) to determine the quality of RNA in molecular profiling analysis. We
      will also determine whether there are enough epithelial benign and tumor tissues for the
      construction of tissue microarrays (TMAs). The results from this feasibility study will
      inform our decision on whether or not to pursue a large scale study.
