This will be done by monitoring changes in\n      Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR); from Baseline/Day 1 (start of study drug) to Week 16 of\n      the study. PVR measures the resistance to flow in the blood vessels of the lungs. The study\n      will include other assessments to evaluate the effect of the study drug on PAH, including\n      measurements of exercise ability and evaluations of PAH disease symptoms."
