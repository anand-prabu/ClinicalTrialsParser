  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether BG00012 (dimethyl fumarate, DMF,
      Tecfidera™) taken over 12 months is effective in reducing Multiple Sclerosis-related
      fatigue, as measured by changes in the Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive Functions
      (FSMC), in participants with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).  The secondary
      objectives of this study are as follows: To describe variation from baseline in fatigue
      scores effects on motor and cognitive function or Fatigue Scale for Motor and Cognitive
      Functions (FSMC) and fatigue severity (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) at 1, 3, and 6 months
      in participants receiving standard of care (SOC) treatment; To investigate changes from
      baseline in fatigue effects on motor and cognitive function (FSMC) and fatigue severity
      (Fatigue Severity Scale [FSS]) at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months in participants receiving
      BG00012; To assess the impact of BG00012 on patient-reported outcomes (PROs), including work
      productivity (Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Multiple Sclerosis questionnaire
      [WPAI-MS]), health-related quality of life (Short Form Health Survey [SF-12] or the
      15-dimensional health-related quality of life [15D HRQoL] questionnaire), depression (Beck
      Depression Inventory-Fast Screen [BDI-FS]), and sleepiness (Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS])
      at 6 and 12 months in participants receiving BG00012;  To examine whether an association
      exists between fatigue and baseline demographics and disease characteristics (e.g., age,
      sex, disease duration, baseline disease activity, treatment history, expanded disability
      status scale [EDSS] score, and PROs);  and To assess any changes in fatigue-related
      medication use.
