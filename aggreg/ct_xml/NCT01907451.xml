        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients benefiting from classical rehabilitation following cardiovascular accident
             (cerebral infarction or spontaneous intracerebral hematoma) according to current
             recommendations (conference de consensus sur l'orientation des patients atteints
             d'AVC des societes Françaises de Medecine Physique et Readaptation (MPR), d'Urgence
             Neuro-Vasculaire et de Geriatrie et Gerontologie), hospitalized in the Physical
             Medicine and Rehabilitation (PMR) units of Dijon and Besançon CHU, and the Functional
             Rehabilitation Centres of  Divio (Dijon) and Bregille (Besançon)

          -  Age between 18 and 85 years.

          -  Etiological examination carried out according to current recommendations (CT scan
             and/or MRI, Holter ECG and Holter blood pressure, Doppler of the supra-aortic trunks,
             echocardiography).

          -  Patients referred to the PMR unit less than one month after the cerebral vascular
             accident.

          -  Clinical status considered stable from a cardiovascular and neurological point of
             view with a well-balanced medical treatment (anti-hypertensives, anti-coagulants or
             antiplatelets, oral antidiabetics if necessary)

          -  Patients able to understand the instructions and the interest of retraining.

          -  Patients who have provided written informed consent for the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existence of disorders associated with hemiplegic motor impairment: disorders of
             memory and superior functions (MMSE &lt; 24) and impaired ability to understand (BDAE
             &lt;3), deep sensitivity disorders, severe unilateral neglect (bells test).

          -  Patients referred following meningeal hemorrhage or deep vein thrombosis

          -  Recurrent stroke, whatever the severity of the sequelae of the previous stroke.

          -  Existence of cerebellar involvement as a major aspect of the clinical picture

          -  Myocardial infarction or heart surgery within the preceding 6 months.

          -  Severe heart failure (NYHA &gt;3 or  left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40%).

          -  Subjects presenting with complete non-stabilized arrhythmia

          -  Any metabolic, infectious, inflammatory, respiratory or cardiovascular disease that
             is not stabilized or constitutes a contra indication to retraining (chronic
             respiratory insufficiency (obstructive or restrictive), severe valve disease,
             obstructive heart disease, severe progressive heart rhythm or conduction disorders,
             intracavitary thrombus.

          -  Symptomatic peripheralartery disease (Leriche and Fontaine stage 3 or 4).

          -  Any other debilitating neurological disease (multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's
             disease).

          -  Participation in another biomedical research protocol during the retraining period (8
             weeks minimum)

          -  Patients under guardianship or ward of court.
