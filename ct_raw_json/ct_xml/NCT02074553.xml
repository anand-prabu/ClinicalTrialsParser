  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, randomized, single-dose, 4-sequence, 4-period cross-over study will compare
      the bioequivalence of 3 test formulations to a reference formulation of alectinib
      (RO5424802) in healthy adult volunteers. All participants will receive each of the 4
      treatments in a randomized sequence. Each treatment will be given as a single oral
      administration after an overnight fast, followed by a 10-day washout period. Total time on
      study is expected to last up to 75 days.
