Main toxicity of docetaxel is myelosuppression. The low rate of severe\n      myelosuppression observed in other cancer trials warrants further study in urothelial\n      cancer. The objective of the study is to evaluate the safety and activity of weekly\n      docetaxel given as salvage therapy for advanced urothelial cancer."

Screening numbers are\n      endowed to all subjects who sign the informed consent forms. These screening numbers are\n      used as 'Subject Identification Code\" along with subject initials. Subjects withdrawn from\n      the study retain their screening number.\n\n      Patients will have study drug discontinued at the time of progression and will then remain\n      on study for a 4-week safety follow-up. Those without progression may continue to receive\n      docetaxel as long as this is considered to be in their interest by their physician. After\n      progression, patients will remain on study for the purpose of collecting follow-up and\n      survival information.\n\n      VII-3. Study treatment\n\n      The study drug doses should be calculated taking the body surface area into consideration.\n      Docetaxel 30 mg/m2 will be administered on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks. Docetaxel will be\n      diluted in 250 ml 0.9% saline or 5% dextrose to produce a final solution with concentration\n      of 0.3-0.74 mg/ml. It will be administered as an infusion over 60 min on each infusion day.\n      Patients will be premedicated with iv dexamethasone 15 mg, antihistamines and a prophylactic\n      antiemetic treatment prior to docetaxel infusion in order to reduce the incidence and\n      severity of fluid retention as well as the severity of hypersensitivity reactions. Patients\n      experiencing adverse events attributed to irinotecan should have treatment delay as needed\n      and/or may be interrupted or reduced depending on individual tolerability and according to\n      the protocol.\n\n      Treatment will be continued until disease progression, unacceptable toxicities, or consent\n      withdrawal. After failure of study treatment, further treatment can be administered at the\n      discretion of investigators."
