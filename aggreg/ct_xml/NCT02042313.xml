    <textblock>
      Esophagectomy is a major surgical procedure often associated with significant morbidity and
      mortality and significant level of postoperative pain. In contrast to open esophagectomy
      where epidural pain control has been considered as a gold standard and could be crucial in
      affecting outcome the analgesic scheme for minimally invasive esophagectomy (MIE) is yet to
      be established. We would like to compare continuous epidural analgesia and continuous
      paravertebral block combined with single shot subcostal transversus abdominis plane (TAP)
      block in the analgesic effects, levels of cytokines, and postoperative complications in
      patients receiving MIE.

    <description>Epidural catheters will be applied at the T6-8 level prior to the induction. 6 ml of 2% xylocaine with 1 in 200,000 epinephrine administered before surgery. During the surgery, 2% xylocaine with 1 in 200,000 epinephrine infusion will be administered at a rate of 2-10 ml/hour adjusted according to patient's blood pressure. After surgery, 0.125% levobupivacaine with 2.5μg fentanyl and 1 in 400,000 epinephrine will be given at a rate of 0.10-0.15 ml kg-1 h-1 (0.5 h lock and 2 ml bolus) through a patient-controlled infusion pump.</description>

    <description>Paravertebral catheterization into the paravertebral region ipsilateral to the VATS incision as described by Murata at the level of T7-8 will be performed.  10 ml of 2% xylocaine with 1 in 200,000 epinephrine to initiate analgesia. During the surgery, 2% xylocaine with 1 in 200,000 epinephrine infusion will be administered at a rate of 2-10 ml/hour adjusted according to patient's blood pressure. After the surgery, 0.125% levobupivacaine with 2.5μg fentanyl and 1 in 400,000 epinephrine will be administered at the rate of 0.10-0.15 ml kg-1 h-1 (0.5 h lock and 2 ml bolus) through a patient-controlled infusion pump.
Ultrasound-guided (USG) subcostal TAP block will be performed at the end of surgery.  Fifteen milliliters of 0.5% levobupivacaine with 1 in 400,000 epinephrine will be injected in incremental doses on each side of the abdomen.</description>
