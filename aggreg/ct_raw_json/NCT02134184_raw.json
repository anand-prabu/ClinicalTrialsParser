Healthy volunteers, > 60 years of\n      age, will be identified by the Stanford Blood Center based on their history of positive or\n      negative CMV serologies.  Baseline blood samples will be drawn from all study participants\n      prior to immunization. All participants will receive a single dose of 2012-2013 licensed\n      TIV.  Volunteers will complete 3 study visits at Day 0, Day 7 and Day 28."
