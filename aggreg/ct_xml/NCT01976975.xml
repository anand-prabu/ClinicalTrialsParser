  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to investigate reward learning across the mood disorder spectrum and to
      investigate the predictive validity of reward learning for subsequent symptom severity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study involves three sessions. In the first session, participants will play a computer
      task. In the second session, participants will go through a clinical interview and will have
      an EEG recording while playing another computer task. In the third session, participants
      will undergo an fMRI scan while playing another computer task. All tasks assess reward
      learning. At three and six months after the final session, researchers will follow up with
      participants by phone to assess symptom severity. There will be no intervention in this
      study.
