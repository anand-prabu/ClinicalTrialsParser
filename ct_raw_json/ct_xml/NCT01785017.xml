      A Standardized Clinical Assessment Management Plan (SCAMP) has been developed and
      implemented at Boston Children Hospital to decrease variations in clinical practice in
      critical asthma therapies for children.  The primary aim is to determine whether a Critical
      Asthma SCAMP can improve clinical outcome.

    <textblock>
      A Standardized Clinical Assessment Management Plan (SCAMP) has been developed and
      implemented at Boston Children Hospital to decrease variations in clinical practice in
      critical asthma therapies for children.  However the effects of the Critical Asthma SCAMP on
      the clinical outcomes in children with critical asthma are unknown.  This study will assess
      the effectiveness of the SCAMP by comparing retrospective data from medical records in
      children with critical asthma to prospective clinical PPSQ SCAMP outcome data obtained
      during the QA process of the SCAMP.  The primary aim is to determine whether a Critical
      Asthma SCAMP can improve clinical outcome.  There are three specific pathways in the
      Critical Asthma SCAMP.  The primary outcome measure is the length of intensive care length
      of stay (defined as time to every 2 hr intermittent albuterol nebulization) for all three
      pathways.  The secondary aim is to validate a clinical asthma score to direct critical
      asthma therapies.  To achieve this goal we will determine the relationships of the driver(s)
      of the SCAMP which includes Boston Children Hospital (BCH) Asthma Severity Score [HASS] and
      non-invasive measures of pCO2 to standard measures of severity of asthma (blood gases and
      peak flow measurements).
