  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic illness characterized by inflammation of the airways. Severe asthma is
      defined in the literature as asthma not controlled by medication. In recent years it has
      become known that severe asthma is a variable disease and has subtypes relating to the age
      of onset, type of inflammation and allergy, obesity, etc.

      Our aim is to characterize the phenotypes of severe asthma population in our clinic and
      compare the prevalent phenotypes to the phenotypes described before.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of Asthma- typical symptoms and signs accompanied by either: a. obstruction
             in  Spirometry, OR- b. positive methacholine test

          2. Regular use of high dose of inhaled corticosteroids (1000 micrograms of fluticasone
             per day or equivalent) in addition to a long acting beta agonist (LABA).

          3. Lack of asthma control- 2 or more exacerbations in the past year- exacerbations
             defined by hospitalization or care in an emergency department or treatment with
             systemic glucocorticosteroids for exacerbation of asthma symptoms.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Presence of another relevant respiratory illness, such as chronic obstructive
             pulmonary disease (COPD)

          2. lack of adherence to medical therapy
