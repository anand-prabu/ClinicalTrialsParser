Assess the total dose of\n      irinotecan received per 6 week course in these patients. III. Determine the incidence of\n      irinotecan-induced leukopenia, neutropenia, and diarrhea in these patients. V. Determine the\n      response rate for this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Amifostine is administered by 10 minute IV infusions.\n      Irinotecan is administered by IV infusions 15 minutes after completion of amifostine.\n      Treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for 6 weeks. This 6 week course is repeated in the\n      absence of disease progression. Treatment may be delayed up to 2 weeks after a course to\n      allow for recovery from toxic effects. Patients are followed at the end of study and at 30\n      days after study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 25-30 patients accrued into this study."
