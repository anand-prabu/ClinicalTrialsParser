The\n      primary objective of the study is to describe the safety for the doublet therapy (dabrafenib\n      and ipilimumab) and the triplet therapy (dabrafenib/trametinib and ipilimumab). Preliminary\n      efficacy data will also be collected. Subjects will be assigned to receive either the\n      doublet combination (dabrafenib and ipilimumab) or the triplet combination (dabrafenib,\n      trametinib, and ipilimumab). Subjects will be enrolled to dose-finding cohorts in the\n      doublet combination (dabrafenib + ipilimumab) in a sequential 3+3 fashion. Following\n      establishment of a dose for the doublet combination, an expansion cohort will be opened. At\n      the same time, enrollment to dose finding cohorts for the triplet combination (dabrafenib +\n      trametinib + ipilimumab) will begin in a sequential 6+6 fashion. Enrollment into triplet\n      cohorts will take priority when both the doublet expansion arm and the triplet dose-finding\n      arm are open for enrollment at the same time. Approximately 9-24 subjects will be enrolled\n      to the dose finding portion of the study. Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled to\n      doublet expansion cohort and 30 subjects will be enrolled in the triplet expansion cohort. A\n      two-week run-in period without ipilimumab will be followed by 4 intravenous doses of\n      ipilimumab at the recommended dose and schedule. Oral daily dosing of dabrafenib or\n      dabrafenib + trametinib will continue from the two-week run-in, through combination with\n      ipilimumab, and post-ipilimumab until no longer of clinical benefit, in the opinion of the\n      treating physician, or until unacceptable AE or death"
