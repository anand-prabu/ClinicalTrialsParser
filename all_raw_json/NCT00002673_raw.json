Determine whether adoptive immunotherapy comprising donor-derived CD8+,\n      CMV-specific, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted cytotoxic T-lymphocyte\n      (CTL) clones (CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones) and CD4+ CMV-specific T-helper (Th)-cell clones\n      is effective in preventing CMV viremia and disease in CMV-positive patients with\n      malignancies requiring allogeneic bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cell transplantation.\n      II. Determine whether the transfer of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones to patients with\n      deficient responses can reconstitute CD4+ Th-cell activity and augment adoptively\n      transferred CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones.\n\n      OUTLINE: Allogeneic CD8+ CMV-specific, major histocompatibility complex class I-restricted\n      cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) clones (CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones) and CD4+ CMV-specific\n      T-helper (Th)-cell clones are harvested and cultured in vitro at least 2 weeks before bone\n      marrow or peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation. Bone marrow or PBSC are infused\n      on day 0. Patients receive the first infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones beginning\n      between days 28 and 45 posttransplantation, followed 8 days later by the second infusion,\n      followed 2 days later by the first infusion of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones. Patients\n      who receive prednisone posttransplantation or have deficient CD8+ CTL responses (i.e., less\n      than 50% of the response measured in the immunocompetent bone marrow donor) after the second\n      infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL clones receive a third infusion of CD8+ CMV-specific CTL\n      clones and a second infusion of CD4+ CMV-specific Th-cell clones before day 67.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
