Assess the clinical and pathological\n      response rate to this therapy in this patient population. III. Compare the benefit of\n      surgery in terms of overall survival of responding and nonresponding patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive infusions of docetaxel over 1 hour on day 1, followed by infusions\n      of cisplatin over 1 hour on days 1-2. Treatment is repeated for three 21 day courses.\n      Patients undergo tumor resection and mediastinal lymph node dissection. Patients are to\n      receive postoperative radiotherapy within 4 weeks of resection if the tumor reaches the\n      resection margins and/or the first mediastinal lymph node levels are involved. Patients will\n      be followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 5-40 patients will be accrued within 3 years."
