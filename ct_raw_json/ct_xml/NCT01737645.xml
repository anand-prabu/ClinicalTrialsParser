  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if there is a rise in eye pressure, when patients are placed in a
      position where the head is lower than the rest of the body during long surgeries.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eye pressure will be measured at protocol specified intervals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects undergoing prolonged procedures (scheduled &gt;3hr) in steep  Trendelenburg
             position (eg. robotic prostatectomy, hysterectomy, cystectomy)

          2. Morbidly obese subjects:  BMI ≥ 35 kg/m2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of glaucoma

          2. Note:if initial IOP is noted to be &gt;21mmHg (millimeters of mercury), patient will be
             excluded from study and an ophthalmology consultation will be obtained.Surgery will
             not be postponed.

          4. Allergy to latex or proparacaine hydrochloride ophthalmic solution

          5. Patients with active corneal epithelial defects or history of recurrent corneal
             erosion

          6. Patients with underlying disorders that can directly increase intraocular pressure
             (thyroid eye disease, intra orbital tumors, orbital vascular malformation,
             Sturge-Weber disease, carotid or dural cavernous arteriovenous malformation,
             cavernous sinus pathology)

          7. History of corneal surgery, to include LASIK (laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis)

          8. Any eye surgery within prior 1 month
