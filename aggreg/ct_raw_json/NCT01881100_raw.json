The calculated sample size was 60 children and 120 white spot\n           lesions. The initially planned number of participants was increased by expected  20%\n           drop-out after 1 year, at least 72 children; the minimal number of treated active\n           caries lesions amounted to 144.\n\n        -  Participants were allocated to the \"test\" and to the \"control\" group, respectively, by\n           computer-generated randomly permuted blocks using package blockrand in R statistical\n           software, sealed in envelopes.\n\n        -  The children were re-examined clinically by the same 2 examiners as at baseline\n           evaluation.\n\n        -  Statistical analyses were performed using statistical software STATISTICA 10\n           (StatSoft), the level of significance was set at 0.05. Intra-examiner reliability was\n           assessed by kappa statistics.\n\n        -  To compare average values between two independent groups U Mann-Whitney test was used\n           (for e.g. to compare experimental group with the control one); Wilcoxon signed-rank\n           test was used for paired samples (for e.g. to compare first measurement with final\n           measurement for experimental group). Comparison of fractions was conducted using\n           Pearson's chi-square test of independence and Z test. The 95% confidence intervals were\n           calculated on the basis of normal approximation."
