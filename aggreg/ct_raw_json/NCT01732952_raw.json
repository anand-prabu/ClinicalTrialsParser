The investigators will primarily be cardiologists,\n      endocrinologists, neurologists, gerontologists, internists, or other physicians who are\n      representative of the general population of physicians managing patients with dyslipidemia\n      and/or at high risk for cardiovascular events likely to be treated with lipid-modifying\n      drugs. Demographic data, cardiovascular risk factors, a history of cardiovascular disease\n      and cardiovascular treatments will be documented in a single visit through patient clinical\n      examination and chart review.\n\n      DYSIS-China is part of a string of epidemiological studies that share the same master\n      protocol, which has been conducted in different countries mainly in Europe and Canada. The\n      analysis of the pooled studies including overall data and cross-country comparisons is the\n      subject of a distinct protocol."
