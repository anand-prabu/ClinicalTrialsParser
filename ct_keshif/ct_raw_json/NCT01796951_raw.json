The mechanism of aspirin's cancer prevention\n      is not known.  This study will evaluate whether once daily aspirin use can reduce the\n      production of a protein named prostaglandin E2 (PGE-2), which is known to promote cancer.\n      Specifically, this study will evaluate if aspirin can inhibit the production of PGE-2 by\n      blocking an enzyme named cycloxygenase-2 (COX-2).  To accomplish these goals, participants\n      will take either aspirin 325 mg daily, celecoxib 200 mg twice daily, or the combination of\n      both during various days of this 16-day study.  Urine be collected to evaluate for PGE-2\n      production at 4 timepoints in this 16-day study."
