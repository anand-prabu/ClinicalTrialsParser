  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study examines the potential effect of reducing nicotine content or menthol or both in
      women of reproductive age, a vulnerable population identified by the FDA in need of further
      research.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study is designed to address the following questions that have been outlined by the FDA as
      particular areas of interest:

        1. What are the factors, including menthol and other flavorings that influence the appeal
           of tobacco products to vulnerable populations:  What is the impact of these factors on
           cessation, switching tobacco products and multiple use?

        2. What is the potential impact of modifying nicotine levels on dependence, and smoking
           rate and cessation, as well as patterns of switching of products and use of multiple
           tobacco products?

        3. Beyond nicotine, what othr constituents enhance addictive properties?

    <description>Examine cigarette content manipulation (nicotine reduction and menthol removal) as independent variables and  the number of cigarettes recorded daily as dependent variable..Measures that will be tested for  include subscales of the cigarette evaluations  as well as craving,  affect and mood, and self-confidence</description>

    <description>To explore the moderating effects of supertasters with menthol assignments to predict compliance with treatment, cigarette taste and aversion. A logistic model will be used to predict post-treatment abstinence. The interaction between supertaster and menthol will test for the moderating effect.</description>
