Patients with past history of AC won't be included.\n\n      Study design : Retrospective cohort study will be conducted from 2000 using diagnostic codes\n      of anal AIN3 lesion in histo-pathology departments. Then a prospective cohort study will be\n      conducted with new diagnoses of anal AIN3 lesion.\n\n      Outcome : The main outcome is histology proven AC. AC identification can be done either by\n      using diagnostic codes of AC in histo-pathology departments (for retrospective cases), or\n      prospectively.\n\n      Statistics : The incidence rate of AC will be calculated. Factors associated with AC will be\n      estimated using a multivariate Cox regression model.\n\n      Number of patients : 1000 Number of centers : 33 (50 physicians) Length of follow-up: 3\n      years at least Length of study : 3 years of inclusion and 3 years of follow-up at least\""

Samples are analyzed by the laboratories of anatomopathology of the\n             hospitals where the patients are diagnosed. These points make the histological data\n             bases reliable and allow clearly identifying cases of anal ain3 retrospectively since\n             2000.\n\n        Taking in account the number and quality of the units care involved in the study and the\n        way cases are identified, we think our recruitment will be exhaustive in France, to limit\n        selection bias.\n\n        - Patient's non opposition to study\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  history of anal carcinoma without any history of anal AIN3 lesion\n\n          -  impossible follow-up for the duration of the study (3 years or more)\n\n          -  patient aged under 18"
