  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiomyopathy in children is a serious disease which can result in death, disability, heart
      transplantation or serious heart rhythm disorders. Doctors know little about the causes of
      cardiomyopathy but would like to learn more. In fact, up to 50-75% of cases in children have
      no known cause. For this reason, the purpose of this study is to identify genes that cause
      cardiomyopathy or that influence how people with cardiomyopathy do over time. These findings
      could improve disease prevention, surveillance, early management, and prognosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric cardiomyopathy is a heterogeneous genetic disease with high morbidity and
      mortality in which children often present with fulminant disease leading to death or
      transplant. The long-term goal of this project is to identify the genetic basis of
      cardiomyopathy and to correlate these findings with clinical phenotypes for risk
      stratification. These findings could improve disease prevention, surveillance, early
      management, and prognosis.

      The specific aims of this study are:

        1. To identify the disease-causing and disease-associated genetic variants underlying
           pediatric cardiomyopathy in a carefully phenotyped cohort.

        2. To identify genotype-phenotype correlations that allow for risk stratification and
           improve management and therapy.

      Exome sequencing will be used as part of a tiered genetic analysis in a large cohort of up
      to 700 pediatric cardiomyopathy subjects with systolic (dilated cardiomyopathy) or diastolic
      (hypertrophic or restrictive cardiomyopathy) dysfunction.  The  biological parent(s) of
      enrolled participants will also be approached about participating and providing a blood
      sample for genetic testing.  In addition to the parent(s), the participants siblings and
      other relatives may also be approached regarding enrollment, based on the pedigree and
      family history.

      This study will significantly increase our understanding of pediatric cardiomyopathy by
      defining the prevalence of mutations in genes known to cause cardiomyopathy as well as
      identifying novel disease-causing genes in the pediatric population. Genetic association
      tests will identify variants that modify disease.  Novel bioinformatics and systems biology
      applications for interpretation of exome level genetic information will contribute
      fundamental knowledge and technical innovation to the translation of genomic data to
      clinical utility. These aims will provide critical genetic architecture data, identify
      variants with large effects, and enable genotype-phenotype correlations necessary for
      advancing management and therapy.

      The Study will have two components: 1) clinical data collection by chart review and family
      interview, and 2) biospecimen collection and genetic testing.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient is alive. (except samples from deceased relatives who have consented    for
             testing).Patients who are status-post heart transplant are eligible if pre-transplant
             longitudinal data are available.

          -  Under age 18 years at the time of diagnosis of either primary or idiopathic dilated,
