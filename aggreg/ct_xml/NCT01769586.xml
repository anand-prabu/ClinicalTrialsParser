  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are undergoing colonoscopy and are not adequately sedated after initial
      standard sedation with midazolam 5 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg will be randomly assigned to
      receive diphenhydramine vs. continued midazolam, and their level of sedation will be
      assessed.  Our hypothesis is that diphenhydramine will provide better sedation than
      continued administration of midazolam during colonoscopy in patients not achieving adequate
      sedation with standard doses of midazolam plus fentanyl.

    <textblock>
      Patients who are undergoing colonoscopy and are not adequately sedated after initial
      standard sedation with midazolam 5 mg and fentanyl 100 mcg will be randomly assigned to
      receive diphenhydramine (up to 3 incremental doses of 25 mcg each) vs. continued midazolam
      (up to 3 incremental doses of 1.5 mg each).  the level of sedation will be assessed using
      the MOAA/S scale 2-3 minutes after each administration to determine if they are sufficiently
      sedated to begin colonoscopy.  The patient, the healthcare team involved in performing the
      endoscopy, and the investigator assessing sedation will be blinded to the therapy.  Our
      hypothesis is that diphenhydramine will provide better sedation than continued
      administration of midazolam during colonoscopy in patients not achieving adequate sedation
      with standard doses of midazolam plus fentanyl.
