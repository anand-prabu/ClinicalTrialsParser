  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder anterior dislocation is a major disease entity in emergency department. There are
      more than 10 reduction methods that have been reported. Traditional reduction methods
      require sedatives, which could cause adverse effects on the patients such as respiratory
      suppression and allergy. There are some reduction maneuvers reported recently which do not
      need sedatives prior to performing reduction, including FARES method and SPASO method. So
      far, there are no well-designed study to compare these two methods. Besides, in clinical
      experience, we found that combining these two methods could even get higher successful
      reduction rate. This study is aimed to compare these two methods as a prospective randomized
      design, and furthermore, to show that combining these two methods could get higher
      successful reduction rate.
