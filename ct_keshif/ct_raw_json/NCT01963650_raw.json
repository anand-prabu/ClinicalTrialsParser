The estimated\n      overall incidence of the disease in the western world is approximately 1 in 100,000 live\n      births.\n\n      This study is a multicenter, observational, longitudinal study that plans to enroll up to 30\n      patients with onset of MLD-related signs and symptoms prior to 30 months of age and who are\n      less than 12 years of age. Patients will participate in this study for approximately 114\n      weeks (Screening through Follow-up) and will be assessed at defined intervals for disease\n      status."

A GMFM-88 total (percent) score greater than or equal to 15 at the screening\n             examination.\n\n          4. The patient is less than 12 years of age at the time of enrollment.\n\n          5. The patient and his/her parent or legally authorized representative(s) must have the\n             ability to comply with the clinical protocol.\n\n          6.

The patient has any known or suspected hypersensitivity to agents used for anesthesia\n             or is thought to be at an unacceptably high risk for associated potential\n             complications of airway compromise or other conditions.\n\n          3.
