    <textblock>
      Many studies reveal that infliximab (IFX, an immunoglobulin gamma-1 antibody)can response
      well to  Crohn's Disease(CD) patients who are intolerant of corticosteroids and
      immunosuppressant,or steroids-dependent .More over,A complex fistula in CD is an indication
      for early IFX therapy in conjunction with surgical drainage.Some papers claim that IFX may
      prevent enterectomy CD patients from relapsing. Those with risk factors which  at diagnosis
      associated  with &quot; disabling disease &quot;include age &lt; 40 years, initial need for steroid
      therapy, and the presence of perianal disease are recommended to use IFX early.

      IFX is approved by State Food And Drug Administration(SFDA) in 2007 ,but the safety is still
      controversial by then.Some studies  proclaim that the side effect may be infections,acute
      infusion reactions,anaphylactic reactions,autoimmunity,drug-induced lupus,congestive heart
      failure,abortion and demyelination,etc.

      So some problems still need to be settled as follows:1)all the the infliximab dates are from
      other countries,there is rare date from the Chinese,especially the large quantity of random
      controlled studies and the CD patients with enterectomy.2)despite of the large number of
      databases from the international ,when to stop and the predictor of the response is still
      obscure.3)The high cost of IFX may hinder its applications,especially for the moderate to
      severe active CD patients who take mesalazine and/or immunosuppressant to maintain
      remission.In addition,the pathogenic age segments in the occurence of CD: from 15~ 50 years
      old ,so they suffer from the disability of self-improvements.

      The main object of the clinical trial is to complete the database of Chinese CD patients
      ,especially the safety and efficacy of IFX and those with enterectomy.Then we can record the
      clinical manifestations of the moderate to severe CD patients with the use of IFX or
      conventional drugs,including the dose,course and Concomitant treatment.We can also study the
      predictor and the appropriate time to stop using IFX .We can make the mode of cost-benefit
      help the patients choose the best project.
