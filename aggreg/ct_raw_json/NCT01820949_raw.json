The frequency of these events will be\n      compared between PBM and control cohort stratified by center with a one-sided\n      Mantel-Haenszel test in a non-inferiority setting with significance level of \u03b1=2.5% and a\n      non-inferiority margin of 1% for the incidence of the composite endpoint."
