            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine if a new type of mechanical ventilation, or\n      breathing machine (called neurally adjusted ventilatory assist or  NAVA), will provide\n      additional support to infants who were born prematurely. Investigators are looking to\n      determine if in two hours infants who weighed less than 1500 grams or 3 pounds 5 ounces,\n      will demonstrate a decrease in the amount of carbon dioxide (the gas that humans exhale)\n      dissolved in their blood as compared to prior to starting the study. This will be\n      accomplished by enrolling infants who are stable on their current type of mechanical\n      breathing that provides a constant air flow into the infant. This type of mechanical support\n      helps keep the lungs inflated but does not help remove carbon dioxide. This study will\n      change the type of mechanical support to a type of support called neurally adjusted\n      ventilatory assist or NAVA. This type of mechanical support detects when the infant is\n      breathing in by having electrical sensors on a feeding tube that is placed into the stomach\n      through the nose or mouth. These electrical sensors detect when the diaphragm or the muscle\n      that helps humans breath is trying to take a breath in. When the NAVA ventilator senses the\n      attempt to breath, it provides additional air flow to make the effort of breathing easier.\n      The ventilator will be attached to a tube or cannula that is placed into the infant's nose.\n      After two hours of being on the NAVA ventilator a repeat measure of carbon dioxide in the\n      blood will be performed by taking a small amount of blood from the infant's heel."
