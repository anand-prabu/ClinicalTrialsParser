    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study will evaluate the safety and anti-tumor
      activity of DCDS4501A in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamid e, doxorubicin and
      prednisone in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Cohort of patients will receive
      escalating doses of DCDS4501A intravenously every 3 weeks in combination with standard doses
      of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and oral prednisone. Patients will be treated
      for a total of six or eight cycles in accordance with local institutional practice.

             dimension

          -  Life expectancy of at least 24 weeks

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1, or 2

          -  Adequate hematologic function (unless inadequate function is due to underlying
             disease, as established by extensive bone marrow involvement or is due to
             hypersplenism secondary to the involvement of the spleen by lymphoma per the
             investigator)

        Dose-Escalation Portion of the Study:

          -  No more than one prior systemic treatment regimen for B-cell NHL (single agent
             anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody therapy will not be counted as a prior treatment
             regimen)

          -  No prior treatment with anthracyclines

          -  Current Grade &gt; 1 peripheral neuropathy, with the exception of pre-phase treatment
             with prednisone/prednisolone

          -  Ongoing corticosteroid use of &gt; 30 mg/day of prednisone/prednisolone or equivalent.

             at least 4 weeks' duration before Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Primary CNS lymphoma

          -  History of other malignancy that could affect compliance with the protocol or
             interpretation of results Patients with a history of curatively treated basal or
             squamous cell carcinoma or melanoma of the skin or in situ carcinoma of the cervix

        Patients with a malignancy that has been treated with surgery alone with curative intent
        will also be excluded unless the malignancy has been in documented remission without
        treatment for &gt;/= 5 years before enrollment.

          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases, including renal disease
             that would preclude chemotherapy administration, or pulmonary disease (including
             obstructive pulmonary disease and history of bronchospasm)

          -  Significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart Association Class III or
             IV cardiac disease, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction within the
             previous 6 months, unstable arrhythmias, or unstable angina)

          -  Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, parasitic, or other infection
             (excluding fungal infections of nail beds) at study enrollment or any major episode
             of infection requiring treatment with IV antibiotics or hospitalization (relating to
             the completion of the course of antibiotics) within 4 weeks before Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Clinically significant history of liver disease, including viral or other hepatitis,
             current alcohol abuse, or cirrhosis

          -  Positive for hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection
