Participants will be recruited in 2 cohorts. The 6 participants in the\n      first cohort were dosed in error with doses less than 1000 mg. So, an additional cohort of 4\n      participants will be enrolled to receive a single oral dose of 1000 mg 14C-JNJ 26489112.\n      Total 10 participants will receive the study medication. Safety will be assessed by\n      monitoring vital signs, physical examinations, electrocardiograms, and clinical laboratory\n      tests throughout the study. The total duration of the study for each participant will be\n      approximately 5 weeks (including up to 3 weeks for screening and 11 to 15 days of study) or\n      up to 1 additional week for participants who excrete 14C-JNJ26489112 more slowly."
