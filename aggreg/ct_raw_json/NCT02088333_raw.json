The mCRC\n      intervention will include a tablet-based patient education program, clinic protocols to\n      facilitate the ordering of CRC screening tests, and electronic messaging with patients to\n      promote screening.  The investigators hypothesize that participants randomized to mCRC will\n      be more likely to complete screening compared with those randomized to the control arm of\n      the study.  Additionally, the investigators hypothesize mCRC will increase several\n      intermediate outcomes (such as knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and test ordering) which will\n      predict completion of screening.  Lastly, the investigators hypothesize the mCRC\n      intervention will add little to the overall cost of screening."
