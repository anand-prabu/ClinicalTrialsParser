The sessions were developed for delivery by a family physician, two family medicine residents, and a nutritionist, who received training in positive psychology and resilience skills.  All children were measured on the same dates, but children were randomly assigned to two cohorts, beginning 6 months apart, to facilitate statistical analysis by having one group experience \"normal growth\" on study prior to intervention."

Led by physicians and young adults, the 12 weekly 90 minute sessions provide hands\n      on experiences that connect into the participants' daily lives.  In the study, the families\n      were divided into two groups, beginning their classes 6 months apart.  Body measurements\n      were taken at baseline and every 4 months to 16 months."

The targeted lifestyle components of the intervention\n      are less TV viewing, less sweetened beverages, smaller food portions, less fast food/better\n      choices away from home and more general physical activity.  The psychosocial component was\n      based in Resiliency; the Choices model focused on a non-judgmental approach to empowerment\n      in relation to personal goals and knowledge of the basics of nutrition and physical\n      activity.\n\n      Our aim was to recruit 35-40 children (approximately equal boys and girls) ages 8-11 and\n      their parents for a 12 weekly sessions group office visit program.  Participants were\n      randomized into 2 groups; one group starting in March 2006 and the lagged intervention\n      control group starting in September 2006.  Physical measurements and data collection were at\n      baseline, 4, 8, 12, 16 months from randomization.\n\n      We evaluated the acceptability and feasibility of the group office visit model and effect\n      size (body mass index (BMI) and weight-for-age Z-scores).  Feasibility and acceptability\n      included ability to recruit within clinics, attendance, completion, follow-up rates, focus\n      groups data and interviews of those who drop out.  Evaluation of effect size included the\n      patterns of growth over 15 months from baseline in relation to expected growth patterns and\n      intervention exposure."
