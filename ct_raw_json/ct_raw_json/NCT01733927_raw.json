Group 1 consisted of 344 participants who did not know their HIV status; Group 2 consisted of 153 participants who were previously confirmed to be HIV positive. The participants were instructed to obtain their own oral fluid sample using the testing devices provide by the OQA rapid test kits.  Project team members, certified to interpret OQA results, registered each test outcome on a data form using the same code number that the participant was assigned for the ELISA test."

            "textblock": "Human Immunodeficiency Virus /Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome (HIV/AIDS) continues to be\n      one of the most devastating worldwide pandemics. In response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic, the\n      Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in 2010, urged countries to improve access to\n      HIV/AIDS testing and counseling in an effort to increase the number of people who know their\n      HIV status, thereby attempting to decrease transmission and increase treatment. Thus, an\n      effective country response is to increase voluntary testing and counseling, particularly\n      among at-risk populations.  Ensuring patients receive their test results is an essential\n      component of these efforts.\n\n      Chile, since 1991, has seen an increase of notified cases of HIV/ AIDS among certain regions\n      of the country. The Chilean government offers free screening for HIV using only the ELISA\n      test.  In addition, many Chileans fail to return to receive their test results, as do many\n      other individuals worldwide. In the United States, the Center for Disease Control reported\n      that when using the \"gold standard of HIV testing\" (the ELISA) 30% of people with negative\n      results and 39% of people with positive results do not return for their test results.\n\n      In Western counties, as well as several Latin American countries, the use of rapid testing\n      technology to identify HIV 1 and 2 has increased the percentage of people who learn their\n      serological status when compared with those who are tested using the traditional ELISA\n      method.  Neither the rapid test nor ELISA yield a definitive diagnosis, so further\n      confirmation testing is required using the Western Blot to rule out the possibility of a\n      false positive result.  Nonetheless, by providing quick turn-around,  rapid testing helps to\n      facilitate individuals receiving their initial test results, thereby  increasing the their\n      probability of being quickly  referred to appropriate health services for confirmatory\n      testing and treatment.\n\n      Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) currently has approved six different rapid\n      tests for clinical use to detect HIV 1 and 2, the OraQuick Advance Rapid Assessment (OQA) is\n      the only one that is administered orally.\n\n      OQA testing can be conducted in geographical locations where laboratory facilities capable\n      of performing ELISA assays are unavailable.   Thus, HIV screening programs that adopt OQA\n      can extend their reach far beyond previous locations.\n\n      Despite OQA's growing success and popularity in many different settings globally, Chile has\n      yet to accept OQA or any rapid testing as a viable alternative to ELISA testing.  The\n      Chilean government has delayed approval for the adoption of OQA pending additional evidence\n      among Chileans that it offers a more advantageous alternative to ELISA testing with equal\n      specificity."
