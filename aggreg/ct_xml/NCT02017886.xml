  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the effect of daily ingestion of the probiotic Lactobacillus reuteri on the
      levels of secretory IgA in saliva of healthy young adults.

  <detailed_description>

      Study design: A randomized, double-blind, cross-over design separated by three weeks run-in
      and wash-out periods. Each intervention period is three weeks and the participants are
      allocated to the test and placebo regimes in a randomized order.

      Material: 40 healthy adults are enrolled after informed consent from the School of
      Dentistry, University of Copenhagen.

      Methods: Samples of resting, unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva
      (SWS) are collected five times during the study period. The samples are immediately frozen
      in 0.5 ml aliquots.

      Intervention: The subjects are instructed to ingest two tablets containing Lactobacillus
      reuteri or placebo, twice daily for 3 weeks. No probiotic food or health products are
      allowed during the intervention period. All normal oral hygiene routines should be
      maintained during the entire study. The compliance is checked through interviews. Any
      perceived side effects are reported without delay to the research staff.

      Endpoints: The concentration of total protein and secretory IgA in saliva are determined
      with the enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).

      Scientific importance: The study may provide evidence that probiotic supplements can
      influence the innate defense system in the whole saliva which may open up for novel
      strategies to combat oral diseases.
