Patients were stratified\n      according to age: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. The spinal component\n      of the anesthetic was established by bolus administration of up-and-down doses of 0.75%\n      plain bupivacaine, determined by Dixon's method. The degree of motor block after intrathecal\n      administration of each concentration was evaluated by the modified Bromage and Hip motor\n      function score. The EC50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the method of\n      Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Other endpoints were included on the basis of\n      sensory block level, duration of motor blockade, hypotension, and vasopressor requirements."
