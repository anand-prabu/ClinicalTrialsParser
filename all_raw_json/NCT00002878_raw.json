Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining\n      PSC 833 with chemotherapy may reduce resistance to the drug, and allow more tumor cells to\n      be killed. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus PSC 833 is more\n      effective than combination chemotherapy alone in treating patients with relapsed or\n      refractory multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without PSC 833 in treating patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma."

Patients are stratified by response to\n      prior treatment, prior doxorubicin and/or vincristine, prior autologous peripheral blood\n      stem cell transplantation, and center.\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:\n\n        -  Arm I: The first group receives vincristine, doxorubicin, and dexamethasone (VAD).\n           Patients receive higher dose vincristine IV over 96 hours and higher dose doxorubicin\n           IV over 96 hours on days 1-4 and oral dexamethasone daily on days 1-4 and 15-18.\n\n        -  Arm II: The second group receives VAD plus oral PSC 833. Patients receive oral PSC 833\n           every 6 hours beginning on day 1 and continuing for 20 doses. Patients receive lower\n           dose vincristine IV over 96 hours and lower dose doxorubicin IV over 96 hours on days\n           2-5 and oral dexamethasone daily on days 2-5 and 16-19.\n\n      Treatment in both arms repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 2 courses, patients are reevaluated, and those\n      with stable or responding disease continue treatment for 2 courses beyond maximum response.\n      Doxorubicin is discontinued in patients who receive a maximum lifetime dose but still have\n      stable or responding disease.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients will be accrued for this study over approximately\n      20 months."
