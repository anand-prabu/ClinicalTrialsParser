  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a one-time injection of allogeneic
      mesenchymal bone marrow cells is safe and beneficial in the treatment of chronic skin aging
      and photodamage on the face.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been isolated from a number of sources, including bone
      marrow, adipose tissue, and peripheral blood.  The MSCs manufactured for this study are a
      subset of non-hematopoietic stem cells derived from the bone marrow of healthy, adult
      donors. These cells have the ability to migrate to areas of injury in the body and can
      differentiate into multiple cell types, including cutaneous cells. In addition to
      contributing directly to repair of the skin by replacing damaged cells, MSCs also stimulate
      the body's own cells to regenerate.

      Though an increasing number of patients are seeking remedies for photoaged skin, current
      treatments, ranging from topical medications to laser peels, are not ideal methods for
      addressing the medical need. Because MSCs have been shown in clinical and non-clinical
      applications to be useful in wound healing, it is also possible that the cells will have a
      similar effect in skin rejuvenation.

      In the present study, we will determine the efficacy and safety of intravenously delivered
      MSCs in otherwise healthy patients with significant photodamage.

             abnormality that in the judgment of the Investigator or Sponsor for which
             participation in the study would pose a safety risk to the subject

          -  Participation in another study with an investigational drug or device within 3 months
             prior to stem cell administration
