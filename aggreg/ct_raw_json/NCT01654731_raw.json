            "textblock": "Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is a chronic cholestatic liver disease that eventually leads\n      to end-stage liver failure and death unless liver transplantation (LT) is performed.\n      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) administered orally at the daily dose of 13-15 mg/kg is\n      currently the only drug approved for the treatment of PBC. UDCA consistently improves\n      biochemical liver tests, prolongs survival without LT, and delays histological progression\n      as well as the occurrence of portal hypertension. However, a significant proportion (40%) of\n      patients treated with UDCA shows an incomplete biochemical response and remains at high risk\n      of death or LT. The development of new treatments in combination with UDCA is therefore\n      needed. Several candidates exist among which is Bezafibrate. Bezafibrate belongs to the\n      fibrates' pharmacological class, which has been developed 4 decades ago for the treatment of\n      mixed hyperlipidaemia. Bezafibrate is cheap, widely available and well tolerated. There is\n      now a substantial body of circumstantial evidence supporting that fibrates, and Bezafibrate\n      in particular, are well tolerated and can improve biochemical liver tests in patients with\n      PBC with incomplete response to UDCA. However, despite several positive successful pilot\n      studies, there are still no phase 3 randomized placebo-controlled trials of fibrates for the\n      treatment of PBC. The purpose of this protocol is therefore to conduct such a trial in a\n      selected population of patients with PBC based on an incomplete biochemical response after 6\n      months of UDCA therapy."
