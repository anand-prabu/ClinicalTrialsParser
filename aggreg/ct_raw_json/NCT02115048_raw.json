Low ER expression will be defined as tumor sample with\n      H-score below 160 (Finn, 2009).\n\n      All subjects who consented for the study must submit a tumor sample to the designated\n      central laboratory for central confirmation of ER / Progesterone receptor (PR) and HER2\n      statuses and determination of the H-score. This will be assessed prior to randomization.\n\n      Subjects with HER2 negative, ER+ advanced breast cancer with low ER expression defined as\n      H-score between 1 and 159 will enter screening phase and perform the required screening\n      assessments.\n\n      Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio and stratified according to sites\n      of disease (bone only disease vs. other) and prior administration of hormonal therapy in\n      neo/adjuvant setting (Yes vs. No) to either:\n\n      Arm A : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg until progression of disease or any\n      other study treatment discontinuation criteria.\n\n      or Arm B : Continuous regimen of oral letrozole 2.5 mg daily plus oral afatinib 30 mg daily\n      until progression of disease or any other study treatment discontinuation criteria.\n\n      Once the subject is discontinued from study treatment and has undergone the End of Treatment\n      visit, the subject will enter in the follow-up phase.\n\n      A total of 150 subjects, 75 per arm, will be randomized over an estimated period of 18\n      months."
