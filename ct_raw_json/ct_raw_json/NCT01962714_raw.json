We hypothesize that Veterans randomized to LKM will report mean reductions in\n      PTSD and depressive symptom severity that are not meaningfully worse than CPT-C. We further\n      hypothesize that reductions in posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs will more strongly mediate\n      PTSD and depressive symptom improvement for those assigned to CPT-C than those assigned to\n      LKM."

In the\n      proposed project 170 Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to LKM or CPT-C.  Comprehensive\n      assessments will be performed at baseline as well as at the end of the 12-week interventions\n      and 3 and 6 months later.  PTSD symptoms, depression, posttraumatic maladaptive cognitions\n      and self-compassion will be assessed weekly during the treatment phase to assess temporality\n      of change and to assess mediators of outcomes."
