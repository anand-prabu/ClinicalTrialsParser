Only samples that are collected via peripheral venipuncture\n      may be included in this study. The ISDD will be compared to current laboratory practices for\n      the collection of blood for culture purposes.  Laboratory Standard Procedures (LSP) is\n      defined as collection of venipuncture blood for culture without an initial diversion method\n      to divert and sequester potential blood contaminants."
