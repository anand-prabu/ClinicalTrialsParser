            "textblock": "The overall goal is to determine the changes that occur in amyloid-beta (A\u03b2) metabolism in\n      Alzheimer's disease (AD) and model the production, transport, metabolism and clearance of A\u03b2\n      in the human central nervous system (CNS) and periphery to improve clinical trial designs\n      and also possibly develop an AD blood test.\n\n      Clearance of brain A\u03b2 occurs by enzymatic digestion (e.g. Insulin Degrading Enzyme,\n      Neprilysin, etc.), cellular uptake and breakdown, transport across the blood-brain-barrier,\n      and transport from the brain to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and then to blood.  However, the\n      relationship between CNS A\u03b2 and blood A\u03b2 is not known in humans and only partly understood\n      in other animals. The goal is to determine the kinetics of A\u03b2 in the CNS and blood to test\n      the hypothesis that altered A\u03b2 kinetics in the CNS in AD is associated with altered blood A\u03b2\n      labeling kinetics.  Understanding blood and CSF A\u03b2 kinetics will contribute to a better\n      understanding of A\u03b2 production, transport, and breakdown within and between the brain, CSF\n      and blood compartments.  These fundamental measurements of A\u03b2 kinetics in AD will help\n      determine the effects of peripheral A\u03b2 metabolism on pathophysiologic changes in AD. This\n      information will provide key insights into whole body A\u03b2 metabolism and will be useful for\n      understanding the causes of AD.  Further, these results may lead to a specific blood\n      biomarker for AD.\n\n      Aim 1. To determine blood A\u03b2 isoform SILK (stable isotope-linked kinetics) using existing\n      steady state infusion labeled blood samples from amyloid positive and amyloid negative\n      control participants.  Blood A\u03b2 kinetics will be compared to CSF A\u03b2 kinetics and combined\n      utilizing multi-compartment and structural models to determine the direction and magnitude\n      of transport and breakdown.\n\n      Current labeling methods employ a primed continuous infusion which labels A\u03b2 to near\n      steady-state.  In order to provide additional kinetic information on A\u03b2 kinetics and\n      potentially better distinguish AD from controls, an alternative pulse labeling protocol is\n      proposed.  In addition to providing clearer information on A\u03b2 transport and clearance, the\n      simplified labeling method makes blood A\u03b2 kinetics feasible as a clinical test for treatment\n      trials or as a diagnostic test.\n\n      Aim 2. To perform pulse bolus labeling in amyloid positive and amyloid negative controls and\n      measure CSF A\u03b2 isoform kinetics and blood A\u03b2 isoform kinetics. Participants will be\n      recruited to complete a pulse labeling study.  Results from Aim 2 will be incorporated into\n      complimentary models with results from Aim 1 and ongoing studies to provide measures of A\u03b2\n      production, transport, and breakdown within and between the brain, CSF and blood\n      compartments.\n\n      Approach: Based on preliminary data and published studies, the hypothesis will be tested\n      that blood A\u03b2 isoform kinetics are disrupted in AD and to model the A\u03b2 production, transport\n      and clearance between the brain and periphery. The data from these studies will be useful to\n      model the production, transport and breakdown of A\u03b2 throughout the human body.\n\n      Results of these aims will be utilized in complimentary modeling approaches and combined\n      with the results of prior studies to provide a comprehensive model of in vivo A\u03b2 kinetics in\n      both the human CNS and periphery.  The data and models will be able to confirm and exclude\n      current hypotheses of human A\u03b2 metabolism.  The goals of the aims are to determine the CNS\n      A\u03b2 isoform kinetics with a pulse labeling protocol (Aim 1), and to determine the peripheral\n      blood A\u03b2 isoform kinetics with a pulse labeling protocol (Aim 2).\n\n      Experimental Design:  A pulse labeling protocol with twenty participants will be completed\n      to simplify labeling. Pulse labeling experiments will provide additional kinetics results to\n      determine A\u03b2 kinetic models. Then sixty participants will be re-enrolled that have completed\n      prior intravenous steady-state labeling A\u03b2 SILK studies.  All participants will have had a\n      PET/PIB scan completed for fibrillar amyloid deposition measurements or CSF A\u03b242\n      concentration measurements.\n\n      Clinical Study:  A single pulse dose of leucine will be given at the beginning of the study\n      and blood and/or CSF will be collected for 24-36 hours.\n\n      Data Analysis:  We will compare the pulse labeling blood A\u03b2 SILK results of the amyloid\n      positive vs. amyloid negative control group for A\u03b238, A\u03b240, A\u03b242, and ratios of isoforms vs.\n      tests of amyloidosis such as PET/PIB scan and/or CSF A\u03b242 concentration."
