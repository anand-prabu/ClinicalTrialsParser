The behavioral intervention will be\n      assigned at the level of the site, which include Many Men, Many Voices (3MV) and\n      Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC).  Subjects will first complete the behavioral\n      intervention offered at their respective site and then be provided with open label\n      emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF) (Truvada\u00ae) as PrEP.  Behavioral and biomedical data will\n      be collected at baseline and 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks.  Any subjects who become HIV\n      infected during the course of the study will be discontinued from the study agent and\n      followed for an additional 24 weeks after the study visit at which HIV infection is\n      confirmed.  Those subjects who meet specific bone or renal criteria at the Week 48 visit or\n      the 24-Week HIV Seropositive visit will be followed for an additional 48 weeks in the\n      Extension Phase to more closely monitor longer-term outcome of potential concerns."
