The defined\n      population comprises low income, less educated smokers who will vary in their level of\n      motivation to quit smoking. Patients will be randomly assigned within clinics to one of two\n      interventions (a) Nicotine patch prescription plus brief physician advice (minimal care);\n      and (b) Nicotine patch prescription plus brief physician advice, with the addition of a\n      tailored motivational intervention, a behavioral skills counseling session for smoking\n      cessation."
