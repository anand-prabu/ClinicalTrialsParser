  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is the commonest cause of severe infection and meningitis in
      babies under 3 months in the United Kingdom (UK). About one in ten babies with GBS infection
      die and half of babies with GBS meningitis are left with long term problems with their
      development.

      Vaccinating pregnant women against GBS in order to protect their newborn babies is a
      promising area of research.However, many women are reluctant to accept vaccination during
      pregnancy for fear it will harm their unborn child and there is often a lack of
      understanding of both the vaccine and the condition it aims to prevent. Nevertheless, the
      recent positive experience of immunisation against pertussis in the United Kingdom, suggest
      that antenatal immunisation can be acceptable.

      Previous research has shown that advice from maternity healthcare professionals regarding
      vaccination is highly valued by pregnant women so it is also important to explore the
      attitudes and opinions of this group.

      The objective of this study is to assess the knowledge and attitudes of pregnant women and
      maternity healthcare professionals in England and Scotland regarding GBS disease and the
      acceptability of a potential vaccine.

      There are two parts to this study. The first part will invite pregnant women, maternity
      healthcare professionals and parents who have had a child affected by GBS disease to take
      part in either a focus group or an individual interview.

      This will allow for an in-depth exploration of the participants thoughts and opinions about
      GBS and vaccination in pregnancy. This part of the study will take place at the Oxford site
      only. The results will guide the development of a self completed, paper questionnaire which
      will be distributed to a wider range of pregnant women and maternity healthcare
      professionals across four different study sites.

      This study has been funded by Meningitis UK. Additional collaborators to those listed
      include the charity Group B Strep Support.
