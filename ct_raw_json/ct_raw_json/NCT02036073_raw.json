            "textblock": "Periventricular leukomalacia (PVL) is one of the most common brain injuries that occur in\n      preterm infants, which is related with the development of cerebral palsy. The current\n      therapy is only supportive to maintain the live sign stable.  There is no effective\n      therapeutic strategy for preterm brain injury. Erythropoietin (EPO) has been shown to be\n      protective against hypoxic-ischemic and inflammatory injuries in animal models of brain\n      injury, and clinical trials of neonatal hypoxic ischemic brain injury.  Furthermore,\n      recombinant human Epo (rhEpo) has been widely used in preterm infants to prevent or treat\n      the anemia of prematurity during the past decade. It has been considered to be safe and well\n      tolerated in preterm infants. However, there is no conclusion yet if the EPO has the effect\n      to prevent preterm brain injury. The purpose of the study was whether the rhEpo (500 U/kg)\n      given to very preterm infants (gestation age < 32 weeks) within 24h after birth and\n      subsequently each other day for2 week possesses neuroprotective properties. Very preterm\n      infants with gestational age of < 32 weeks and admit to our NICU are eligible for\n      enrollment. After informed consent is obtained, infants will be randomly assigned to either\n      EPO group or vehicle group. The primary short-term outcome measures are brain injury\n      (intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and periventricular leukomalacia (PVL)) and ROP. The long\n      term outcomes are whether rhEpo in very preterm infants finally improves neurodevelopmental\n      outcome at 18 months corrected age."
