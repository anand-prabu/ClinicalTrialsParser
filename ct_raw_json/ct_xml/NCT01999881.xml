    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies exercise intervention in improving quality of
      life and exercise capacity and reducing inflammation and oxidative stress in patients with
      lung cancer and their support persons. Exercise therapy may help improve quality of life,
      may increase exercise capacity, and may reduce inflammation and oxidative stress in patients
      with lung cancer and their supporters.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of an eight-week exercise intervention on biomarkers of
      inflammation, oxidative stress, exercise capacity, and quality of life in lung cancer
      patients.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the effect of an eight-week exercise intervention on markers of stress and
      quality of life in the support person of lung cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM A: Patients and their support persons undergo a supervised combined aerobic exercise
      comprising walking, cycling, or video-based aerobics and strength training using resistance
      bands for 40 minutes 2 days a week at the University of Wisconsin Hospital and Clinic (UWHC)
      and 3 days a week at home over 8 weeks.

      ARM B: Patients and their support persons undergo the usual care over 8 weeks.

             prevent participation in an exercise program at the discretion of the study physician

          -  LUNG CANCER PATIENTS: Cognitive or reading impairments that would preclude them from
             completing questionnaires

          -  LUNG CANCER PATIENTS: Current participation in an exercise program

          -  SUPPORT PERSONS: Symptomatic heart disease including congestive heart failure or
