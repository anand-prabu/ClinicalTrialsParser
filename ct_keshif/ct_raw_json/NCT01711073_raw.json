Delivery\n      of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) has been shown in animal models and limited clinical trials\n      to result in improved liver disease (MELD) score.\n\n      In preclinical studies we have demonstrated that the combination of G-CSF plus Mozobil can\n      effectively mobilize both hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and MSCs into the peripheral\n      circulation. While G-CSF only mobilizes HSCs.\n\n      The clinical trial will test the safety of treating patients with end stage liver disease\n      with G-CSF and Mozobil to mobilize MSCs into the peripheral circulation."
