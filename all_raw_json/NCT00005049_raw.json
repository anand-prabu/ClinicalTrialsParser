Combining more than one drug and giving them by intraperitoneal\n      infusion may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of intraperitoneal combination\n      chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage III ovarian epithelial cancer or\n      gastrointestinal cancer."

Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4-6 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 and 6 weeks, then at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
