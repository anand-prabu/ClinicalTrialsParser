Especially the results in the split-thickness skin graft donor\n      site, which is regarded as an excellent model for any kind of superficial wounds in human\n      skin, suggest that Oleogel-S10 should be efficacious and safe in treatment of grade 2a\n      burns.\n\n      The present Phase III clinical trial in grade 2a burns is initiated in order to measure the\n      wound healing progress applying objective methods, i.e., the time to healing and the grade\n      of epithelialization of the wound.\n\n      In this study, grade 2a burn wounds are separated into two halves: Following wound cleaning\n      and disinfection, wounds are separated into two wound halves. Randomly assigned, one wound\n      half receives Oleogel-S10 ointment, the other wound half standard of care treatment.\n\n      Wound healing progress is documented by photos which are assessed by expert reviewers\n      blinded to the treatment of the wound halves."
