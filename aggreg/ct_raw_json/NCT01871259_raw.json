Before surgery, patients will be asked to complete a\n      STOP-questionnaire. The eRDI will be calculated using the modified Mallampati's grade,\n      tonsil grade, and the body mass index. After performing spinal anaesthesia, propofol will be\n      infused and adjusted to BIS 70-75. An ApneaLinkTM, which measures airflow through a nasal\n      cannula, will be then applied to estimate the level of apnea-hypopnea."
