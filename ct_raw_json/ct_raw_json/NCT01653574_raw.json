The investigators' phase I study has shown that the drug's toxicity is manageable and\n      the recommended phase II dose is 25 mg. The hypothesis of this clinical research study is to\n      discover if the study drug Famitinib Malate can shrink or slow the growth of pretreated\n      HER2-negative breast cancer. The safety of Famitinib Malate will also be studied. Patients\n      physical state, symptoms, changes in the size of the tumor, and laboratory findings obtained\n      while on-study will help the research team decide if Famitinib Malate is safe and effective\n      in pretreated HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer patients."
