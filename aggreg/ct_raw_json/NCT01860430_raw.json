Patients with chronic Hepatitis B or hepatitis C infections are\n             excluded because of potential effects on immune function and/ or drug interactions,\n             as well as the potential for confounded interpretation of immune-related adverse\n             events such as hepatic inflammation occurring on protocol.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because ipilimumab may have the potential\n             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.
