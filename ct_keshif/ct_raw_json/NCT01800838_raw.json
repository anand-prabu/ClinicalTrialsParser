Determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that can be utilized for a single\n      treatment of Pc 4-PDT (silicon phthalocyanine 4 photo dynamic therapy) on subjects with\n      mycosis fungoides (MF)/cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) stage IA-IIA, by evaluating an\n      accelerated dose escalation protocol consisting of a single exposure to PDT using\n      topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a wavelength of 675 nm, followed by assessment\n      of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort I)\n\n      II. Determine safety and tolerability of repeated light (PDT) exposures after a single\n      application of Pc 4 to a MF/CTCL plaque, using topically-applied Pc 4 and visible light at a\n      wavelength of 675nm, followed by assessment of skin biopsies to analyze cellular and\n      molecular changes induced by Pc 4-PDT. (Cohort II)\n\n      III. Identification of targets for assessment of efficacy to assist in planning for a Phase\n      II study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive silicon phthalocyanine 4 topically and then undergo PDT.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, 1 week, 2 weeks,\n      and 30 days."
