The exercise should be\n      applied daily, (minimally,  five days per week) for 6 months. The app contains audios to\n      guide autogenic training, muscle relaxation training and guided imagery. On a daily basis,\n      participants can select one of the three exercises which they want to apply.\n\n      Main outcome measure: The primary outcome is the mean pain intensity after 3 months measured\n      by the daily pain intensity on the NRS."
