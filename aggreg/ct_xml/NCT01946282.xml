  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through this program, The investigators will test a systematic colon cancer screening
      outreach strategy for increasing screening completion among uninsured patients, not
      up-to-date with screening. The intervention will consist of mailed screening invitations,
      with processes such as phone reminders to promote screening and evidence based follow up.
      All patients will be randomly assigned to receive mailed invitations to complete a home
      fecal immunochemical test (FIT).  Some patients will be randomly assigned to receive a small
      financial incentive on completion of FIT testing.
