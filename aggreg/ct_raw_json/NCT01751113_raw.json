The study will utilize a three-way cross-over\n      design with a 2-week wash-out period between each 4-week consecutive treatment period.  The\n      aim is to support the rationale for \"triple combination\" therapy by demonstrating that\n      treatment with both ADOAIR and tiotropium can potentially produce improved, clinically\n      relevant effects compared with either treatment alone.\n\n      This study will utilize a range of lung function measures in order to fully assess the\n      benefits of triple therapy. The primary endpoint will be based on airways conductance\n      measured using plethysmography (sGaw measured over 4hours post dose (AUC 0-4hr) on Day 28).\n      Secondary endpoints will include lung function measures based on plethysmography and\n      spirometry.  The lung function measures will be supported by measurement of the use of\n      relief salbutamol ."
