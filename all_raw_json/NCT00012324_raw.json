Patients are stratified\n      according to CLIP score (0-1 vs 2-3) and Karnofsky performance status (60-70% vs 80-100%).\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive nolatrexed dihydrochloride IV continuously on days 1-5.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin IV on day 1. Treatment continues in both arms\n           every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 446 patients (223 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 12 months."
