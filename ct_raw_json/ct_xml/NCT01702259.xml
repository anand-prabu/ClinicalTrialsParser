  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the application of green diode low level
      laser light therapy is effective in reducing the appearance of cellulite in the thighs and
      buttocks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cellulite is a common term used to describe superficial pockets of trapped fat, which causes
      uneven dimpling or &quot;orange peel&quot; skin. It appears in 90% of post-adolescent women. In
      advanced stages of cellulite, heaviness and pain may occur.

      Currently available treatments for cellulite have minimal to no demonstrable effect and some
      involve risky invasive procedures. Therefore, the potential advantages of the application of
      low level laser light therapy to reduce the appearance of cellulite over current treatment
      options include a risk free procedure that is non-invasive and pain free. Since low level
      laser light within the green spectrum has been proven to increase the synthesis of collagen,
      it is believed that its application may serve to decrease the appearance of cellulite by
      tightening the skin.  Moreover, newly synthesized collagen may alter the irregular pattern
      of the connective tissue responsible for the formation of cellulite.
