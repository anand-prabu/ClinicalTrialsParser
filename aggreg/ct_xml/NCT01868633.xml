  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effectiveness intravenous (IV) dexamethasone when
      used as part of a multimodal regimen to manage post cesarean delivery pain.

      We hypothesize that a single dose of IV dexamethasone administered, as part of a multimodal
      analgesia after spinal anesthesia will significantly reduce post cesarean delivery opioid
      consumption and pain

      After the subjects consent to participate in the study they will be transferred to the
      operating room for their scheduled cesarean delivery. They will have their routine spinal
      anesthesia with the dosages of drugs used standardized, and a standardized regimen to manage
      hypotension. After delivery of the baby the subjects will be administered either the study
      drug or placebo depending on the randomization. The subjects will then be prescribed a
      standard post-operative analgesia regimen. The subjects will then be interviewed at 12,24
      and 48 hours post cesarean delivery. During the interview the subjects will be asked to rate
      their pain, nausea and vomiting and pruritus. They will also be asked to rate their quality
      of recovery from the surgery using Quality of Recovery-40 questionnaire. The subjects will
      be contacted 6 months after the study to rate their pain using a Short-Form McGill Pain
      Questionnaire
