    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cryotherapy is effective in the treatment
      of persistent high grade dysplasia (HGD) or early esophageal adenocarcinoma (IMCA) in
      patients who have not responded to radiofrequency ablation (RFA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Able to provide informed consent

          -  Patients with unifocal or multifocal BE with HGD or IMCA who have        failed at
             least 2 serial RFA therapy.

          -  Patients who refused esophagectomy or deemed inoperable or whose BE dysplasia is not
             amenable to endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) treatment alone due to: (1) extensive
             multifocal lesions (2) severe coagulopathy or any medical condition deemed high risk
             for EMR (3) patient refuses EMR

          -  Patients with a nodular BE lesions may undergo clinically-indicated EMR and still be
             eligible for enrollment as long as they have  BE-HGD lesion/s that are still
             candidate for ablative treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age younger than 18 years old

          -  Life expectancy less than 12 months

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Presence of esophageal varices

          -  Esophageal stricture precluding passage of an endoscope and suction tubing

          -  Any procedure that has impeded normal gastric emptying or limited gastric volume
             distention, including but not limited to gastric bypass, stomach stapling,
             gastrojejunostomy or  any disease state has significantly reduced the elasticity in
             the GI tract (e.g. Marfan's syndrome, Scleroderma or any Connective Tissue Disease)

          -  Esophageal cancer (T2 and above)
