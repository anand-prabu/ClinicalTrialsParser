The study length will be 10 minutes long.  The\n      subjects will take several deep nasal inhalations at the 0, 2, 5 minute marks.  Level of\n      nausea will be recorded during these times and at 10 minutes.  The investigators will also\n      assess satisfaction of the intervention.  As in previous post operative unit studies,the\n      hypothesis is that there will a significant difference in levels of nausea between the\n      alcohol pad group versus the normal saline pad group."
