      Hand psoriasis/eczema is a common problem which is characterized by itchy, erythematous and
      scaly lesions often with a long lasting and relapsing course. Treatment is difficult with
      considerable number of patients do not or only partially respond to the current  treatments.
       Several studies have shown the therapeutic effectiveness of the combination of topical
      psoralen with long wavelength ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) in treating hand
      psoriasis/eczema.  Topical PUVA is has several short- and long-term side effects. Narrow
      band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) has emerged recently as an important treatment for a variety of
      photoresponsive diseases including psoriasis and eczema.  For most conditions (other than
      hand psoriasis/eczema) NB-UVB has been shown to have similar therapeutic results to PUVA
      with less side effects. There are only a few studies published on the efficacy of NB-UVB for
      hand psoriasis/eczema.   Therefore, this study is aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety
      of  t-PUVA and NB-UVB in treating these conditions.

      Hand dermatoses is a common problem which is characterized by itchy, erythematous and scaly
      lesions often with a long lasting and relapsing course. Patients presenting with these
      severe cutaneous changes are classified as having severe recalcitrant hand dermatoses.
      Treatment is difficult with  considerable number of patients do not or only partially
      respond to the current  treatments. Current treatment regimens mainly involve the use of
      high potency topical corticosteroids, which has only limited affect. Systemic  treatment
      modalities have been utilized but have serious side effects with limited improvement of
      disease.

      Several studies have shown the therapeutic effectiveness of the combination of topical
      psoralen with long wavelength ultraviolet A radiation (PUVA) in treating hand dermatoses.
      Topical PUVA is commonly associated with mild local sunburn reactions that often necessitate
      temporarily withholding treatment or decreasing the light dose. This subsequently leads to a
      delay in response or a prolongation of the treatment. Long term side effects include aging
      of the skin, hyperpigmentation, and a small increased risk of skin cancer that is more
      common in systemic PUVA. Narrow band ultraviolet B (NB-UVB) has emerged recently as an
      important treatment for a variety of photoresponsive diseases including psoriasis and
      eczema.  For most conditions (other than hand psoriasis/eczema) NB-UVB has been shown to
      have similar therapeutic results to PUVA with less side effects.

      There are only a few studies published on the efficacy of NB-UVB for hand psoriasis/eczema.
      Our hypothesis is that NB-UVB and topical PUVA will result in at least comparable
      improvement in hand psoriasis/eczema with less side effects associated with NB-UVB. We plan
      on conducting a prospective single-blind randomized clinical trial to compare the efficacy
      and safety of  topical PUVA and NB-UVB in treating hand psoriasis/eczema.

      Study Objectives

        1. To compare the  effect of  topical PUVA and NB-UVB on visual cutaneous symptoms in
           patients  presenting  with recalcitrant hand dermatoses.

        2. To compare the  side effect profile of  topical PUVA and NB-UVB when treating patients
           with recalcitrant hand dermatoses.

    <description>This single-blinded randomized bilateral left to right controlled comparison clinical trial of 24 weeks duration will compare the efficacy of NB-UVB to t-PUVA. For each patient  one  hand  will be randomly  assigned  to receive t-PUVA and the other hand will receive NB-UVB. Each hand will receive treatment with either NB-UVB or topical PUVA three times weekly. Treatment  will  be  performed  until  complete  or almost  complete   clearing   of  psoriasis/eczema   or  until   50  exposures (over 16 weeks) have been reached, whichever comes first.</description>
