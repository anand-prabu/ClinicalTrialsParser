Surgical technique in both groups is same laparoscopic-assisted gastrectomy with D2\n      lymphadenectomy.  Compare outcomes includes length of hospital stay, return to normal diet\n      and postoperative complications.Results: Recovery parameters such as the length of time to\n      return to normal diet; to the first defection; start of ambulation time ;the mean hospital\n      stay will be all less in patients assigned to the fast track surgery protocol compared with\n      those in the conventional care programme.  Conclusion: We will consider fast-track\n      rehabilitation to be safe and feasible in advanced gastric cancer patients. Moreover, it\n      will result in decreased hospital stay."
