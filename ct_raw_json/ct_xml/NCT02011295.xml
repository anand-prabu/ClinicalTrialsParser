      The purpose of this study is to determine the clinical efficacy of the application of bone
      marrow aspirate concentrate (BMAC) as a supplement to microfracture in the treatment of
      osteochondral lesions of the talus (OLTs).

      After appropriate patient identification and consent, patients will be asked to complete a
      100 mm visual analog pain scale, a Foot and Ankle Disability Index questionnaire, a Short
      Form-36 questionnaire, and a Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment questionnaire.  They
      will then be randomized to one of two groups: (1) microfracture alone or (2) microfracture
      plus injection of autologous BMAC.

      At the time of surgery, all patients will undergo standard ankle arthroscopy with
      debridement and microfracture of the OLT.  If randomized to the microfracture alone group,
      no further intervention will take place.  If randomized to the microfracture + BMAC group,
      then, while the surgeon is performing the ankle arthroscopy, the surgical assistant will
      perform the iliac crest bone marrow aspiration.  The ipsilateral iliac crest will undergo
      sterile preparation and draped into the surgical field.  The iliac crest aspiration site
      will be injected with 2cc of 1% lidocaine for postoperative pain control.  Through an
      approximate 4mm incision, approximately 2 cm posterior to the patient's ipsilateral anterior
      superior iliac spine, a JamshidiÂ® type trocar/cannula system will be placed through the
      incision and the medial and lateral borders of the pelvic brim will be palpated.  Once
      centered, the needle will be malleted into the pelvis between the inner and outer tables to
      a depth of 2-3 cm.  The sharp trocar will be switched for the blunt trocar and introduced
      another 2-3cm.  The blunt trocar is used to prevent penetration of the cannula through the
      inner table cortex.  Next, 60cc of iliac crest bone marrow will be aspirated.  The needle
      will be withdrawn and the incision is closed with one 3-0 nylon suture.  The iliac crest
      bone marrow aspirate is then passed through a filter to remove any bone spicules and then
      centrifuged using the Harvest SmartPReP 2 BMAC system (http://www.harvesttech.com).  This
      device is approved for intra-operative point-of-care use for concentrating iliac crest bone
      marrow.  Its use is approved at Duke.  The process takes approximately 15 minutes and will
      be occurring simultaneous to the ankle arthroscopy, debridement, and microfracture of the
      OLT.  Concentration of 60cc of iliac crest bone marrow aspirate typically yields 6-7cc of
      BMAC.  Therefore, to provide a standard amount of BMAC across all cases, 5cc of the BMAC
      will be injected into the ankle joint through the arthroscopy incision prior to closure.

      All patients will be placed in a postoperative splint and remain non-weightbearing for six
      weeks as a standard protocol for microfracture of OLTs.  They will return for the first
      postoperative visit 2-3 weeks after the surgery and the sutures will be removed.

      Additional post-surgical routine follow-up occurs at 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, and 2
      years.  These standard time-points will occur for all patients enrolled in this study.  At
      each time-point, patients will be asked to complete a 100 mm visual analog pain scale, a
      Foot and Ankle Disability Index questionnaire, a Short Form-36 questionnaire, and a Short
      Musculoskeletal Function Assessment questionnaire.  At the one-year time-point, patients
      will be scheduled for a repeat MRI.
