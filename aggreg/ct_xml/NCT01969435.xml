    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Hodgkin lymphoma or non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

          -  Eligible for autologous stem cell transplantation.

          -  18 to 75 years of age at time of enrollment.

          -  Adequate autologous graft, defined as an unmanipulated, cryopreserved, peripheral
             blood stem cell graft containing at least 2 x 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg based on patient
             body weight

          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 2

          -  Normal organ function as defined below:

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt; 40 ml/min

               -  Total bilirubin ≤2.0 x IULN

               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 3.0 x IULN

               -  LVEF &gt; 40% (by ECHO or MUGA)

               -  FEV1 &gt; 50% of predicted and DLCO &gt; 50% of predicted

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Able to understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of other malignancy ≤ 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or
             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or
             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.

          -  Currently receiving any other experimental therapy or has received any other
             experimental therapy within the 4 weeks prior to enrollment.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to melphalan HCl for injection (propylene glycol-free),
             Captisol, or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, unstable
             cardiac arrhythmias, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit
             compliance with study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding women.  Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative serum pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Known HIV-positivity. These patients are excluded because of the potential for
             pharmacokinetic interactions with the study regimen and their antiretroviral therapy
             and because these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated
             with marrow-suppressive therapy.  .

          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities

        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
