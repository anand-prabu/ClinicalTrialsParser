Vaccines may make the body build an immune response to kill\n      cancer cells. Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase the number of\n      immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system\n      recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial of vaccine therapy plus sargramostim following chemotherapy in\n      treating patients who have previously untreated aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Determine the ability of recombinant idiotype immunotherapy to stimulate a\n      specific immune response against the B cell idiotype of the malignant clone that constitutes\n      the tumor in patients with previously untreated aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II.\n      Determine the safety and toxicity of this treatment regimen using Genitope Corporation's\n      molecular rescue technology in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of cyclophosphamide,\n      doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or cyclophosphamide, mitoxantrone,\n      vincristine, and prednisone (CNOP). Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until the maximal\n      clinical response is achieved followed by 2 additional courses of consolidation therapy for\n      up to a maximum of 6 courses. At 2-6 months following completion of chemotherapy, patients\n      achieving adequate disease response receive vaccination consisting of recombinant tumor\n      derived immunoglobulin idiotype with keyhole limpet hemocyanin conjugate subcutaneously (SQ)\n      followed by sargramostim (GM-CSF) SQ, each at 2 separate sites on day 1. Patients receive\n      GM-CSF alone on days 2-4. Vaccination repeats every 4 weeks for 4 doses, followed 3 months\n      later by the fifth and final dose. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6\n      months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
