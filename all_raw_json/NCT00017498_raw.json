Treatment repeats every\n      21 days for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 12 weeks until disease progression and then every 6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-29 patients will be accrued for this study."
