If the patient is initiated under the facilities Massive Transfusion\n      Protocol and meets other inclusion and exclusion criteria the patient will be enrolled in\n      the study. Study procedures include collection of a blood sample following the transfusion\n      of each shipment, through shipment 5, of blood products outlined in the current Massive\n      Transfusion Protocol.\n\n      Each blood sample will be run on a Thromboelastograph to evaluate the patient's hematostatic\n      state through resuscitation. One final blood sample will be collected 24 hours following the\n      discontinuation of the Massive Transfusion Protocol and also ran on the thromboelastograph.\n\n      Due to the critical need for medical intervention, consent procedure will be waived at time\n      of enrollment. An authorized representative for the patient will be identified and\n      approached to obtain consent for use of data collected."
