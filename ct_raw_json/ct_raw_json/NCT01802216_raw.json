            "textblock": "This is a randomized controlled pilot trial to two intention-to-treat treatment arms:\n      intensive periodontal therapy or control-delayed periodontal therapy. The investigators'\n      goals are to test the feasibility of conducting this trial among an underserved (mostly poor\n      and low literacy) population and to determine the variability of renal and inflammatory\n      biomarkers in response to intensive periodontal therapy over a 12 month period among\n      participants with both chronic kidney disease (CKD) and significant periodontal disease.\n\n      Randomization will be restricted with respect to diabetes (a strong risk factor for\n      causing/aggravating both CKD and periodontal disease) to prevent an imbalance between the\n      two arms. The investigators will recruit 51 patients from the San Francisco General Hospital\n      (SFGH) Renal Clinic. Participants will be assigned 2:1 to the intervention group for the\n      intensive periodontal treatment protocol (n=34) or to the control/delayed treatment group\n      for rescue periodontal treatment only with intensive treatment at the end of the study\n      (n=17).\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      A large scale randomized controlled trial of intensive periodontal treatment among the\n      underserved will be feasible (with respect to enrollment, randomization, adherence and\n      variability in clinical outcomes).\n\n      Specific Aims:\n\n        1. To assess the feasibility of recruiting patients to this pilot trial.\n\n        2. To determine the variability of kidney biomarkers in response to periodontal disease\n           treatment.\n\n      Statistical Analysis:\n\n      The investigators will calculate descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation) of each\n      clinical outcome  which will include a traditional marker of kidney function (serum\n      creatinine), markers of kidney structure [as glomerular injury (albuminuria) and tubular\n      injury (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL))]; a marker of vascular\n      endothelial injury (asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA)); and markers of systemic\n      inflammation (IL-6 and C-reactive protein) measured at baseline, study month 4, and study\n      month 12. The investigators will use repeated-measures generalized estimating equations\n      (GEE) to compare changes in clinical outcomes over time within each treatment group and to\n      compare differences between treatment groups taking individual change over time into\n      account.\n\n      Sample Size Calculation:\n\n      This is a pilot study. To the investigators' knowledge, there are no existing data of the\n      anticipated effect size of periodontal treatment to inform sample size calculations.\n      However, because a primary aim is to determine the variability of various renal and\n      inflammatory biomarkers, the investigators seek to enroll at least 30 subjects in the\n      intervention arm of the trial."
