Absolute and relative changes from baseline in percentage of\n           predicted FEV1 and FVC will be analysed.  The absolute change in percentage of\n           predicted lung function (FEV1 and FVC) will be the primary focus.  Changes in FEF25-75\n           will also be analysed.\n\n        -  Safety data will be analysed descriptively (listings and summary tables)."

Have a known intolerance to mannitol;\n\n          6. Be taking non-selective beta-blockers;\n\n          7.
