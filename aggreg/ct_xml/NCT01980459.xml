    <textblock>
      In most diabetic patients where low blood magnesium levels occur the important depletion of
      cellular levels is usually not measured. This study will measure both blood and oral mucosal
      cell magnesium levels before and after 3 months of supplementation with magnesium tablets
      (the recommended dietary amount of 336 milligrams per day). These magnesium levels will be
      correlated with blood levels of indicators of inflammation (eg C reactive protein) to see
      whether the cellular levels are more reliable than blood levels of magnesium for appropriate
      treatment of magnesium deficiency in diabetic patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anti-inflammatory effects of oral magnesium (Mg) supplementation of diabetic and
      metabolic syndrome patients with low serum Mg levels have been studied with increased
      interest in recent years. However, serum magnesium levels only represent less than one
      percent of total body magnesium; whereas cellular deficiency of Mg is a more reliable
      parameter to assess repletion of this essential mineral for correlation with indices of
      inflammation.

      The proposed research will compare the efficacy of a 3 month period of treatment with oral
      Mg of diabetic patients selected for elevations of CRP, TNFα and other markers of
      inflammation on cellular and serum levels of Mg.

      We anticipate that one hundred hypomagnesemic diabetic patients will be selected for a
      double-blinded study of 3 months of supplementation with 336 mg of Mg lactate (50 patients)
      or placebo tablets (50 patients). The repletion of serum and oral epithelial cell Mg levels
      will be correlated with responses of CRP, TNFα, substance P, HgbAIc and
      oxidative/nitrosative (ROS/RNS) stress parameters before and after treatment. Individuals
      will be selected from the Dasman Diabetes Institute in Kuwait. With completion of these
      analyses, several collaborative manuscripts with joint authorship will be prepared and
      submitted for publication.
