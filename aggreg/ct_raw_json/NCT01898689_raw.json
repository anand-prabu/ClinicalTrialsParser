            "textblock": "A continuous peripheral nerve block\u2014also termed \"perineural local anesthetic\n      infusion\"\u2014involves the percutaneous insertion of a catheter adjacent to a peripheral nerve,\n      followed by local anesthetic administration via the catheter, providing\n      anesthesia/analgesia.  Continuous peripheral nerve blocks may be provided in the hospital\n      setting, but the use of lightweight, portable pumps permits ambulatory infusion as well.\n      This technique's most-common application is providing analgesia following surgical\n      procedures, and it has enjoyed explosive growth in the past decade due multiple factors,\n      including the simplicity of ultrasound-guided catheter insertion, the ability to provide\n      analgesia with concurrent administration of various anticoagulants (unlike epidural\n      infusions), and a relative lack of complications associated with the technique.\n      Importantly, ambulatory infusion has experienced logarithmic increases in growth due to the\n      fact that oral analgesics often provide insufficient analgesia following painful outpatient\n      surgical procedures.\n\n      The optimal local anesthetic (predominantly ropivacaine in the United States) concentration\n      remains unknown, but the overwhelming percentage of investigators use 0.2% (>98% of\n      reports).  It is at this concentration that the basal infusion rate of 4-8 mL/h has been\n      reported.  However, recent evidence suggests that for continuous femoral nerve blocks, it is\n      the local anesthetic dose that determines infusion effects, and not concentration.  This\n      raises the tantalizing possibility that a basal infusion at half the standard rate with\n      ropivacaine of twice the standard concentration results in equivalent analgesia, since the\n      total dose remains unchanged (rate [volume] x concentration determines total dose).\n\n      The study suggesting that it is dose, and not rate/concentration, that determines perineural\n      effects involved femoral catheters.  However, femoral infusions are rarely provided to\n      outpatients due to their inducing thigh muscle weakness and a resulting high risk of falls.\n      In contrast, the other perineural catheter locations such as popliteal-sciatic are often\n      provided to outpatients because there is less fall risk (patients often avoid  \"walking\" on\n      their operative foot with the use of crutches).  If this relationship holds true for other\n      catheter locations, it would mean that adequate postoperative analgesia could be provided\n      with a fraction of the basal infusion rate\u2014and, therefore, a fraction of the local\n      anesthetic volume.  In addition, if one concentration/dose combination results in less\n      muscle weakness, but with at least equivalent analgesia, then the risk of falling might be\n      decreased as well for those patients who DO ambulate postoperatively on their operative\n      foot.\n\n      The result:  portable infusion pumps' local anesthetic reservoir volume be consumed at a\n      lower rate, greatly increasing the duration of post-operative analgesia provided by\n      ambulatory perineural infusion; and, the risk of postoperative falls might be decreased.\n\n      In fact, there is currently evidence that a low-rate, high-concentration continuous\n      ropivacaine popliteal-sciatic block decreases the incidence of an unwanted insensate\n      extremity compared with a high-rate, low-concentration infusion.  However, this study in\n      outpatients was not powered to determine analgesia equivalence, and was criticized for\n      relying on subjective endpoints.  More importantly, subjects self-administered bolus doses,\n      making it impossible to determine the total dose that each actually received and confounding\n      the results.\n\n      The investigators therefore propose a volunteer-based clinical trial testing the hypothesis\n      that providing ropivacaine at different concentrations and rates (0.1% at 8 mL/hour vs. 0.4%\n      at 2 mL/hour)\u2014but at an equivalent total basal dose (8 mg/hour)\u2014produces comparable effects\n      when infused for a continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve block.  The primary endpoint will be\n      tolerance to cutaneous electrical current applied on the plantar aspect of the foot.  This\n      is an objective endpoint that has been validated in multiple previous publications and\n      correlates with intra- and post-operative pain.\n\n      Ethics of Inclusion of Volunteers:  Currently, there are no data investigating this\n      hypothesis for popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks.  The study cannot be done without the\n      volunteer model that we describe for the following reason.  Of note, the study itself is\n      investigating the principle of whether or not the local anesthetic concentration/rate/dose\n      within continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks affects both the sensory and motor effects.\n       To test our hypothesis does not require including patients with post-surgical acute pain.\n      We need to determine whether or not\u2014and to what extent\u2014these local anesthetic factors have\n      any an affect on sensory and motor block.  An acute pain model is not necessary in this\n      case.  We are not trying to ascertain which concentrations/rates/doses of local anesthetic\n      optimize postoperative analgesia\u2014which would require an acute pain model.  Rather, we are\n      trying to determine if these factors have any affects on the resulting sensory and/or motor\n      blockade.  This is a theoretical question of immense importance that both can be answered\n      involving healthy volunteers; and, cannot be answered using an acute pain model (explanation\n      below).\n\n      In post-surgical patients, the surgical pain must be treated\u2014it is unconscionable (and\n      unethical) to NOT treat this pain.  Previous clinical studies (all unpublished failures\u2014the\n      P.I. knows of from discussing with colleagues) attempting to answer the same questions the\n      proposed volunteer study will answer have all failed for this reason:  when a surgical\n      patient has pain, an analgesic MUST be provided.  This confounds the collected data.  For\n      example, if a perineural infusion is provided as a basal dose at 4 mL/h, and the patient has\n      surgical breakthrough pain, then a bolus of local anesthetic must be administered to provide\n      analgesia.  Given that we are trying to determine the relative effects of concentration and\n      dose upon block effects, the extra bolus doses on top of the basal infusion confound the\n      results:  if a patient has lower pain scores, is that because of the intervention or because\n      s/he treated any discomfort with additional bolus doses of local anesthetic and therefore a\n      higher total dose of local anesthetic when combined with the basal infusion?  In the\n      proposed volunteer model there will be no surgical pain, and therefore the treatment groups\n      receiving only a basal infusion will not require bolus doses.  Only in this way will we be\n      able to discern the relative effects of concentration and dose.\n\n      This is a critical question to answer given that providing a continuous popliteal-sciatic\n      nerve block results in some degree of muscle weakness (as well as femoral nerve sensory\n      deficit which provides the post-surgical analgesia); and muscle weakness increases the risk\n      of falls;5 and falls may result in catastrophic post-operative complications.  The problem\n      is that many foot/ankle procedures\u2014such as bunionectomy\u2014are very painful and require potent\n      postoperative analgesia\u2014and only a continuous femoral nerve block will provide this potent\n      analgesia (on top of oral and intravenous analgesics such as COX-2 inhibitors and opioids).\n      Insurance companies will not pay for in-hospital stays for nearly all foot/ankle procedures,\n      and therefore patient have no choice but to return home with either insufficient analgesia\n      with oral analgesics; or, they receive a perineural popliteal-sciatic nerve block using a\n      portable infusion pump.  Unfortunately, at the relatively high rate that is currently used\n      to deliver the local anesthetic, the infusion pump reservoirs do not outlast the\n      moderate-to-severe surgical pain.  So, we must find a way to extend the analgesia of\n      continuous popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks while minimizing the resulting motor block.\n      Answering this vital question will help healthcare providers administer continuous\n      popliteal-sciatic nerve blocks (as well as catheters in other anatomic locations) in a safer\n      manner, yet still optimize postoperative analgesia.\n\n      Only with a volunteer study can these critical questions be answered; and the answers are\n      critically important to maximize the care that literally hundreds-of-thousands of patients\n      are receiving annually in the United States, and millions across the World (continuous\n      peripheral nerve blocks are used in Europe and Australia even more than in the United States\n      because of earlier adoption of the technique in the 1990s).\n\n      This investigation will be a randomized, observer-masked, controlled, split-body,\n      human-subjects clinical trial.\n\n      Enrollment.  Subjects will be volunteers of both sexes, age 18 and older.  Volunteers will\n      be solicited using newspaper advertisements, fliers, and an existing database of volunteers\n      (IRB approved).  If a volunteer meets inclusion/exclusion criteria and desires study\n      participation, written, informed consent will be obtained.  Selection for inclusion will not\n      be based on race or socioeconomic status.  The study population of interest includes men and\n      women of all races and socioeconomic status.  A urine pregnancy test will be administered to\n      all women of childbearing age following written informed consent but before any study\n      interventions.  This urine test will be administered by CTRI nursing staff using standard,\n      FDA-approved urine pregnancy testing devices.\n\n      Inclusion criteria for the trial will be:  (1) age \u2265 18 years; and (2) willing to have\n      bilateral femoral perineural catheters placed with a subsequent ropivacaine infusion and\n      motor/sensory testing for 6 hours, requiring an overnight stay in the UCSD GCRC/CTRI to\n      allow dissipation of local anesthetic infusion effects by the following morning.  Exclusion\n      criteria for the trial will be:  (1) current daily analgesic use; (2) opioid use within the\n      previous 4 weeks; (3) any neuro-muscular deficit of either femoral nerves and/or quadriceps\n      muscles; (4) morbid obesity [weight > 35 kg/m2]; (5) pregnancy (as determined by a urine\n      pregnancy test prior to any study interventions); and (6) incarceration.  We expect to\n      recruit a maximum of 30 healthy volunteers; with a target goal of 24 for the analysis.\n      Selection for inclusion will not be based on gender, race, or socioeconomic status.  The\n      study population of interest includes men and women of all races and socioeconomic status.\n      There will be no participants from vulnerable populations, such as pregnant women, children,\n      or prisoners\n\n      Perineural catheter insertion.  Following written, informed consent, subjects will be\n      admitted to the UCSD CTRI and have demographic/morphometric data recorded (e.g., age,\n      weight, height).  An intravenous line will be placed in an upper extremity, followed by\n      external monitors (pulse oxymeter, blood pressure, and EKG), and oxygen by nasal cannula.\n      Sedation will be provided with intravenous fentanyl (50 mcg) and/or midazolam (1 mg), or\n      oral valium (10 mg) and/or dilaudid (4 mg), as necessary.  Subjects will then have bilateral\n      popliteal-sciatic perineural catheters placed using standard UC San Diego techniques as\n      previously published by the current P.I.7,8\n\n      Treatment Group Assignment.  Subjects will have the right-sided catheter randomly assigned\n      to one of two treatment groups:  a ropivacaine concentration of 0.1% or 0.4%.  Subjects will\n      act as their own controls, with the contralateral side receiving the alternative\n      concentration. The Investigational Drug Service will prepare the randomization list as well\n      as the two ropivacaine reservoirs and two electronic infusion pumps (SIGMA Spectrum Infusion\n      System, Baxter Healthcare International, Deerfield, IL) used to infuse the ropivacaine.  All\n      pumps will be FDA approved for infusion of local anesthetic.  The basal rate of each\n      infusion will be determined by the ropivacaine concentration in each pump reservoir:  0.1%\n      (8 mL/h) or 0.4% (2 mL/h).  While the basal rate and bolus volume will differ for each\n      concentration, the total dose of local anesthetic will be the same for both treatments (8\n      mg/h).  The local anesthetic reservoirs will be contained within an opaque bag prepared by\n      the Investigational Drug Service, and the infusion rates displayed on the pumps covered,\n      ensuring masking for both the subjects and observers (clinical research nurse taking the\n      measurements).  Following 6 hours (48 mg), the infusions will be discontinued and the\n      catheters removed.\n\n      Treatment Group Basal Rate (mL/h) Basal Dose (mg/h) Total Dose (mg in 6 h) Ropivacaine 0.1%\n      8 8 48 Ropivacaine 0.4% 2 8 48\n\n      The tubing from the pumps to the subjects will be gently wound at least 5 rotations and\n      covered with opaque tape, masking which perineural catheter is receiving which treatment\n      (ropivacaine is clear, so the flow through the clear tubing from the tape to the perineural\n      catheters will not be visually distinguishable).  Subjects will remain within the CTRI until\n      the following morning at least until Hour 22 for the final measurement; or, until their\n      perineural infusion sensory and motor effects have resolved.  If a subject requests early\n      withdrawal from the study, they will remain in the CTRI until their perineural infusion\n      sensory and motor effects have resolved.\n\n      Outcome Measurements.  The selected measures have established reliability and validity and\n      minimal inter-rater discordance.  Measurements will be performed at Hour 0 (baseline), and\n      on the hour until Hour 14, as well as the following morning at Hour 22.  In all cases,\n      measurements will be taken in the supine position with the dominant side measured first,\n      followed by the non-dominant side.\n\n      Tolerance of transcutaneous electrical stimulation:  Sensory perception\u2014depth of\n      analgesia\u2014will be evaluated using tolerance of transcutaneous electrical stimulation with\n      the same quantitative procedure validated and used in multiple clinical trials.\n      Electrocardiogram pads are placed on the lateral aspect of the plantar surface of the foot\n      which is covered by the sciatic nerve distribution; and, the tolerance to cutaneous\n      electrical current is obtained using a nerve stimulator.  The current is increased from 0 mA\n      until subjects detect the electrical current (up to a maximum of 80 mA), at which time the\n      current is recorded and the nerve stimulator turned off.\n\n      Muscle strength:  We will evaluate muscle strength with an isometric force electromechanical\n      dynamometer to measure the force produced during a maximum voluntary isometric\n      plantar-flexion (muscles innervated by the sciatic nerve).  The dynamometer will be placed\n      against the bed's foot board (immobile) and the subject will be asked to take 2 seconds to\n      come to maximum effort contracting the target muscles, maintain this effort for 5 seconds,\n      and then relax.  The measurements immediately prior to perineural ropivacaine administration\n      will be designated as baseline measurements, and all subsequent measurements will be\n      expressed as a percentage of the pre-infusion baseline.\n\n      Food and Drink:  Both food and accompanying beverages/water will be provided by the hospital\n      and served by the nursing staff immediately following catheter insertion.  Meals will be\n      provided without charge to the study subjects.   There is no restriction on oral intake\n      following catheter insertion.\n\n      Statistical Analysis.  Sample size calculations are based on the primary aim of determining\n      the relationship between perineural ropivacaine concentration and continuous\n      popliteal-sciatic nerve block effects. To this end, we will perform an equivalency trial\n      with the primary endpoint designated as the maximum tolerance to transcutaneous electrical\n      stimulation at Hour 6.  We will aim to demonstrate that differing the concentration (0.1%\n      vs. 0.4%) applied to different legs of each subject, but providing an equal total dose (8\n      mg/h) of ropivacaine through a popliteal-sciatic perineural catheter does not result in a\n      significant difference in tolerance between legs at Hour 6.  We will conclude that the\n      interventions are equivalent if the 95% confidence interval for the mean difference in\n      tolerance between legs is contained within the pre-specified tolerance interval of +/- 10\n      mA.  This value is used as the minimally clinically-relevant current since it approximates\n      the tolerated electrical current range at baseline of the general population\u2014in other words,\n      natural variability and therefore a relatively small amount of current to detect.4 Based on\n      previously-published data,1,4 we assume the standard deviation of tolerance difference\n      between legs is SD=13 mA.  With n=24 subjects, we will correctly conclude equivalence with\n      approximately 80% probability (\"power\").  Alternatively, if the population difference is 10\n      mA, we will correctly reject equivalence with probability 5%.  The mean difference between\n      treatments will be estimated by Analysis of Covariance (ANCOVA), using baseline tolerance\n      difference as a covariate. Subjects will receive each of the two treatments applied randomly\n      to the left and right legs.\n\n      The same analyses will be applied to the secondary endpoints. Profiles of the responses over\n      time will be examined with spaghetti and mean plots. Further secondary analyses will include\n      mixed-effects modeling of the repeated measures. These models account for the hierarchical\n      correlation of paired measures from each subject over time, and will be used to test the\n      effects of subject characteristics, including sex, height, weight, body mass index, and age.\n      The model will also allow simultaneous analysis of all observations while accounting for\n      within-subject correlation, which can improve the standard errors of the estimated\n      differential at each time point.  The within-subject correlation will be modeled via a\n      subject-specific random intercept.  This is similar to a compound symmetric correlation\n      structure without a random effect.  The change from baseline, Y, for subject i and time t\n      will be modeled with the linear mixed-effect model:\n\n      Yi(t\u00acj) = Yi(0) \u03b20 +  1{t\u00acj=1}\u03b21 + \u2026 + 1{t\u00acj=9}\u03b29 + bi + eij\n\n      where 1{t\u00acj=k} is 1 if t\u00acj=k and 0 otherwise.  The subject-specific random intercepts bi and\n      residuals eij are assumed to follow a Gaussian distribution. We will present the estimated\n      difference at each hour with unadjusted p-values, and p-values adjusted using the\n      single-step method for simultaneous inference from parametric models.\n\n      Analyses will be executed using R version 2.12 (http://www.r-project.org). Additional\n      analyses will include the Mann-Whitney U for nonparametric comparisons and Fisher's exact\n      test for categorical variables (InStat, GraphPad Software, San Diego, California, United\n      States)."
