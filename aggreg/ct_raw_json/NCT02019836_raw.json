Vitamin D is a fat-soluble steroid hormone that primarily\n      contributes to the maintenance of normal calcium homeostasis and skeletal mineralization. In\n      addition to its classical role in bone metabolism, vitamin D also has immunomodulatory\n      effects on immune function. Although some studies reported a link between vitamin D\n      deficiency and critical illness in adults, a direct relationship has not been directly shown\n      yet. However, to the best of our knowledge, no study evaluated the association between EOS\n      and maternal/neonatal vitamin D levels. The objective of this prospective study is to\n      determine the possible role of maternal and neonatal plasma vitamin D levels on EOS\n      development in term infants. We also aim to evaluate possible effect of the severity of\n      vitamin D deficiency on EOS development in the study population."

The study group\n      will consist of term neonates who are clinically suspected to have an early infection from\n      the 1st day of life. Blood for neonatal and maternal vitamin D levels will be obtained from\n      all infants and their mothers at the time of hospital admission. Only infants with high\n      probable sepsis will consist the study group. The healthy infants who admit to our\n      outpatient clinic for routine evaluation at postnatal day 3 with no signs of clinical and\n      laboratory infection and are evaluated for hyperbilirubinemia will be referred to as the\n      Control group. The Control group wll consist term infants with the same gestational and\n      postnatal age of the infants that will be included in the study group. In both groups,\n      maternal samples will be obtained at the postpartum period at the time of infant's\n      hospitalization. Plasmas after separated and stored at -800C.
