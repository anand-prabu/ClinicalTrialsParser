  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many hospitals employ a common canister inhaler protocol in patients that do not require
      mechanical ventilator support.  Common canister refers to a single inhaler paired with
      standardized cleaning methods for use on more than one patient.  Small reports suggest that
      this method does not pose an increased infectious risk and is associated with significant
      cost savings.

      Common canister protocols offer a solution to the discordance between inhaler sizes and
      average inpatient use of the drugs. Metered dose inhaler canisters are contain enough drug
      for several days to weeks of daily use. However, the average length of stay for most
      inpatients is only several days.  Therefore, most inpatients do not use all of the canister
      contents, an unused resource that is potentially wasted.

      The common canister approach has not been previously described in mechanically ventilated
      patients (people requiring intensive care unit admission on breathing machines).  This study
      aims to assess the safety of common canister utilization by assessment and comparison of
      infection rates in the study and control group.
