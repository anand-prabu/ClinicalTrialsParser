Treatment continues\n      for up to 52 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After\n      approximately 12 weeks of treatment, patients are evaluated for response and undergo\n      surgical resection if clinically appropriate.\n\n      Patients are followed for 1 year for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2\n      years."
