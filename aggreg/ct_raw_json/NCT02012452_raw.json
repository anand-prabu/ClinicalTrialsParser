This study has 3 aims: (1)\n      to evaluate whether tobacco use interferes with recovery from PTSD during empirically based,\n      trauma focused PTSD treatment.  (2) To gather preliminary data about whether tobacco use\n      alleviates PTSD symptoms among continued tobacco users vs. recent quitters.  (3) To explore\n      the impact of recovery from PTSD treatment on tobacco use quantity and frequency, tobacco\n      withdrawal symptoms, and craving for tobacco.  To test these aims, we propose a randomized\n      two group design where 50 participants are assigned to receive either tobacco treatment\n      (Contingency Management plus Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) or control treatment (Health\n      Education) before completing Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT) for PTSD.  Study outcome\n      variables will be PTSD symptom severity following CPT, PTSD symptom severity during tobacco\n      cessation treatment, and tobacco use and tobacco withdrawal during CPT."
