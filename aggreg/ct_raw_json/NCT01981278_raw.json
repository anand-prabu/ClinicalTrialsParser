All participants will receive in randomized order the TRF tablet\n      and PR2 tablet, both as a single dose of 250 mg tapentadol. Approximately 64 participants\n      will be enrolled in the study. The study consists of 3 phases: a screening phase (within 2\n      to 21 days before the first study drug administration on Day 1 of Period 1), an open-label\n      treatment phase consisting of 2 single-dose treatment periods. Treatment administrations\n      will be separated by a washout period of 7 to 14 days. All participants will be randomly\n      assigned to 1 of 2 possible treatment sequences and receive both of the following\n      treatments, 1 in each period: Treatment A: tapentadol ER 250-mg TRF tablet, administered as\n      a single oral dose under fasted condition and Treatment B: tapentadol ER 250-mg PR2 tablet,\n      administered as a single oral dose under fasted condition. Safety will be evaluated by the\n      assessment of adverse events, vital signs, physical examination, 12-lead electrocardiogram,\n      and clinical laboratory tests which will be monitored throughout the study. The duration of\n      participation in the study for an individual participant will be up to 5.5 weeks."
