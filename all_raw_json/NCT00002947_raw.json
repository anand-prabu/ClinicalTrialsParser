Patients receive indium In III pentetreotide\n      (OctreoScan) IV on day 1. Imaging is conducted on days 3 and 6. Treatment continues weekly\n      for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Cohorts of at least 3 patients receive escalating doses of OctreoScan until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for\n      the first year, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 35 patients will be accrued for this study."
