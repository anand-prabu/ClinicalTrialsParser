The only effective treatment option for Fuchs' ED is corneal\n      transplantation.\n\n      Corneal transplantation Corneal transplantation surgery has seen major advances in the last\n      decade, and the Descemet's Stripping Automated Endothelial Keratoplasty (DSAEK) procedure\n      has now become the preferred method.\n\n      Outcome There have been a substantial number of publications on outcome after DSAEK surgery,\n      and the procedure has several advantages over the former preferred method of\n      transplantation, penetrating keratoplasty (PK).\n\n      Despite the apparent success of the DSAEK procedure, visual acuity is seldom fully restored\n      even in otherwise healthy eyes. Several studies have tried to clarify this matter but so far\n      results have been conflicting.\n\n      Hypotheses\n\n        1. The reduction in visual acuity and contrast sensitivity in patients with Fuchs'\n           endothelial dystrophy is correlated with corneal thickness, corneal light scatter, and\n           the type and magnitude of optical disrupting guttae in Descemet's membrane.\n\n        2. The subjective visual function after corneal transplantation with a posterior lamellar\n           graft is correlated with the optical properties of the grafted cornea (thickness, light\n           scatter, irregularities on the anterior, and posterior corneal surfaces)\n\n      Materials and methods\n\n      In a controlled prospective trial of DSAEK patients, we aim to register different\n      morphological patterns, monitor visual performance and optical parameters.\n\n      Three sex and age-matched groups will be compared:\n\n      Group 1: 40 patients that undergo DSAEK surgery Group 2: 40 patients that undergo combined\n      cataract and DSAEK surgery. Group 3: Control group of 40 patients with normal corneas that\n      undergo cataract surgery."
