  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) is now established as the most
      accurate non-invasive imaging modality for characterizing breast cancer. CE-MRI has a very
      high sensitivity because the intravenous MR contrast agent highlights regions with increased
      vascularization and vascular permeability compared to normal breast tissues and benign
      lesions. While research continues on improving the specificity of CE-MRI, several other MR
      techniques that do not require an exogenous contrast agent have been shown to provide
      valuable information that can improve the characterization of breast cancers. These
      techniques include magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), diffusion-weighted imaging, and
      water T2 relaxometry. The long-term goal of this study is to develop these techniques to
      produce quantitative MR-based biomarkers that can be used to supplement or possibly supplant
      the information provided by CE-MRI. This project seeks to facilitate the advancement of
      these advanced, non-contrast techniques. This study uses a piggyback design, in which
      subjects who are already scheduled to receive a CE-MRI study are invited to receive an
      additional 10-20 minutes of scanning to help develop these novel methods. This efficient
      design allows for the refinement and assessment of these new techniques with a minimum of
      risk and inconvenience to the patient. With these proposed improvements, these techniques
      may lead to quantitative biomarkers that can guide critical clinical questions in treatment
      response, diagnosis, staging, and high-risk screening of breast cancer.
