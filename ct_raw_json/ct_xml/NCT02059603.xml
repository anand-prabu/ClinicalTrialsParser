  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Our previous study demonstrated that electroacupuncture at Zusanli, Sanyinjiao,
      Hegu, and Zhigou reduces the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery within a traditional perioperative care setting. Recent
      evidence also suggested that a 'fast-track' perioperative program may help accelerate
      recovery after colorectal surgery. As electroacupuncture is simpler to implement and less
      labor intensive, it may be the preferred adjunct therapy if it is proven to be noninferior
      to fast-track program in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay
      after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      Objectives: To compare the efficacy of electroacupuncture and fast-track program in reducing
      the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic colorectal surgery.

      Design: Prospective, randomized, noninferiority trial.

      Subjects: One hundred sixty-four consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic
      resection of colonic and upper rectal cancer will be recruited.

      Interventions: Patients will be randomly allocated to receive either: (A) electroacupuncture
      with traditional perioperative care; or (B) fast-track program without acupuncture.

      Outcome measures: Primary outcome: time to defecation. Secondary outcomes: duration of
      hospital stay, time of first passing flatus, time to resume diet, pain scores, analgesic
      requirement, morbidity, and medical costs.

      Conclusions: This study will determine if electroacupuncture is noninferior to fast-track
      program in reducing the duration of postoperative ileus and hospital stay after laparoscopic
      colorectal surgery. Electroacupuncture may be the preferred perioperative adjunct therapy to
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery because it is simpler to implement and less labor intensive
      than fast-track program.
