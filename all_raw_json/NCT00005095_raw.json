Participants may\n      have samples of blood, tissue, or body fluids (such as ascites, pleural fluid or urine), or\n      any combination of the aforementioned samples obtained to develop tumor markers to detect\n      early stage or recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\n      The results from the biomarker research studies will not be reported to the patient or the\n      physician. In the future, if any of the experimental tumor markers are found to be effective\n      in detecting early stage ovarian cancer, and the patient's result is abnormal, the patient\n      and physician will be notified.\n\n      Subjects may be asked to complete a combination of questionnaires designed to evaluate\n      psychological functioning among women enrolled in a comprehensive ovarian cancer early\n      detection program who are at increased risk for developing disease as compared to women\n      currently diagnosed with ovarian cancer."
