When  the number of observations (items) per subject ranges\n      from 4 to 6, roughly 152-199 patients are required to show 10% increase in intraclass\n      correlation from baseline ICC of 30% with 85% power and 5% type I error rate. The sample\n      size was determined based on this calculation and practical considerations.\n\n      The pilot study will be performed based on 30 people (include reference), and the main study\n      will include 1100 people (considering 10% drop-out from 200 people in each group) cancer\n      type (ovary, cervix, endometrium, and breast) and healthy female.
