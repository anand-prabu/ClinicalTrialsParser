Changes in health related quality of life are being evaluated\n      using three instruments: the SF-36, the St. George\ufffds Respiratory Questionnaire, and the\n      Quality of Well-Being Scale, the latter to calculate utility associated with different\n      health states.  Costs will be determined using utilization data on outpatient visits,\n      medications, oxygen use, inpatient days, radiology tests, laboratory tests, and emergency\n      room visits are being collected for the twelve months before and after surgery.  Costs will\n      be calculated according to VA and  community standards.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Complete."
