Dalfampridine may enhance cognition by direct\n      pharmacological mechanisms, and should have effects on motor outcomes as in prior studies.\n      By combining cognition and motor outcomes in the proposed study, the investigators will\n      evaluate if the same patients with positive effects show beneficial responses on motor\n      outcomes including physical activity and if such motor outcomes mediate and/or moderate\n      cognitive improvements with dalfampridine"

Patient Sample and Recruitment\n\n      Subjects will be consecutively selected from the Western NY region where the Baird MS Center\n      and the Jacobs Neurological Institute are located.  Patients will be interviewed and their\n      records reviewed to assess for inclusion/exclusion.  Patients will then be approached in the\n      clinic or contacted by telephone and invited to participate in this clinical trial.  The\n      attached flier will also be used to directly advertise the study to patients.  Patients who\n      initiate contact with the researcher will be interviewed to assess eligibility.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria.   Patients will be eligible for the study if they fulfill all the\n      inclusion criteria specified below\n\n        1. Males/Females who are \u2265 18 years old and < 65 years old and are capable of\n           understanding and complying with the protocol, including speaking and writing fluent\n           English and having at least a 9th grade education.\n\n        2. Have a diagnosis of MS, as per revised McDonald's Criteria.\n\n        3.

Are capable of performing the requirements of a NP test battery including at least\n           20/70 near visual acuity by near vision chart, with correction allowed.\n\n        8.
