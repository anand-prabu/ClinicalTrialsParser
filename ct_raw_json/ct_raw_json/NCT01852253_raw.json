            "textblock": "Peri-implantitis is a infectious disease that resides in the mucosa surrounding dental\n      implants and also affects the supporting bone. Because the number of implants placed in\n      everyday clinical practice is continuously increasing, is it reasonable to anticipate an\n      increasing prevalence of peri-implantitis. This underlines the necessity for a predictable\n      therapy. However, from the literature there is very little reliable evidence suggesting\n      which could be the most effective interventions for treating periimplantitis.\n\n      The primary objective of this controlled clinical study is to evaluate the clinical effect\n      of decontamination of the implant surface during the surgical treatment of peri-implantitis\n      using a 2% chlorhexidine solution or a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution. The secondary objective\n      is to assess the microbiological effect of decontamination of the implant surface during the\n      surgical treatment of peri-implantitis using a 2% chlorhexidine solution or a 0.12%\n      chlorhexidine solution.\n\n      The primary study parameter is the change from baseline in modified bleeding index.\n      Secondary study parameters are: change in microbial composition of the biofilm covering the\n      dental implant surface; microbiological composition of the peri-implant sulcus; change in\n      probing pocket depth;change in suppuration on probing; change in radiographic marginal bone\n      level on standardized intraoral radiographs; change in modified plaque index; implant\n      failure, defined as implant mobility of previously clinically osseointegrated implants and\n      removal of non-mobile implants because of progressive marginal bone loss or infection;\n      complications and adverse events. It is hypothesized that decontamination of the implant\n      surface with 2% chlorhexidine leads to a greater decrease in modified bleeding index than\n      decontamination with a 0.12% chlorhexidine solution."
