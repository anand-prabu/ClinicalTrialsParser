Veliparib will be administered per a\n      dose escalation schema.  The starting dose of veliparib is 20 mg BID based upon\n      safety/efficacy data available.  Dose escalation will continue in 20 mg increments until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached.  Intra-patient dose escalation will not be allowed."
