            "textblock": "Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are bone marrow malignancies characterized by poor bone\n      marrow function that may progress to acute myeloid leukemia. Many patients become red blood\n      cell transfusion-dependent. Transfusion dependence is associated with inferior quality of\n      life (QOL). However, the relationship between the degree of anemia and QOL is less clear. A\n      commonly used transfusion strategy is to target the hemoglobin (Hb) in the range of 80-90\n      g/L (normal hemoglobin > 120-130g/L). The question is: would a higher hemoglobin target lead\n      to improvement in QOL despite the negative impact transfusion dependence may have on QOL\n      (due to associated time commitments, expense, transfusion reactions etc). Several groups\n      have prospectively shown that targeting hemoglobin levels of greater than 120 g/L (with\n      hematopoietic growth factors (HGFs) and/or blood transfusions) or incremental increases of\n      15-20 g/L (with HGFs alone) were associated with improved QOL. The investigators MDS program\n      has been conducting prospective assessments of QOL since 2007 in all registered and\n      consented patients using a variety of validated questionnaires. Preliminary analysis (in 236\n      patients) revealed that, compared with an age-matched healthy general population, MDS\n      patients have inferior QOL. Transfusion dependence and anemia were independently predictive\n      of poor functioning, fatigue and decreased health utility. Furthermore, a hemoglobin level\n      of \u2265100 g/L seemed to be the key threshold for improvement in function and symptom scores.\n      The investigators hypothesize that the target hemoglobins in transfusion dependent MDS\n      patients are too low and this may account for their inferior quality of life.  Our goal is\n      to compare the effect on QOL of a restrictive strategy (which is the current standard of\n      care), with a liberal transfusion strategy in a large randomized controlled trial of\n      transfusion dependent MDS outpatients. Before embarking on such an endeavor, the\n      investigators must first prove feasibility in a smaller pilot randomized controlled trial."
