  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy patients in cardiac rehabilitation with maximal exercise capacity less than 1.4 watt
      per kilogram bodyweight will be randomized 1:1 into either an intervention training (IN)
      group or usual care (UC). The IN patients will perform supervised endurance and resistance
      exercise for approximately 90 minutes once a week and traditional cardiac rehabilitation
      (TCR) once a week; the UC patients will perform TCR twice a week. The intervention is
      planned for six months with a follow-up of a further six months. The primary investigation
      is differences between IN and UC with regard to changes in exercise capacity (max
      watt/kgBW).
