  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In patients with aortic stenosis the valve through which blood is pumped out of the main
      heart chamber is narrowed. This results in heart muscle working harder to open the valve so
      blood can circulate around the body. The muscle adapts to the increased pressure load to
      maintain efficiency. This can cause long-term muscle damage. To predict when this
      deterioration will require a valve replacement is difficult and untimely operation exposes
      patients to unnecessary risk.

      We aim to compare all validated techniques looking at different aspects of heart muscle
      strain in these patients. These will be a blood sample measuring a specific hormone (BNP)
      and enzyme (Troponin), a nuclear scan to assess nerve activation, an MRI identifying
      scarring and an exercise echocardiogram that measures heart muscle response and pressure
      changes across the valve. Tests will be performed at recruitment and either after one year
      or after valve replacement, which ever comes first.

      In comparing these different imaging techniques we aim to identify patients who will benefit
      from an early operation, those whose muscle is likely to recover back to normal and which
      patients it is safe to wait longer for the surgery, avoiding unnecessary risk.

      The results of the study will benefit patients as it will help doctors more accurately
      assess the timing of valve surgery and improve their prediction of long term heart muscle
      recovery. It may also increase convenience in clinical management by reducing unnecessary
      tests and hospital trips. This would translate into cost savings for the NHS.
