  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now overwhelming evidence documenting the efficacy of psychotherapy in the
      treatment of depression in the general population. Surprisingly, however, given the high
      prevalence of depression in cancer patients, there are very few studies on the efficacy of
      psychotherapy in this population. Published studies of psychotherapy in cancer patients
      generally include patients with high heterogeneity of psychiatric diagnosis and frequently
      include patients without a psychiatric diagnosis, with the aim of preventing the appearance
      of a psychiatric disorder. This heterogeneity complicates the interpretation of the efficacy
      and specificity of these interventions. Specifically, the efficacy of psychotherapy for
      major depression in patients with cancer is unknown.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interpersonal psychotherapy (IPT) is a brief, manualized therapy that has shown efficacy in
      the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) in several controlled trials. This study
      will test the efficacy of IPT in a group of prostate, colorectal, lung and pancreatic cancer
      patients with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder.

      We will test the efficacy of IPT using a variety of outcome measures at different time
      points of  the  treatment.  Those  scales  will  evaluate  the  patient's  depressive
      symptoms, psychosocial functioning  and  quality  of  life.  Patients  that  are  deemed
      eligible  for  the  study  will have  IPT  for twelve weeks. Patients will receive twelve
      50-minute sessions over 16 weeks. To facilitate access to treatment, sessions 1,2,3,4, 8 and
      12 will be in person, while all others will in be person or over the  telephone  according
      to  the  patient's  choice.  Sessions  will  be audiotaped  and  periodically reviewed  by
      experienced  supervisors  to  assess  therapist's adherence  to  IPT  technique.  This
      taping  will  be  optional  and  is  covered  in  a  separate consent  form.  This  pilot
      study  is  to  prove feasibility and acceptability of IPT in this population and to show
      preliminary efficacy.
