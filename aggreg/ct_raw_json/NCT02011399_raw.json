The investigators want to keep users motivated and determine the best way to\n      provide effective training. Healthy users will be trained to control a computer by wearing\n      an electrode cap that is connected to a computer. They will have their levels of motivation\n      and interest measured while learning to use the Mu rhythm. Two different types of learning\n      programs will be used to determine which is most effective for Mu rhythm training. This\n      method will be used for device control by people with severe physical impairments, who may\n      be able to communicate or carry out other desired tasks using a BCI."
