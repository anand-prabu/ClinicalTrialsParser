      1. objectives

             -  Evaluate the performance of Venus MedTech aortic valve prosthesis intervention by
                femoral artery

             -  Evaluate safety and clinical benefit of percutaneous implantation of the Venue
                MedTech aortic valve prosthesis.

             -  Continuous observe 12 months of safety and efficacy.

        2. Approximately 80 patients presenting with native aortic valve stenosis necessitating
           valve replacement which are considered unsuitable for Surgical Valve Replacement, with
           a high surgical risk, as attested to by both the surgeon and the cardiologist are
           recruited in the study.

        3. Safety and performance will be evaluated at discharge and at 30 days post procedure.
           Valve safety, performance and placement will be followed up at 6 and 12 months
           post-procedure.
