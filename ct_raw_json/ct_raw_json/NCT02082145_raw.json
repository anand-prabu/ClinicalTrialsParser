            "textblock": "Diabetes is a metabolic disease that affects the body's ability to control blood sugar\n      levels. This affects the tissues of the body, particularly the walls of blood vessels.\n      People with diabetes are more likely to suffer from ischaemic heart disease, stroke, kidney\n      problems, blindness, foot ulcers, and peripheral nerve problems. Diabetes affects\n      approximately 347 million people worldwide, and by 2030 the WHO projects that complications\n      of diabetes will be the 7th leading cause of death.\n\n      Peripheral neuropathy is a dysfunction of the nerves most commonly affecting the arms and\n      legs.  Diabetes is the leading cause of neuropathy in the Western world, and diabetic\n      neuropathy is estimated to affect between 20-50% of diabetic people. The American Diabetes\n      Association define it as the 'presence of symptoms and signs of peripheral nerve dysfunction\n      in patients with diabetes after exclusion of other causes'. As regards complications of\n      diabetes, peripheral neuropathy has the greatest detrimental effect on quality of life.\n      Diabetic neuropathy is implicated in 50-75% of non-traumatic amputations.\n\n      The device to be tested mimics the effect of walking by stimulating the motor nerves of the\n      leg, making the foot twitch- it increases blood flow to the limb and exercises the leg\n      muscles. We have seen previous clinical cases of improvement in peripheral neuropathy with\n      use of the device, and wish to formalise the benefits to patients. It is hypothesised to\n      work either by increasing blood flow to the limb and therefore the nerves themselves, or for\n      electrical current to be having a direct effect on the peripheral nervous system itself. The\n      device is easily fitted, can be self-administered by patients, and is suitable for\n      out-patient therapy.\n\n      We wish to evaluate both the short- and longer-term effects of a neuromuscular stimulator on\n      diabetic peripheral neuropathy as a therapeutic intervention."
