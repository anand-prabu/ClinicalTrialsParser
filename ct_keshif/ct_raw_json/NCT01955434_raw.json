Immunomodulatory therapies, such as LCL161, may stimulate the immune\n      system in different ways to kill the cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by\n      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing, and can also help to modulate the\n      immune response to cancer.  It is not yet known whether giving LCL161 alone or with\n      cyclophosphamide is more effective in treating multiple myeloma."

To estimate the confirmed overall response rate to LCL161 in combination with\n      cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of response or\n      progression.\n\n      II. To estimate the overall survival and event-free survival of patients treated with LCL161\n      in combination with cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of\n      response or progression.\n\n      III. To evaluate the tolerability of LCL161 alone and in combination with cyclophosphamide\n      in patients with relapsed MM.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1) in\n      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), changes in serum cytokines, and changes in immune\n      cell subsets by flow cytometry.\n\n      II. To correlate the effect of LCL161 with the presence of activating mutations of the\n      nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) pathway.\n\n      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LCL161 alone, and LCL161 in combination with\n      cyclophosphamide.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive LCL161 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
