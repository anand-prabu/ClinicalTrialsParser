  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence that mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) such as meditation,
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) and yoga might improve Quality of Life (QOL) and
      reduce stress in breast cancer survivors. These interventions are becoming increasingly
      popular in cancer survivors.  However, little is known about the feasibility and effect of
      MBIs administered during the interval of time of chemotherapy, on QOL and stress.  The
      investigators are planning a MBI intervention study developed specifically for breast cancer
      survivors receiving chemotherapy (usually 4-5 months) at the investigators institution, for
      at least 8 sessions combined with at least 8 weeks of home-practice, in 25 women receiving
      chemotherapy for breast cancer.
