            "textblock": "Extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants have significant transepidermal water loss\n      immediately after birth. This significant fluid loss is related to proportionally large\n      extracellular pool of fluids, the immaturity of the skin barrier, and the relatively large\n      surface area exposed to evaporation. Water depletion in this population is associated with\n      development of significant electrolyte imbalance in the form of hypernatremia, hyperkalemia,\n      hyperglycemia and hyperosmolarity. In order to compensate for these losses, clinicians have\n      to progressively increase fluid intake. Excessive fluid intake in the first days of life is\n      associated with worsening patent ductus artriosus (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC),\n      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and mortality. Also skin integrity is important to protect\n      against skin infection and secondary sepsis. Based on recent studies and relevant data, the\n      risk of sepsis in ELBW is up to 40% nationwide, but only about 25% at GWUH Water application\n      is a benign treatment that is routinely applied to the skin of premature babies and was\n      shown to decrease skin colonization. The current practice at GWUH is to clean the bodies of\n      premature infants using a piece of damp cloth with warm water. This is performed at birth\n      and consequently every other days. The study group will receive  more frequent and\n      standardized applications. The investigators hypothesize that application of sterile water\n      in ELBW infants is associated with decreased fluid requirements in the first week of life.\n      As a secondary outcome, the investigators hypothesize that sterile water application is\n      associated with improved skin integrity, decreased incidence of BPD with no increased\n      incidence of skin or systemic infections."
