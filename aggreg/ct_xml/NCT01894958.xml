      The purpose of this study is to determine whether NNZ-2566 is safe and well tolerated in the
      treatment of Fragile X Syndrome in adolescent and adult males.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fragile X Syndrome is a genetically determined neurological disorder in which affected
      individuals are intellectually handicapped to varying degrees and display a variety of
      associated psychiatric symptoms. Clinically, Fragile X Syndrome is characterized by
      intellectual handicap, hyperactivity and attentional problems, autism spectrum symptoms,
      emotional lability and epilepsy.  The epilepsy seen in Fragile X Syndrome is most commonly
      present in childhood, but then gradually remits towards adulthood.  Physical features such
      as prominent ears and jaw, and hyper-extensibility of joints are frequently present but are
      not diagnostic.  Intellectual handicap is the most common feature defining the phenotype.
      Treatment for the disorder is symptomatic - focusing on the management of symptoms - and
      supportive, requiring a multidisciplinary approach.

      This study will investigate the safety and tolerability of treatment with oral
      administration of NNZ-2566 at 35 mg/kg or 70 mg/kg BID in adolescent or adult males with
      Fragile X Syndrome. The study also will also investigate measures of efficacy during
      treatment.

             psychotropic medications.  Similarly, anti-epileptic medications are permitted and
             are not denoted as &quot;psychotropic medications&quot; if they are used for treatment of
             seizures.  Use of anti-epileptics for other indications such as the treatment of mood
             disorders counts towards the limit of permitted medications.  Concurrent use of
             omega-3 fatty acids is also permissible and does not count towards the allowed number
             of concomitant psychotropic medications. A complete list of permitted concomitant
             psychotropic medications can be found in Appendix A.

             medications stable in the 4 weeks preceding Screening and during the period between
             Screening and the commencement of study medication.

               1. Permitted psychotropic concomitant medications (except for anti-epileptic
                  medications-see below) must be stable, in terms of dose and dosing regimen, for
                  at least 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period

          7. Behavioral treatments excluding psychotherapy (see exclusion criteria) must be stable
             for 4 weeks prior to Screening and must remain stable during the period between
             Screening and the commencement of study medication

             a. For each enrollee, every effort should be made to maintain stable regimens of
             allowed concomitant medications and allowed behavioral therapies from the time of
             commencement of single-blind study medication until the last study assessment.

             lithium, minocycline, acamprosate, racemic baclofen, investigational metabotropic
             glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) medications, d-cycloserine, oxytocin,
             carbetocin, tricyclic antidepressants, modafinil,  armodafinil, benzodiazepines
