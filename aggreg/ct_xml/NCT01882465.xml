    <textblock>
      Limbal ring contact lenses enhance the look of the eye by adding pigmentation in a ring
      pattern to the contact lens. The purpose of this investigation is to determine if corneal
      staining increase is dependent upon the lens pigment location.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. Fluency in English an ability to read and understand written English.

          3. The subject must be able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this
             clinical protocol.

          4. The subject must be between 18 and 35 years of age.

          5. The subject must be an adapted (minimum of 4 week history of daily wear prior to the
             baseline study visit) soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          6. The subject must be East or Southeast Asia descent, e.g. ethnic Chinese, Japanese,
             Korean, Malay, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Filipino, etc. by self-report.

          7. The subject must come in with a current (no more than 12 month old) spectacle or
             contact lens prescription as indicated. (NB: Emmetropic subjects who wear contact
             lenses for enhancement purposes only will also require a current contact lens
             prescription).

          8. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of PLANO to -6.00D in each eye.

          9. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity on +0.24logMAR (equivalent to
             20/30 (-2)) or better in each eye.

         10. The subjects own a wearable pair of spectacles (as indicated by current prescription)
             and wear them to all visits including the screening visit as required for vision
             correction. They must be willing to wear their spectacles during the 24 hour washout
             period leading up to each treatment visit (NB: Emmetropic subjects who do  not own
             spectacles must   agree to no lens wear on all visit days including the screening
             visit).

         11. The subject must have  normal eye (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are currently pregnant or lactating, determined by self-report (subjects who become
             pregnant during the study will be discontinued).

          2. Have any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact
             lens wear.

          3. Have any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may
             interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but may not be limited to
             diabetes, hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjogren's syndromes,
             xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, Stevens-Johnson syndromes.

          4. Use any topical medication such as eye drops or ointment.

          5. Have entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history
             of recurrent corneal erosions, or aphakia.

          6. Had any previous, or have planned, ocular or intraocular surgery (e.g., cataract
             surgery, radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, ect.).

          7. Have any grade 3.0 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g., edema, corneal
             neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection)
             on the Efron classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may
             contraindicate contact lens wear.

          8. Have any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to contact lenses (As assessed
             by ocular history).

          9. Have any ocular infection.

         10. Have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable
             contact lens wear.

         11. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14
             days prior to study enrollment.

         12. Have any infectious disease (e.g., hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV), by self-report.

         13. Currently wear their contact lenes on an extended wear basis.

         14. Is an employee of the investigational clinic (e.g., Investigator, Coordinator,
             Technician).

         15. Currently wears toric or multifocal contact lenses. If the subject wears soft contact
             lenses for monovision, they must be willing to wear distance only correction in both
             eyes for the study.
