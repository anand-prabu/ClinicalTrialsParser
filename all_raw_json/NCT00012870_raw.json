There has been a lack of research regarding nonpharmacologic\n      interventions with patients with heart failure and other chronic conditions.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The primary objective of this 4-year study was to determine the effect of a nurse-led\n      behavioral management intervention on health-related quality in patients with\n      medically-managed heart failure.  The secondary objective was to assess the impact of the\n      behavioral management intervention on health care resource utilization.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      DESIGN: randomized controlled trial.  SETTING: single site, VA San Diego Healthcare System.\n      SAMPLE: Patients were enrolled in 11 cohorts a total of 116 outpatients were randomly\n      assigned to one of two treatment groups to evaluate the clinical impact of the intervention.\n       Group 1 received usual care for patients with heart failure (n=58).  Group 2 was an\n      augmented group receiving usual care plus participation in the 15-week (4-month) behavioral\n      management program (n=58).  Inclusion criteria were that the patient had a primary diagnosis\n      of heart failure, a VA primary care provider, stable symptoms for at least one month and was\n      able to walk.  INTERVENTION: The behavioral management program augmented usual care and\n      consisted of establishing specific goals with patients related to healthier diet, increased\n      quality and amount of exercise, smoking cessation, and increased social and interpersonal\n      activities.  DEPENDENT VARIABLES/OUTCOME MEASURES:  The five major dependent variables for\n      this study were psychological symptom distress (Multiple Affect Adjective Check List -\n      MAACL), physical functioning (SF-36 physical component summary score), mental functioning\n      (SF-36 mental component summary score), exercise capability (6-Minute Walk), and general\n      health perceptions (SF-36 general health scale score).  Dependent variables were assessed at\n      baseline, at the end of treatment (at 4 months), and then at 10 and 16 months.  DATA\n      ANALYSIS:  Initial analyses included all subjects who were randomized to treatment and\n      completed all data collection time points in a series of 2 by 4 ANOVAs with time as a\n      repeated measure.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed. Final report submitted August 2003"
