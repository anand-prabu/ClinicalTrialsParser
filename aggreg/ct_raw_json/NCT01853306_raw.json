Subject who has received strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A, 1A1, 2D6, or 2C19\n             within 3 days or five half-lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the first dose of\n             veliparib (applicable to Part 1 only).\n\n          6.

Questions\n             regarding the inclusion of individual subject should be directed to the Medical\n             Monitor.\n\n         12. History of gastric surgery, vagotomy, bowel resection or any surgical procedure that\n             might interfere with gastrointestinal motility, pH or absorption.\n\n         13. Receipt of any investigational product within 28 days prior to study drug\n             administration or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer.\n\n         14. Current enrollment in another clinical study.\n\n         15. Consideration by the investigator, for any reason, that the subject is an unsuitable\n             candidate to receive veliparib."
