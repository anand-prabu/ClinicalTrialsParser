Systolic, diastolic\n      and mean blood pressures, heart rate, Spo2, ECG, adverse effects during the operation were\n      recorded. Double cuffed tourniquet were placed on the extremity to be operated to hinder\n      nerve injuries. With Esmarch bandage venous blood in the extremity was purged. Proximal cuff\n      was inflated with a pressure 50-100 mmHg higher than systolic blood pressure and the bandage\n      was displaced. Randomly patients were divided into 2 groups. Group 1: %0.5\n      Lidocaine+Ketamine 0.8 mg/kg; 40 ml. Group 2: %0.5 Lidocaine 40 ml. Anesthetic agent was\n      injected with a rate of 20 ml/min. 20 minutes after injection the distal cuff was inflated\n      and the proximal cuff deflated with a rate of 50 mmHg in every 3 minutes. 0,5,10,15,30,45,60\n      minutes after the beginning of deflation and 10 minutes after the deflation was completed\n      ECG were recorded. PR,QT,QTc, RR were recorded."
