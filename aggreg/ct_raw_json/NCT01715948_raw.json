            "description": "Patients who have been implanted with a BAHA over the past three years will be given a two-week trial period with a CROS hearing aid. The CROS uses two hearing aids that fit behind each ear. The hearing aid fitted on the side of the poor ear houses a microphone and a transmitter. The hearing aid fitted on the normal ear side houses a receiver that is connected to an open ear tip.  Sounds on the side of the poor ear are picked up by the microphone and transmitted to the opposite normal ear, overcoming the head shadow effect that presents with unilateral deafness."

        "brief_summary": {
            "textblock": "People with single-sided deafness (SSD) have significant hearing loss in one ear and normal\n      or near normal hearing in the other ear.  Those living with SSD experience several\n      communication difficulties, particularly when listening to speech in the presence of\n      background noise.  This problem is worse in situations where the noise is on the side of the\n      good ear and the speech is on the side of the poor ear.\n\n      The Bone-Anchored Hearing Aid (BAHA) and the Contralateral Routing of Signals (CROS) hearing\n      aid are two devices designed to improve hearing in people who have significant hearing loss\n      in one ear only.  The BAHA is a surgically implanted device which also includes an external\n      processor; sounds from the poor ear are transmitted to the good ear through skull\n      vibrations. The CROS does not involve surgery; instead a hearing aid is fitted behind each\n      ear, and the sounds on the side of the poor ear are wirelessly transmitted to the good ear.\n\n      The majority of previous studies comparing the BAHA to the CROS have used older CROS models\n      with basic technology and a wire along the neck to send sounds from the poor ear to the good\n      ear.  There is a lack of studies comparing newer digital wireless CROS hearing aids to the\n      BAHA. The current research will compare the effect of the BAHA and CROS hearing aid on\n      speech perception scores when listening to speech in quiet and in noise. The research will\n      also investigate patients' reported benefits with each device during everyday situations. In\n      order to compare the BAHA and CROS, individuals who already have been implanted with a BAHA\n      will be given a trial period with a new wireless digital CROS hearing aid.\n\n      The research hypothesis states that the CROS hearing aid will be as equally beneficial or\n      greater than the BAHA in improving hearing and patient benefit. If the findings support the\n      hypothesis that the CROS offers just as much benefits as the BAHA, or is an even better\n      alternative, more patients may choose to avoid surgery and decide to receive a CROS hearing\n      aid instead."
