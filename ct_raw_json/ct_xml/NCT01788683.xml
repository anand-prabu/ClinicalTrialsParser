  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement in subject-reported
      clinical outcomes, for Regenexx SD treatment vs. Exercise Therapy of non-retracted
      supraspinatus tendon tears, from baseline to 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy
      and durability up to 24 months.

      Secondary objectives include evaluation of US evidence of tendon repair; incidence of
      post-operative complications, adverse events, re-injections, and surgical intervention;
      change in pain score and use of pain medications.

      Prospective, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 25
      subjects treated with Exercise Therapy alone.

      Subjects will have a non-retracted supraspinatus tendon tear comprising at least one half
      the tendon thickness in the anterior-posterior and/or superior-inferior planes as evidenced
      with positive diagnostic imaging such as arthrogram, ultrasound and/or MR.

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to Regenexx-SD injection or initiation of
      exercise therapy and take part in follow-up visits for two years following treatment.  A
      preoperative visit will occur at the time of enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the
      clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months post injection.
      Target enrollment is 50 subjects, to include 25 subjects treated with Regenexx SD and 25
      subjects treated with exercise therapy alone.

      The primary endpoint analysis will be conducted once all subjects reach the 3 month
      endpoint. At that point, subjects enrolled in the Exercise Therapy group will be given the
      option of crossing over to the Regenexx SD treatment groups. Subjects will continue to be
      followed through the 2 year endpoint with data analysis performed at the 1 year and 2 year
      time points.

      Subjects will complete the study following the 2 year follow-up visit.
