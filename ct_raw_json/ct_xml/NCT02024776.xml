  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances, morbidity and mortality associated to major abdominal surgery is
      significant. A poor physical condition and functional status reduces the ability of a person
      to cope, mentally and physically, with hospitalization and surgery and may compromise
      functional recovery, potentially leading to postoperative complications and death.
      Prehabilitation aims to enhance functional capacity preoperatively for better toleration of
      surgery and to facilitate recovery and eventually the prognosis of the surgical patient.
      Whereas the benefits of cardiopulmonary fitness programs are well established, the
      accessibility, sustainability of effects, and impact on the surgical outcome of these
      programs are unsolved issues. Wellness programs based on integrated care services supported
      by Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can overcome such limitations. The
      investigators hypothesized that a prehabilitation program, inducing beneficial effects on
      exercise capacity, may improve the surgical outcome in high-risk patients. Moreover, ICT
      support may contribute to increase the adherence and sustainability of this intervention.

    <description>Prehabilitation program is defined as a tailored physical exercise program to be carried out to a patient on the basis of his/her health condition, social circumstances and adherence profile. The intervention consisted of a standard 4-6 week supervised outpatient program including global endurance exercise training, or educational sessions followed by a self-management program supported by ICT during the follow-up period, or a combination of both.</description>
