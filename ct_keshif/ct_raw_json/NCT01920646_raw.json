            "textblock": "The combination of poverty-related infectious and lifestyle-related non-communicable\n      diseases, both driven by malnutrition, causes a high burden for South Africa. Healthy and\n      nutritious diets for populations depend on availability and accessibility of a variety of\n      plant and animal foods, within a context that promotes and supports healthy behaviour. Food\n      based strategies, such as supplementation, food fortification, and diversification of crops,\n      are used to achieve optimal dietary requirements to combat malnutrition, including\n      micronutrient deficiencies. A more sustainable food based strategy is the (promotion of) use\n      of indigenous and traditional foods, such as African Leafy Vegetables (ALVs). Unfortunately,\n      several studies from all over Africa have shown that there is a shift from traditional diets\n      as result of the preparing techniques and the absence of women in homes. Furthermore,\n      indigenous and traditional foods are considered as \"poor people's food\".\n\n      Against this background, a joint project between South Africa, Kenya and Benin is designed\n      to fill the gaps in knowledge in these countries regarding the availability, acceptability\n      and consumption and evidenced based benefits of foods from local biodiversity. The main aim\n      of the study in South Africa is to provide empirical evidence of how the role of\n      biodiversity can be translated into improved health status in contemporary poor rural and\n      urban communities in the North West Province of South Africa. In order to achieve this it is\n      important to gain knowledge on the possibility of using ALVs as a strategy to alleviate\n      micronutrient deficiencies. Therefore an intervention study to determine the effect of\n      selected ALV on the nutritional status (including zinc, iron, and vitamin A status) of\n      school children (grade R-4) residing in contemporary poor rural community in the North West\n      Province, South Africa has been designed."
