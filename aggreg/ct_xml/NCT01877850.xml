    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the difference of the duration of weaning process
      from the ventilator between protocol-driven weaned patients and clinical judgment driven
      weaned patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with difficult weaning and who required tracheostomy are enrolled in the study.
      These patients are randomized as &quot;Caso or Controllo&quot; by a computer program. For all this
      patients are calculated modified-BWAP(BWAP-M) and TOBIN indexes. The &quot;CASO&quot; patients can
      start the weaning protocol process only if BWAP-M value is more than 15 or BWAP-M 10-15 with
      Tobin index &lt; 100.

      If not, the BWAP-M and Tobin will be calculated every day. The Control patients will start
      weaning by clinical judgement even if the BWAP-M value is less than 10.

      For all patients are calculated: the duration of weaning process, the ICU length of stay and
      the duration of the mechanical ventilation.
