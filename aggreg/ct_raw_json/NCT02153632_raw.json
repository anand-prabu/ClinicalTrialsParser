It\n      has been reported in the literature to effectively treat the motor complications of\n      levodopa, especially dyskinesia, but it must be given 2 to 4 times a day. The purpose of\n      this multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, 26 week study is to compare the\n      efficacy and safety of two different dose levels of Amantadine Extended Release Tablets to\n      placebo for the treatment of levodopa induced dyskinesia in patients with Parkinson's\n      disease. The dose will be given once a day in the morning so that amantadine concentrations\n      are maintained throughout the day for treating the levodopa induced dyskinesia, but will be\n      lower during the night, potentially reducing the negative impact of amantadine on sleep."
