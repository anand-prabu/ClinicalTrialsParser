            "textblock": "This study is a first-in-human, double-blind (neither investigator nor participant knows\n      which treatment the participant receives), randomized (participants are assigned different\n      treatments based on chance), placebo-controlled (placebo is an inactive substance that is\n      compared with a drug to test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial),\n      single-ascending dose study. The study is designed to evaluate the safety (side effects),\n      tolerability and pharmacokinetics (how the drug is absorbed in the body, distributed within\n      the body, and how it is removed from the body over time, ie, what the body does to the\n      drug), and pharmacodynamics (what the drug does to the body) of JNJ-54861911 which is\n      currently being developed for the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease.\n\n      The study population will consist of approximately 64 healthy participants divided among\n      approximately 8 cohorts (small groups). Each cohort will have 8 participants.\n\n      For all participants the study will consist of 3 phases: a screening phase (between 28 and 2\n      days prior to the first dose administration), a double-blind treatment phase, and a\n      follow-up examination (within 7 to 14 days after last dose administration). Participants who\n      successfully complete the screening examination and are considered eligible to participate\n      will be admitted to the clinical unit on Day -1 before administration of the study drug and\n      will remain in the unit until the evening of Day 3.\n\n      The double-blind treatment phase will consist of three parts:  Part 1 (Cohorts 1 to 3) is a\n      single ascending dose part in young healthy male participants, between 18 and 54 years of\n      age. Part 2 (Cohorts 4 to 7) is a single-ascending dose part in elderly male and female\n      participants between 55 and 75 years of age including continuous cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\n      sampling.  Within Parts 1 and 2 of the study, participants will be randomized (assigned by\n      chance) to treatment with JNJ-54861911 (n=6/cohort) or matching placebo (n=2/cohort).\n      Following each dose level, the observed safety and tolerability profile will be evaluated.\n      If no side effects are observed and the pharmacokinetic data are roughly in line with\n      predicted safe values, the dose will be escalated. Each participant of the next cohort will\n      be given a higher dose of JNJ-54861911. As a general safety precaution for a first-in-human\n      study, all dose administrations in Part 1, Cohort 1 and all further cohorts will be\n      staggered.\n\n      Part 1 of the study will primarily focus on determining safety and tolerability of\n      JNJ-54861911 after single ascending dose administrations and understanding the primary\n      pharmacokinetic characteristics of JNJ-54861911. In addition possible pharmacodynamic\n      effects of JNJ-54861911 on plasma amyloid beta (A\u03b2) levels will be explored.  The primary\n      focus of Part 2 will be determining the maximal tolerated dose level of JNJ-54861911 or\n      determine the safety and tolerability at the maximum feasible exposure level, whichever is\n      reached first in healthy elderly participants. In addition the reduction in CSF A\u03b2 over 36\n      hours post single dose administration of JNJ-54861911 will be explored.  Planned doses will\n      be 1 mg, 3 mg, 9 mg, 27 mg, 81 mg, and 160 mg of JNJ- 54861911 or matching placebo,\n      administered as a single oral dose. The starting dose of JNJ-54861911 in Part 2 will be the\n      dose level tested in Part 1 found to be safe and well tolerated, and that is expected to\n      reduce CSF A\u03b2 by 20 percent or more. The initial dose tested in Part 2 will not be higher\n      than the doses tested in Part 1.\n\n      Part 3 (Cohort 8) of the study will evaluate the effect of food on how JNJ-54861911 is\n      absorbed, distributed within the body, and removed from the body. One single dose of\n      JNJ-54861911 or matching placebo will be tested after consumption of a high fat breakfast.\n      The dose of JNJ-54861911 tested in this part will be derived from the results obtained in\n      Parts 1 and 2. Part 3 may be performed in parallel with Part 1 or 2 of the study. Depending\n      on the pharmacokinetic properties and safety and tolerability profile of JNJ-54861911, young\n      or elderly healthy participants may be recruited for this part. In addition male\n      participants enrolled in Part 1 or Part 2 may also be enrolled for Part 3.\n\n      Participants will be discharged from the clinical unit after the last study assessment on\n      Day 3 has been obtained. Participants will only be discharged if in the opinion of the\n      investigator it is safe for the participants to be discharged.  The participant will return\n      to the clinical unit on Day 4 (72 h post dose) and Day 5 (96 h post dose) for plasma PK\n      sampling. Safety assessments will be performed throughout the study. The maximal study\n      duration for a participant will not exceed 6 weeks."
