Treatment options are limited, and there is a pressing need for new\n      interventions to treat MS-related cognitive impairment.  Glucose (a type of sugar) is used\n      to fuel the cells of the healthy brain. For people with neurological conditions such as MS,\n      glucose is not converted into energy as efficiently as it would be in a healthy brain, which\n      can lead to a decrease in cognitive function.  Caprylic Triglyceride may work to bypass this\n      problem by providing an alternative energy source that is metabolized in the liver and used\n      by the brain.\n\n      Objective: To evaluate the therapeutic effects of 90 days of caprylic triglyceride on\n      cognitive impairment in multiple sclerosis.\n\n      Design: Randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled trial of 158 subjects.\n\n      Outcome: Change in Total Learning (Trials 1-5) on the California Verbal Learning Test-2nd\n      Edition-(CVLT-II)  AND Change in Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) (at day 90"
