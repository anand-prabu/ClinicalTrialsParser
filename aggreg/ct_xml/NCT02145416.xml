    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single centre imaging study which will be offered to all consecutive,
      eligible patients receiving radical chemoradiation therapy (CRT) for anal cancer within
      Oxford University Hospitals. Hypothesising that patients with no resolution of poor
      vascularity or hypoxia, correlate with those likely to be at risk of relapse; and half of
      those patients could be identified with this technique, we would anticipate at least 3 of 16
      patients to demonstrate minimal change in Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC).

      Investigations

        -  Dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE MRI)

        -  Diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (DWI MRI)

        -  Blood oxygen-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD MRI)

        -  Perfusion computed tomography (pCT)

        -  Fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET/CT)

      Study Design: Observational

      Patient Numbers: 16 evaluable patients

      Target Population: Patients undergoing radical CRT for anal cancer in Oxford University
      Hospitals National Health Service (NHS) Trust.

      Duration on study: Patients should be on study for a maximum of 5 months.

      Patient care post-trial: Follow up as per local standard.

      No. of Study Site(s): Single Centre, United Kingdon (UK)

      End of study: Last Patient, last assessment of response. Patients should be on study for a
      maximum of 5 months.
