  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a 4-arm, Randomized Control Trial among members of CVS Caremark with suboptimal
      cholesterol control who are at high risk for CVD, the study investigators propose to test
      the effectiveness of different behavioral economic techniques in inducing habit formation
      for adherence to statin use and sustained reductions in LDL cholesterol after financial
      incentives are discontinued. Primary outcome is changes in LDL from enrollment to 12 months
      (6 months after cessation of financial incentives).
