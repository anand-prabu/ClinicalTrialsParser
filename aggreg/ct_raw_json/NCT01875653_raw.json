It is called an experimental\n      therapy (or \"study therapy\") because it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA).  This research study will use the patient's own tumor cells,the\n      patient's own dendritic cells (a type of immune cell), and a granulocyte-macrophage colony\n      stimulating factor (GM-CSF, a type of growth factor).  GM-CSF is a natural growth factor\n      that stimulates white blood cells in the body.  Since 1991, GM-CSF has been used as a\n      medical standard to help increase the number of white blood cells after chemotherapy.\n\n      The patient's dendritic cells are grown in a test-tube with the patient's tumor cells and\n      the growth factor.  The resulting solution is called the study therapy.  The intent of the\n      study therapy is to make the dendritic cells more effective at fighting the tumor when they\n      are injected back into the patient."
