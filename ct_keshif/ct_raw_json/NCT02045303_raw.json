            "textblock": "This prospective pilot study is designed to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of a wound\n      care ultrasound treatment protocol for sub-acute or chronic wounds of the lower extremity\n      and of any etiology. The Viana-Pompeo (VIP) ultrasound protocol consists of high intensity,\n      low frequency, contact ultrasound therapy (with Sonoca-180) followed by low intensity,\n      low-frequency, noncontact ultrasound therapy (with MIST Therapy). Previously published\n      healing rates for each of the ultrasonic therapy modalities will be used as a comparison.\n\n      The Physical Therapist will perform the initial assessment and treatment, and devise an\n      individualized plan of care that involves contact ultrasound followed by noncontact\n      ultrasound. Subjects may remain in the study for up to 12 weeks, or up to when end of study\n      criteria is met.\n\n      Transition from contact mode to noncontact mode will happen when:\n\n      - Wound is sufficiently clean with \u2264 20% of necrotic tissue or adherent slough.\n\n      OR\n\n      - >= 80% of soft slough is easily removed from the wound bed with mechanical or selective\n      debridement before or after treatment\n\n      OR\n\n      - Wound bed quality has failed to progress after 3 consecutive contact ultrasound treatments\n\n      For the purposes of this study, treatments will be performed 3 times a week. Treatment time\n      will be dependent on the wound area, at least 20 sec/cm2, per standard protocol.\n\n      Only the wounds present during Physical Therapy (PT) initial assessment will be included in\n      the research. If the patient develops new wounds during the course of the research, the\n      patient will receive appropriate treatment, but such wounds will not be part of the study.\n\n      Patients in the wound clinic setting are allowed to perform home dressing changes as ordered\n      by the physician in addition to the dressing changes performed by the therapist or wound\n      clinic nurse on clinic visit days. Patients and/or caregivers will be trained in dressing\n      changes techniques and must understand the procedure prior to performing dressing changes on\n      their own.\n\n      Patients in the acute setting will have dressing changes by the nurse on days where patient\n      is not seen by the Physical Therapist.\n\n      In addition to ultrasonic treatment and dressing changes, wound debridement may be performed\n      each visit as needed. Digital photography and wound measurements will also be performed\n      weekly and as needed.\n\n      End of PT wound therapy may be before, at, or after the end of the study period. The\n      beginning of the MIST therapy will depend on the individual characteristics and wound needs.\n\n      A minimum of 4 MIST treatments must be completed for a patient's data to be included the\n      data analysis in the acute care setting.\n\n      A minimum of 2 treatments per week (goal of 3 per week) must be reached for the 12 week\n      period for a patient's data to be included in the data analysis.\n\n      Study Endpoints\n\n      Primary endpoint:\n\n        -  Wound area reduction\n\n        -  Percent granulation tissue\n\n        -  Length of the study for ambulatory subjects: 12 weeks from Start of Contact Ultrasound\n           therapy\n\n        -  Length of the study for acute care subjects: From Start of Contact Ultrasound therapy\n           up to 12 weeks or until patient is discharged from the hospital.\n\n      Secondary endpoint:\n\n        -  Wound closure at any point within the length of study\n\n        -  Failure to note improvement in wound area, and/or wound volume, and/or wound bed\n           quality after 4 consecutive weeks of treatment.\n\n        -  3 consecutive missed visits, or a total of 7 missed visits"
