            "textblock": "Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging tool for monitoring functional\n      and metabolic responses of biological events with specific radiotracer in vivo. The PET\n      tracer [18F]Fluciclatide is an 18F radiolabeled small peptide containing the RGD\n      (arginine-glycine-aspartate) tri-peptide, which preferentially binds with high affinity to\n      \u03b1v\u03b23 and \u03b1v\u03b25 integrins. \u03b1v\u03b23-integrins are expressed at low levels on epithelial cells and\n      mature endothelial cells but are expressed at high levels on activated endothelial cells in\n      the neo-vasculature of a range of tumors and it also may regulate angiogenesis. If pazopanib\n      acts mainly on active angiogenetic tumors, the quantitative uptake of [18F]Fluciclatide can\n      be used to predict the effect of this antiangiogenic drug.  The investigators expected the\n      baseline tumor uptake in [18F]Fluciclatide to be able to predict treatment response, and\n      planned a study of [18F]FluciclatidePET for patients with metastatic RCC who received\n      pazopanib systemic therapy."
