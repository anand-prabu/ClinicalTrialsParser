      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a caregiver skill training program (HI-FIVES),
      offered as a part of a randomized control trial to caregivers of Veterans referred to home
      and community-based long-term care. Of primary interest is to examine whether participating
      in HI-FIVES leads to clinically significant increases in days spent at home for Veterans
      compared to caregivers in usual care. The investigators aim, through the training, to
      decrease the number of days over 12 months post-intervention that Veterans spend in the
      emergency department, hospital, or nursing home. Days spent in these settings reduces the
      Veteran's quality of life and increases health care costs to the VA. The investigators also
      will evaluate whether caregivers in HI-FIVES have clinically significant reductions in
      depressive symptoms post-intervention compared to caregivers in usual care.

      Anticipated Impacts on Veteran's Healthcare: Designing and implementing a training program
      for informal caregivers of functionally impaired Veterans (HI-FIVES) will enhance Veterans'
      ability to remain in their homes and satisfaction with care, as well as lower VA costs.
      Caregiver training can also improve caregiver wellbeing by alleviating feelings of
      depression and burden, which can also improve the care they provide to veterans. Our
      caregiver training program is consistent with features of two recent national policy changes
      aimed to improve quality of care for veterans. First, providing training to informal
      caregivers of functionally impaired veterans is consistent with the 2000 Millennium Health
      Care Act, which mandated an unprecedented expansion in long-term care benefits to Veterans,
      and stipulated that, whenever possible, care be provided in the least restrictive
      environment possible-the home. Second, The Caregivers and Veterans Omnibus Health Services
      Act of 2010 mandated unprecedented support for informal caregivers of severely injured
      OEF/OIF Veterans, including providing caregiver training to informal caregivers of any era
      veteran. Achieving higher quality informal care supports both of these mandates. By
      partnering with VA providers, HI-FIVES will improve the skill of caregivers, thereby
      improving veteran health care quality and the ability for veterans to remain at home.

      Project Background: Caregiver burnout, strain and burden are associated with caregiver
      depression and patient institutionalization. Furthermore, lack of skills among caregivers
      can lead to depression and anxiety as well as patient institutionalization. The
      investigators propose to evaluate an innovative program that supports and trains informal
      caregivers when veterans are referred to VHA home and community-based care (HCBC), a
      critical moment in a veteran's VHA health care use trajectory. Referral to HCBC is a time
      when caregivers may face personal strain and uncertainty about demands involved in
      caregiving. As such, it presents a teachable moment to train caregivers to better meet the
      demands imposed by caregiving.

      Project Objectives: To evaluate whether over 12 months, veterans with caregivers in the
      skill training program have clinically significant increases in days at home than veterans
      in usual care (e.g. days not in emergency department, hospital, or nursing home). In
      addition, the investigators will evaluate whether veterans in the skill training program
      have significantly lower VA costs of medical care or higher satisfaction with VHA over 6 and
      12 months than veterans in usual care. Finally, the investigators will evaluate whether
      caregivers in the skill training program have clinically significant reductions in
      depressive symptoms, subjective burden, or increased satisfaction with VA healthcare at 6
      and12 months than caregivers in usual care.

      Project Methods: The study is a randomized controlled trial with data collection from
      caregiver-patient dyads before and after training, and at 6 and 12 months after program
      completion. Piloted in early 2012, the setting is the Social Work Service at the Durham
      VAMC. Patient inclusion criteria are patient referred to home and community-based services
      in the past 3 months, not eligible for hospice, residing at home, has an informal caregiver,
      and willing to let investigators contact the caregiver. Caregivers must be cognitively and
      physically capable to participate, understand English, not be treated for a substance abuse
      disorder, not be in another caregiver interventional study, and willing to participate in 3
      phone call trainings and attend five group sessions at the VA. Caregivers in the control
      group will receive the training and support usually provided by HCBC and VA medical
      providers. To be referred successfully to HCBC, patients will have a minimum of 2 activity
      of daily living limitations, and are likely to have multimorbidity, including high rates of
      cognitive impairment (44% in the pilot). The target sample size will be 146 caregivers in
      each arm. Patient involvement will be limited to four short phone assessments (with
      mechanisms established for proxy respondents). Caregivers in the treatment arm will take
      part in three phone training sessions and five group sessions, and in both arms caregivers
      will be asked to provide four phone assessments. Descriptive statistics will be used to
      summarize all study variables. Of primary importance will be to examine the distribution of
      patient days spent at home during the first 3 months, the first 6 months, and over the
      entire 12 months of the post-intervention period (e.g. days not in ED, inpatient, or nursing
      home setting). Investigators will use the count-data regression model which best fits our
      data (Poisson, Negative Binomial or zero-inflated versions of Poisson or Negative Binomial)
      to test the primary hypothesis that veterans with caregivers in the skill training program
      will have significantly more days spent at home than veterans in usual care.

    <description>Usual care will be the Veteran patient care and caregiver support that are normally offered once the Geriatrics and Extended Care (GEC) referral process has occurred. This process entails the patient and caregiver work with the social worker assigned to the patient to obtain home and community based care (HCBC) services. The patients in the usual care group will be free to seek medical, psychological, social support, and social services that are available through VAMCs or any other source. In addition to this, caregivers in the usual care arm will be told about the caregiver support programs in the VHA and the caregiver will receive the national VA caregiver hotline phone number (see Appendix VI for this pamphlet). The information provided mirrors efforts to support caregivers in the VA nationally and new standards of care for VA caregivers. This will be the only contact with the usual care subjects besides the scheduled data collection assessments.</description>

    <description>Caregivers in the HI-FIVES group will receive individual calls with a nurse educator to address topics he/she identified as being the highest priority learning areas. After the phone calls, caregivers will participate in evidence-based group sessions aimed to improve clinical care skills, psychological care skills, and support-seeking skills. The curriculum will be delivered by a trained nurse educator on the research team and the PI and VA Caregiver Support Staff. Three individual telephone training calls will be tailored to the individual needs of Veteran-caregiver dyad. Four group training sessions will be targeted to address common needs of Veterans and their caregivers. Given that all Veteran care recipients will have at least 2 or 3 ADL limitations.  After the final group session, there will be two optional booster calls at one and three months.  Four assessments in all will be collected, baseline (in person), and at 3, 9, and 15 months (by phone).</description>
