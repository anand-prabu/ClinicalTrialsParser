Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on participants\n           health and reintegration in intervention households compared to participants in delayed\n           control households.  Health and reintegration will be measured at baseline and six,\n           twelve, and 18-months post-baseline using self-report in both intervention and delayed\n           control groups. We hypothesize that at six, twelve and 18 months post-baseline\n           participants in intervention households will have improved health and increased\n           reintegration to families in comparison to participants in control households.\n\n        2. Determine the effectiveness of a village-led microfinance program on household economic\n           stability in intervention households compared to delayed control villages. Household\n           economic stability will be measured at baseline and six, twelve and 18 months post-\n           baseline using self-report in both intervention and control households. We hypothesize\n           that at six, twelve and 18-months post-baseline the intervention households will have\n           improved household economic stability in comparison to control households.\n\n        3. Examine the role of a village-led microfinance program on village-level health,\n           economics, stigma and reintegration of survivors and their families in intervention and\n           delayed control villages. Village members (n=5 in each village, n=50 total) will\n           complete a baseline and 18 month post-baseline qualitative interview to examine the\n           role of microfinance on village-level health, economics, stigma and reintegration in\n           both intervention and control households."

            "textblock": "Mobutu Sese Seko's government of \"Kleptocracy\" collapsed in 1997 after 30 years of\n      oppression. The new nation that emerged, the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), remains an\n      all-to-potent reminder of how human rights violations, and their related health and economic\n      impacts, can devastate individuals, families and communities.  The genocide in neighboring\n      Rwanda, coupled with the collapse of the Mobutu government, has spawned two wars and over a\n      decade of warfare throughout the region, resulting in millions of deaths in what is the\n      deadliest conflict since World War II 1. The last decade has seen the use of rape as a\n      weapon of war in the DRC, where rebels and soldiers subject women, men and children to\n      brutalizing attacks, rape, torture, and mutilation.  Survivors of the assault are often\n      further traumatized by infections, disease, poverty, stigma and social isolation.\n\n      The US plays a significant role in global health. It is both the largest funder of\n      innovation in global health and the largest donor to care and support programs in\n      sub-Saharan Africa\u2014notably through The US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief\n      (PEPFAR) and responses to humanitarian crisis, such as USAID funded programs in DRC. The\n      effectiveness and sustainability of these efforts are limited by gaps in knowledge of the\n      role of social determinants, such as poverty, social isolation, chronic stress and trauma,\n      and limited access to health care services has on the health of women and families. To begin\n      to address these gaps, our overall goal is to build the science base for large-scale\n      implementation of economic programs to improve the health of survivors of trauma living in\n      man-made and natural disaster settings."
