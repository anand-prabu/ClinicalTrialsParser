After 3 weeks\n      of rest, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1 every 2 weeks for 3 courses.\n      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously on days 3-10 of each doxorubicin and\n      docetaxel course. Within 6 weeks of completion of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, patients undergo\n      surgery with mastectomy or lumpectomy and axillary lymph node dissection.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
