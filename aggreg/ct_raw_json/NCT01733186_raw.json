Despite the numerous\n      techniques available today, complete healing of damaged or defective cartilage or consistent\n      reproduction of normal hyaline cartilage does not occur, and continuous drug administration\n      or secondary surgeries are common.\n\n      Research in mesenchymal stem cells has had a rapid acceleration over the past decade and\n      MSC-based therapy has become one of the objects of investigation for a new branch of\n      medicine termed regenerative medicine. This emerging technology shows great promise for\n      producing transplantable cartilage constructs to restore the function of degenerated joints.\n\n      CARTISTEM\u00ae, a combination of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and\n      sodium hyaluronate, is intended to be used as a single-dose cellular therapeutic agent for\n      cartilage regeneration in human subjects with cartilage defects of the knee as a result of\n      ageing, trauma, or degenerative diseases."
