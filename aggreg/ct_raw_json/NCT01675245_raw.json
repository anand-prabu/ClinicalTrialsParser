The study consists of 3 phases, including, screening phase, treatment\n      phase, and follow up phase. In the screening phase, data will be collected on the basis of\n      patient's demographic status, components of disease severity assessment, and potential\n      prognostic factors. Data on prior cancer treatments will be collected retrospectively at\n      baseline for patients receiving cancer treatment prior to receiving Velcade. In the\n      treatment phase, Velcade is administered intravenously for a 2-week treatment period\n      followed by a 10-day rest period. Each treatment cycle consists of 21 days. Prospective (in\n      which the participants are first identified and then followed forward as time passes)\n      observational data will be collected during treatment with Velcade.  In the follow up phase,\n      patients will be followed for up to three years to document long-term survival data. For\n      patients who reinitiate Velcade, data collection should follow Velcade treatment period\n      documentation process. Safety evaluations will be based on the incidence, intensity, and\n      types of adverse events.  The total duration of the study is set prospectively for three\n      years from the date of the patients' initiation of Velcade."
