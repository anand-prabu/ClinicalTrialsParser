However, several studies have demonstrated that\n      hand exercises and CMC-orthoses may reduce pain and improve grip strength, and in a recent\n      study, assistive devices improved activity performance and satisfaction with performance in\n      people with hand-OA. Still, most people do not receive any such treatment, but those with\n      severe CMC-OA are often referred for surgery in this joint. The effect of occupational\n      therapy to prevent or delay need for surgery CMC-OA has been investigated in a small study\n      with 33 participants, but randomised controlled trails (RCT) of good quality are needed."
