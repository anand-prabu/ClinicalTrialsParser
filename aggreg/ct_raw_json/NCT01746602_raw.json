Given that thinning of the tear film appears to be a risk factor for the\n      development or the aggravation of dry eye syndrome, the current study seeks to investigate\n      whether tear film thickness is changed after topical treatment with anti-glaucomatous drugs\n      in healthy subjects.\n\n      For this purpose, tear film thickness will be measured at baseline and after single\n      instillation of one of 5 study drugs in one randomly chosen eye. In addition, one group of\n      20 subjects will receive no drug and will serve as a second control. Drug effects on tear\n      film thickness will be compared to the fellow, non-treated eye. In addition, effects on tear\n      film thickness of timolol with preservatives (Timoptic 0.5%) will be compared to timolol\n      without preservatives (Timophtal sine 0.5%) and three lubricants with different viscosity\n      (Genteal HA, Hylo-Comod, Thealoz)."
