            "textblock": "Respiratory muscle function is critical for maintaining effective alveolar ventilation, and\n      airway secretions clearance. The reduction in respiratory muscle function might lead to\n      chronic respiratory insufficiency, and potentially to life-threatening problems. Respiratory\n      muscle function and the impacts of various treatments regimens have not been investigated\n      longitudinally in patients with advanced lung cancer patients.\n\n      The purposes for the 1st phase of this study are to exam longitudinal changes and the impact\n      of various treatments on the respiratory muscle function, and the relations with dyspnea,\n      functional capacity, quality of life, 6- and 12-month respiratory morbidity, and survival\n      status (control group). The 2nd phase of this study will investigate the potential\n      beneficial effects of chest physiotherapy in the same patient population (intervention\n      group).\n\n      Methods: 102 patients with advanced lung cancer per group will be recruited from the\n      National Taiwan University Hospital. Demographic and clinical signs/syndromes will be\n      obtained from the chart. Pain and dyspnea will be measured using visual analog scale.\n      Respiratory muscle strength will be tested by measuring maximal inspiratory and expiratory\n      pressure (PImax and PEmax, respectively). Spirometric variables, forced expiratory volume in\n      one second (FEV1) and forced vital capacity (FVC) will be measured. Functional capacity will\n      be measured using Karnofsky performance status and Simmonds functional assessment.\n      Anxiety/depression symptom will be measured using Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale.\n      Quality of life will be measured using European Organization for Research and Treatment of\n      Cancer, EORTC QLQ-C30 and LC13 questionnaire. Six- and 12-month respiratory complication\n      morbidity and survival status will be recorded in the prospective nature.\n\n      Clinical relevance: The prevalence of lung cancer is increasing in the recent years. To\n      understand the indications for chest physiotherapy (e.g., respiratory muscle weakness and\n      its related sequels) and the effects of chest physiotherapy program will shed light on if\n      routine chest physiotherapy should be implanted for patients with advanced lung cancer\n      during treatment."
