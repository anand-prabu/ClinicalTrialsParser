            "textblock": "Based on current literature, the incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting varies\n      widely and can reach up to 40% in abdominal surgery patients. Thus, patient tolerability to\n      postoperative enteral feeds is taken as 60%. This is a superiority trial: group one is the\n      clear feeds group and patient tolerability in this group is taken to be 60%.  Group two is\n      the low residue diet group.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that the incidence of postoperative ileus is not affected by the\n      consistency of enteral diet given, and patients who are placed on low residue diet from\n      postoperative day one do not have an increased risk of postoperative nausea and vomiting as\n      compared to patients who are placed on clear feeds.\n\n      The primary endpoint measured is Patient tolerability, as evidenced by development of\n      vomiting on postoperative day two.\n\n      Key Inclusion criteria are:\n\n        1.
