One of the\n      mechanisms demonstrated in animal studies points towards deposition of iron in the brain\n      tissue following hemorrhage. Preliminary data in animal studies also support a favorable\n      effect of iron chelate agents on the extent of neural tissue damage. preliminary human\n      trials based on this hypothesis demonstrate safety of escalating doses of desferroxamine in\n      the human population. The evaluation of iron chelate agent in the context of hemorrhagic\n      stroke is entering into phase II/III trials.\n\n      There is no modality till date that can quantify this tissue iron non invasively. Some\n      preliminary studies have demonstrated the role of MRI in identifying parenchymal iron\n      deposition in traumatic brain injury. We propose to validate an MRI based method to not only\n      identify but also quantify the non heme iron levels deposited in brain tissue following\n      hemorrhagic stroke. Once validated this method will be a robust mechanism to reliably\n      quantify tissue iron in the brain which then can be closely followed through iron chelate\n      therapy in a trial setting."
