Myectomy was extended to the base of the papillary muscles, when midseptal thickening was present. The papillary muscles were grasped and pushed medially to visualize the abnormal connections between the papillary muscles and the anterior wall of the ventricle. A blade was used to divide the thickened abnormal attachments. A pituitary rongeur may be used to resect a portion of the junction of the papillary and lateral wall. This reduces the diameter of the papillary muscle and allows for posterior displacement of the anterior mitral leaflet. Division of abnormal attachments and thinning of the papillary muscles is critical for the treatment of SAM.",
