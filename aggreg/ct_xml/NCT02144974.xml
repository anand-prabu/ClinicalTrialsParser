  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Total pelvic exenteration (TPE) is a rare operation, which is the only possible curative
      intervention to treat central residual or recurrent  tumors of the vulvar, vaginal,
      cervical, or uterine malignancies after initial surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy.
      Several options for pelvic floor and vaginal reconstruction have been described. The
      transverse musculocutaneous gracilis (TMG) flap has been introduced for breast
      reconstruction as a free flap. The investigators adopted the pedicled TMG flap for
      reconstruction after TPE.

      Between November 2011 and February 2014, twelve patients underwent TPE and reconstruction
      with unilateral (6 patients) or bilateral (6 patients) pedicled TMG flaps. Five patients had
      vaginal reconstruction with bilateral TMG flaps. The investigators describe the operative
      procedure and the outcome of the operation in these patients.
