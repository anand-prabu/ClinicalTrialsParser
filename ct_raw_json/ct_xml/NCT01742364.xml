  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to test the hypothesis that BCG administration via jet injector will
      produce a comparable immune response and that there will be no significant differences in
      safety or reactogenicity between BCG administration via jet injector and needle and syringe.

      The primary objectives of this study are to...

        1. Compare the safety and reactogenicity of BCG administered intradermally by a jet
           injector device in adults and infants, to BCG administered intradermally by needle and
           syringe;

        2. Compare the specific T cell immunity in neonates vaccinated with BCG via the jet
           injector device to infants vaccinated with BCG via needle and syringe.
