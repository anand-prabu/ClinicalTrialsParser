Some people with migraine report that\n      light can trigger their migraines and some people with migraine are light sensitive all of\n      the time. The investigators have recently determined that certain colors of light are more\n      likely to trigger migraines than other colors. In this study the investigators want to know\n      if people who wear glasses that block these colors of light will have fewer migraine\n      headaches."
