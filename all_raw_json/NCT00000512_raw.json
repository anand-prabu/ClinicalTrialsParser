            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      For several decades, clinical trials have addressed the question of whether treatment of\n      hyperlipidemia reduces the risk of cardiovascular events.  Substantial evidence supports the\n      idea that cardiovascular benefits are related to the degree of reduction in low-density\n      lipoprotein cholesterol level and perhaps to the degree of increase in the high-density\n      lipoprotein cholesterol level.  In these trials, changes in lipid levels have usually been\n      small and the overall clinical benefits have been limited.  The appearance in the 1980s of\n      more effective treatments for hyperlipidemia, new arteriographic methods for assessing\n      atherosclerosis, and new insights into atherogenesis permitted an objective investigation\n      into whether the progression of atherosclerosis was retarded or reversed by lipid-lowering\n      agents.\n\n      The clinical trial was supported by a subproject within a program project grant.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled.  Baseline arteriograms were performed and\n      fasting lipid samples drawn before heparinization.  Patients were stratified for age below\n      45 years, cigarette smoking within the previous month, and lipid patterns including familial\n      hypercholesterolemia and triglyceride levels.  Patients were given dietary counseling and\n      randomly assigned to one of three treatments:  lovastatin (20 mg twice a day) and colestipol\n      (10 g three times a day); niacin (1 g four times a day) and colestipol (10 g three times a\n      day): or conventional therapy with placebo (or colestipol if the LDL cholesterol level was\n      elevated).  The primary endpoint was a measure of change in the severity of disease in the\n      proximal coronary arteries as measured by quantitative arteriography."

Thus, at the end of the study, on average, these nine lesions were almost 3 percentage points less severe among patients treated intensively rather than conventionally. This difference represents almost 1/10 of the amount of disease present at base line (34 percent stenosis). The minimum diameter, an alternative index of the severity of disease, in the nine proximal lesions averaged 1.91 mm for all patients.
