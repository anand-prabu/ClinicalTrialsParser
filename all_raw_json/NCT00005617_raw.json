Mononuclear cells are isolated, used\n      to generate dendritic cells (DC), and then pulsed with MART-1 peptide. Patients are\n      vaccinated with MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC either IV or intradermally on days 0, 14, and 28.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MART-1 peptide-pulsed DC until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
