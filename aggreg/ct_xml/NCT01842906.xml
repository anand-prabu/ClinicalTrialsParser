      The study is examining if an over-the-counter device (Theravent) worn while sleeping can
      reduce acute mountain sickness upon awakening in a high altitude trekking population.

    <textblock>
      The specific aim of this study is to evaluate if an inexpensive and disposable
      end-expiratory pressure device can prevent acute mountain sickness (AMS). AMS is a common
      disorder found in 25-75% of hikers and trekkers in N. America and Europe who expediently
      ascend high altitude (&gt;8,000 ft). This environmental malady is insidious in onset and
      prevention is necessary not just to limit progression to severe or fatal disease, but also
      to limit physiologic deterioration in those who seek enjoyment or employment at high
      altitudes. One of the hallmarks of both healthy and sick individuals sleeping at high
      altitude is an oscillating pattern of respiration marked by periods of hyperventilation
      alternating with apnea or hypopnea. This distressing &quot;periodic breathing&quot; pattern leads to a
      feeling of suffocation, prevents restful sleep, and the hypoxic events may well worsen
      ensuing AMS. Prior studies have found positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) an effective
      non-pharmacologic method to prevent nocturnal desaturations and decreasing both AMS
      incidence and severity.

      Traditionally, PEEP devices are cumbersome and expensive, and while showing promising
      efficacy, are limited by both cost and portability as a useful non-pharmacologic option for
      AMS prophylaxis. The SLEEP-AID methodology is designed to prospectively enroll participants,
      randomized in a double blind placebo-controlled fashion to either the intervention
      [Theravent (Ventus Medical) which is single use, inexpensive, and very small] or a visually
      identical &quot;sham&quot; placebo group, and gather physiologic data to accurately reflect sleep
      patterns of high altitude travelers and objective as well as subjective outcomes of the
      intervention. The benefit of this approach will be to provide definitive data in a large and
      diverse cross section of a real hiking population that is generalizable to the majority of
      tens of millions of hikers, climbers, and high altitude tourists in the United States,
      Europe, Asia, and South America.
