Previous\n      studies have suggested that D-serine may improve motor symptoms, including dyskinesias,\n      which are caused by treatment with presently used antipsychotics drugs.\n\n      The hypothesis under investigation in the present study is that D-serine adjuvant treatment\n      may improve TD in schizophrenia patients diagnosed with this disorder."
