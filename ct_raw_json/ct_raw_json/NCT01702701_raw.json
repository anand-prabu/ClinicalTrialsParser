The study\n      will be conducted at multiple sites with Medical College of Wisconsin as the coordinating\n      site. After identification and recruitment all patients will be randomized (provider\n      blinded) to one of two medications: montelukast 10mg po qday vs fluticasone 440mcg po bid.\n      Patients will also complete a pretreatment, 6 week therapy and 12 week therapy questionaire.\n      They will then undergo a repeat endoscopy to evaluate endoscopic and histologic response."
