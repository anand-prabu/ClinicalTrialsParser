One blood sample was drawn prior to dosing,\n      and 13 samples were drawn over the 72-hour interval following the single dose or\n      prucalopride. Urine was collected quantitatively for the first 24 hours. Plasma prepared\n      from blood samples and urine samples were assayed for prucalopride concentrations. Safety\n      was monitored over the 72-hour interval following the dose of trial medication."
