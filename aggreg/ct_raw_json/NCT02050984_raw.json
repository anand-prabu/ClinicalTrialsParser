A variety of studies showed that it cause significant weight loss,\n      recovery from diabetes and improvement in cardiovascular risk factors, such as blood\n      pressure. The recent guidelines suggest that patients with a BMI of more than 30 kg/m2 with\n      co morbidities is a candidate for bariatric surgery. However, the patients with diabetes in\n      Chinese has lower BMI than that in west country. Therefore, this research is designed to\n      observe whether bariatric surgery reduce blood pressure in patients with diabetes and\n      relatively lower BMI."
