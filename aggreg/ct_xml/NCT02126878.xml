  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation of the trochanteric bursa is a common cause of hip pain. A bursa is a closed
      fluid filled sac or sac-like cavity found between tissues that function as a gliding surface
      to reduce friction. Bursitis is the inflammation of the bursa. Inflammation between the
      trochanteric process of the femur and gluteus medius tendon/ iliotibial tract is the cause
      of trochanteric bursitis. Several treatments exist for trochanteric bursitis, including a
      local steroid injection. The injection consists of a mixture of local anesthetic and steroid
      medications. The steroid is routinely mixed with a local anesthetic. The anesthetic acts to
      diluent the steroid as well as act as a pain reliever. Various steroid preparations have
      been used, at varying doses, for trochanteric bursitis. The steroid preparation,
      triamcinolone is commonly used for various reasons. Besides the procedure associated and
      injection site risks, risks associated with the use of steroids, though rare, exist. Short
      term, the steroid can raise blood sugar levels and should be used with caution and be
      appropriately monitored in diabetics. Additionally, the steroid can suppress the immune
      system. Long-term risks are related to the dose and frequency of use. These risks include
      thinning of the skin, easy bruising, weight gain, elevated blood pressure, cataract
      formation, thinning of bones and joints. Studies have shown the effectiveness of local
      steroid injections for trochanteric bursitis. Unfortunately, there is limited data on the
      ideal dose of the steroid preparation. Triamcinolone of 40mg/ mL is commonly used, but,
      studies have shown effectiveness at various doses, ranging 20 to 160 mg/mL. The aim of this
      study is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of local steroid injections of various
      steroid dosages for the treatment of trochanteric bursitis.
