      Men who have sex with men (MSM) continue to be the most heavily-impacted risk group in the
      US HIV epidemic. Studies suggest that the majority of incident HIV infections among MSM are
      attributable to sex with a main male sex partner; however, HIV prevention interventions that
      target male-male couples are lacking. Because of this, Couples HIV Voluntary Counseling and
      Testing (CVCT), an intervention that has been repeatedly shown to reduce HIV transmission
      within heterosexual couples, has been adapted to US MSM couples. Additionally, novel
      evidence demonstrates that antiretroviral therapy (ART) not only reduces morbidity and
      mortality among HIV-positive persons, but also serves to reduce the risk of HIV transmission
      to a negative partner by 96%. As adherence to ART is modifiable, and levels of peer support
      have been shown to increase ART adherence, this current study proposes to use CVCT combined
      with dyadic adherence counseling (&quot;CVCTPlus&quot;) to improve linkage to care, retention in care,
      ART adherence and viral suppression among male-male couples using a cohort of 200 couples in
      Atlanta, Boston, and Chicago. Prospective couples (100 in each arm) will be followed for two
      years, with study visits every six months. At each visit, they will receive HIV testing, and
      both partners will complete a study survey measuring social and behavioral factors that may
      influence adherence, such as a couple's coping ability and their concordance of agreements
      regarding outside sex partners. Additionally, couples in the intervention arm will receive
      two additional sessions of Partner-STEPS.

      Since the earliest reports of AIDS in the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM)
      have been, and continue to be, the most heavily impacted risk group in the US HIV epidemic.
      In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new HIV diagnoses, an increase from 53% of HIV incidence
      in 2006. The &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy for HIV infection entails universal testing with
      immediate treatment for those who test seropositive, with the aim of achieving viral
      suppression among positives. The efficacy of treatment as prevention demonstrated in HPTN
      052 has reinvigorated the discussion over using a &quot;test and treat&quot; strategy to reduce the
      incidence of HIV infection in the US. However, engagement-in-care research raises a note of
      caution regarding potential pitfalls in the effectiveness of this strategy. The recently
      published MMWR &quot;Vital Signs&quot; Report, showed only 28% of all HIV-infected persons in the US
      has a suppressed viral load. The estimates published by Gardner show that of the estimated
      1.1 million persons infected with HIV in the United States, 21% of HIV-infected persons are
      currently undiagnosed. Of those who are diagnosed, losses occur at initial linkage to care
      and later in care such that only 50% remain in care, such that only 19% of HIV-infected
      persons in the US currently having viral load below the limits of assay detection. There is
      now substantial evidence of the role of couples - or main partnerships - in fueling the HIV
      epidemic among MSM in the US. A recent CDC analysis found that 68% of new infections among
      MSM in the US were ascribed to main sex partners, and the proportion of new infections from
      main sex partners was even higher among younger MSM. Led by Sullivan and Stephenson, recent
      work has illustrated the feasibility of enrolling couples into HIV prevention efforts,
      demand for couples-focused services among MSM. A response to the growing demand for
      couples-focused services has been the adaptation of Couples Voluntary Counseling and Testing
      (CVCT) for MSM in the US. A recent NIMH-funded RCT of CVCT versus traditional VCT among MSM
      (Sullivan PI) showed 22% of MSM couples to be sero-discordant. This collective evidence
      provides the foundation for the proposed activities; we know that a significant proportion
      of new HIV infections occur within couples, and we know that current levels of linkage to
      care, retention in care and adherence to ARVs are below par among US MSM. In April 2012, WHO
      released new guidelines for Couples HIV testing and counseling, including ARV for treatment
      and prevention among sero-discordant couples [7]. The guidelines report a significant gap in
      evidence around the uptake and adherence to ARV among couples, and the role of CVCT in
      shaping uptake and adherence to ARVs: the proposed research has the potential to add
      significantly to our understanding of these issues. The proposed activities investigate the
      utility of CVCT combined with dyadic adherence counseling for improving linkage to care,
      retention in care and adherence to ARVs. Through the screening of 1250 MSM couples and the
      enrollment of couples in a RCT across 3 cities (Atlanta, Boston and Chicago) the study aims
      to examine the impact of CVCTPlus (CVCT plus dyadic adherence counseling) versus VCT on
      linkage to HIV care, retention in HIV care, adherence to ARV and achievement of viral
      suppression among MSM couples. The specific aims are:

      Primary Aims:

        1. Enroll and screen 1250 MSM couples across 3 cities (Atlanta, Boston and Chicago) for
           HIV, randomizing 625 couples to receive CVCT and 625 couples to receive VCT.

        2. From the initial screening, identify and enroll a cohort of 200 couples to be
           followed-up for a period of 2 years: couples in the intervention arm will receive
           CVCTPlus (couples testing plus a couples-focused adherence intervention).

        3. Compare linkage to HIV care, retention in care, adherence to ARVs and achievement of
           viral suppression between couples originally diagnosed in the intervention (CVCTPlus)
           and the control (VCT) arms.

      Hypothesis: Couples who receive a package of CVCT and a dyadic-focused adherence
      intervention will achieve greater linkage to care, retention in care, adherence to ARVs and
      viral suppression than couples who receive the standard of care (individualized VCT and
      adherence counseling).

      With increasing evidence of the role of ARVs in reducing HIV transmission, MSM couples
      represent a significant target group for new interventions. The proposed activities will
      provide new information demonstrating the efficacy of using a couples-based approach for
      increasing ARV adherence and care seeking among couples.

    <description>For each study visit we will extract viral load and CD4 counts from the positive participant's medical record. If there are multiple reports within 30 days of the study visit, we will use the count nearest in date to the study visit. If there is no report within 30 days of the study visit, this will be treated as missing data. In the case of the sero-conversion of a negative partner, we will also collect viral load and CD4 counts from the newly positive partner at each study visit. Viral suppression will be considered achieved if the medical records report a viral load below the level of detection for the site specific assay</description>
