Overall response rate and duration to this\n      combination will also be assessed.\n\n      Tissue will be collected at baseline and at progression (clinical or radiological).\n      Patients may remain on treatment after progression (at the discretion of the investigator)\n      as long as they are still experiencing clinical benefit.  We anticipate that up to 50% of\n      patients may continue on therapy post-progression for 2-8 weeks.\n\n      BRF113220, the phase I/II trial of the BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib in combination with the MEK\n      inhibitor trametinib is ongoing in metastatic melanoma to establish the safety of this\n      combination, and to determine the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) for each agent.\n      Expansion cohorts at the RP2D for these drugs in combination were included in the phase I to\n      characterize the safety in more detail, and to explore the efficacy of this combination.\n      The combination was well tolerated as described in section 1.5, with decreased frequency of\n      rash compared to either agent alone and with just 1 report of cutaneous SCC.\n\n      This proposed study will utilize the RP2D determined in the Phase I/II study: trametinib 2mg\n      QD and dabrafenib 150 mg BID.  Despite a very promising overall response rate of 81%, these\n      patients will also likely go on to develop resistance as a result of new resistance\n      mutations, and given the cooperative signaling network of kinases that sense inhibition of\n      key nodal kinases and induce compensatory responses that offset pharmacological\n      intervention. The study objectives are as follows: Objectives Primary Objective To identify\n      kinases that are differentially expressed pre- and post-treatment with BRAF (dabrafenib) and\n      MEK (trametinib) inhibitors, and to determine a kinome signature predictive of resistance to\n      BRAF/MEK inhibition in stage III/IV melanoma Secondary Objectives To explore whether\n      resistance to BRAF and MEK inhibition is associated with new functional mutations in the\n      approximately 150 oncogenes / tumor suppressor genes that are assessed in more than 10% of\n      the tumors (using NextGen DNA sequencing technology) in the subset of patients who co-enroll\n      in LCCC1108, with particular focus on one of five established resistance genes (BRAF, NRAS,\n      MEK1, MAP3K8 or COT, and PTEN) To determine the overall response rate (ORR: complete\n      response + partial response) as measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate the duration of ORR as\n      measured via RECISTv1.1 To estimate progression-free survival (PFS) as defined by RECISTv1.1\n      To estimate the rate of overall survival (OS) at 1 year from day 1 of treatment\n\n      Primary Endpoint Kinome signature pathway will be based on comparison of kinome expression\n      from pre- and post-treatment biopsies using Multiplexed Inhibitor Beads (MIBs) coupled with\n      mass spectrometry."
