  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prevalence of depression is higher in people living with human immunodeficiency virus
      (PLHIV) than among seronegative people. Depressive symptoms have been observed in up to 40%
      of seropositive population. Presence of depressive symptoms has a negative impact on quality
      of life, optimal compliance of antiretroviral treatment, adoption of safe sexual behaviors,
      and on immune status and viral load.

      Although antidepressants and psychotherapeutic interventions -particularly those with
      cognitive-behavioral components— have been proven effective in decreasing depressive
      symptoms in PLHIV, their use is limited among other causes due to misdiagnosis, patient
      refusal, possible interaction with antiretroviral treatments, or unavailability in the case
      of psychotherapy. Furthermore, identification and assessment of more accessible
      interventions that would decrease depressive symptoms and improve quality of life in PLHIV
      has become a crucial objective in the management of this chronic disease.

      A meta-analysis shows that relaxation is an efficient intervention to reduce depressive
      symptoms in people diagnosed with depression or with high levels of depressive symptoms.
      According to some authors, relaxation, an easy-to-learn and self-applied intervention,
      proves to be a simple first line therapy capable of reducing depressive symptoms. However,
      the amount of relaxation needed to produce an effect on depression was not established in
      this meta-analysis and there are no results on the effects of relaxation in people whose
      depressive symptoms were caused by other diseases and only a study which includes PLHIV.

      Given the prevalence of depressive symptoms and its consequences on the health of PLHIV and
      given the effects of relaxation on depressive symptoms, this pilot project aims to evaluate
      feasibility and acceptability of a relaxation intervention in PLHIV who suffer depressive
      symptoms, assess the feasibility and acceptability of the research project and assess the
      preliminary effects of a relaxation intervention.
