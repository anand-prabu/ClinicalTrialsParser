We also will monitor the impact of\n      psilocybin-facilitated treatment on the use of other drugs and outcomes relevant to cocaine\n      involvement (e.g., criminal involvement).\n\n      MRI assessment is a unique aspect of this study. As a potential biological mechanism of\n      psilocybin's effect includes changes in default mode network functional connectivity\n      (Carhart-Harris et al., 2012), we will determine if psilocybin's therapeutic effects are\n      mediated by such changes. Moreover, as Glx (a brain metabolite that reflects glutamate)\n      abnormalities have been shown to play a role in cocaine addiction, we will determine if\n      psilocybin impacts Glx in the anterior cingulate cortex and hippocampus."

            "textblock": "Individuals who are eligible to participate and provide informed consent will complete\n      baseline questionnaires and be randomly assigned in a double-blind manner to the Psilocybin\n      or Active Placebo group. The first MRI assessment will take place shortly thereafter using a\n      3T head-only Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Spectroscopy scanner (Magnetom Allegra, Siemens\n      medial Solutions, Malvern, PA), optimized for neuroimaging applications.\n\n      Preparation sessions (see below) and the drug administration session will take place in a\n      room at the Clinical Research Unit designed to be as comfortable, aesthetically pleasing\n      (i.e., living-room like), and safe (e.g., no furniture with sharp corners or glass objects)\n      as possible, with a directly adjacent, private restroom.\n\n      All participants will undergo four weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours\n      each. The purpose of these sessions is to: 1) develop strong therapeutic alliance between\n      the participants and the guide (Dr. Hendricks) and secondary monitor (Dr. Cropsey); 2)\n      establish comfort and rapport between participants and the remainder of the research team;\n      3) discuss participants' aspirations with regard to their drug administration experience\n      (e.g., What do participants hope to gain from their experience?); 4) discuss the treatment\n      rationale and putative mechanisms of action of psilocybin (e.g., insight and reorientation\n      that boost motivation to quit and abstinence self-efficacy, reduction of withdrawal/craving\n      secondary to mood improvement); 5) obtain a detailed personal history of the participant,\n      with a focus on those factors contributing to their current difficulties; 6) prepare\n      participants for drug administration, including a detailed account of all potential effects\n      of the drug; 7) discuss all aspects of the drug administration protocol (i.e., logistics and\n      procedures), including plans of action in the event that participants experience acute\n      distress; and 8) administer cognitive-behavioral treatment for cocaine use. Any participant\n      who demonstrates significant anxiety, discomfort, or unease regarding drug administration at\n      the conclusion of the four preparation sessions will be provided up to two additional\n      preparation sessions. If these sessions are unsuccessful at mitigating the participant's\n      anxiety, discomfort, or unease, the participant will be removed from the study.\n\n      Approximately one week after their final preparation session, participants will be\n      instructed to eat a low-fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration\n      session at 8:00 am, approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be\n      collected to verify drug-free status and participants will be encouraged to relax and\n      reflect before drug administration. The drug administration session will take place over the\n      course of 8 hours. The guide and secondary monitor will be present with participants\n      throughout this session (at least one individual will always be present with the\n      participant, even during brief intervals when the guide or monitor may be using the\n      restroom). During this time, participants will be encouraged to lie down, use an eye mask to\n      block external visual distraction, and use headphones through which a supportive music\n      program will be played. Participants will be instructed to focus their attention on their\n      inner experiences throughout the session.\n\n      Any participant reporting significant distress will be provided reassurance verbally or\n      physically (e.g., with a supportive touch to the hand or shoulder). Although no contemporary\n      studies have reported the need for pharmacological intervention, in the event that\n      psychological distress is insufficiently managed with reassurance alone, medication will be\n      administered under the guidance of the study physician.\n\n      Blood pressure will be assessed at regular intervals via automatic blood pressure monitor\n      (e.g., pre-administration, and at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes\n      post-administration), and medication for the treatment of acute hypertension will be\n      administered should blood pressure exceed 190 systolic and 100 diastolic.\n\n      Sessions will be videotaped and reviewed to verify session procedures.\n\n      Seven hours after drug administration, when the major drug effects have subsided,\n      participants will complete questionnaires assessing their experience. Participants will then\n      be released into the care of a friend or family member oriented to be emotionally supportive\n      of the participant (as arranged during preparation sessions) and instructed not to drive an\n      automobile or engage in any other potentially dangerous activity for the remainder of the\n      day. Participants will be provided with the guide's pager number should they feel the need\n      for support that evening.\n\n      Within 2 days after the drug administration session, participants will meet with the guide\n      for approximately 2 hours to discuss and reflect on their experience. The guide will assess\n      for potential adverse effects at this time. The second MRI session will take place shortly\n      thereafter. Participants will then meet with the guide once per week over the next 4 weeks\n      with an emphasis on integration of their medication session experience in the context of\n      achieving abstinence from cocaine; continued cognitive-behavioral treatment for cocaine use\n      will be provided during these follow-up meetings.\n\n      Long-term assessment visits will take place 3 and 6 months after the final follow-up\n      meeting. A battery of measures will be delivered at these times. At the conclusion of the\n      6-month assessment meeting, participants will be debriefed."
