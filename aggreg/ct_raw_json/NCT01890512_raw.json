Subjects considered eligible for this studty are already\n      implanted with the system according to standard medical guidelines for PM implantation.\n\n      The study is aimed at providing confirmatory data of no impact of MRI on device function,\n      lead parameters and patient conditions. The study will collect standard device measurement\n      through device interrogation pre- and post- MRI scan. MRI scan in this study is a\n      non-clinically indicated procedure and is not planned for diagnostic purposes.\n\n      Data from this study will be used to support the evidence of clinical performance of the\n      ImageReady\u2122 MR Conditional Pacing System following a MRI scan when used under the labeled\n      Conditions of Use, and may be used to support regulatory submissions for the approval of the\n      system where requested.\n\n      The study has no primary endpoint and is not hypothesis driven."
