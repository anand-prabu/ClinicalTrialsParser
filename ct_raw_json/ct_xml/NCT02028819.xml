    <textblock>
      Dolutegravir is a second-generation integrase inhibitor that is effective in suppressing HIV
      replication in individuals with resistance to first-generation integrase inhibitors.
      Ibalizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody directed against a human
      T-cell receptor (CD4) and thus suppresses HIV replication by blocking entry of HIV into CD4+
      lymphocytes. Both Dolutegravir and ibalizumab have completed phase I and II clinical studies
      in HIV-negative and HIV-infected individuals showing that both are safe and effective for
      suppressing HIV replication.

      1. Dolutegravir is a second-generation integrase inhibitor that is effective in
           suppressing HIV replication in individuals with resistance to first-generation
           integrase inhibitors. Ibalizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody
           directed against a human T-cell receptor (CD4) and thus suppresses HIV replication by
           blocking entry of HIV into CD4+ lymphocytes. Both Dolutegravir and ibalizumab are in
           the pipeline for FDA approval to treat HIV infection. For both medications phase I and
           II clinical studies have been completed in HIV-negative and HIV-infected individuals
           showing that both are safe and effective for suppressing HIV replication.

        2. Use of these medications requires that a single patient IND be obtained from the FDA
           for each patient requiring dolutegravir and/or ibalizumab. Because treatment of HIV
           infection requires multiple active antiretroviral medications, the FDA requested that a
           single Investigational New Drug Application (IND) be utilized to cover both of these
           investigational medications. An individual use IND has been approved by the FDA; The
           IND number is 114515. The manufacturers of dolutegravir (ViiV Healthcare) and
           ibalizumab (TaiMed Biologics, Inc) will ship the drug directly to the Denver Health
           pharmacy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients with a diagnosis of HIV-infection with resistance or intolerance to
             currently available antiretroviral medications available in the United States or in
