Determine if IC (intensive AML-like therapy) in comparison to HMA as initial therapy,\n      will affect transplantation frequency, quality of life, pre-hematopoietic cell\n      transplantation (HCT) toxicity, and transplant candidacy.\n\n      II. Conduct exploratory analysis of post-HCT outcomes (overall survival, non relapse\n      mortality, incidence of graft rejection, graft-versus-host disease [GVHD], relapse, and\n      relapse-free survival).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM A: Patients receive decitabine or azacitidine intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC)\n      for 7 days. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 4 courses of decitabine or 6 courses of\n      azacitidine in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM B: Patients receive cytarabine IV continuously over 24 hours for 7 days and idarubicin\n      IV or daunorubicin hydrochloride IV on days 1-3 at the discretion of the treating physician.\n      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 18 months."
