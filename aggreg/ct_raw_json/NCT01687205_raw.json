The female participants must be between the ages of 21-46\n      (inclusive) and currently using effective non-barrier contraception.  Male participants must\n      be 21 years of age or older.  This Phase 1 expanded safety study will assess tenofovir PK in\n      the genital tract secretions (CVL), rectal (rectal sponge) and both intracellular and\n      extracellular tissue compartments (vaginal biopsy) in the absence of, or following coitus.\n      Pharmacodynamics (antiviral activity) will also be assessed in CVL.  MTN-011 will study the\n      timing in which coitus might have the greatest impact on these variables, which is when gel\n      is applied shortly prior to coitus in the absence of a drug reservoir.\n\n      In Stage 1, MTN-011 will examine PK/PD in response to a single dose of 1% tenofovir gel\n      applied shortly before sex and compare to PK/PD assessments following a single gel\n      application without sex.  Additionally, data obtained from a visit in which participants do\n      not dose with gel and do not have sex will serve as an additional control for the\n      pharmacodynamic (PD) studies of the antiviral activity in CVL.  If tenofovir retains its\n      antiviral activity following sex, then the anti-HIV activity in CVL collected at the visit\n      in which female participants dose with gel and have sex should be comparable to that of CVL\n      collected at the visit in which females dose with gel and then do not engage in intercourse\n      and significantly greater than the endogenous anti-HIV activity in CVL obtained at the visit\n      in which participants do not dose with gel but do have sex and the visit in which no gel is\n      administered and sex does occur.  An interim analysis will be performed after the completion\n      of enrollment and follow-up procedures for Stage 1.  If a difference is detected (25%\n      decrease in PK) between the pharmacokinetic data or in the antiviral activity (PD) at the\n      Gel/Sex Visit vs. Gel/No Sex Visit Stage 2 of the study will commence and begin enrolling.\n\n      If Stage 1 demonstrates an impact of coitus and semen on PK/PD when a single 1% tenofovir\n      dose is applied shortly prior to sex, coitus and semen may not have the same impact on PK/PD\n      in the setting of daily gel application due to continual accumulation of drug in\n      cervicovaginal tissue over time.  Thus Stage 2 will compare PK/PD after 7 daily doses of gel\n      in the absence of sex to that of the PK/PD after the couple engages in sex."

At Screening or Enrollment, symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI)\n\n             Note:  Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI during screening are\n             offered treatment and may be enrolled after completing treatment and all symptoms\n             have resolved as long as treatment is completed and all symptoms have resolved within\n             30 days of obtaining informed consent for Screening/Enrollment.\n\n          3.
