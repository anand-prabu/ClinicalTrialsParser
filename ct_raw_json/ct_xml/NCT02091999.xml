  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics ASG-22CE as well as
      assess the immunogenicity and antitumor activity in subjects with metastatic urothelial
      cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute IV infusion of ASG-22CE once weekly for 3 weeks
      of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks. The study design will
      follow a modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).

      Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of ASG-22CE,
      investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Subjects will have a Safety Follow up Visit a
      minimum of 28 days after the last ASG-22CE infusion.

      A data review team (DRT) will review cumulative unaudited data on an interim basis to
      explore additional doses and/or schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts. Doses
      intermediate to those predefined in the protocol may be explored with DRT endorsement.
