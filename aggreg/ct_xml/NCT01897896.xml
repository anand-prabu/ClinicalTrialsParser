    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of
      SD-809 ER in subjects switching from tetrabenazine to SD-809 ER. In addition, the safety and
      tolerability of long term treatment with SD-809 ER will be assessed in &quot;Switch&quot; subjects as
      well as &quot;Rollover&quot; subjects completing a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled study
      of SD-809 ER,
