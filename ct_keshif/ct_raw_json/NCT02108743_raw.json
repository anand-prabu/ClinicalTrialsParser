There is a continued need for adjuvant therapy in iPAH, and bronchodilators\n      have the potential to ameliorate dyspnea during exercise, which could lead to improved\n      quality of life in this disabling condition. This study will investigate the presence of\n      airway involvement in this population as measured by dynamic hyperinflation, and if there is\n      any improvement in function with the use of inhaled albuterol."
