Determine the toxicity of this\n      drug in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics (newly diagnosed\n      anaplastic oligodendroglioma versus recurrent anaplastic oligodendroglioma). Patients\n      receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 28 days. Patients\n      with progressive or recurrent disease (at baseline) continue treatment in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with newly diagnosed disease continue\n      treatment for a maximum of 4 courses before radiotherapy in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with responding disease may receive an\n      additional 6 courses after completion of radiotherapy. (Radiotherapy is not part of study\n      treatment.) Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
