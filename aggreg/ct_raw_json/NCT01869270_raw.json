If the\n      subject has undergone therapy or treatment, the results will be noted."

Much work\n      remains to be done to understand and effectively treat these diseases. To date, no\n      comprehensive assessment of the natural history of Tay-Sachs or Sandhoff has been\n      undertaken. The information that is gathered through this study will characterize and\n      describe the Tay-Sachs disease population as a whole, including the variability and\n      progression of this disease. This information, in turn, will function as a point of\n      reference against which to assess the efficacy of therapeutic interventions.  Therapeutic\n      interventions may include any treatments/therapies the subject may have undergone in the\n      past, including hematopoietic cell transplantation, and/or the administration of miglustat,\n      acetylcysteine, or other pharmaceutical agents; and possible future gene therapies."
