Persistent dryness of\n      the mouth causes oral pain, discomfort and significantly interferes with the quality of\n      life. Rebamipide, in addition to its gastro-protective effect has displayed various\n      anti-inflammatory actions including inhibition of neutrophilic leukocyte activation.\n      Preclinical and clinical studies have demonstrated an increase in saliva volume following\n      rebamipide administration.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to assess efficacy of rebamipide in the treatment of dry\n      mouth symptoms related to Sj\u0151gren's syndrome.\n\n      Methods: Fifty-five patients with American European Consensus Criteria Group (AECG)-based\n      diagnosis of SS will participate in this randomized placebo-controlled trial. Inclusion\n      criteria will include SS patients with dry mouth symptoms. Patients with dry mouth due to\n      other conditions will be excluded. Patients will be randomized 1:1 to receive either 300mg/d\n      (100mg x3/day) of rebamipide or placebo for 12 weeks together with their usual therapy.\n      Outcome measures will include patient-assessed improvement of dry mouth symptoms and\n      increase in salivary secretion (evaluation of unstimulated saliva; questionnaires including\n      the visual analogue scale (VAS) for Sicca-syndrome VAS 0-100mm). Subjective and objective\n      findings of dry mouth will be recorded at baseline, two, four, six, eight, ten and twelve\n      weeks. Safety and efficacy will be assessed at each visit."
