Identifying early brain biomarkers of\n      treatments responses seems necessary to improve antidepressant treatment outcome. In this\n      study we aim to detect early brain responses to a fast acting antidepressant-like treatment\n      administered intravenously during a Real-Time Neurofeedback functional magnetic resonance\n      imaging (MRI) Task to predict antidepressant treatment outcome in depression.  At completion\n      of the neuroimaging task, participants will enter a placebo-controlled clinical trial with a\n      selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)."
