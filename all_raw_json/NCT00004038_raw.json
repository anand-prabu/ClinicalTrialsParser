Patients receive the Ad-p53 gene therapy in one nodule and injection of a second nodule with Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline.

Determine p53 protein expression following intralesional injections of Ad-p53 by\n      immunohistochemistry and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction in this patient\n      population.\n\n      III. Determine the time course and magnitude of the development of a humoral antibody\n      response to the adenoviral vector in this patient population.\n\n      IV. Determine the ability of transfected p53 to upregulate downstream signals important in\n      G1 arrest by assaying for WAF1 mRNA and apoptosis in this patient population.\n\n      V. Determine the toxicities and side effects of intralesional injections of Ad-p53 given in\n      combination with standard chemotherapy in patients with cutaneous and subcutaneous\n      metastatic breast cancer amenable to injections and biopsies.\n\n      VI. Determine if there is an increase in apoptosis induced by Ad-53 compared to baseline in\n      this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo biopsy of one of their skin nodules prior to any treatment. Patients\n      receive the Ad-p53 gene therapy in one nodule and injection of a second nodule with\n      Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline.
