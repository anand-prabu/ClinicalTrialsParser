Asymmetric\n      candidates are patients with severe to profound hearing loss in one ear and better hearing\n      in the other ear.  (One ear is deaf and the other ear has better hearing and in most cases\n      uses a hearing aid.) The investigators hypothesize that cochlear implantation of the poorer\n      ear provides a functional increase in word and sentence understanding in quiet or noise,\n      perceived benefit, localization ability, and other measures of auditory performance relative\n      to use of the better hearing ear alone."
