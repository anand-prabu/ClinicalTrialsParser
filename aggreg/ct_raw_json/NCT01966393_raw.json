A dual-hormone closed-loop strategy would\n      regulate glucose levels through the infusion of two hormones: insulin and glucagon.\n\n      The main objective of this project is to compare the efficacy of single-hormone closed-loop\n      strategy, dual-hormone closed-loop strategy and conventional insulin pump therapy to\n      regulate glucose levels in a 60-hours in non-standardized conditions in adults with type 1\n      diabetes.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that 1) Controlling glucose levels using single- or\n      dual-hormone CLS is feasible in free-living conditions for long period of time (60 hours);\n      2) Dual-hormone CLS is superior to single-hormone CLS as assessed by reducing time spent in\n      hypoglycemic range; 3) Both single-hormone and dual-hormone CLS are superior to conventional\n      pump therapy."
