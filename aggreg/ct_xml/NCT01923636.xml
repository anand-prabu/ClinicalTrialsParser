  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to elaborate, in the neonatal period, a prognostic score
      for the development of neurological and sensorineural sequelae at 1 year in neonates
      infected in utero by cytomegalovirus. This score will be based on clinical, imaging and
      biological evaluations.

      The second objective of the study is to estimate the prevalence of this infection in France
      and to describe its epidemiology through the screening of 10,000 consecutive neonates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infection with cytomegalovirus (CMV) is the most frequent cause of congenital neurological
      handicap of infectious origin in industrialized countries. Around 10% of infected neonates
      have symptoms and more than 50% of them will develop long term neurological sequelae and
      sensorineural hearing loss. Among asymptomatic infected neonates 10 to 15% will ultimately
      develop hearing loss. To establish the prognosis of infected neonates remains difficult and
      the purpose of the study is to better define early prognosis factors.

      The true burden of CMV congenital infection is unknown in France: the prevalence of the
      infection as well as the description of its epidemiology (proportion of symptomatic and
      asymptomatic cases, rate of long term sequelae, proportion of cases following primary or
      secondary maternal infections) are unknown.
