            "textblock": "Effectiveness of sleeve gastrectomy is between gastric banding and gastric bypass. However,\n      a proportion of patients that undergo surgery, report troublesome and persistent dysphagia,\n      pain, new onset or worsening of gastro-esophageal reflux (GER) requiring treatment. Improved\n      results for sleeve gastrectomy could be possible if more was known about the surgical /\n      mechanical factors that affect outcome. Current investigations based on traditional\n      intra-luminal imaging (endoscopy) and radiology (UGI series) may not provide adequate\n      preoperative assessment of esophago-gastric dynamics. Current practice in the creation of a\n      sleeve gastrectomy involves the use of a bougie or endoscope around which the sleeve is\n      stapled. There is no consensus on the diameter of this bougie and this intraoperative\n      calibration may alter the gastro-esophageal junction (GEJ) anatomy, does not provide real\n      time physiology feedback, and allows only for a rough approximation of the size of the\n      sleeve providing no information about the distensibility and pressure gradient of the newly\n      created gastric tube as it is filled. A more distensible sleeve will have lower\n      intra-gastric pressure, and thus will theoretically be expected to reduce the incidence of\n      side effects. As laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is performed with increasing frequency,\n      there is a need for development of tools to assist the surgeon in modeling properly and\n      standardize the gastroplasty. This study will be based on a strict assessment of the\n      anatomical and functional characteristics of the \"ideal \"gastric sleeve, using existing\n      imaging modalities (endoscopy - CT scan- MRI - HRM)."
