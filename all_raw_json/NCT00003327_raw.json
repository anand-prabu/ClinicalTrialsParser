Evaluate the safety of\n      paclitaxel in this patient population. III. Assess the overall survival and quality of life\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter, nonrandomized study. Patients receive\n      intravenous paclitaxel over 1 hour weekly. Each course consists of four weeks. Patients\n      receive treatment until disease progression or unacceptable toxic effects are observed.\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for the first year, then every 4 months until\n      completion of treatment, and then every 3 months until death. Patients complete a quality of\n      life questionnaire prior to each of the first 6 courses, then every 2 courses thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
