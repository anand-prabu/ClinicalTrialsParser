Few data are available for the\n      bioavailability of voriconazole in critically ill patients. However, to obtain a therapeutic\n      concentration of voriconazole (>1.5 mg/L, which is associated with a beneficial response to\n      treatment) one study showed that a higher oral dose is required compared with the\n      intravenous dose, to obtain this therapeutic concentration. Therefore, the pharmacokinetics\n      can be changed in critically ill patients, including bioavailability.\n\n      In this study, patients who receive voriconazole orally (prescribed by their attending\n      physician) will receive one intravenous dose of voriconazole instead of the oral dose. The\n      intravenous dose will be the same as the oral dose voriconazole."
