This study will take place during the 2014-15, 2015-16, and 2016-17 school\n      years. Seventy-five schools across California will be randomized to one of three groups: 1)\n      BMI screening and reporting, 2) BMI screening, and 3) no BMI screening or reporting\n      (control). Schools randomized to Groups 1 and 2 will conduct height and weight measurements\n      annually with their 3rd-8th grade students. Group 1 and 2 schools will also administer the\n      five fitness assessments from the FITNESSGRAM test annually with their 5th-8th grade\n      students. These assessments will take place in the spring to coincide with the annual\n      FITNESSGRAM assessment that is required for 5th, 7th, and 9th grade students by California\n      state law. In the fall of Years 2 and 3, Group 1 schools will mail a report home to parents\n      with their student's BMI results from the previous spring. Investigators will randomize the\n      parents of 6th-8th grade students (who were 5th-7th grade students during the previous\n      school year) to receive one of two report types: 1) a report that only provides BMI results,\n      or 2) a report that provides BMI results with results from the five fitness assessments.\n      Schools randomized to Group 3 will not conduct height and weight measurements with their\n      students during Years 1 and 2. During these years, 5th and 7th grade students from Group 3\n      schools will participate in the five fitness assessments of the FITNESSGRAM test. The\n      California Department of Education will grant these schools as exemption from collecting\n      height and weight data on their 5th and 7th grade students, which is normally required as\n      part of the FITNESSGRAM.\n\n      In the fall of Year 1, investigators will conduct a baseline survey with students from all\n      schools. This survey will assess weight-based teasing and stigmatization, weight-control\n      behaviors, and general nutrition and physical activity behaviors. The student survey will\n      also ask questions about students' experiences having height and weight measurements\n      conducted at school. After students complete the baseline survey, investigators will\n      randomize schools to study groups. Investigators will repeat the student survey in the fall\n      of Years 2 and 3 to assess change in the aforementioned constructs. In addition to the\n      student survey, investigators will survey a sample of parents in Years 1 and 3. The parent\n      survey will assess parent behaviors related to their child's physical activity and nutrition\n      and parent reactions to the BMI report."
