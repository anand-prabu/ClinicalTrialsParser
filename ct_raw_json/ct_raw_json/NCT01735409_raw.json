For advanced or metastatic NPC, chemotherapy\n      remain the mainstay of treatment. The 130-nm albumin-bound formulation of paclitaxel\n      ([Abraxane, ABX ];Celgene,Summit,NJ) is a promising new agent with more efficient entry to\n      the tumor microenvironment via caveolae-mediated transcytosis and preferential uptake by\n      cancer cells. Superior activity of ABX-based regimens without the necessity for\n      antianaphylactic pretreatments been shown in various solid tumors compared with the\n      traditional solvent-based paclitaxel-based ones. However, the safety and efficacy of\n      combination of ABX and cisplatin (DDP) has not been determined in patients with advanced\n      NPC. In this single center, non-randomized phase IIa study, investigators seek to determine\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and dose limiting toxicity (DLT) of ABX-DDP, and perform an\n      exploratory study of its efficacy as measured by tumor response."
