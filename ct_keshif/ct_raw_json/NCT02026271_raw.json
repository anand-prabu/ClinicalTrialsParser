IL-12 is a protein that may improve the body's natural response to disease by\n      enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may interfere with blood\n      flow to the tumor.\n\n      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of tumor\n      injections of INXN-2001 given in combination with different doses of veledimex."
