      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of viral therapy in treating
      patients with recurrent or metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. A virus
      called encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter, which has been changed in a certain way,
      may be able to kill tumor cells without damaging normal cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of intratumoral administration of an
      Edmonston strain measles virus genetically engineered to express human thyroidal
      sodium-iodide symporter (NIS) (oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide
      symporter [MV-NIS]) in patients with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-NIS in patients
      with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer.

      II. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach by following,
      radiographic response, and time to progression.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and
      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS
      using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.

      II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following
      intratumoral administration.

      III. To determine humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter
      intratumorally on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for
      1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year.
