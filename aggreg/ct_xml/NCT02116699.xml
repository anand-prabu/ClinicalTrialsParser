  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Extremely premature  (BW&lt;1250g) infants are at high risk for morbidity and mortality. Own
      mother's colostrum (OMC) and milk (OMM) protect against neonatal morbidity and are rich in
      immune factors which may provide immunostimulatory effects when administered oropharyngeally
      to extremely premature  infants during the first weeks of life.  The investigators
      hypothesize that infants who receive oropharyngeal mother's colostrum and milk will have
      significantly lower rates of infection and improved health outcomes, compared to infants who
      receive a placebo.

    <textblock>
      Extremely premature  (BW&lt;1250g) infants are at high risk for morbidity and mortality. Own
      mother's colostrum (OMC) and milk (OMM) protect against neonatal morbidity and are rich in
      immune factors which may provide immunostimulatory effects when administered oropharyngeally
      to extremely premature  infants during the first weeks of life.  This 3 year
      placebo-controlled, double-blind randomized controlled trial will evaluate the safety,
      efficacy and health outcomes of oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM in a sample of 300
      (150 in each arm) extremely premature infants with the following aims: Aim 1. To determine
      if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM to extremely premature infants will reduce the
      risk of late-onset sepsis  or death as the primary outcome, and necrotizing enterocolitis
      and ventilator-associated pneumonia  as pre-planned secondary outcomes. Aim 2: To determine
      if extremely premature infants who receive OMC/OMM via the oropharyngeal route have a
      shorter time to reach full enteral feeds and a shorter length of hospital stay. Aim 3: To
      determine if oropharyngeal administration of OMC/OMM will have immunostimulatory effects, as
      measured by changes in  urine lactoferrin and stool microbiota. Results will confirm whether
      extremely premature  infants demonstrate a host-immune response to this intervention and
      whether there is a beneficial effect on common morbidities in these high risk patients.
