The regimen varies\n      according to the underlying cause of the anemia, but could include busulfan,\n      cyclophosphamide or melphalan, anti-thymocyte globulin or methylprednisolone, and/or\n      radiation therapy. One day after the conditioning regimen is completed, patients receive the\n      UCBT.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 3 months, at 6 months, then every 6 months for 2.5 years,\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 4-90 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
