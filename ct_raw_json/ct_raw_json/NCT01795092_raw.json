The hypothesis of this study is that obtaining\n      outpatient dermatology consultations during a patient\u201fs initial presentation to a primary\n      care office will reduce admissions for cellulitis with accuracy. The primary objective will\n      be to measure the difference in the proportion of patients requiring hospital admission\n      utilizing a dermatology consultation at the PCP\u201fs office (active arm) versus primary care\n      evaluation alone (control arm) by calculating risk ratios and risk differences. The risk of\n      admission for each arm will be assessed once the study has been completed. The secondary\n      endpoint will be admission versus discharge home at a dermatology follow-up visit to assess\n      accuracy of initial assessment. An additional endpoint will be to determine if any\n      differences in frequencies of cellulitis and admission exist based on age and\n      immunosuppression. Exploratory analyses will assess the percentage of patients with a\n      concomitant known predisposing factor for recurrent cellulitis such as lymphedema, leg\n      ulceration, tinea pedis, or onychomycosis, as well as the association of fever >100.5 F and\n      a history of a prior episode of cellulitis."

Patient\n      recruitment will occur at five Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) outpatient internal\n      medicine clinical sites: Medical Walk-In, Internal Medicine Associates, Bulfinch Medical\n      Group, Senior Health, and Women's health. Patients with abnormal vital signs will be\n      excluded, specifically systolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure <80 mmHg,\n      heart rate greater than 90 beats per minute or less than 50 beats per minute, respiratory\n      rate greater than 20, or temperature >100.5 F. In addition, any patients with a history of\n      transplantation must be more than six months after initial transplant with no treated\n      episodes of acute rejection in the last 90 days, no use of antithymocyte globulin or campath\n      to treat rejection in the last 6 months, or more than 20 mg/day of prednisone for more than\n      30 days.\n\n      Once a patient is identified with potential cellulitis who is a candidate for outpatient\n      treatment, the primary care physician will then approach them regarding their interest in\n      entering our study. Patients will be randomized during this initial presentation to their\n      primary care physician. The patients randomized to the treatment group will obtain a\n      dermatology evaluation at the primary care physician\u201fs office and will be sent to the\n      Emergency Department or discharged home with outpatient dermatology follow-up in two to\n      three days to assess for improvement in their condition versus no change or worsening that\n      requires transfer to the Emergency Department. Patients who are evaluated by a dermatologist\n      and who require hospitalization will have their transition to the Emergency Department\n      managed by the dermatologist with notification of the patient\u201fs PCP. These patients who have\n      follow-up in dermatology clinic will not require a follow-up visit with their primary care\n      physician. The skin and lymph node exam performed by the dermatologist on patients in the\n      treatment group will be documented in the electronic medical record for the subjects\u201f\n      medical records. Patients who are admitted after the initial outpatient discharge or at the\n      follow-up visit will be considered treatment failures. A medical record review will be\n      performed for patients in the treatment group two weeks after initial evaluation at the\n      internal medicine clinic. A medical record review will be performed for patients who are\n      randomized to the treatment group two weeks after initial evaluation at the internal\n      medicine clinic.\n\n      Those in the control group who do not obtain a dermatology evaluation will follow primary\n      care recommendations alone and will also have chart review two weeks later to assess for\n      admission versus discharge home from clinic and outcome. In the control group, the need for\n      additional clinical follow-up will be at the primary care physician\u201fs discretion. These\n      patients will receive a followup telephone call to confirm the final outcome of their\n      condition two weeks after their visit to internal medicine clinic. The data sets generated\n      from the treatment and control groups will then be compared to look for differences in\n      hospital admission rates. For the treatment arm of the study, this data will be obtained\n      during the follow-up visit and the medical record review. For the control arm, this will be\n      obtained during both the medical record review and the follow-up phone call. The goal of\n      this data collection is to determine what the final outcome is for patients in both groups\n      in terms of need for hospital admission."
