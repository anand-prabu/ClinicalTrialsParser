  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke, head injury and other forms of brain injury are a major cause of physical,
      psychological and social disability in the adult population. Psychological distress is
      common following brain injury, but the evidence base for specific psychotherapeutic methods
      in this population is limited, and standard treatment approaches may not be suitable.
      Recently there has been a growing interest in positive psychology - the study of wellbeing,
      positive emotions and characteristics, and personal growth. The investigators believe that
      positive psychotherapy interventions may be beneficial after acquired brain injury, to
      reduce psychological morbidity. Because such interventions have not previously been applied
      in this population, the investigators propose to conduct a pilot randomised controlled trial
      to examine the feasibility of a brief positive psychotherapy intervention in an out-patient
      setting. This project will produce essential information to allow us to plan future
      full-scale clinical trials in this area.

          -  Aged 18 years or over;

          -  Diagnosis of stroke or acquired brain injury (confirmed clinically and/or
             radiologically);

          -  Between 3 and 12 months post-injury at time of recruitment;

          -  Presence of emotional distress (score in moderate or above range on at least one

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant communication impairments that would preclude participation;

          -  Diagnosis of mild traumatic brain injury (due to the known additional complexities
             contributing to outcome in this population);

          -  Comorbid developmental learning disability or degenerative neurological condition.

        Pre-injury history of mood disorder will not lead to exclusion.
