During the robot-assisted training, only the paretic hand will be trained and the participant will rest the forearm and hand on a cradle and the wrist and hand in a fixed positions. During the practice, a visual display will provide online visual feedback of accuracy and coordination success. And summary scores regarding movement accuracy and movement smoothness will be shown on the display periodically.

Several research groups have developed the robotic devices and examined\n      their efficacy on improving UL function after stroke. All these robotic devices have been\n      applied in stroke rehabilitation and their efficacy are evaluated, but the scientific\n      evidence for the mechanisms of RT-induced recovery, the relative treatment effects of\n      unilateral vs bilateral robotic trainings, and the impact on physiological responses is\n      still lacking.\n\n      The primary purposes of this study are to examine (1) the relative immediate treatment\n      effects of unilateral vs bilateral RT on motor impairments/performance and daily functions\n      in patients with subacute stroke; (2) the long-term benefits of unilateral vs bilateral RT\n      by conducting a 6-month follow up evaluation; and (3) the effects of RT on movement\n      reorganization as well as on the physiological markers of inflammation, oxidative stress,\n      erythrocyte deformability, and blood glucose. These overall findings will help better\n      understanding of the efficacy of RT on functional outcomes, movement reorganization, and\n      physiological markers. The investigators would additionally explore the possible\n      differential treatment effects in patients with different levels of motor severity (i.e.,\n      moderate vs. severe).\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that (1) both unilateral (the InMotion3) and bilateral (the\n      Bi-Manu-Track) robot-assisted training would bring larger benefits on motor performance and\n      daily function than the control treatment; (2) such benefits would retain during the\n      follow-up; (3) there would be differential immediate and retention effects of unilateral\n      (the InMotion3) and bilateral (the Bi-Manu-Track) robot-assisted training on different\n      outcome measures; (4) better movement reorganization as well as physiological marker\n      expressions would be found in both robotic groups compared to control group; and (5) there\n      would be differential effects of robotic therapy between participants with moderate vs.\n      severe motor impairment."
