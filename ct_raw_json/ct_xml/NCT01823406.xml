      Objective: To assess steady state and dynamic metabolite changes in subjects with type 1
      diabetes with and without microvascular complications and to understand intrinsic
      differences from non-diabetics in metabolite levels and flux.

      The hypothesis is that diabetic complications arise from tissue-specific metabolic
      reprogramming resulting in alterations in fuel utilization which lead to dysfunction of the
      tissue.  To test this hypothesis, we will use sensitive and specific mass spectrometer based
      metabolomic analysis  to measure steady state metabolite levels in plasma and urine from
      controls subjects and subjects with T1DM, without and with diabetic complications during
      euglycemic and hyperglycemic clamp studies.

    <description>Investigators will perform 4 hour  Euglycemic and  4 hr hyperglycemic glucose clamps on each subject once. The Investigators will have 4 different groups of subjects. At specific time points during the clamps, the investigators will draw blood samples for measurement of metabolic assays and flux . The investigators will also collect spot urine samples for metabolic assay and flux.</description>

    <description>Each cohort group will be admitted to the Michigan Clinical Research Unit for Blood glucose Clamp studies. Each subject will have a Euglycemic clamp (normal blood sugar clamp) for 4 hours and a hyperglycemic clamp (elevated blood sugar to 300) for 4 hours. Once the subject is clamped, bloods and urine will be collected to assay for specific metabolomics and proteomic biomarkers. We will perform the same clamps for each cohort.</description>

        Subjects in the microalbuminuria group will have a history of urinary microalbumin to
        creatinine ration between 30-300 m/g confirmed on repeat testing while the non-albuminuric
        group will have a value of less than 30 mg/g.
