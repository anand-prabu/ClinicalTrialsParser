  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability
      in children ages 1-14 years old. There are no effective therapies to treat secondary brain
      injury and the post-injury response of CNS apoptosis and neuroinflammation. This study is a
      follow-up trial from a previously performed Phase I trial that demonstrated the safety and
      potential CNS structural preservation effect of intravenous autologous bone marrow
      mononuclear cells (BMMNC) after severe TBI in children. (Cox, 2011) The study is designed as
      a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, blinded Phase 2 safety/biological activity
      study.  The investigators hope to determine the effect of intravenous infusion of autologous
      BMMNCs on brain structure and neurocognitive/functional outcomes after severe TBI in
      children.
