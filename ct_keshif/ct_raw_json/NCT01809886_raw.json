            "textblock": "Muscle relaxing facilitates endotracheal intubation and surgical access. Muscle relaxants\n      have a long duration with the possibility of residual muscle relaxation after surgery (over\n      40% of patients), and ventilatory problems (hypoxia, hypercapnia, atelectasis, airway\n      collapse) that raise postoperative morbidity and mortality.\n\n      All of these facts are accentuated in the pediatric patient due to the reduced airway\n      caliber which tends lead to obstruction and bronchospasm. So far, the effect of muscle\n      relaxants has only been partially reversed by anticholinesterase (neostigmine), which has\n      the limitation of its short duration of action (8-9 minutes) and has many side effects\n      (bradycardia, hypotension, increased salivation, vomiting, dyspnea and bronchoconstriction).\n      It also needs to be combined with anticholinergic (atropine), which causes a dry mouth,\n      blurred vision and tachycardia.\n\n      At present, the introduction of sugammadex (Bridion\u00ae), an antagonist of nondepolarizing the\n      neuromuscular relaxant rocuronium, may lead to an extraordinary breakthrough. It is the only\n      antagonist able to encapsulate and fully eliminate the muscle relaxant to avoid residual\n      effects and respiratory complications. Muscle strength can be retrieved at any time, without\n      waiting for relaxant metabolism (30 to 40 minutes) and without using the usual classical\n      antidotes (neostigmine and atropine), which produce many undesirable effects that become\n      more troublesome in the postoperatory phase. Sugammadex lacks intrinsic activity and is\n      considered safe, without significant side effects and can be used in cardiovascular or\n      respiratory diseases."
