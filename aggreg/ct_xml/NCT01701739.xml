  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, two-period, fixed-sequence study will investigate the pharmacokinetics and
      safety of multiple doses of aleglitazar on a single dose of digoxin in healthy volunteers.
      In period 1, volunteers will receive a single dose of digoxin, in period 2 volunteers will
      receive multiple doses of aleglitazar and a single dose of digoxin. The anticipated time on
      study treatment is one month.
