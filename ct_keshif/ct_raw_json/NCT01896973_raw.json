Prostate volumes 30 - 80 gm based on transrectal ultrasound\n\n          3. Men \u2265 50 years of age\n\n          4. IPSS symptom score > 15 and IPSS bother score > 2 (see Appendix B for IPSS\n             questionnaire)\n\n          5. Baseline peak flow rate Qmax < 12 cc/s on two separate occasions with voided volume\n             at least 150 cc\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. History of prostate or bladder cancer, pelvic radiation, untreated bladder stones,\n             urethral strictures/bladder neck contracture (BNC), renal insufficiency (i.e.\n             creatinine > 1.4)\n\n          2. Neurogenic bladder, Parkinson's disease\n\n          3. Prior treatment for urinary incontinence\n\n          4. Micturition frequency AND urgency.  Micturition frequency defined as > 8 micturitions\n             per 24 hours as assessed by a thorough subject history including the question: \"On\n             average, how many times do you void during a 24 hour period? // < 4, 5-7, 8 or more.\"\n               Urgency defined as an uncontrollable urge to void that occurs > 3 per 24 hours as\n             assessed through the subject history/question:  \"On average, how many times a day do\n             you have an uncontrollable urgency to void? // 0, 1-2, 3 or more?\"\n\n          5. Intravesical prostate lobe protrusion > 1 cm on TRUS.  Note: this is distinct from\n             lateral lobes protruding up to the bladder such as an intravesical protrusion without\n             median lobe\n\n          6. Active UTI (i.e. must have a screening urinalysis without signs of infection or a\n             negative urine culture)\n\n          7. PVR > 250 at time of enrollment or catheter dependent bladder drainage\n\n          8. History of chronic prostatitis within the last 5 years\n\n          9. Not able to temporarily discontinue aspirin, Coumadin, Plavix and any other\n             anticoagulant at least seven days prior to the time of treatment\n\n         10. History of known bleeding disorders (e.g. von Willebrand disease [VWD]) and subjects\n             determined to have a bleeding disorder by prothrombin time (PT) and partial\n             thromboplastin time (PTT) tests.\n\n         11. Prior BPH prostate procedures (e.g. TUMT, TUNA, water induced thermotherapy [WIT],\n             TURP, PVP)\n\n         12. Men with confirmed or suspected malignancy of the prostate based on a digital rectal\n             exam (DRE), prostate biopsy or PSA > 10 ng/mL.  Men with free PSA < 25% and PSA\n             between 2.5 and 10 ng/mL may only be enrolled after a negative biopsy.  If a prior\n             prostate biopsy was performed within one year of enrollment and was negative for\n             cancer, repeat biopsy is not required if in the investigator's judgment there is no\n             clinical evidence to support biopsy reassessment.  If a biopsy is required, the\n             subject shall have a six-week waiting period between the biopsy and histotripsy\n             treatment, if he is otherwise deemed eligible to participate in the study.\n\n         13. Men interested in future fertility\n\n         14. Declines or unable to provide informed consent\n\n         15. Non-English-speaker\n\n         16. Life expectancy estimated to be less than one year\n\n         17. Unable or unwilling to complete all required questionnaires and follow-up assessments\n\n         18.
