The specific aims of this proposal are as follows:\n\n      1. To institute a prospective, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial in\n      pediatric subjects undergoing cardiac surgery to determine the efficacy of sodium\n      bicarbonate on prevention of acute kidney injury as measured by pRIFLE criteria.  2. To\n      examine whether treatment with sodium bicarbonate modifies the duration of acute kidney\n      injury, fluid balance, hospital length of stay, need for dialysis, and progression to kidney\n      failure.  3. To determine the relevance of NGAL as a biomarker to predict development of\n      acute kidney injury."
