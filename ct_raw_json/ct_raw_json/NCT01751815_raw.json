            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Colonoscopy is often regarded as a painful and unpleasant procedure. Transcutaneous Electric\n      Nerve Stimulation on Acupoints (Acu-TENS) is a non-invasive modality that has been used\n      successfully to treat pain of various origins, but few good-quality studies have evaluated\n      its role in treating pain and anxiety during colonoscopy.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      To investigate the efficacy of Acu-TENS in reducing procedure-related pain and the\n      consumption of sedatives/analgesics during colonoscopy.\n\n      Design:\n\n      Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled study.\n\n      Subjects:\n\n      One hundred and twenty eight consecutive patients undergoing first-time elective day-case\n      colonoscopy without previous experience of acupuncture/Acu-TENS will be recruited.\n\n      Interventions:\n\n      Patients will be randomized to receive either 45 minutes of Acu-TENS or placebo-TENS before\n      colonoscopy. The acupoints relevant to the treatment of abdominal pain and distension,\n      including Zusanli, Hegu, Neiguan, Tianshu, and Dachangshu will be used. For the placebo-TENS\n      group, a non-conductive plastic film will be placed between the acupoint and the electrode\n      so that no current will be transmitted. Acu-TENS and placebo-TENS will be continued\n      throughout colonoscopy. A mixture of Propofol and Alfentanil, delivered by a\n      patient-controlled syringe pump, will be used for sedation/analgesia in both groups.\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      Primary outcome: doses of patient-controlled sedation/analgesia consumed. Secondary\n      outcomes: pain and satisfaction scores according to a visual analog scale, cecal intubation\n      rate/time, and episodes of hypotension/desaturation."
