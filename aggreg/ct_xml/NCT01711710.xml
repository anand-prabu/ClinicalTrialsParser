    <description>Bra cup size can be determined by measuring right or left bust circumference over the nipple.
6 inch= doubleA, 7inch=A, 8inch= B, 9inch=C, 10inch=D, 11inch=E Bust girth means bust circumference line . It can be determined by measuring  around the women's torso over the fullest part of the breasts.</description>
