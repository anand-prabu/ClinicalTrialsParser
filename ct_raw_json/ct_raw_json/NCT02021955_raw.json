            "textblock": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations are common among Veterans\n      admitted to hospital, lead to worsening health-related quality of life, and are important\n      drivers of health care expenditures. As many as half of patients discharged for COPD are\n      readmitted within 6 months. An intervention to improve COPD care is needed, not only to\n      treat patients for COPD and their accompanying comorbidities, but also to redesign the care\n      delivery system. The goal of this clinical trial is to test an intervention to improve\n      patient care during the transition from hospital to outpatient setting for patients\n      discharged for COPD.  We will target the intervention to Patient Aligned Care Team (PACT)\n      providers who will be randomized to receive the intervention or not receive the\n      intervention.  For the intervention, study clinicians, consisting of experienced primary\n      care providers and pulmonary specialists, will review the medical record for each patient\n      discharged from hospital for COPD.  The team will look for gaps in care for COPD and key\n      co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.  They\n      will focus on immediate care processes associated with the hospital admission and comorbid\n      disease treatment. For providers in the intervention group, the team will place any patient\n      care recommendations into the medical record using a non-visit consult note and pre-filled\n      order sets.  The patient's provider then may accept, modify, or decline any or all of the\n      recommendations based on personal knowledge of the patient's history.  We hypothesize that\n      the intervention will: 1) improve patient quality of life; and 2) decrease hospital\n      readmission and mortality after hospital admission for COPD exacerbation."
