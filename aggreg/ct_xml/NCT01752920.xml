  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation study of oral ARQ 087 administered to
      subjects with advanced solid tumors. The study is designed to explore the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of ARQ 087 and to define a recommended
      Phase 2 dose.

    <description>Subjects in this study will receive ARQ 087 orally at dose levels specified for their respective dose cohorts. Dosing will begin at 25 mg every other day (QOD) and will escalate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) is determined. Cycles will be repeated in four-week (28 day) intervals until progression of disease, unacceptable toxicity, or another discontinuation criterion is met. In the case of toxicity, dose adjustment will be permitted.</description>
