Drugs used in chemotherapy\n      use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of the monoclonal antibody rituximab plus\n      chemotherapy with vinorelbine in treating patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that\n      has relapsed following autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation."
