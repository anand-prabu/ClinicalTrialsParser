  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are approximately one million Americans who live with Parkinson's disease with 50,000
      new cases per year and this rate is expected to rise with an aging population. The
      underlying pathophysiology and disease understanding of PD still remains elusive due to a
      combination of disease complexity and lack of predictive capability of existing models.

      The Berg Interrogative Biology™ discovery platform has demonstrated a unique capability in
      producing drug targets and biomarkers that truly represent a disease phenotype. It has been
      able to catalyze molecules now in late stage clinical trials in cancer and many pre-clinical
      candidate therapeutics and biomarkers in endocrinology and central nervous system (CNS)
      diseases. The platform is able to decipher normal versus disease signatures by integration
      of data sets from the genome, metabolome, proteome, and lipidome in an agnostic manner that
      is subjected to Bayesian Artificial Intelligence informatics. The resulting nodes are then
      put back into wet-lab validation before proceeding to proof-of-principle pre-clinical
      testing.

      By utilizing clinical data and specimens obtained by the medical specialists at The
      Parkinson's Institute, along with Berg's Interrogative Biology™, this study aims to discover
      a disease biomarker enabling the creation of a diagnostic test for Parkinson's disease.

      Blood &amp; Urine Specimen Collection: Up to 20mL of venous blood samples will be collected for
      plasma multi-omic analysis, as well as optional genetic, analyses.

      Urine samples (~50ml) will be collected via sterile urine cup and transferred into
      appropriate urine tube for multi-omic analysis.

      All Samples may be saved for future studies, if consented.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        For PD cases:

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Men and women with the clinical diagnosis of idiopathic PD

          -  Willing and able to give informed consent

          -  Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study procedures and
             laboratory tests

        Exclusion Criteria:

        PD Subjects with any of the following may not be enrolled:

          1. Presence of atypical or secondary parkinsonism

          2. Inability to provide a blood and/or urine sample

          3. History of renal failure and/or on dialysis

          4. Currently taking a medication in the following categories: dopamine blockers,
             neuroleptics, and/or dopamine blocking agents.

          5. Any medical, psychiatric or other condition which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would preclude participation

        Healthy Controls:

        All of the following criteria must be met for a Healthy Control to be enrolled in the

          2. Willing and able to give informed consent

          3. Willing and able to comply with scheduled visits, required study procedures and
             laboratory tests

        Healthy Controls with any of the following may not be enrolled:

          1. No clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric condition that would
             interfere with the conduct of the study

          2. Diagnosis of  PD or presence of signs of a neurodegenerative disorder

          3. First degree relative with PD/parkinsonism

          4. Inability to provide a blood and/or urine sample

          5. History of renal failure and/or on dialysis
