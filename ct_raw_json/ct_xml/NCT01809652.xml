  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to gain real world, live implant experience with the remote
      implant support system. This system is intended to provide the technical support for device
      implants from a remote location through telepresence (audio and video) and remote control.
      Specifically, the goals of this study are to corroborate bench testing, assess the
      performance of the system, gain understanding of the workflows, customer experience, and
      logistics.

      The intent of the remote support model is to provide the same support that would typically
      be provided by a local support person, only remotely. As such, the remote support person
      would only perform actions that a local support person would routinely do under the
      direction of a physician. This may involve observing patient data, providing technical
      support and advice, and performing testing and device reprogramming via remote control of
      the programmer.
