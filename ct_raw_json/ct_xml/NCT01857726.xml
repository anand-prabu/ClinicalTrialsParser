      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization with
      adriamycin to transarterial chemoembolization with adriamycin/transarterial chemoinfusion
      with cisplatin combination in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion.

    <textblock>
      Potentially curative treatments for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) include surgical
      resection, liver transplantation, and local ablative therapy.

      However, HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages in Korea. Especially, HCCs with
      portal vein invasion are unresectable and they are not suitable for other curative
      therapies. For these patients, the optimal treatment remains largely controversial. As a
      palliative treatment, the benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown
      in patients with unresectable HCC and without portal vein invasion by several trials. In
      patients with main portal vein invasion, TACE is theoretically contraindicated because of
      the potential risk of hepatic failure resulting from ischemia after TACE. However, recent
      studies have revealed that TACE could safely be performed in these patients.

      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)
      with adriamycin to transarterial chemoembolization with adriamycin/transarterial
      chemoinfusion (TACI) with cisplatin combination in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with
      portal vein invasion.
