There are currently no approved therapies for\n      frailty.  Ghrelin is a hormone produced by the stomach that stimulates appetite centers in\n      the brain. The investigators already know that a single dose of Ghrelin improves food intake\n      immediately after the dose in frail older people. In this study, the investigators are\n      trying to find out if repeated daily doses of ghrelin will help frail older people improve\n      food intake for multiple days in a row."
