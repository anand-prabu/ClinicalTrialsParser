            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to learn whether timolol is useful in preventing or delaying\n      the appearance of gastroesophageal varices, a complication that may develop in the future as\n      a consequence of liver disease. Cirrhosis causes an increased resistance of blood flowing\n      through the liver. This leads to an increased pressure in the portal vein (the vein that\n      takes blood to your liver). High portal pressure is responsible for the appearance of\n      complications of chronic liver disease such as varices and variceal bleeding (bleeding from\n      veins in your esophagus). Timolol belongs to a group of medications called beta-blockers.\n      Beta-blockers decrease high portal pressure and previous studies have shown that\n      beta-blocker pills are useful in preventing bleeding from varices in patients who already\n      have varices. A more desirable effect would be if these pills could prevent not only\n      bleeding from varices but the appearance of varices (and therefore of bleeding)."
