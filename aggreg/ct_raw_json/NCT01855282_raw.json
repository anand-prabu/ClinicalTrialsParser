Workers enrolled in a 2:1 ratio by random allocation into\n      an intervention or control arm of the study.  The intervention participants received weekly\n      classes for 10 weeks with education on diabetes, diet and physical activity and practical\n      exercises. Both control and intervention were measured for weight, waist circumference,\n      fasting blood glucose and interviewed before and after the study intervention. The main\n      hypothesis was that intervention, but not control participants, would experience reduction\n      in body measurements after the intervention."
