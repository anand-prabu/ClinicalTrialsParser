This results in them\n      being more prone to falls, and consequent injuries. The purpose of this study is to\n      determine whether providing strength and balance retraining (in the form of specific\n      physical exercises or activities) can help people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy regain\n      their ability to maintain their balance, increase their confidence in performing\n      balance-based activities and improve their quality of life."

DPN is also associated with the greatest reduction in health  related quality of\n      life (HRQoL) among all diabetic complications, specifically PCS (Physical health Component\n      Summary) and its sub-components, physical functioning and physical role. However, there is\n      currently no intervention that targets individuals with DPN for improvements in HRQoL and\n      functional status.\n\n      The investigators hypothesise that a targeted intervention providing strength and balance\n      training will improve HRQoL and functional status in patients with DPN, which will be\n      sufficiently large relative to increases in cost to make the intervention cost-efficient.\n\n      The specific aims of the study are to test the effectiveness of a structured strength and\n      balance training intervention in 1) improving the physical health component summary (PCS)\n      measure of health related quality of life, 2) functional status, and 3) assessing\n      cost-utility of the intervention, in individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN)."
