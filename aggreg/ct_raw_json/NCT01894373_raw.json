UVB therapy within 2\n             weeks prior to randomisation. Systemic treatment with biological therapies (marketed\n             or otherwise) with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g., alefacept, efalizumab,\n             etanercept, infliximab) within 3 months prior to randomisation.\n\n        Systemic treatment other than biologicals with a possible effect on psoriasis (e.g.,\n        corticosteroids, vitamin D analogues, retinoids, hydroxycarbamide, azathioprine,\n        meth-otrexate, cyclosporine, other immunosuppressants) within 4 weeks prior to\n        randomisation.\n\n        Any topical treatment of the scalp (except for medicated shampoos and emollients) within 2\n        weeks prior to randomisation (medicated shampoos/emollients are not allowed during the\n        double-blind phase). Shampoos containing corticosteroids, e.g. Clobex\u00ae, are not allowed\n        within 2 weeks prior to randomisation.\n\n        Planned use of topical treatment for psoriasis of the trunk or limbs, besides study\n        medication, during the study with the exceptions of: \u2022 emollient \u2022 medications used to\n        treat psoriasis of the skin folds and/or genitals (any medication may be used for this\n        purpose apart from Class 1-5 corticosteroids.\n\n        Topical treatment of the face with Class 1-5 corticosteroids within 2 weeks prior to\n        randomisation.\n\n        Planned initiation of, or changes to, concomitant medication that could affect psoriasis\n        (e.g., beta blockers, anti-malaria drugs, lithium) during the double-blind phase of the\n        study.\n\n        Treatment with any non-marketed drug substance (i.e., an agent which has not yet been made\n        available for clinical use following registration) within 4 weeks prior to randomisation.\n\n        Planned use of chemical treatments of the hair (eg relaxers, 'perms', or colourings)\n        during the double-blind phase of the study.\n\n        Current diagnosis of erythrodermic, exfoliative or pustular psoriasis. Patients with any\n        of the following conditions also present on psoriatic areas of the scalp or trunk/limbs:\n        viral (e.g. herpes or varicella) lesions of the skin, fungal or bacterial skin infections,\n        parasitic infections, skin manifestations in relation to tuberculosis or syphilis,\n        rosacea, acne rosacea, acne vulgaris, atrophic skin, striae atrophicae, fragility of skin\n        veins, ichthyosis, ulcers or wounds.\n\n        Other inflammatory skin diseases that may confound the evaluation of psoriasis of the\n        scalp or trunk/limbs."
