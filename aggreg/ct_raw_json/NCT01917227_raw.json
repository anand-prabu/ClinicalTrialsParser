Screening out-patient treatment with insulin use, HbA1c> 8% or poor postprandial\n           glucose (PPG)\n\n        2. At the time of the visits, invite the patient to participate in the Video group\n           education on insulin therapy  By answering some questions about insulin injections,\n           such as: do not know how to perform; afraid of the pain; fear of inconvenience, give\n           patients time to complete the questionnaire."

Upon the general control of\n      diabetic patients in Taiwan, however, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is not satisfactory.\n      One of the important reasons is the low rate of insulin injection. For the use of insulin,\n      the patient has many misconception. The patients in the clinic need to spend a lot of time\n      to explain and description, but the results are not necessarily good. So we hope that in\n      this part of the health education activities through organized groups Videos to assist\n      doctors and patients as a bridge of communication, to enhance diabetes doctor thus\n      contributing to glycemic control results."
