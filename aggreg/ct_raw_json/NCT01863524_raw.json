It was reported by different studies that the Sensitivity of this technique\n      was between 91-96% for AAA screening.\n\n      In addition, this method is cheap, available and requires only 2-3 minutes to be added to\n      the standard TTE.\n\n      we plan to examine patients admitted with ACS in our Intensive Care Unit for screening AAA\n      by TTE in subcostal views in addition to the standard TTE examination."
