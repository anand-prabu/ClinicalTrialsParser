  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An emerging cause of heart attack in young women is a dissection (or tear) in the coronary
      arteries.  Many of these young women continue to have chest pain long after the tear has
      healed and this is thought to be due to problems with their small blood vessels of the heart
      (or microcirculation).  We want to determine whether commonly used medications for coronary
      artery disease including statins (for cholesterol) and angiotensin-converting enzyme
      inhibitors (for blood pressure) reduce chest pain and improve small vessel function in these
      patients.

    <textblock>
      In patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD), many continue to have
      ongoing signs and symptoms of ischemia after the dissection has healed. Further, 1 in 5
      women will experience recurrent SCAD in long-term follow-up. To date, no study has
      investigated the pathophysiologic mechanism behind ongoing symptoms or recurrence of SCAD,
      but microvascular coronary dysfunction (MCD) has been suggested. Coronary reactivity testing
      (CRT) is an invasive procedure currently being done in MCD patients as the gold standard
      technique.  In particular, a coronary flow reserve (CFR) &lt; 2.5 has been shown to be both
      diagnostic of the condition and prognostic of a 2 fold increased risk of cardiac events.
      Please see below for a detailed description of CRT. In brief, a dual temperature and
      pressure sensor tipped wire by Radi Medical Systems (St Jude Medical, St Paul, MN) will be
      placed into the dissected and non-dissected coronary arteries of the patient.  This will
      measure CFR by thermodilution and will also allow the measurement of the index of
      microcirculatory resistance (IMR). IMR has been found to correlate well with true
      microvascular resistance.

      In addition to a lack of diagnostic strategies, there is a paucity of research into
      therapeutic strategies. Most women are conservatively managed with medications, however,
      there is no consensus as to which pharmacologic therapies should be used. Case reports have
      suggested benefit with antiplatelet agents (e.g. aspirin) and beta-blockers (reduction of
      arterial wall shear stress). To date no study has investigated the effects of statins or
      Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibitors (ACEIs) in SCAD patients.  Both agents have been
      studied in the MCD population and been found to reduce angina frequency and improve CFR
      after 16 weeks.

      Purpose:

      To measuring the CFR and IMR in 40 SCAD patients with ongoing chest pain who are at least 3
      months from their dissection to determine the proportion with microvascular dysfunction and
      to investigate prospectively whether the addition of an ACEI or a statin to usual care in
      patients with ongoing chest pain and a CFR &lt;3.0 improves chest pain frequency by Seattle
      Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at 16 weeks compared to placebo.

      Hypothesis:

      We hypothesize that the average CFR in patients at least 3 months out from their SCAD will
      be &lt;2.5 and that their IMR will be abnormal.  Further, we hypothesize that the addition of
      either an ACEI and/or statin will improve chest pain frequency by at least 20 points on the
      SAQ at 16 weeks compared to placebo.
