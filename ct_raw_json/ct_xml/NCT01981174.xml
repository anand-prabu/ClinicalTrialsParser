  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the levels of pain resulting from injections of
      Botox® for wrinkles on the forehead and between the eyes using two different sized needles
      (32 gauge and 30 gauge needles).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be screened, assessed, and randomized to be injected with onabotulinum toxin A
      using a 30-gauge needle on one side of the face and injected using a 32-gauge needle on the
      other side during their first clinic visit. This study is a pilot study designed to
      determine feasibility of these procedures.

All needles would be luer lock, ½ inch length, and attached to separate 1cc syringes. Injection depth would be 1-2mm, dermal, and the angle of incidence would be perpendicular.</description>
