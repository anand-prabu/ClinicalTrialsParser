            "textblock": "Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) refers to daily or intermittent oral administration of\n      antiretroviral drugs designed to protect high-risk HIV-negative individuals from infection.\n      In order for PrEP to become an effective prevention tool, three critical factors must be\n      addressed: a) acceptability, i.e., individuals who would benefit from PrEP must know about\n      it and be willing to take it; b) adherence, i.e., individuals who choose to PrEP as a\n      prevention strategy must take the pills as prescribed; and c) implementation, i.e.,\n      processes and protocols must be developed to allow for the integration of PrEP delivery and\n      programs into real world settings in a way that is feasible, scalable, and realistic. This\n      project has three specific aims: 1) Identifying social and behavioral factors that are\n      likely to influence PrEP implementation, acceptance, and use/adherence by men who have sex\n      with men (MSM) in NYC, including factors at individual-, community-, and\n      organizational-levels; 2) Examining social and behavioral factors associated with\n      disparities in access to prevention and care services among MSM in NYC that might directly\n      impact PrEP implementation programs and policies; and 3) Evaluating an intervention in which\n      PrEP is introduced, provided, and supported as part of a prevention package delivered in an\n      community health center. The project has the potential to exert a sustained and powerful\n      influence not only on the effectiveness of PrEP interventions for MSM, but also on\n      dissemination and scalability of a targeted intervention within community-based settings and\n      in a manner that reduces disparities in access and maximizes cultural competence and\n      acceptability."
