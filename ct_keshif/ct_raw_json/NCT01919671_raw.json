Participants will be randomized into Tongxinluo capsule treatment\n      group with the capsule administration of 4 granules tid. for 90 days, while the patients in\n      the control group receive placebo capsule. NIH Stroke Score of the subjects is 4-22 at\n      randomization. Evaluations of efficacy and safety will be taken at baseline, 7 days,\n      discharge date and 90 days. Neuroimaging [magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans] will be\n      obtained at baseline and 90 days after therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint is the\n      proportion of Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) \u22641 at 90 days."
