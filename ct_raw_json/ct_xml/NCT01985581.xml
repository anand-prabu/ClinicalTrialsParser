  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study looks to examine whether or not INTUNIV extended release can help children aged
      6-12 years diagnosed with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in improving
      Executive Function when added to their usual care stimulant therapy.  Executive functions
      are a set of mental processes that include emotional control, planning, organization,
      working memory, inhibition of behaviors, and managing time and space. As children with ADHD
      usually have difficulties with Executive Function, and Executive function difficulties lead
      to more difficulties in school and behaviour, it is anticipated that adding INTUNIV extended
      release to usual stimulant therapy will improve Executive Function scores as rated by
      parents and teachers. Improvements in quality of life will also be measured.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although stimulant medications have been shown to have positive impact on executive function
      (EF) (Findling et al, 2009; Hale et al. 2011), little has been documented about the effect
      of INTUNIV extended release on EF in children. The manifestation of clinical symptoms
      related to impairment in EF often leads to the search for additional treatment options and
      in many cases to adjunct therapies to the traditional stimulant medication treatment
      regimen. Demonstrating that the addition of INTUNIV extended release to usual stimulant
      therapy is effective for symptom control as well as in improving EF may influence clinical
      treatment algorithms and the need for health care resources to effectively manage patients.
      Since EF deficits negatively impact academic achievement and behavior at school and because
      children spend a large number of daytime hours at school, the concordance of any reported
      improvement in the school and the home environment will be examined. Overall improvement in
      quality of life with the addition of INTUNIV extended release will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female patient aged 6 to 12 years at the time of consent/assent and to then
             of study. A patient who would turn 13 before the end of the study cannot be enrolled

          2. Patient's parent or legally authorized representative (LAR) must provide signed
             informed consent before any study-related procedures are completed.

          3. Patient meets the diagnostic standard manual-5 criteria for a primary diagnosis of
             ADHD, combined sub-type, hyperactive/impulsive sub-type, or inattentive sub-type

          4. Patient is currently on a stable stimulant regimen but whose EF is suboptimal.
             Suboptimal EF is defined as a global executive composite t-score greater than 65
             (&gt;1.5 SD from mean) on the BRIEF-P questionnaire at screening.

          5. Patient who is currently and is expected to remain on a stable stimulant regimen
             throughout the study. A stable stimulant regimen is defined as:

             •No significant change in dose or dosing frequency within the past 30 days prior to
             screening and stimulant is felt to be optimized by the investigator.

          6. Patient is functioning at an age-appropriate level intellectually, as judged by the
             Investigator.

          7. Patient is able to swallow intact tablets.

          8. Patient has sitting blood pressure (BP) measurement within the 95th percentile for
             age, sex, and height (see Blood Pressure Levels for Boys and Girls by Age and Height
             Percentile

          9. Patient and parent/LAR understand, are willing, able, and likely to fully comply with
             the study procedures and restrictions defined in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a current, controlled (requiring a prohibited medication or behavioural
             modification program) or uncontrolled, co-morbid psychiatric diagnosis [except
             oppositional defiant disorder (ODD)], including any severe co-morbid Axis II
             disorders or severe Axis I disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
             bipolar illness, psychosis, pervasive developmental disorder, obsessive-compulsive
             disorder (OCD), substance abuse disorder, or other symptomatic manifestations or
             lifetime history of bipolar illness, psychosis or conduct disorder.

          2. Patient has any condition or illness which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             represents an inappropriate risk to the patient and/or could confound the
             interpretation of the study. Mild stable asthma treated without the use of beta-2
             agonist is not exclusionary.

          3. Patient has a known personal history, or presence, of structural cardiac
             abnormalities, cardiovascular or cerebrovascular disease, serious heart rhythm

             intolerance to guanfacine hydrochloride or any of its active ingredients or patient
             is taking other products containing guanfacine.

         12. History of adverse event or failure to respond (lack of efficacy) to an adequate
             trial of an alpha-agonist.
