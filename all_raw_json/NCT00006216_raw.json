Determine the safety and side effects of intrapleurally administered PA-1-STK\n      modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine and ganciclovir in patients with stage I, II, or III\n      malignant mesothelioma. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting\n      toxicities of this vaccine in these patients. III. Determine the immunologic response to\n      this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the intrapleural pharmakokinetics of\n      ganciclovir in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of PA-1-STK modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine.\n      Patients receive PA-1-STK modified ovarian carcinoma vaccine intrapleurally on day 1\n      followed by ganciclovir IV over 1 hour for 7 days beginning on day 1. Patients in the first\n      2 cohorts receive 1 course of treatment only. In all subsequent cohorts, treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks for a total of 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of PA-1-STK modified ovarian\n      carcinoma vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose is determined.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-16 patients will be accrued for this study."
