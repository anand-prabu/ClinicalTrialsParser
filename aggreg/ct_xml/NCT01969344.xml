  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of SPIROMICS is to learn about chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),
      which is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis.  Millions of Americans have COPD,
      and it is the fourth leading cause of death in the country.  The most common cause of COPD
      is cigarette smoking, although not all smokers get COPD.  The discovery of new treatments
      for COPD has been slowed by a poor understanding of different types of COPD and a lack of
      ways to measure whether or not COPD is getting worse.

      The study has two main goals.  The first is to find groups of patients with COPD who share
      certain characteristics.  Certain groups may respond differently to certain treatments.  The
      second is to find new ways of measuring whether or not COPD is getting worse.  This would
      provide new ways of testing whether a new treatment is working.

    <description>COPD is characterized by physiological problems, such as airflow limitations and abnormalities of gas exchange and lung hyperinflation. These features of lung function are accessed objectively in the laboratory setting using spirometry/plethysmography, which can measure such parameters as FEV1 (forced expiratory volume in one second), FVC (forced vital capacity or total volume of air exhaled after full inspiration), FRC (functional residual capacity or volume of gas remaining in the lung at the end of tidal expiration), and IC (inspiratory capacity or maximum volume of gas that can be inspired from end-tidal expiration).  The FDA preferred primary endpoint for assessment of alteration in disease progression in COPD is serial measurements of FEV1 over three years.</description>

    <time_frame>Participants will be followed for an average of three years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Deaths of SPIROMICS participants will be identified during follow-up calls and attempts to schedule clinic exams during the three-year study period, and deaths will be recorded in the clinical database.  The cause of death will be determined via chart review and adjudication, and deaths attributable to COPD worsening or exacerbation will be recorded as confirmed clinical endpoints, in addition to contributing to the endpoint of all-cause mortality.</description>
