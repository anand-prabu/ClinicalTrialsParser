  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Psoriasis is a distressing, chronic dermatitis. Plague-type psoriasis is the most common
      form of the disease, occurring in more than 80% of the cases. This type of psoriasis is
      characterised by sharply dermatcated, erythematous, scaling plagues that typically affect
      the elbows, knees, scalp, and intergluteal cleft. Estimates of the prevalence of psoriasis
      is vary from 0.5% to 4.6%, with rate varying between countries and races. The prevalence of
      psoriasis was about 2% in Taiwan. The cause of psoriasis remains unknown; however, it has
      been linked to complex interactions between predisposing genes and the environment. Current
      treatment of psoriasis included topical therapy (eg. topical corticosteroids, tars,
      anthralin, vitamin D analogues, Retinodes), phototherapy and systemic therapy (eg.
      Methotrexate, cyclosporine, Retinoids, Biologics). Although beneficial, all have undesirable
      adverse effects.

      Estimated enrollment:

      Total of 24 subjects:

      mild to moderate psoriasis patients will be randomized into treatment group (n=16) placebo
      group (n=8)

      Study evaluation:

      A baseline and end of the study evaluation on the patients will be performed, including
      physical examination, hemogram and blood biochemical analysis (including
      glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic-pyruvic transaminase, and creatinine
      measurement). The baseline and end of the study of total body surface area involvement and
      Psoriasis Area Severity Index (PASI), PGA, OTPSS scores will be also calculated.
