      This study is a regulatory post-marketing surveillance in Japan, and it is a local
      prospective and observational study of patients who have received EYLEA for Age-Related
      Macular Degeneration (AMD).

      The objective of this study is to assess safety and effectiveness of EYLEA using in real
      clinical practice.

      A total of 4,000 patients are to be enrolled and assessed in 3 years standard observational
      period. An annual follow-up survey will be conducted for 5 years at the longest after
      standard observational period.
