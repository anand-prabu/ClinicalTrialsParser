            "textblock": "Growing evidence indicates that chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is an important\n      cause of respiratory impairment in HIV+ persons and will likely increase as the HIV+\n      population continues to age. In the HIV-uninfected population, COPD frequently co-exists\n      with cardiac disease including atherosclerosis and pulmonary hypertension (PH). The\n      investigators work has demonstrated that a syndrome of \"cardiopulmonary dysfunction\" exists\n      even in non-smoking or antiretroviral-treated HIV+ individuals. The investigators have found\n      that HIV+ individuals have a high prevalence of respiratory symptoms, airflow obstruction,\n      and diffusing capacity (DLco) abnormalities that occur concurrently with cardiac\n      co-morbidities, including radiographic measures of atherosclerosis and elevated\n      echocardiographic pulmonary artery pressures. This syndrome is marked by inflammation with\n      elevated levels of cytokines and hsCRP, peripheral T-cell activation, and increased sputum\n      neutrophils as well as elevation of NT-proBNP, a marker of heart strain. Importantly, the\n      investigators have shown that DLco impairment and elevated NT-proBNP are significant\n      independent predictors of mortality in HIV, indicating that cardiopulmonary dysfunction is\n      likely highly clinically relevant and identifies a vulnerable population in whom the\n      investigators lack effective interventions.\n\n      Statins have anti-inflammatory effects in the lung and vasculature that might benefit\n      cardiopulmonary dysfunction in HIV. These agents have a long history of clinical use in\n      cardiovascular disease and are currently being investigated as disease-modifying drugs for\n      HIV, COPD, and PH. In preliminary analyses, the investigators have found that HIV+\n      individuals who received statin therapy within the past year were significantly less likely\n      to have impaired DLco and had lower pulmonary artery pressures, lower NT-proBNP, lower\n      peripheral cytokines, and fewer sputum neutrophils despite being older and having a greater\n      smoking history than those not using statins."
