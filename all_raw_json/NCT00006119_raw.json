Patients are stratified according to grade of disease\n      (I vs II or III).\n\n      Patients receive oral hydroxyurea daily for 2 years.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
