    <textblock>
      This study examines the use of cryoablation as an alternative to surgery and radiation in
      the treatment of early stage invasive breast cancer. The hypothesis is that cryoablation
      will complete ablation and destroy the tumor in a selected population of women who may
      otherwise be adequately treated with surgery.

      PURPOSE:

      To determine the rate of successful tumor ablation in patients treated with cryoablation and
      endocrine therapy without axillary surgery or radiotherapy in a subset of elderly patients
      with prognostically favorable early stage breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:

        1. Core Biopsy (Pre-Registration)

        2. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Pre-Registration)

        3. Tumor Cryoablation

        4. Core Biopsy (Post-Cryoablation)

        5. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (Post-Cryoablation)

        6. Post-operative Follow-up

        7. Evaluation of outcomes

      ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

        1. Age 70 or older

        2. No History of en bloc open surgical biopsy and/or lumpectomy for diagnosis/treatment of
           the index breast cancer.

        3. No prior or planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

        4. Adequate breast size for safe cryoablation. Female breast cancer patients with breasts
           too small to allow safe cryoablation are not eligible as the minimal thickness of the
           breast tissue does not lend itself to cryoablation.

        5. Unifocal primary invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed by core needle biopsy.

        6. Patients with prior in situ or invasive breast carcinomas are eligible if the prior
           carcinomas occurred in the contralateral breast or in a separate quadrant of the same
           breast. Patients with prior in-situ or invasive breast carcinomas in the same quadrant
           of the ipsilateral breast are not eligible.

        7. Tumor enhancement on pre- study MRI.

        8. Tumor size ≤2.0 cm in greatest diameter.

        9. Tumor with &lt;25% intraductal components in the aggregate.

       10. Histology and prognostically favorable (Luminal A) breast cancer based on analysis of
           core needle biopsy specimen.

       11. Clinically node negative based on examination and axillary ultrasound, or
           histology-confirmed negative nodes based on fine or core needle biopsy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 70 or older

          2. No History of en bloc open surgical biopsy and/or lumpectomy for diagnosis/treatment
             of the index breast cancer.

          3. No prior or planned neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast cancer.

          4. Adequate breast size for safe cryoablation.

          5. Unifocal primary invasive ductal breast carcinoma diagnosed by core needle biopsy.

          6. Patients with prior in situ or invasive breast carcinomas are eligible if the prior
             carcinomas occurred in the contralateral breast or in a separate quadrant of the same
             breast. Patients with prior in-situ or invasive breast carcinomas in the same
             quadrant of the ipsilateral breast are not eligible.

          7. Tumor enhancement on pre- study MRI.

          8. Tumor size ≤2.0 cm in greatest diameter. Specifically, the tumor must measure ≤2.0 cm
             in the axis parallel to the treatment probe and ≤1.5 cm in the axis anti-parallel to
             the treatment probe. Largest size measured by required scans (mammogram, ultrasound,
             and MRI) will be used to determine eligibility.

          9. Tumor with &lt;25% intraductal components in the aggregate. NOTE: The percent
             intraductal component form the patient's diagnostic biopsy must be available prior to
             registration. If the biopsy pathology report does not contain the percent intraductal
             component, the re-review of pathology slides and creation of a report addendum or
             note-to-file by the reviewing pathologist.

         10. Histology and prognostically favorable (Luminal A) breast cancer based on analysis of
             core needle biopsy specimen.

         11. Clinically node negative based on examination and axillary ultrasound, or
             histology-confirmed negative nodes based on fine or core needle biopsy.
