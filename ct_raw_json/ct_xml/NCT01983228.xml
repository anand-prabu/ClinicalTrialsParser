  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of chronic pain treatment among VA
      patients. The primary objective of this study is to improve pain outcomes among black VA
      patients with chronic, musculoskeletal (MSK) pain, who experience poorer pain treatment and
      outcomes than their white counterparts. The work proposed is expected to result in a
      non-pharmacological intervention, delivered by telephone, designed to reduce pain and
      improve functioning among black patients with MSK pain, by promoting walking. This
      intervention is specifically designed to address factors that contribute to MSK pain among
      black Veterans; however, we expect that it will also benefit non-black Veterans. The
      proposed research is innovative, in its use of proactive outreach and recent advances in
      self-regulation strategies (such as Action Planning) to help black Veterans overcome
      psychological, environmental, utilization-related, and provider-related barriers that
      contribute to pain.

      1. BACKGROUND/RATIONALE. Chronic musculoskeletal (MSK) pain is one of the most common
           conditions among Veterans, affecting approximately 60% of those seen in VA primary
           care. Although perceived effectiveness of chronic pain treatment is low among all VA
           patients, black patients are less likely than whites to perceive their treatment as
           effective, and are more likely to experience functional limitations due to pain.  There
           is growing consensus that chronic MSK pain is best addressed by a biopsychosocial
           approach that acknowledges the role of psychological and environmental factors, some of
           which differ by race. For example, blacks experience greater pain-related fear and
           lower self-efficacy in coping with pain (psychological contributors), and neighborhoods
           that make physical activity difficult (environmental contributors). However, there is a
           lack of effective interventions to improve pain treatment among minority patients,
           particularly those that target psychological and environmental contributors.

        2. OBJECTIVES. Our long term goal is to improve the quality and equity of pain treatment
           in order to improve pain outcomes for all Veterans. The objective of this application
           is to test the effectiveness of a multi-component intervention that specifically
           targets known barriers to effective pain care among blacks Veterans with chronic MSK
           pain. Our primary hypothesis is that a telephone-delivered intervention, which
           emphasizes walking and incorporates Action Planning, Motivational Interviewing (MI) and
           Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) techniques, and the use of pedometers, will improve
           core chronic pain outcomes in black Veterans.

        3. METHODS. We propose a randomized trial to test the effectiveness of  the intervention
           compared with usual care (UC) among 286 black and 286 non-black patients with chronic
           MSK pain. Patients from the Atlanta VAMC will be identified using data from the
           recently funded VA cohort study of Veterans with diagnoses of musculoskeletal pain in
           VA care. Patients will be screened by phone, and, if eligible, will be administered the
           full baseline survey. Eligible patients will be randomly assigned to the Usual Care
           (UC) or intervention condition (IC). Intervention participants will receive a
           pedometer-mediated walking intervention that will incorporate Action Planning and the
           use MI and CBT techniques. The intervention will be delivered in 6 telephone counseling
           sessions over three months.  Patients in the UC condition will receive an informational
           brochure and a pedometer. The study is powered to find a difference between the IC and
           UC groups within the black and non-black groups. The primary outcome is chronic
           pain-related physical functioning, assessed by the revised Roland and Morris Disability
           Questionnaire, a measure recommended by the Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and
           Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). We will also examine whether the
           intervention improves other IMMPACT-recommended domains (pain intensity, emotional
           functioning, and ratings of overall improvement), will examine whether psychological
           factors targeted by the intervention mediate improvement in pain outcomes, and will
           test the effectiveness of the intervention on non-black patients and other subgroups of
           patients who may experience barriers to effective pain management.  Measures will be
           assessed by phone survey at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Data analysis of primary
           aims will follow intent-to-treat methodology.

        4. STATUS. We received the funding letter on 10/07/13 and we are in the early stages of
           preparing our JIT documents and we are currently waiting for IRB approval.

        5. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE. This project will result in a non-pharmacological intervention
           to improve pain-related functioning among black Veterans with chronic MSK pain in VA
           care, which may also benefit other Veterans who have similar contributors to pain.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Eligible patients must receive care at the Atlanta VAMC and

          -  have pain duration of   6 months,

          -  moderate-severe pain intensity and interference with function (defined as a PEG score
             of   5),

          -  self-reported ability to walk at least 1 block, and

          -  must be able to communicate effectively by telephone (no cognitive disability). We
             will not exclude patients who are on medication or receiving interventions to treat
             their chronic pain.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will not include the approximately 10% of patients who have no race data;
             administrative race data will be verified on the brief screening survey.  We will
             also not include any vulnerable populations or those who meet any of the following
             exclusion criteria that may interfere with the outcome assessment:

               -  moderately severe cognitive impairment defined as &gt; 2 errors on a brief
                  cognitive screener;

               -  anticipated back, knee, hip, or other major surgery within the next 12 months,
                  and

               -  a diagnosis (on the MSD) of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or other psychosis.

          -  We will also exclude any veterans who also happen to be VA employees at the Atlanta
             VAMC because employees cannot be compensated for participating in research studies.
