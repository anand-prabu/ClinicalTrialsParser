There is an urgent need to find a simpler way to prevent mother-to-infant\n      transmission during labor and delivery. The proposed NVP schedule is simpler and possibly\n      could be used in Uganda."

The proposed\n      trial specifically will test the hypothesis that chemoprophylaxis of the fetus/neonate\n      during labor and delivery and the first week of life may significantly reduce the risk of\n      perinatal HIV-1 transmission.\n\n      Pregnant women infected with HIV-1 are randomized to 1 of 4 study arms and receive either\n      NVP or its placebo, or AZT or its placebo. Mothers in the NVP group receive a single dose of\n      NVP or placebo at the onset of labor and are followed to 6 to 8 weeks after delivery.\n      Infants born to these mothers receive at 48 to 72 hours post-delivery or discharge,\n      whichever comes first, a regimen of the same treatment (NVP or placebo) given to the mother.\n      Infants are followed for 18 months post-delivery by clinical and laboratory evaluation to\n      determine toxicity, evidence of HIV-1 infection, and clinical disease progression.\n\n      Mothers in the AZT group receive either a bolus of AZT or its placebo at onset of labor,\n      then doses every 3 hours until delivery, with follow-up to 6 to 8 weeks. Infants begin\n      receiving either a lower dose of AZT or placebo as soon as they can tolerate liquids by\n      mouth, twice daily for 7 days, and are followed for 18 months as in the NVP group."
