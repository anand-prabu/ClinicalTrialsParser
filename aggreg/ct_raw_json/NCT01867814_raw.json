            "textblock": "Laparoscopic surgery is frequently associated with hemodynamic changes due to\n      pneumoperitoneum (PnP). Those complex hemodynamic changes are difficult to predict and\n      occasionally they require active therapeutic interventions or even interruption of the\n      surgical procedure.\n\n      One of the main hemodynamic effects of PnP is a decrease in cardiac output due to reduction\n      of venous return and cardiac preload. Although it has been shown repeatedly that waveform\n      variables are good predictors of cardiac output response to volume loading, the prediction\n      hemodynamic response to decrease of preload is more complex.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that waveform variables will predict cardiac output changes\n      resulting from PnP. Particularly, augmented values of waveform variables before PnP will be\n      associated with a larger decrease of cardiac output after establishing PnP."

All patients will\n                anesthetized intravenously with Fentanyl 2-5 mcg/kg, Propofol 1-2 mg/kg and\n                Rocuronium 0.6-1.0 mg/kg followed by endotracheal intubation. Positive pressure\n                ventilation with tidal volume 8 mL/kg of ideal body weight and respiratory rate\n                8-12 bpm to achieve end-tidal carbon dioxide of 33-37 mmHg will be applied after\n                intubation. Anesthesia will be maintained with inhalation of Isoflurane\n                (end-expiratory concentration at least 1.2%) in air/O2 (FiO2=0.4). Intraoperative\n                fluid management will include an initial bolus of crystalloid solution (lactated\n                Ringer's solution) at a dose of 7 mL/kg. Arterial blood pressure will be measured\n                continuously through a radial arterial catheter. Pulse oximetry\n                photoplethysmography will be monitored by index finger probe on the same side.\n                Cardiac output will monitored noninvasively by NICOM (Non-invasive cardiac output\n                monitor) that calculates stroke volume variation (SVV) in addition to cardiac\n                output/cardiac index and stroke volume/stroke index\n\n             -  The study procedure will begin after induction of anesthesia, preparation of the\n                patient for surgery and insertion of the pneumoperitoneum insufflation device. The\n                study procedure will last for 10-15 minutes and will be finished before actual\n                intraperitoneal surgical manipulation begins\n\n        -  Waveforms will be recorded from the patient monitor and values of NICOM will be noted\n           at baseline before surgical manipulation, at PnP pressure=0 mmHg before gas\n           insufflation but after insertion of peritoneal needle, and after PnP pressure reaches\n           15 mmHg (routine value for laparoscopic surgery). If after reaching PnP pressure of 15\n           mmHg CO will decrease by more than 20%, the PnP pressure will be reduced to 10 mmHg and\n           recording of waveforms will be repeated after two minutes\n\n        -  Standard hemodynamic parameters (heart rate, systolic and diastolic BP) and waveform\n           variables (SPV, PWV) will be measured and calculated offline according to the records\n\n        -  Parameters measured by NICOM (CO, CI, SV, SVI, SVV) will be noted at baseline (PnP\n           pressure=0 mmHg), after PnP pressure reached 15 mmHg and after PnP pressure decreased\n           till 10 mmHg (if necessary)\n\n             -  There will be no further follow up of the patients\n\n             -  We anticipate that there will be a significant number of patients with a reduction\n                of CO by 20% or more after establishment of PnP of 15 mm Hg. We will perform\n                comparisons between waveforms at baseline between those who decrease CO and those\n                who do not. If there will be significant difference in variables at baseline there\n                will be justification to perform ROC analysis to evaluate sensitivity and\n                specificity of these variables to predict decrease in CO. In patients who will\n                have a decrease in CO after PnP of 15 mm Hg we will compare the same variables to\n                those that will be reached at PnP of 10 mmHg. These comparisons can help to\n                understand the mechanisms of CO decrease during PnP\n\n             -  All of the analysis of the data will be performed after removing all identifying\n                data"
