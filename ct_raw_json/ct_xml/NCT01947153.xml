    <textblock>
      The objective of the current study is to demonstrate bioequivalence of two 2.5 mg
      linagliptin/500 mg metformin fixed dose combination tablets compared to the free combination
      of the linagliptin 5 mg and metformin 1000 mg in healthy male and female volunteers.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with Good Clinical Practice and the local legislation

          -  Healthy males and females according to the following criteria:

        Based upon a complete medical history, including physical examination, vital signs (BP,
        PR), 12-lead ECG and clinical laboratory tests (haematology, clinical chemistry and
        urinalysis).

          -  Age 18 to 45 years (incl.)

          -  Body mass index by Quetelet between 18.50 to 24.99 kg/m2 (incl.)

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who agree on using double-barrier
             contraception during the study. If a female is postmenopausal (no menses for at least
             2 years) or surgically sterile (bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or
             hysterectomy) she will be exempt from the requirement. In case of using oral
             contraceptives, these should be withdrawn at least 2 months before the first drug
             dosing.

          -  Male subjects who agree on using effective contraception during the study (barrier
             contraceptive methods)

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Any laboratory value outside the reference range that is of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease

          -  Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          -  Positive results of blood tests for infections (HIV, syphilis, hepatitis B or C)

          -  A positive urine drug screening test at screening and on admission to the trial site
             in each treatment period.

          -  A positive alcohol breath test at screening and on admission to the trial site in
             each treatment period.

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)
