Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus radiation\n      therapy in treating women who have stage III or stage IV endometrial cancer."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks\n      for 3 courses. Patients then undergo whole abdominal radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4-6\n      weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-53 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5\n      years."
