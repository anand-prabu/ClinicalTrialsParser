            "textblock": "When a healthy individual begins a meal, there is a rapid insulin response.  Currently\n      available subcutaneously injected or infused human insulin products (both recombinant human\n      insulin and rapid acting insulin analogs) do not replicate the natural insulin response to a\n      meal challenge.  Instead, subcutaneously injected or infused insulins enter the bloodstream\n      relatively slowly, and, likewise, they tend to have a duration of action that is too long to\n      optimally mimic normal physiology.  As a consequence, patients with diabetes have inadequate\n      levels of insulin present at the initiation of a meal and very often have too much systemic\n      insulin between meals.  This may lead to hyperglycemia in the early post-meal time period,\n      followed by risk of hypoglycemia between meals.\n\n      Building on Halozyme's experience with rHuPH20 (active component of Hylenex recombinant)\n      co-injected with insulin products studied in both the clinical setting and in the take-home\n      setting along with experience using rHuPH20 with CSII, this Phase 4 study is designed to\n      demonstrate non-inferiority of pretreatment with Hylenex recombinant in the CSII setting to\n      rapid acting analog insulin alone with respect to glycemic control as assessed by changes in\n      A1C in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus"

A1C 6.5 - 9.5% (inclusive) based on central laboratory results.\n\n          3. Fasting C-peptide < 0.6 ng/mL\n\n          4. Current use of an insulin pump compatible with available tubing for Hylenex\n             recombinant infusion and use of an infusion set compatible with the tubing available\n             or willingness to switch to an infusion set compatible with tubing available for\n             infusion of Hylenex recombinant.\n\n          5. Current treatment at the time of screening with insulin <300 U/day.\n\n          6. Subjects who routinely use CGM (defined as average CGM use 5 or more days per week\n             over the preceding 3 months) and those who do not routinely use CGM are both eligible\n             for inclusion in the study.  Intermittent use of CGM is also acceptable but will not\n             be a criterion use for stratified randomization.\n\n          7. Subjects should be in good general health based on medical history and physical\n             examination, without medical conditions that might prevent the completion of study\n             drug infusions and assessments required in this protocol.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Type 2 diabetes\n\n          2. Known or suspected allergy to any component of any of the study drugs in this study.\n\n          3. Severe proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy, and/or gastroparesis, and/or severe\n             neuropathy, in particular autonomic neuropathy, of such severity as to impede the\n             subject's ability to comply with protocol procedures, as judged by the Investigator.\n\n          4. History of transmural myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and\n             uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic BP consistently >100 mm Hg) are exclusionary\n\n          5. As judged by the Investigator, clinically significant active disease of the\n             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (including history of stroke, a history of\n             arrhythmia or conduction delays on ECG), hepatic, neurological, renal, genitourinary,\n             pulmonary, or hematological systems of such severity as to impede the subject's\n             ability to comply with protocol procedures.\n\n          6. History of any illness or disease that in the opinion of the Investigator might\n             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering the study\n             drugs to the subject.\n\n          7. As judged by the Investigator, clinically significant findings in routine laboratory\n             data at screening.\n\n          8. Use of drugs that may interfere with the interpretation of study results or are known\n             to cause clinically relevant interference with hyaluronidase action (see Section\n             8.3), insulin action, glucose utilization, or recovery from hypoglycemia (including\n             systemic pharmacologic corticosteroid).  Use of pramlintide or a GLP1 receptor\n             agonist is NOT exclusionary but subjects using these agents will be subjected to\n             stratified randomization.  Use of aspirin (ASA) up to 325 mg/day is NOT exclusionary\n             but should be noted for analysis.\n\n          9. Hypoglycemic unawareness of such severity as to impede the subject's ability to\n             comply with protocol procedures, as judged by the Investigator.\n\n         10. Current addiction to alcohol or substance abuse as determined by the Investigator.\n\n         11. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, the intention of becoming pregnant, or not using adequate\n             contraceptive measures (adequate contraceptive measures consist of sterilization,\n             intra-uterine device [IUD], oral or injectable contraceptives, and/or barrier\n             methods).  Abstinence alone is not considered an adequate contraceptive measure for\n             the purposes of this study.\n\n         12.
