Tumors without demonstration of deletions of INI1 gene\n      by FISH are examined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based microsatellite analysis for\n      loss of heterozygosity using markers that map to 22q11.2.\n\n      DNA from tumor tissue is analyzed for mutations in the exons of the INI1 gene. Isolated\n      matched normal DNA may be analyzed for identification of germline mutations. Parental DNA\n      may be analyzed to identify inherited germline mutations of the INI1 gene.\n\n      The patient's physician may receive the results of the genetic testing. The results do not\n      influence the type or duration of treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 25 months."
