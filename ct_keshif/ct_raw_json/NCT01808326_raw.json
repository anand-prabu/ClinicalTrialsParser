Other more aggressive\n      treatment options such as a combination of fludarabine (F) and cyclophosphamide are\n      available, but are associated with significantly greater toxicities. The addition of\n      ofatumumab to chlorambucil offers potentially a more effective therapy, with limited\n      additional toxicity.\n\n      Study OMB110911 has been conducted mainly in the US and EU to evaluate progression-free\n      survival (PFS) and overall response (OR) in subjects with previously untreated CLL with\n      ofatumumab in combination with chlorambucil versus (vs.) chlorambucil monotherapy.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate overall response of chlorambucil in Japanese\n      subjects with previously untreated CLL."
