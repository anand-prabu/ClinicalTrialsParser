  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with severe thalassemia (thalassemia major) present with severe anemia that
      requires life-long transfusion therapy, spleen enlargement that may lead to increased
      transfusion requirement, and other serious complications as early death, growth retardation,
      bone deformations and iron overload due to blood transfusions. Splenectomy can significantly
      reduce transfusion requirement in thalassemia patients, but it is associated with an
      increased risk of serious complications such as sepsis and thrombosis. Preliminary
      preclinical and clinical data suggest that JAK2 inhibition, by reducing spleen size, may
      improve hemoglobin levels, thereby eliminating the need for splenectomy and reducing
      transfusion requirement and related iron overload.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients 18 years of age or older

          2. Patients with thalassemia on a regular and stable transfusion regimen (at least 2 RBC
             units within every 4-week interval for 24 weeks prior to Screening) and anticipated
             to receive the same transfusion regimen during the study.

          3. Patients with spleen enlargement at Screening, defined as spleen palpable below the
             costal margin and spleen volume of ≥ 450 cm3 as confirmed by MRI (or CT scan in
             applicable patients).

          4. Patients need to be on iron chelation treatment (deferoxamine or deferasirox) for at
             least four weeks prior to Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Splenectomy prior to or planned during the study.

          2. Active serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, parasitic or viral infection which
             requires therapy (e.g., pneumonia, tuberculosis, systemic mycosis, herpes zoster).

          3. Hemoglobin &lt;65 g/L (&lt;4.0 mmol/L) at Screening.

          4. Platelet count &lt;75×109/L, absolute neutrophils count &lt; 1.5×109/L at Screening.

          5. Estimated MDRD &lt; 30 mL/min/1.73 m2 at Screening.

          6. ALT (SGPT) levels &gt;5 times ULN at Screening.

          7. Hepatocellular disease such as hepatitis B (presence of HBs antigen), hepatitis C
             (presence of HCV RNA), liver cirrhosis.

          8. HIV positivity
