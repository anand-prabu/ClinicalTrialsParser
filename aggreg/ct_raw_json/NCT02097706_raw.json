            "textblock": "Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders\n      with high morbidity and mortality. It affects the lives of millions worldwide and is often\n      highly incapacitating, leading to significant psychosocial dysfunction. Moreover, nearly all\n      patients have experienced suicidal ideation and about 10% actually commit suicide, a rate\n      almost 50 times higher than in the general population. Mostly young women are at greater\n      risk for the disorder and are three times more likely to be diagnosed with BPD than men.\n\n      BPD aetiology is complex and could be explained by both biological and environmental\n      factors. Among the environmental factors, sexual or physical abuse, parental divorce, loss\n      or illnesses are identified as the most common ones. These factors can induce dysfunctional\n      behaviours, which might cause emotional dysregulation, high impulsivity and frequent self-\n      injurious behaviour.\n\n      However, there are no pharmacologic interventions that are known to be specifically\n      effective to treat BPD. Therapeutic options for this devastating disorder is still far from\n      adequate for treating acute illness episodes, relapses, and recurrences and in restoring\n      premorbid functioning. In addition, some patients are unable to tolerate existing therapies\n      for BPD, which leads to either frequent changes in medications or to non-adherence.\n      Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of more rapidly effective treatments\n      for BPD.\n\n      A growing body of evidence suggests that glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular\n      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype may play a role in the pathophysiology of multiple\n      psychiatric disorders. This has led to various clinical trials with glutamate modulating\n      drugs. The trial drug is an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist approved for Alzheimer's\n      disease is increasingly being studied in a variety of non-dementia psychiatric disorders.\n      Results from these studies have proved that the trial drug was safe and well tolerated and\n      has the potential for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.\n\n      To date, there are no published data on the use of trial drug in the treatment for BPD.\n      Therefore, the investigators intend to study the efficacy of this novel cognitive enhancing\n      drug as an addition to ongoing therapy with atypical antipsychotics in patients with\n      Borderline Personality Disorder. This study will recruit 30 BPD patients who are currently\n      stable on Quetiapine (25-150mg) medication for three weeks. The patients will be randomly\n      allocated to receive either the study medication (20mg/ day) or placebo via oral\n      administration for eight weeks. To observe the efficacy of the trial treatment, all\n      participants will be assessed at various time intervals for different scales including\n      psychotic, negative and cognitive symptoms."
