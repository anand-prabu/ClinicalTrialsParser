    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to estimate the difference in the efficacy between a 16-week
      treatment regimen of boceprevir (BOC) in combination with peg-intron alpha 2b (PEG2b) plus
      ribavirin (RBV) (BOC/PR) and a 28-week treatment regimen of BOC/PR in previously untreated
      participants with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) genotype 1 in Asia who achieve undetectable
      hepatitis C virus ribonucleic acid (HCV RNA) at treatment week (TW) 8.
