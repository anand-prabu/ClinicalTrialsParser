  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) affects haemoglobin - the molecule in blood cells which carries
      oxygen. It causes red blood cells to become abnormal crescent (or sickle)- shaped. Sickled
      red blood cells cannot travel through small blood vessels as easily as normal red blood
      cells which can lead to blockages. This means that oxygen may be prevented from getting to
      where it is needed. Individuals with sickle cell disease also suffer form abnormality in the
      lining of their blood vessels, which contributes to the damage.

      Damage and blockage can occur in the blood vessels in the brain and means that children with
      sickle cell disease have a significant risk of suffering from strokes. Research  has shown
      that transcranial Doppler ultrasonography can be used in this setting to identify children
      at most risk of getting strokes.

      Ultrasound is therefore used in children with sickle cell disease to measure the blood flow
      in the vessels in the brain. This research has formed the basis of the National Health
      Service (NHS) Standard of Care for Sickle Cell Disease in the United Kingdom (UK) which uses
      transcranial Doppler ultrasonography at once a year to screen children with sickle cell
      disease aged 2 to 16.

      Ultrasound is used because it is portable, does not uses ionising radiation such as x-rays,
      is non-invasive and gives good results. However, the results are dependent on the operator.
      This means that the screening service is provided by centres of excellence with experienced
      scanning staff visiting clinics in smaller hospitals with portable machines. There is a lack
      of research comparing the use of portable machines to laboratory-based machines. This is
      important because screening can identify children at high risk of stroke and may be used by
      clinical staff to make a decision about the care of the child.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical Diagnosis of Sickle Cell Disease

          -  Under surveillance as part of the NHS Sickle Cell &amp; Thalassaemia Screening Programme

          -  Children between the ages of 2 - 16 years old. Those under 16 years of age must be
             accompanied by a responsible adult.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants older than 16 years of age as this is outside the scope of the sickle
             cell screening programme.

          -  Individuals unable to give fully informed and voluntary consent.

          -  Individuals with inadequate temporal windows as it will not be possible to record
             measurements of velocity.
