  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At least 1 in 4 of the 700,000 U.S. Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War suffer
      from Gulf War Illness (GWI). Despite considerable research, effective treatments remain
      elusive. GWI refers to a complex of symptoms that typically include widespread chronic pain,
      persistent headache, memory and concentration problems, gastrointestinal difficulties, sleep
      disturbances and unexplained fatigue. These symptoms are similar to that of fibromyalgia
      syndrome (FMS), another multi-symptom condition. Whereas, effective treatments for GWI have
      yet to be found, the FDA has approved Duloxetine and Pregabalin for the treatment of FMS.
      The lack of progress in finding effective treatments for GWI, and the similarities between
      GWI and FMS, provides a rationale for determining if these medications can provide relief to
      Veterans who suffer from GWI.  This randomized controlled trial will test the efficacy of
      Duloxetine and Pregabalin for treating Gulf War Veterans who suffer from GWI.

      At least 1 in 4 of the 700,000 U.S. Veterans who served in the 1990-1991 Gulf War suffer
      from Gulf War Illness (GWI). Despite considerable research, effective treatments remain
      elusive. GWI refers to a complex of symptoms that typically include widespread chronic pain,
      persistent headache, memory and concentration problems, gastrointestinal difficulties, sleep
      disturbances and unexplained fatigue. This symptom profile is similar to that of
      fibromyalgia syndrome (FMS), a multi-symptom condition similar to GWI. Whereas, effective
      treatments for GWI have yet to be found, progress has been made in identifying medications
      to treat FMS. For example, the FDA has approved a number of medications including Duloxetine
      and Pregabalin for the treatment of FMS. Compared to placebo (PBO) Duloxetine (a serotonin
      norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor) and Pregabalin (an alpha-2-alpha-subunit calcium-channel
      ligand) significantly improved pain responses and fatigue. The capacity of Duloxetine to
      increase central levels of serotonin and norepinephrine as well as the more complex
      alterations of neurotransmitters and CNS mediators of pain attributed to pregabalin are
      thought to be responsible for the medication's effects on pain, mood and sleep. Clinical
      practice and one open-label trial support the use of these medications in combination to
      achieve optimal symptom improvement amongst GWI sufferers; however, such combinations have
      not been formally tested in randomized controlled trials. The lack of progress in finding
      effective treatments for GWI, and the similarities between GWI and FMS, provides a rationale
      for determining if these FDA approved medications can provide significant symptomatic relief
      to Veterans who suffer from GWI. Central Texas is home to one of the highest number of Gulf
      War Veterans in the nation, thus our research team is ideally situated to conduct the
      proposed study. In a randomized, double-blind, controlled trial, 180 Veterans who meet
      defining criteria for GWI and whose symptom profile includes chronic widespread pain and
      sleep disturbances will be treated with one of the following medications; 1) AM Duloxetine+
      PM placebo (PBO); 2) PM Pregabalin + AM PBO or 3) AM PBO + PM PBO. All active treatments
      will titrate from a lower dose in 2-week increments to the full therapeutic doses
      (FDA-approved for FMS). The outcome of the PBO double-dummy period will be compared
      statistically with 18 weeks of active therapy (weeks 5-22).
