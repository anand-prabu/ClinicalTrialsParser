            "textblock": "Cancer patient's whole body metabolism is characterized by an increased fat oxidation rate\n      and a decrease ability to metabolize glucose for energy demands (insulin resistance). In\n      preliminary studies it was shown, that a fat rich diet allows to spare muscle mass from\n      being reduced due to catabolic mechanisms. The resulting better body composition relates to\n      less fatigue and higher quality of life, the latter was shown in advanced cancer patients\n      for a ketogenic diet.\n\n      The aim of the KOLIBRI-study is to analyze if a very fat rich ketogenic diet (KD) or a\n      moderate fat rich \"low glyc\u00e4mic and insulinemic\" (LOGI) diet compared to a standard low fat\n      diet (SD) are feasible, safe and tolerable and will improve quality of life and physical\n      performance in patients with Breast Cancer during the rehabilitation phase.\n\n      The most stringent nutritional regime high in fat and low in carbohydrates is the ketogenic\n      diet (KD) comprised of at least 75% of daily calories via fat (derived from several plant\n      oils, nuts, avocado, butter, cream, cheese, eggs, fatty fish and fat rich meat), balanced in\n      protein (1.4 g/kg body weight/day) and very low in carbohydrates (approx. 20-30 grams per\n      day, derived from salad, vegetable, some berries or fruits, and milk products like yoghurt).\n\n      A less strict but even lower in carbohydrates and richer in fat and protein than a standard\n      diet is the LOGI regimen. It allows up to 120 grams of carbohydrates (inclusion of more\n      vegetable and fruit and rare grains and potatoes compared to KD), is high in protein (1.7\n      g/kg body weight/day) and rich in fat (remaining calories) The control nutritional regime\n      follows the standard recommendations of the German society for nutrition (DGE) and is\n      comprised of at least 50% of the daily energy derived from carbohydrates, 0.8 grams/kg of\n      body weight protein and 30% of daily energy expenditure from fat.\n\n      It will be an open-label trial of nutritional intervention for 20 weeks spanning three\n      phases:\n\n      The first phase spans 3 weeks of stationary intervention in a hospital (location: Bad\n      Kissingen, Bavaria, Germany) with the initial examination (medical, body composition, food\n      preferences, quality of life, blood samples, physical performance) followed by\n      implementation of the allocated diet and respective training of the patients in diet\n      calculation, cooking and realization of the diet regimen in routine daily life.\n\n      The second phase encompasses16 weeks of an outhouse phase with continuing the selected\n      nutritional regime under close contact and supervision of the study team accompanied by\n      urine measurements (KD group), food diaries, questionnaires covering the quality of life and\n      one blood sample) The third phase of the study represents one week of stationary\n      intervention at the hospital with the final examination and further teaching in eiterh\n      sticking to the selected diet or in changing the diet to the individually preferred one."
