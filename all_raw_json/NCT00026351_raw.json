            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate cancer cells\n      and either kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them without harming normal\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining pentostatin and rituximab in\n      treating patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or chronic lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients then receive\n      rituximab IV and pentostatin IV on days 8, 15, and 22. An additional course with both drugs\n      is administered on days 36, 43, and 50. Patients with progressive disease or a complete\n      response receive no further treatment. Patients with responsive disease, but less than a\n      complete response, receive one additional course of therapy as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and 50 chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n      patients will be accrued for this study."
