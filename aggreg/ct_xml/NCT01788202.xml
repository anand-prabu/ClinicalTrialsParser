    <textblock>
      When it is safe to administer general anesthesia to the patient with cocaine positive urine
      drug screen has never been clearly determined. The study doctors would like to determine the
      effect of cocaine on  blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm during surgery.  After surgery,
      the subjects will be observed in regards to  mental status and any changes in heart rate and
      rhythm.

    <textblock>
      The risks associated with administering general anesthesia to cocaine abusing patients with
      a positive urine cocaine metabolite is a major cause of cancellation of surgery in many
      trauma centers.  Although many clinicians wait 24 to 48 hours after a positive urine drug
      screen before administering anesthesia, no standard or practical guidelines have yet to
      determine when it is safe to proceed with general anesthesia in this patient population.
      Due to the lack of guidelines for these cases, the rate of cancellation of procedures for
      these patients is high.  The frequent cancelling of such cases causes a waste of resources,
      personnel, and time.  The risks associated with cocaine use that cause most clinicians to
      cancel cases are mainly due to the cardiovascular effects of cocaine.  Increases in blood
      pressure, heart rate, temperature, and the potential for myocardial infarction and fatal
      arrhythmias are what clinicians fear when administering general anesthesia to these
      patients.  However, due to the urgency of some of the cases, it would be beneficial to both
      the patient and institutions to know when it is safe to proceed with the case and when it is
      not. When it is safe to administer general anesthesia to the patient with cocaine positive
      urine drug screen has never been clearly determined.   This observational study will
      evaluate the effects of general anesthesia on the cocaine abusing patient with cocaine
      positive urine drug screen.
