Capecitabine will be given at 1000\n      mg/m2 PO BID on Days 1-14 of each 21-day cycle. Trastuzumab will be given as a loading dose\n      of 8 mg/kg IV followed by 6 mg/kg once every 21 days. However, a loading dose of trastuzumab\n      will not be given to patients who have received trastuzumab within 4 weeks of the first\n      study dose of trastuzumab. These patients will receive trastuzumab at 6 mg/kg each cycle,\n      including Cycle 1. Trastuzumab may also be given on a weekly basis at 2 mg/kg IV q 7 days,\n      but only in the circumstance that trastuzumab infusion has been delayed, and weekly\n      infusions are required to resynchronize the cycle length to 21 days, after discussion with\n      the medical monitor. Trastuzumab infusion rates will be per institutional guidelines.\n      ONT-380 will be given PO BID at a dose dependent upon the dosing cohorts to which the\n      patient is enrolled.\n\n      There will be 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled in each cohort in the dose escalation phase,\n      unless that dose is found to be intolerable prior to completion of enrollment.  At least 6\n      evaluable patients are to be treated at a dose level in order for an MTD/RP2D to be\n      determined.\n\n      The MTD/RP2D of ONT-380 to be used in combination with either capecitabine alone\n      (Combination 1) or trastuzumab alone (Combination 2) will be determined prior to evaluating\n      ONT-380 in combination with both capecitabine and trastuzumab (Combination 3). If\n      Combination 1 and Combination 2 are found to be tolerable, then ONT-380 will be evaluated in\n      Combination 3, using the lowest MTD/RP2D of ONT-380 determined for either of the two drug\n      combinations. This will be followed by enrollment of an expansion cohort of patients treated\n      at the MTD/RP2D for Combination 3. Additional expansion cohorts for either Combination 1\n      (ONT-380 and capecitabine) or Combination 2 (ONT-380 and trastuzumab) may also be enrolled.\n\n      Provided that only seven dose cohorts are needed for dose escalation and only the MTD/RP2D\n      expansion cohort for Combination 3 is enrolled, up to 51 evaluable patients will be\n      enrolled. Additional patients may be enrolled if additional expansion cohorts are opened."
