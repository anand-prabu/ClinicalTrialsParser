The study will provide novel information\n      in two areas. The main objective is to study the effect of physical activity on the weight\n      loss and cardiovascular risk factors. This will be accomplished in a randomized clinical\n      trial in patients, who are eligible for gastric bypass (GB). Patients will be randomized to\n      six month of structured physical activity or standard postoperative counseling. The study\n      will include an exhaustive panel of blood tests related to cardiovascular risk and the most\n      extensive evaluation of structural and functional vascular test done in this patient group\n      so far. In addition the study will provide information of the effect of bariatric surgery\n      per se since both pre- and postoperative investigations are conducted. The study will learn\n      us to what degree it is possible to motivate this group of patients to increased physical\n      activity. All together this will enable us to improve the counseling of the patients\n      undergoing GB."
