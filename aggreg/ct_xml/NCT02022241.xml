  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist is sufficient for triggering final oocyte
      maturation in GnRH antagonist protocol and can significantly reduce incidence of ovarian
      hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in high-risk patients.

      However, lower oocyte yield was reported in patients with lower luteinizing hormone (LH)
      level post trigger with single injection of GnRH agonist, which might be related to the
      shorter duration and lower amount of LH induced by GnRH agonist.

      Our aim is to study repeated injection of GnRH agonist for preventing OHSS and maintaining
      clinical outcome in high risk patients who receive controlled ovarian stimulation in GnRH
      antagonist protocol.

      This was a prospective cohort study of all women attending the Center for Reproductive
      Medicine, Department of Gynecology and Obstetrics, Nanfang Hospital, affiliated with
      Southern Medical University for in vitro fertilization and/or intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection . Women at high risk of OHSS who received IVF and/or intracytoplasmic sperm
      injection (ICSI) treatment with a flexible GnRH antagonist protocol were recruited to
      participate in this study.

      All patients underwent standard ovarian stimulation protocol with gonadotropins, standard
      individualized adjustment of medication dose, and standard egg retrieval procedure. Patients
      were triggered with a single bolus of 0.2 mg triptorelin at night and had second injection
      of 0.2 mg triptorelin 12 hours later when the criteria for administration of the ovulation
      trigger were met.
