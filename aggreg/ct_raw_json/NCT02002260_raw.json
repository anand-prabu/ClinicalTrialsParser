We hypothesize\n      that, compared to COCs, the LNG-IUS will be more effective at improving bleeding-related\n      quality of life and will be associated with fewer treatment failures and greater\n      cost-effectiveness at one year.  To test these hypotheses, we plan to enroll 212 women from\n      several sites who present for gynecologic care and self-report heavy menstrual bleeding into\n      a RCT comparing LNG-IUS to COCs.   The eligible study population includes women with heavy\n      menstrual bleeding secondary to ovulatory disorders (AUB-O) or endometrial hemostatic\n      disorders (AUB-E).  Women meeting study eligibility will be randomized to receive LNG-IUS or\n      COCs.  Main study outcomes will be obtained at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year."
