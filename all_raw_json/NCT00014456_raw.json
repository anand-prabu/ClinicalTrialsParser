Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the\n      number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      filgrastim in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on day 2 and\n      continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 14 days in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Fatigue is assessed at baseline and then at weeks 2, 5, 7, and 9 during therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 15-22\n      months."
