  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco addiction is treatable with behavioral and pharmacological means, but results are
      often less than optimal. Transcranial direct current stimulation is a new non-invasive
      technique that applies weak electrical currents through the skull and has been shown to
      alter the excitability of certain brain areas. It is currently being tried in disorders
      where there is abnormal brain excitability, such as epilepsy and depression. A few studies
      have also been able to diminish drug craving, suggesting that brain excitability might also
      be altered in drug addiction.

      This study aims at non-invasively changing the excitability of certain brain areas-a
      procedure called neuromodulation- in order to help smokers quit smoking more easily.

    <description>Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation (tDCS) is a procedure that uses a small battery-driven unit to deliver weak electrical currents  (1-2 mA) through the intact scalp. The procedure is painless and is thought to modulate the excitability of the underlying cerebral tissue for hours or days after sessions.
In the placebo group the current will be off.</description>
