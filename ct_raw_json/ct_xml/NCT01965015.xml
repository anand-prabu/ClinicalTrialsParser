      The V-Wave atrial-septal shunt implant is intended for the reduction of elevated left atrial
      filling pressures ('Left Atrial Decompression') in  chronic, New York  Heart Association
      (NYHA) class III -IV, Heart Failure (HF) patients. This is a First In Man (FIM)  study,
      aimed to enable a first evaluation of the safety and performance of the V-Wave shunt implant
      when implanted in Chronic Heart Failure patients. Prospective, open label, single-arm study
      with intra-patient comparisons (i.e. subjects' status will be compared to their pre-implant
      (baseline) status.

    <textblock>
      V-Wave Ltd, an Israeli based medical device company, has developed the V-Wave atrial-septal
      shunt, a permanent implant indicated for  Heart Failure (HF) patients with elevated Left
      Atrial filling Pressures (LAP). The V-Wave shunt, developed by V-Wave Ltd, has been designed
      specifically to meet the needs of an interatrial shunt and thus represents a dedicated
      device, to be implanted percutaneously in the interatrial septum creating an interatrial
      communication.

      This study aims to enable a first evaluation of the safety and performance of the V-Wave
      shunt implant when implanted in  Heart Failure patients with elevated LAP. Study endpoints
      were then chosen to portray both safety (device related Major Adverse Cardiac And
      Neurological Events) as well as preliminary performance as assessed by a well characterized
      measure (e.g., LAP which is known to be associated with the general state of the disease and
      most importantly left ventricular ejection fraction and cardiac function in general).
