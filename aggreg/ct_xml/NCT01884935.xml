    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of multiple
      doses of natalizumab in pediatric subjects with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis
      (RRMS). The secondary objectives are as follows: to characterize the PD profile of
      natalizumab (as defined by α4 integrin binding) and to explore the safety and tolerability
      of multiple doses of natalizumab in the pediatric population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, defined by 2 or more
             disabling relapses in 1 year, and with 1 or more gadolinium-enhancing lesions on
             brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load, as compared to a previous
             recent magnetic resonance imaging  (MRI)

          -  Other inclusion criteria may apply

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of, or abnormal laboratory values indicative of, significant medical,
             neurologic (other than MS), or psychiatric disorders that might preclude
             participation in the study in the opinion of the Investigator.

          -  Prior natalizumab therapy.

          -  Other exclusion criteria may apply.
