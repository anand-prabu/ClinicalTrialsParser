Subject is in chronic renal failure.\n\n          -  11. Subject has a hematocrit < 21% pre-operatively.\n\n          -  12. Subject has a serum creatinine \u22652.5 mg/dl at baseline or is currently on\n             dialysis.\n\n          -  13. Subject has a cardiac ejection fraction <25%.\n\n          -  14. Subject is scheduled for another cardiac surgery within 30 days of enrollment.\n\n          -  15. Subject has an active or latent infection which is systemic or at the intended\n             surgery site.\n\n          -  16. Subject is immuno-compromised such as that resulting from chronic oral steroid\n             use, chemotherapeutic agents, or immune deficiency disorders.\n\n          -  17. Subject is pregnant by a positive pregnancy test or has plans to become pregnant\n             during the study period or is currently breast-feeding.\n\n          -  18.

In the opinion of the investigator, the subject has a clinical condition that\n             would preclude the use of the study device, preclude the subject from completing the\n             follow-up requirements, or would complicate the evaluation of this study."
