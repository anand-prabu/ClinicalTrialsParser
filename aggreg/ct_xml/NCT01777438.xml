    <textblock>
      Allergic rhinitis (AR) is defined as inflammation of the nasal mucosa after exposition to an
      allergen in sensitized patients. AR causes not only nasal symptoms such as sneezing, itchy
      nose, rhinorrhea and nasal obstruction, but also has a significant impact on quality of
      life. Symptom control and overall satisfaction in patients undergoing subcutaneous
      immunotherapy (SCIT) or sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) on the long term has not yet been
      investigated so far.

            <description>Visual analogue scale (VAS) scores for TNS experienced during the last 4 weeks. Visual analog scales (VAS) have been used to rate the presence of symptoms or impairment of the daily activities. Patients had to answer each question by indicating a position with a vertical line between two endpoints, 0 cm for not bothersome versus 10 cm for extremely bothersome. In this way each question is scored between 0 and 10 points.</description>
