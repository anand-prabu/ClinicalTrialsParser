  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the consequences of exacerbations will be visualized by high resolution
      computed tomography (HRCT) scan at functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung
      capacity (TLC) as taken during an episode of exacerbation and after recovering. Changes in
      HRCT based airway dimensions and computational fluid dynamic (CFD) -based resistance values
      will be correlated with changes in patient reported outcomes (PROs) and lung function tests
      recorded at the same time.

    <description>As tertiary objective the reproducibility of the segmentations done by the centers will be evaluated. To accomplish reproducible segmentations the multiple centers will be guided to perform accurate segmentations, and bottlenecks in the usage of the program will be identified and resolved in order to simplify it where necessary and possible.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At entry in the study experiencing an exacerbation defined as an acute change in the
             patient 's baseline dyspnea, cough, and/or sputum that is beyond normal day to day
             variations, and that necessitates the administration or doubling of systemic
             corticosteroid treatment.

          -  Patients must be able to understand and complete protocol requirements, instructions,
             questionnaires and protocol-stated restrictions.

          -  Written and signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant or lactating females

          -  Patient diagnosed with asthma

          -  Patient with pneumonia as defined radiologically at the start of the exacerbation

          -  Patient with a history of or presence of lung cancer

          -  Patient with an indication for non-invasive ventilation

          -  Patient unlikely to comply with the protocol or unable to understand the nature,
             scope and possible consequences of the study.

          -  Patient who received any investigational new drug within the last 4 weeks prior to
             visit 1.
