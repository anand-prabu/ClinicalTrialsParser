Intervention and\n      control groups received usual standard medical therapy.\n\n      Baseline data were collected within one week after admission.

Secondary outcomes were serum cortisol, interleukin-2,\n      interleukin-6, IFN-\u03d2 (Interferon gamma), and N Acetyl Aspartat/ creatine ratio in limbic and\n      paralimbic system by Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy."
