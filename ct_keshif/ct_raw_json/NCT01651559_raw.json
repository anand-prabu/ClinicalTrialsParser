A bilateral left\n      right comparison will be made, after using the study product and the placebo, for 8 weeks,\n      twice daily, on each of the body sides (left right). In addition to the clinical\n      evaluations, skin biochemistry will be studied using non-invasive techniques.  The latter\n      will be correlated with the clinical results of the patients.  These will serve for future\n      development of diagnostic assays and personalized therapies."
