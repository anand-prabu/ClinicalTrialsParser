This proposed study is designed to\n      compare closed-loop control with or without optimization of initialization parameters\n      related to basal insulin infusion rates and insulin to carbohydrate (I:C) ratios for meals\n      and snacks.\n\n      The study consists of an evaluation of the Artificial Pancreas device system during two\n      24-27.5-hour closed-loop phases in an outpatient/hotel environment.  Prior to the\n      closed-loop phases, each subject will undergo a 7-day data collection period consisting of\n      his or her usual free-living conditions along with 3 meals of known carbohydrate content.\n      Data from the insulin pump, a continuous glucose monitoring sensor (CGM), diet and exercise\n      records will be collected during this period.  These data from this 7-day period will be\n      analyzed in order to come up with adapted basal insulin infusion rates and bolus insulin to\n      carbohydrate (I:C) ratios."
