            "textblock": "The Communicating Effectively about Donation (CEaD) is a communications training program\n      specifically and uniquely tailored to the problem of making requests for organ donation to\n      families of deceased patients. The CEaD trains Organ Procurement Organization (OPO) staff\n      requesters to make effective requests to donor-eligible families by allowing requesters to\n      learn and practice relational communication skills using a series of simulated scenarios.\n      \"Simulated Patients\" or \"Standardized Patients\" (SPs) acting out the roles of families\n      making donation decisions were created in consultation with our partner OPO for our single\n      site test of the intervention.\n\n      In a previous study, four training scenarios were developed: the first an uncomplicated\n      scenario; the second a single parent, urban, African-American family; the third the divorced\n      parents of a pediatric patient who are at odds; and the fourth a case of donation after\n      cardiac death (DCD).  Each scenario allows the requester to use basic requester skills,\n      including: framing donation positively, use of statistics to explain donation benefits,\n      engaging the family in a discussion of their values, probing and responding to family fears\n      or misinformation about donation, and attending to family's emotional needs. Because they\n      are presented as a series, the scenarios allow requesters to work through increasingly more\n      challenging donation simulations and to encounter family-specific issues such as unresolved\n      family disputes, family dysfunction, cultural differences, and families who are divided\n      about whether or not to donate.\n\n      OPO requesters will be trained in the CEaD method of organ donation communication over a\n      period of 4 months either using the DVD training material only (the autonomous condition) or\n      they will be assisted by having the DVD supplemented through working the scenarios with live\n      SPs who will be trained to act out the scenarios with the OPO requesters and provide\n      feedback in the four OPOs in the assisted CEaD condition."
