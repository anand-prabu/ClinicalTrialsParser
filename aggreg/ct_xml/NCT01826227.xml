    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Positron Emission Tomography (PET) probes make it
      easier for your surgeon to find cancer and remove it during your surgery. A PET probe is a
      wandlike device that can detect radioactivity.

    <description>of detection of lesions with PET probes compared to preoperative FDG18F-FDG PET and standard intraoperative examination. Sensitivity is defined as the percent of lesions that were found with malignant disease divided by the number of lesions with true presence of malignant disease based on the pathology report. A higher sensitivity will indicate a higher number of lesions found with the respective technique thus providing an initial estimate of the incremental benefit of the PET probe as opposed to the other techniques</description>

    <description>This is a pilot study to determine the ability of intraoperative PET probe to detect and localize recurrent disease. Patients with evidence for a first recurrence of ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal carcinoma, with evidence of 18F-FDG avid disease on 18F-FDG PET/CT and who are able to undergo secondary CRS are eligible. 20 patients will be studied. All patients will undergo secondary cytoreduction guided by intraoperative PET probe survey. Intraoperative count levels as well as exvivo counts of the resected specimens will be done. Specimens detected with probe only will be labeled so and will be submitted to pathology for histopathologic confirmation.</description>
