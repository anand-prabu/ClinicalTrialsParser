    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the remission rates in patients treated for generalized
      anxiety disorder in primary and specialized care. Factors that may influence remission such
      as disease history and severity of the anxiety disorder, the type of treatment, the presence
      of co-morbid depression or anxiety disorder as well as socio-demographic factors will also
      be evaluated. The study will also assess patient functioning and compare functioning in
      patients who do and do not achieve remission.

      The aim of the study is to assess the remission rates in patients treated for generalized
      anxiety disorder in primary and specialized care. Factors that may influence remission such
      as disease history and severity of the anxiety disorder, the type of treatment, the presence
      of co-morbid depression or anxiety disorder as well as socio-demographic factors will also
      be evaluated. The study will also assess patient functioning and compare functioning in
      patients who do and do not achieve remission.

      The objectives of the study are:

      Primary: To determine the prevalence of remission in patients treated for generalized
      anxiety disorder in primary care and specialized care. Secondary: To determine patient
      functioning and work loss days and compare these in patients who do or do not achieve
      remission. To determine the effect of disease factors on remission rate such as disease
      history, duration, severity, co-morbidity with depression or other anxiety disorders. To
      determine the effect of treatment factors on remission rate such as setting, type of
      treatment, duration and adherence. To determine the effect of socio-demographic factors on
      remission rate such as gender, age, region (language), marital status, educational level and
      employment status.

      This will be a cross-sectional observational study looking at the point prevalence of
      remission in treated patients with generalized anxiety disorder in general practice and
      specialized care in Belgium. General practitioners and psychiatrists will assess remission
      rates in patients treated for generalized anxiety disorder during 1 routine visit of these
      patients.

      The participating physicians will have 3 months to evaluate remission at a routine visit in
      5 to 10 patients that have been treated for generalized anxiety disorder since at least 3
      months
