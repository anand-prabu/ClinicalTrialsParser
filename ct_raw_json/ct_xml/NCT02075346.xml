    <textblock>
      The Multi-functional Patient Monitoring PCBA is an electronic circuit  board in the
      monitoring system that performs calculations.

      The study will evaluate the performance of the Sensor Off New Patient Monitoring system by
      exposing the sensor to an ambient light source, sensor slipping off the finger with the
      light emitter and detector facing each other or a sensor slipping off under a blanket.

          -  Subject is able to participate for the duration of the study

          -  Subject is willing to sign an informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous injury or trauma to fingers or hands that may change blood flow or
             vascular supply and affect our ability to test sensors.

          -  Physiologic abnormalities that prevent proper application of pulse oximetry sensor.

          -  Severe contact allergies that cause a reaction to standard adhesive materials such as
             those found in medical sensors and electrodes
