Indeed, sarcopenia is a more robust\n      predictor of functional status and mortality in the elderly than chronological age or\n      indeed, any other co-morbidity. Sarcopenia is an incipient process whereby lean muscle mass\n      contributing up to ~50% of total body weight in young adults declines to ~25% when reaching\n      the age of 75-80 y. Adequate nutritional intake, and in particular dietary protein, is\n      important for offsetting age-related declines in muscle mass. The aim of this project is to\n      seek the most effective nutrition with which to counteract sarcopenia, specifically in\n      women."
