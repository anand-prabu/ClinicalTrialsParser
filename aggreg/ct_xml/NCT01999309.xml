  <brief_summary>

      Rationale: There is ample evidence that inflammatory processes play a role in the
      pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)
      have been shown to be able to reduce symptoms in these patients, these drugs either have
      unfavourable cardiovascular side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated. Moreover,
      patients with schizophrenia already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk. The
      combination of well-established vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by
      simvastatin offers a highly attractive potential to further improve the treatment of
      schizophrenia and related disorders.

      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment
      reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia, improves cognition, presence and severity of movement
      disorders, and decreases the risk for metabolic syndrome as compared to placebo.

      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial
      effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given in addition to antipsychotic
      medication. We expect lower symptom severity as measured with the Positive And Negative
      Symptom Scale (PANSS) with an average of at least 7.5 points over the course of one year.
      Secondary objectives are assessment of general functioning using the General Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF), neurocognitive functioning with the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition
      in Schizophrenia), presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and movement disorders and
      immunological parameters.

      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.

      Study population: 250 men and women, between 18 and 50 years of age, diagnosed with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder (DSM-IV 295.*) or psychosis NOS
      (not otherwise specified) (298.9). Onset of first psychosis no longer than 3 years ago.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily,
      in the form of identical tablets.

      Rationale: Different lines of evidence now suggest that low grade inflammation in the
      central nervous system is involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. These include the
      altered risk of schizophrenia patients and their relatives for specific auto-immune
      diseases, clinical similarities between the course of schizophrenia and auto-immune disease
      and decreased prevalence of schizophrenia in men who have used Non-Steroidal
      Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) or glucocorticosteroids for somatic disorders. Furthermore,
      an infectious cause or trigger is suggested by the observed association between
      schizophrenia and pre- and perinatal infections, as well as by seroconversion to certain
      pathogens in patients with schizophrenia. On a cellular level, inflammation of the central
      nervous system is suggested by an increased number of activated microglia cells in the
      brains of patients with schizophrenia as visualized by positron electron tomography. In an
      activated state, microglia cells can produce free radicals, pro-inflammatory components and
      other neurotoxic substances, causing cell death in their proximity. The activation of
      microglia cells provides a possible route by which an increased pro-inflammatory state in
      the brain could cause increased gray matter loss and more severe negative and cognitive
      symptoms. Although Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) have been shown to be able
      to reduce symptoms in these patients, these drugs either have unfavourable cardiovascular
      side effects or are otherwise not well tolerated. Moreover, patients with schizophrenia
      already tend to have an increased cardiovascular risk. The combination of well-established
      vascular protection and reduction of inflammation by simvastatin offers a highly attractive
      potential to further improve the treatment of schizophrenia and related disorders.

      Hypotheses: Daily treatment with 40mg simvastatin in addition to antipsychotic treatment
      reduces the symptoms of schizophrenia, improves cognition and decreases the risk for
      metabolic syndrome, as compared to placebo.

      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate the proposed beneficial
      effect of simvastatin as compared to placebo when given in addition to antipsychotic
      medication. We expect lower symptom severity as measured with the Positive And Negative
      Symptom Scale (PANSS) with an average of at least 7.5 points over the course of one year.
      Secondary objectives are assessment of general functioning using the General Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF), neurocognitive functioning with the BACS (Brief Assessment of Cognition
      in Schizophrenia), presence and severity of movement disorders, lower severity of metabolic
      syndrome as defined by the AHA/NHLB (American Heart Association/National Heart, Lung and
      Blood Institute) and a shift in immunological parameters into the direction of
      anti-inflammation.

      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial.

      Study population: 250 men and women, between 18 and 50 years of age, diagnosed with
      schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder (DSM-IV 295.*) or psychosis NOS
      (not otherwise specified) (298.9). Duration of disease should be no more than three years.

      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either 40 mg simvastatin or placebo daily,
      in the form of identical tablets.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is change in total PANSS score from
      baseline to end of treatment. Secondary outcomes will be the changes in GAF scores,
      cognitive functioning, presence and severity of metabolic syndrome and movement disorders,
      in addition to the measurement of various immunological biomarkers and depression symptoms.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness: Use of simvastatin implies that there is a risk of side effects, as all
      lipid-lowering drugs carry the risk of negative effects. The number of patient visits will
      be limited  and mainly requires time investment for a few physical examinations,
      questionnaires and two cognitive testing sessions (around 10 hours per year in total).

      Blood will be drawn at four occasions with negligible and known risks (e.g. irritation). The
      burden and risks are acceptable while the benefits are expected to be considerable.
