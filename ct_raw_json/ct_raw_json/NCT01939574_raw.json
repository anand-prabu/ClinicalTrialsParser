            "textblock": "This is a single-center, open-label, single arm study to explore whether potential image\n      biomarkers correlate with efficacy of bevacizumab combined with conventional  therapy in\n      newly diagnosed glioblastoma.\n\n      Despite the increase in therapies available, the median survival of patients with\n      glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains less than 15 months.\n\n      The phase III pivotal study in newly diagnosed GBM also met its co-primary endpoint of\n      progression-free survival (PFS) which further confirm the efficacy of bevacizumab in GBM.\n\n      Early predicting the efficacy of bevacizumab combined with conventional therapy in newly\n      diagnosed glioblastoma could help us to identify the suitable patients to receive suitable\n      treatment in GBM. Thus, characterizing the blood flow and blood volume in the tumor and\n      their changes during therapy might provide information on vasculature growth or\n      collapse,edema formation, tumor growth, and/or cell death(necrosis) .We decided to\n      investigate whether the estimation of  blood circulation in tumor, using MRI,PET could be\n      used as a surrogate marker to predict the early response of GBM to bevacizumab.\n\n      Several previous studies have demonstrated that the relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)\n      correlated with the histologic grade of gliomas and investigated the prognostic value of the\n      tumor CBV for survival.In current study, We hypothesized that, the temporal changes during\n      anti-angiogenesis therapy in specific regions of high and low perfusion in glioblastoma\n      might predict the efficacy of bevacizumab.Since there is no mature PET tracer directly image\n      Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in China,we use\n      18F-Galacto-arginine-glycine-aspartic acid (RGD)\u2014\u2014 a new tracer for PET imaging of \u03b1v\u03b23 by\n      testing Standardized uptake value mean (SUVmean),Standardized uptake value max (SUVmax) and\n      tumor to non-tumor tissue ratios (T/NT) to indirectly reflect the VEGF expression. The\n      integrin \u03b1v\u03b23 is an important receptor affecting tumor growth, local invasiveness, and\n      metastatic potential. Specifically, \u03b1v\u03b23 is highly expressed on activated endothelial cells\n      during angiogenesis.\n\n      Therefore, in the pilot study, we use dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging\n      (DCE-MRI),dynamic susceptibility-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (DSC-MRI) and\n      18F-Galacto-RGD PET to explore the potential image biomarkers of bevacizumab  used in newly\n      diagnosed glioblastoma."
