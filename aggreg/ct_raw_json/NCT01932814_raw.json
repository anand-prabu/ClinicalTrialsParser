One cornerstone of the management of these\n      patients remains the early and appropriate antibiotic administration, , which must be also\n      active at the site of infection.  Aminoglycosides are often administered in combination with\n      beta lactams in this context . According to the progress in pharmacokinetic management\n      achieved over the past decade,  their safety and efficiency tended to increase but many\n      uncertainties remain. The purpose of the present study is to determine whether\n      administration of aminoglycosides in septic critically ill patient is a risk factor for\n      acute kidney injury.\n\n      Study design: This is an open retrospective monocentric cohort study including septic\n      critically ill patients from november 2008 to january 2010. To determine the incidence and\n      the specific risk of nephrotoxicity of aminoglycosides, only  hospitalized patients without\n      initial acute kidney injury or with rapidly improving kidney function during the three first\n      days will be included.Primary outcome will be the occurrence of acute kidney injury assessed\n      with the RIFLE  classification (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss, and End-stage kidney disease)\n      from day 4 to day 15. Patients receiving aminoglycosides will be compared with a control\n      group, i.e. not receiving them. We estimated hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals\n      (CI) with adjusted and propensity score (PS)-matched Cox-proportional hazards models."
