            "textblock": "The measure of the pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) is a very useful index in intensive care\n      to estimate right ventricular after load. The reference technique for this measure is the\n      right catheterism which is an invasive technique. It is possible to estimate the pulmonary\n      artery pressure by using transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which allows, using the\n      continuous Doppler, the measure of maximum speed of tricuspid regurgitation (TRvmax). The\n      measure of the TRvmax can however be difficult for intensive care patients with little\n      echogenicity or impossible for those having no tricuspid leak. The evaluation of the\n      tricuspid regurgitation is also particularly difficult using TOE. To avoid these drawbacks,\n      one can use the analysis of the pulmonary ejection in the pulmonary artery (PAAT) with TOE.\n      However, the data of the literature are controversial on this method and it was not\n      validated in mechanically ventilated intensive care patients.\n\n      The aim of this work is to compare three methods of measure of the PAP: the measure TRVMAX\n      (by means of the tricuspid leak) by transthoracic echocardiography, the measure of the TAAP\n      by transesophageal ultrasound and the direct measure of the pulmonary pressures by right\n      catheterization, in ventilated patients already monitored with a catheter in the right\n      cavities for usual indications in intensive care (ARDS, shock). We shall analyze then the\n      correlation between the TRVmax, the TAAP and the pressures measured by the right catheterism\n      which serves as reference technique."
