  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of brief
      cognitive-behavioral therapy (B-CBT) for the treatment of suicidality, including suicidal
      ideation and attempts (regardless of Axis I or II diagnosis) among active duty military
      personnel. The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing improvement
      following B-CBT (treatment duration of 12 weeks) to treatment as usual (TAU).  The primary
      outcome comparisons will include both direct markers of suicidality (i.e. suicide, suicide
      attempts) and indirect markers including associated symptomatology (i.e. suicidal ideation,
      intent, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, and sleep disturbance), along
      with remission of psychiatric diagnoses. Secondary purposes include the prospective
      investigation of suicide risk factors and warning signs to explore these variables' ability
      to predict subsequent suicidal behavior following an index attempt.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research gap in the treatment of suicidality is considerable, particularly with military
      populations, including those returning from deployment in support of OIF/OEF. Only one
      randomized clinical trial targeting suicidality has been conducted with a military sample
      (Rudd et al., 1996).  Although time-limited treatment of suicidality is the primary target
      of the project, additional elements will be explored including prospective investigation of
      suicide risk factors and warning signs, as well as development of a centralized software
      assessment/management tracking system for high-risk suicidal individuals.  Reference to
      &quot;active duty&quot; refers to U.S. military service members that have been activated and deployed
      as a part of OIF/OEF in accordance with federal orders under Title 10 or 32, Unites States
      Code.  This includes individuals on active duty from the National Guard and Reserve forces.

      Specific Aim 1:  To evaluate the effectiveness of brief cognitive-behavioral therapy (B-CBT)
      for the treatment of suicidality, including suicidal ideation and attempts (regardless of
      Axis I or II diagnosis) among active duty military personnel. It is anticipated that a large
      percentage of those identified for treatment will include military personnel recently
      returned from OIF/OEF.  The standard null hypothesis will involve tests conducted comparing
      improvement following B-CBT (treatment duration of 12 weeks) to treatment as usual (TAU).
      The primary outcome comparisons will include both direct markers of suicidality (i.e.
      suicide, suicide attempts) and indirect markers including associated symptomatology (i.e.
      suicidal ideation, intent, anxiety, depression, hopelessness, substance abuse, agitation,
      and sleep disturbance), along with remission of psychiatric diagnoses.

      Specific Aim 2:  To engage in prospective investigation of suicide risk factors (i.e.
      psychiatric diagnosis and history, suicidal ideation, intent, anxiety, depression,
      hopelessness) and warning signs (i.e. agitation, sleep disturbance), exploring their ability
      to predict subsequent suicidal behavior following onset of suicidality.

      Specific Aim 3: To explore the effectiveness of B-CBT (versus TAU) for increasing
      appropriate utilization of and compliance with medical, mental health, and substance abuse
      treatment, as well as improving psychological and social functioning.

      Specific Aim 4: To develop a risk management software program for the initial risk
      assessment, ongoing monitoring and clinical management of high-risk suicidal patients.  The
      software program would provide a mechanism for organizing and tracking clinical risk factors
      and warning signs for suicide, along with appropriate management and clinical intervention
      strategies during the treatment process.

    <measure>Suicide Attempt Self-Injury Interview (SASII)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SASII is a clinician-administered interview designed to assess the factors involved in nonfatal suicide attempts and intentional self-injury. The SASII assesses variables related to method, reliability, lethality, impulsivity, likelihood of rescue, suicidal intent, consequences, and habitual self-injury. Interrater reliabilities for each item range from .87-.98, with the correlation for rater classification of behavior (i.e., suicide attempt or non-suicidal self-injury) being .92. The SASII demonstrates very high agreement in identifying and classifying suicide-related events when compared to clinician therapy notes, patient diary cards, and medical records (for events requiring medical attention).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SSI is a 21-item, interviewer-administered scale used to evaluate the current intensity of the patient's specific attitudes, behaviors, and plans to commit suicide. The SSI has moderately high internal consistency and good concurrent and discriminant validity for psychiatric outpatients. Inter-rater reliability has been found to be higher than .98, with good evidence of predictive validity.</description>

    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SIS is a 15-item, interviewer-administered assessment of the intensity of an individual's intent to die at the time of a suicide attempt. It assesses verbal and nonverbal indicators of suicidal attempt including objective circumstances surrounding the attempt, and the attempters' perceptions of the attempt.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Interpersonal Needs Questionnaire (INQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The INQ is a 10-item self-report questionnaire that measures current beliefs about the extent to which the respondent feels connected to others (i.e., thwarted belongingness), and the extent to which he or she feels like a burden on the people in their lives (i.e., perceived burdensomeness).</description>

    <description>In addition to TAU, participants in BCBT receive 12 outpatient individual psychotherapy sessions scheduled on a weekly or biweekly basis, with the first session lasting 90 minutes and subsequent sessions lasting 60 minutes. BCBT was is delivered in three sequential phases. In phase I (5 sessions), the therapist identifies patient-specific factors that contribute to and maintain suicidal behaviors, provides a cognitive-behavioral conceptualization, collaboratively develops a crisis response plan, and teaches basic emotion regulation skills. In phase II (5 sessions), the therapist applies cognitive strategies to reduce beliefs and assumptions that serve as vulnerabilities to suicidal behavior. In phase III (2 sessions), a relapse prevention task is conducted.</description>
