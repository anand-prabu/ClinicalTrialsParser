Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white\n      blood cells to kill melanoma cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or without\n      interleukin-2 in treating patients who have recurrent metastatic melanoma that has not\n      responded to previous therapy."

Evaluate the toxicity, immunologic reactivity, and possible therapeutic\n      efficacy of immunization with recombinant fowlpox virus encoding the gp100 melanoma antigen\n      administered alone or with interleukin-2 in patients with metastatic melanoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive recombinant fowlpox virus\n      encoding the gp100 melanoma antigen (FPV-gp100) IV or intramuscularly to rotating sites or\n      fowlpox virus encoding modified gp100 melanoma antigen IV every 2 weeks for 4 vaccinations.\n      Treatment continues for a maximum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression.\n      Cohorts of 3-9 patients receive escalating doses of FPV-gp100 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients develop dose-limiting toxicity. Patients in 3 of 5 cohorts also receive\n      interleukin-2 (IL-2) within 12 hours of FPV-gp100. One cohort receives IL-2 subcutaneously\n      daily on days 1-5 and days 8-12. A second cohort receives low-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes\n      every 8 hours on days 2-8. A third cohort receives high-dose IL-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8\n      hours on days 2-6. Patients in cohorts 4 and 5 receive FPV-gp100 alone and, if no response\n      is observed after 2 courses, may receive 2 courses of IL-2 alone every 8 hours for 5 days,\n      approximately 2 weeks apart. A separate cohort of 3-9 patients receives modified FPV-gp100.\n      If no response is observed after 2 courses, IL-2 may be administered as in cohorts 4 and 5.\n      Patients are followed at 28 days after the second immunization with FPV-gp100.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 91 patients will be accrued for this study."
