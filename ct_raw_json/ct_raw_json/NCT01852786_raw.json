It is\n      possible to find a number of publications about their non-contraceptive benefits, also about\n      their adverse events. Most researches are conducted during clinical trials, which are\n      commissioned by pharmaceutical companies, in order to compare COCs of different composition.\n      This study set out to assess the role of psychosexual, metabolic, endocrine, hormonal and\n      genetic measures of  low dose combined oral contraceptive users- 20 micrograms of\n      Ethinylestradiol/3 mg of  Drospirenone and 20 micrograms of  Ethinylestradiol/75 micrograms\n      of  Gestoden. Because this study is not commercial, it is expected to obtain valuable\n      objective data - there are very few comparative studies about the impact of COCs to woman's\n      organism."
