TIPS proved more effective than\n      alternative treatments in controlling or preventing variceal bleeding and refractory\n      ascites. The main drawback of the TIPS procedure is progressive overt hepatic encephalopathy\n      (OHE). Three risk factors for post-TIPS OHE have been identified: age over 65 years, history\n      of previous episodes of OHE, and Child-Pugh score equal to or over 10. However, the\n      incidence of post-TIPS OHE in patients fulfilling these criteria remains close to 35 %."

Therefore, there is a real challenge in discovering new molecular\n      mechanisms involved in pathogenesis of OHE as well as new treatment to better prevent the\n      risk of OHE in patients treated by TIPS. Observational and experimental studies suggest a\n      microbiota's role in the mechanism of OHE and recently a non absorbable antibiotic has\n      proven to reduce the risk of recurrence of OHE. However, the effect of this drug for the\n      prevention of a first episode of OHE in patients treated by TIPS is not known. In addition,\n      the mechanisms of the beneficial effect of rifaximin remain poorly understood."
