      The purpose of this study is to find the safe dose of nab-paclitaxel in children with solid
      tumors, and to see if it works to treat these solid tumors in children and young adults (≤
      21 years old). After the final dose has been chosen, patients will be enrolled according to
      the specific solid tumor type, (neuroblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, or Other solid tumors), to
      see how nab-paclitaxel works in treating these tumors.

      ABI-007-PST-001 is a Phase 1 / 2, multicenter, open-label, dose-finding study to assess the
      safety , tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of weekly nab-paclitaxel in pediatric
      patients with recurrent or refractory solid tumors (excluding brain tumors). The Phase 1
      portion of the study will be dose escalation design to determine the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD) and the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). The Phase 2 portion of the study will enroll
      additional patients at the RP2D into one of three solid tumor groups [Neuroblastomas,
      Rhabdomyosarcomas, Other]. Both phases of the study will be open-label and conducted at
      multiple centers.

             13. The patient has any significant medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or
             psychiatric illness that would prevent the patient from participating in the study.

             14. The patient has any condition, including the presence of laboratory
             abnormalities, that places the patient at unacceptable risk if he/she were to

             the study.

             16. The patient or parent(s)/guardian(s) is/are unable to comply with the study visit
             schedule and other protocol requirements, in the opinion of the investigator.
