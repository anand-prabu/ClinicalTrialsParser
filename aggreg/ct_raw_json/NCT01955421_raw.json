The primary endpoint is disease\n      control rate (DCR) and the key secondary endpoint is progression free survival (PFS). A\n      total of 224 eligible patients will be randomized to receive either erlotinib 100mg daily or\n      gefitinib 250mg daily in a 1:1 ratio until patients experience disease progression.\n      Independent assessment of the major endpoints will be completed in a treatment-blinded\n      manner. Randomization will be stratified based on treatment-lines (first-line vs.\n      maintenance vs. second-line therapy). Tumor response and progression will be assessed\n      according to RECIST 1.1."
