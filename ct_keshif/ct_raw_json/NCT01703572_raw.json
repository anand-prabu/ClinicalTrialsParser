Must have received their last chemotherapy, biologic, radiotherapy, or\n             investigational therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment; 12 weeks from their\n             last radioimmunotherapy; 3 months if the last therapy was bone marrow/ peripheral\n             stem cell transplant.\n\n          6.

Women of childbearing potential must have had a prior hysterectomy or have a negative\n             serum pregnancy test and be using adequate contraception prior to study entry and\n             must agree to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6 months\n             after discontinuation of study drug.  Men must also agree to use adequate\n             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to\n             study entry and from study entry through at least 6 months after discontinuation of\n             study drug.
