This\n      study will therefore evaluate the efficacy of eccentric training on physical capacity and\n      overall autonomy, and will analyse the adaptive mechanisms with regard to both adaptation to\n      cardiac and muscular effort and tolerance.\n\n      The research will take place in 3 phases:\n\n      PHASE 1 (DURATION 6 MONTHS):\n\n      30 healthy volunteers will be included to test tolerance to personalized exercise on an\n      eccentric cycle ergometer.\n\n      PHASE 2 (DURATION 6 MONTHS):\n\n      30 patients suffering from cardio-respiratory disorders and chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease will be included to test the same protocol.\n\n      PHASE 3 (DURATION 24 MONTHS):\n\n      160 patients split into 2 parallel groups will be included: a group with conventional\n      rehabilitation (group 2) and the other group with rehabilitation using an eccentric cycle\n      ergometer (group 1)."
