            "textblock": "Retinoids have shown activity in T-cell malignancies in past studies (both isotretinoin and\n      etretinate) with an overall response rate of about 60%.  One third of those responses were\n      complete responses.  Interferon-alpha has proven efficacy in wide ranges of human\n      malignancies including T-cell lymphomas as a single agent.  A clinical trial was needed to\n      evaluate the response rate of these two agents combined.\n\n      Interferon is a normal body protein, which is made by cells after exposure to viruses.  It\n      acts as a messenger to warn surrounding cells of invasions by viruses and, possibly, by\n      cancer cells.  Isotretinoin is a synthetic form of Vitamin A which effects the growth of\n      normal cells and cancer cells.\n\n      Participants participating in this study will receive a combination of alpha-interferon and\n      isotretinoin.  Alpha-interferon will be given once a day for an initial period of 12 weeks.\n      Participants will take the drug home, where a nurse or family member of the participant (who\n      can be trained at UTMDACC) will inject it just under the skin (SQ).  Isotretinoin will be\n      given by mouth twice a day.\n\n      If a participant's disease does not show a response, the alpha-interferon and the\n      isotretinoin will be increased.  If side effects occur, the dose of alpha-interferon and/or\n      isotretinoin will be decreased by 50%.  If the side effects are severe, therapy will be\n      discontinued.  If the participant's disease is unresponsive or worsens, the participant will\n      be taken off study and other treatments will be recommended.\n\n      Responding participants will be placed on a maintenance schedule for as long as they\n      respond.  Up to 60 participants will be studied at UT M.D. Anderson Cancer Center to test\n      the effectiveness of this drug combination.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Alpha-interferon and isotretinoin are FDA approved and\n      commercially available."
