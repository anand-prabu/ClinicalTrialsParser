Changes in total and visceral body fat are measured by\n      dual x-ray absorptiometry and computerized tomography, resting energy expenditure and fat\n      oxidation rate by indirect calorimetry, and lipoprotein lipids by enzymatic assay. Glucose\n      tolerance is assessed during a three-hour oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of\n      glucose- and insulin levels every 30 minutes. LPL activity is measured in 3050mg pieces of\n      subcutaneous abdominal and gluteal adipose tissue."
