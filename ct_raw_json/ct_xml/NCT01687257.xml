      This is a multicenter, Open-Label, Randomized Study to Investigate the Safety and Efficacy
      of GS-7977 and Ribavirin Administered for 48 weeks in Patients Infected with Chronic HCV
      with Cirrhosis and Portal Hypertension with or without Liver Decompensation. Approximately
      50 subjects (25 per group) will be randomized (1:1) to either receive study drug for 48
      weeks or take part in an untreated observational arm for the first 24 weeks followed by
      study drug for another 48 weeks.
