  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Research is needed to determine safe and effective exercise rehabilitation programs to
      prevent and improve physical disability in older adults living with HIV. This problem is of
      great importance to the VA. The majority of the 25 thousand HIV-infected veterans are over
      50 years of age (64%).  The combined effect of aging and inflammation increase the risk for
      physical disability in older HIV-infected veterans. This translational exercise training
      trial will examine the cardiac and skeletal muscle effects of combined aerobic exercise and
      resistance training to attenuate the functional declines of aging with HIV by reducing the
      deleterious consequences of chronic inflammation. Findings will guide future rehabilitation
      research on cardiac remodeling and inflammation of skeletal muscle. The proposed research
      will advance the goal to develop effective rehabilitation strategies that improve the health
      of older HIV-infected veterans.

      The objective of this study is to determine the effect of exercise training on the central
      (cardiovascular) and peripheral (muscular) impairments underlying poor physical function by
      comparing older HIV-infected veterans randomized to combine aerobic and resistance exercise
      training versus usual care. The study hypothesis is that a progressive aerobic and
      resistance rehabilitation program will increase aerobic capacity and muscle strength, which
      will be mediated by improved diastolic function, increased muscle mass, and decreased
      systemic inflammation. To test this hypothesis, investigators will conduct a randomized
      16-week trial of progressive aerobic and resistance training versus usual care control in 60
      sedentary older (50+ years) HIV-infected veterans. The study will determine the effects of
      exercise training on aerobic capacity and diastolic function, and their relationship to
      changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation and cardiac fibrosis (AIM 1). The study will
      also determine the effect of exercise training on strength and muscle mass, and their
      relationship to changes in biomarkers of systemic inflammation (AIM 2).
