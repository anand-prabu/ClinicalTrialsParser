    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the noninferiority of Algeron 1.5 and 2.0
      μg/kg/week in combination with ribavirin compared to PegIntron in combination with ribavirin
      in the treatment of chronic hepatitis C, and to determine therapeutic dose of Algeron.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After 12 weeks of treatment, an assessment of treatment efficacy was performed, i.e. rates
      of rapid (after 4 weeks) and early (after 12 weeks) virologic responses according to serum
      HCV RNA level PCR data. In patients without virologic response after 12 weeks, AVT was
      discontinued, and they were withdrawn from the study. Patients with EVR were enrolled in a
      follow-up period. During the follow-up period, patients of the first and the second group
      will receive Algeron in the selected therapeutic dose in combination with ribavirin,
      patients of the third group - PegIntron in combination with ribavirin during 12 or 36 weeks
      (depending on a genotype of the virus), afterwards they will be followed up without therapy
      for 24 weeks.
