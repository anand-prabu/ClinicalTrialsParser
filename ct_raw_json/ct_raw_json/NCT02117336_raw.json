Patients with clinically significant medical condition of malabsorption, inflammatory\n             bowel disease, chronic conditions which manifest with diarrhea, refractory nausea,\n             vomiting or any other condition that will interfere significantly with the absorption\n             of study drugs\n\n          9.

If\n             patients receiving routine IVIG have core antibody or surface antigen positivity\n             without evidence of active viremia (negative hepatitis B DNA) they may still\n             participate in the study, but should have hepatitis serologies and Hepatitis B DNA\n             monitored periodically by the treating physician.\n\n         12.
