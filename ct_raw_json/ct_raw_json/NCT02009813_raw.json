The investigators have recently shown that exposure to\n      hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) leads to an increase insulin sensitivity in males ubjects and that\n      this improvement can be measured in all men, not just those with diabetes. The aim of this\n      study is to investigate the time course of this effect and explore the mechanisms involved.\n      The investigators suspect that insulin sensitivity as measured by\n      hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamp will be increased within the time-frame of one 2-hour\n      hyperbaric oxygen exposure, and that the improvement will be measurable in females as well\n      as males."
