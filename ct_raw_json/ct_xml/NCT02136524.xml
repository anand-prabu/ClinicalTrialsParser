  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a Phase 1, open-label, randomized, 2-period, 2-treatment sequ ence
      crossover study to determine the relative bioavailability of cobimetinib ad ministered as a
      single dose of the tablet formulation relative to a single dose of the capsule formulation
      to healthy male and female participants. A minimum of 24 participants (12 participants per
      sequence) will complete the study. Partici pants will be randomly assigned to 2 possible
      sequences (i.e., I: A/B, II: B/A) where the treatments are as follows: Treatment A: One
      cobimetinib tablet adminis tered as a single oral dose after at least an 8-hour fast;
      Treatment B: Four cob imetinib capsules administered as a single oral dose after at least an
      8-hour fa st. The study is expected to last approximately 7 weeks.
