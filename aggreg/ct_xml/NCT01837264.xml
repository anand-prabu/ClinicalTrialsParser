    <textblock>
      Compartment syndrome (CS) is a condition resulting from increased pressure within a
      compartment, which compromises circulation and can lead to critical limb ischemia. CS is one
      of the biggest medical challenges that our soldiers face after battlefield related injuries.
      Chronic or exercise-induced compartment syndrome (CS)rarely requires treatment; acute
      compartment syndrome is a medical emergency requiring surgery.  Treatment of compartment
      syndrome is limited to fasciotomy, which relieves the pressure.The study purpose is to
      evaluate the feasibility and safety of the administration of marrow-derived autologous bone
      marrow concentrate and PRP gel generated by a point of care marrow separation system for the
      treatment of compartment syndrome. And to show this treatment possibly enhances wound
      healing, bone healing, perfusion, infection control, and the return of limb function in
      patients with CS.

      Stem Cell and regenerative medicine development efforts for therapeutic angiogenesis and
      wound healing have predominantly focused on the mechanism of action of a single stem cell
      population to achieve neovascularization and improve tissue perfusion. It is well documented
      that other cells, including platelets, are efficient carriers of growth factors (VEGF-PDGF,
      bFGF, and SDF-1) and play active roles in angiogenesis and wound healing. Arteriocyte's
      development efforts focus on concentration of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells and
      platelets for delivery to the site of injury in a concentration sufficient to effect local
      tissue revascularization and repair. These products provide for the rapid, bedside
      preparation of autologous PRP and bone marrow stem cell concentrate.

      This clinical trial with the Magellan® System is for the preparation of autologous cell
      concentrate for the treatment of wound, tissue and bone healing, improved perfusion,
      infection control, and the return of limb function in patients at risk of amputation.
