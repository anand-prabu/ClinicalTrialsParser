Part I contains questions concerning the patient's mentation, behavior and mood. Part II asks questions about the patient's ability to perform activities of daily living. Part III is the motor examination of the patient's symptoms ranging in scores from 0 to 4 with 0 equaling either normal or absence of symptoms. The minimum score on this section is 0 and the maximum is 108. Part IV asks the patient questions about any complications of therapy they have experienced within the past week. However, for this study the total UPDRS included Parts I, II, and III. A higher the score on the scale indicates more severe symptoms.",

GM1 ganglioside is a chemical that is normally found in the brain and is a\n      normal part of the outer covering or membrane of nerve cells.  This study will compare the\n      effectiveness of GM1 to standard PD treatment.  In addition to studying clinical measures of\n      motor and cognitive functioning, the investigators will use PET (positron emission\n      tomography) scanning to image the brain and the dopamine nerve endings in a subgroup of\n      patients.  Patients with mild to moderate idiopathic PD will be divided into 2 groups.  One\n      group will receive GM1 for 24 weeks and the other will receive placebo.  At the end of this\n      24 week period, all patients will enter into a 96 week treatment period in which all\n      patients will receive GM1.\n\n      In parallel, a group of standard-of-care patients with mild to moderate PD will be monitored\n      over a 1 to 2 year period to assess the natural progression of PD.  These patients will\n      receive the same clinical evaluations as the treatment group subjects but they will not\n      receive the experimental medication."
