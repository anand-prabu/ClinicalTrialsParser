            "textblock": "Arthritis is the nation's most common cause of disability.  An estimated 50 million U.S.\n      adults (about 1 in 5) report doctor-diagnosed arthritis.  Twenty three million U.S. adults\n      of working age (18-64 years) have arthritis; and in this age group arthritis-attributable\n      work limitations affect about 1 in 3 people.  An estimated 12% of all patients seeking\n      intervention for symptomatic arthritis have an etiology of previous trauma to the involved\n      joint.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to examine these inflammatory compounds in the joint fluid\n      (synovial fluid), the joint lining (synovium), and in blood among subjects with isolated\n      intra-articular fractures.\n\n      The hypothesis is that early levels of intra-articular inflammation and markers of joint\n      tissue degeneration following articular fracture in the human knee are predictive of the\n      development of PTA (Post Traumatic Arthritis). Early levels of intra-articular inflammation\n      and markers of joint tissue degeneration identified from human knee joints following\n      articular injury are predictive of the development of PTA in the mouse knee.\n\n      Samples of blood, urine and synovial fluid will be taken at the spanning frame surgery and\n      only synovial fluid at the ORIF (Open Reduction Internal Fixation)surgery. Two MRIs\n      (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) will be part of this study at 4 weeks and 18\n      months.Participants will complete a set of questionnaires(KOOS: Knee Injury and\n      Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) at 4 weeks and 18 months."

If patients only need to have one surgery (ORIF) sample\n      will be collected only once. MRI imaging of the injured knee will be obtained after fixation\n      at between week 6 and 8 and at 18 months.  Tissue samples will be analyzed for established\n      biomarkers of joint inflammation and degradation.  Patients will be followed for 18 months\n      to assess for signs of post-traumatic arthritis.  Imaging with plain film and MRI will occur\n      at 18 months.  MRI imaging analysis of cartilage thickness and composition changes will be\n      assessed in the injured knees.  Assessment of articular cartilage and joint space narrowing\n      and KOOS  will be correlated to biomarkers that may be indicative and predictive of joint\n      degeneration and the development of PTA."
