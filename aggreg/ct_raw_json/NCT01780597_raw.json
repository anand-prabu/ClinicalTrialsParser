The consequence of this is the number of heart transplants being\n      performed have steadily declined.\n\n      At present there are 600 hearts from brain dead donors offered for transplant every year in\n      the United Kingdom (UK). Of these 200 have anatomical reasons why they cannot be used for\n      transplant such as ischaemic heart disease. 100 are transplanted and the remaining 300\n      hearts are judged to have inferior function which probably occurs as a direct result of\n      brain death (Dark).\n\n      Ex vivo 'rig' testing has been developed for lungs that were judged unsuitable for\n      transplantation. As a result several donor lungs have been 'improved' by warm perfusion on\n      the rig to the extent that they became suitable for transplantation and so national lung\n      transplant rates are increasing (Dark). The aim would be to develop a similar approach for\n      the heart."
