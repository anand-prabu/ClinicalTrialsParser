Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients receive 2 additional courses beyond\n      attainment of best response (partial or complete response or stable or plateau disease).\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
