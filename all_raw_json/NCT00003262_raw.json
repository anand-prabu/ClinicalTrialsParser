This schedule is repeated every 3\n                weeks for 6 courses.\n\n        -  High risk patients (those with one or more risk factors) receive the Stanford V\n           regimen, as follows:\n\n             -  Doxorubicin and vinblastine intravenously on days 1 and 15\n\n             -  Mechlorethamine intravenously on day 1\n\n             -  Vincristine and bleomycin intravenously on days 8 and 22\n\n             -  Etoposide intravenously on days 15 and 16\n\n             -  Prednisone orally daily\n\n             -  Patients also receive daily injections of G-CSF on days 3-7, 9-13, 17-21, and\n                23-26. This schedule is repeated every 28 days for 3 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months the first year and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20-30 patients will initially be accrued in this study."
