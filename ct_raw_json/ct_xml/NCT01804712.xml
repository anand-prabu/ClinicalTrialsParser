  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is now substantial evidence that B cells are recruited into prostate cancers by CXCL13
      released by the tumor cells. B cells release lymphotoxin which drives malignant cell
      proliferation through the NFkB pathway. This is a pilot trial in 18 patients to determine
      whether depletion of B cells by rituximab will result in a decrease in the extent of B cell
      infiltration of the prostatic cancer. The extent of infiltration in the diagnostic biopsy
      will be compared to that in the prostatectomy samples following administration of 4 weekly
      doses of rituximab.

      This is an open label, single institution, pilot study of rituximab neoadjuvant therapy in
      patients with high risk prostate cancer scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy. Prior to
      prostatectomy, patients will receive one treatment cycle (28 days) of rituximab 375 mg/m2
      intravenously once weekly.  Patients will be scheduled to undergo radical prostatectomy
      within two weeks of completing study treatment. Tissue from prostatectomy will be used for
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining of pharmacodynamic markers.
