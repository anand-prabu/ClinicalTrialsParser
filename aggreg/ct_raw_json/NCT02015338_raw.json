            "textblock": "Congenital hemiparesis, mainly due to stroke, affects approximately 25% of children with\n      cerebral palsy. Noninvasive brain stimulation has emerged to influence improvements in hand\n      function specifically in children with congenital hemiparesis due to stroke.\n\n      The use of one type of noninvasive brain stimulation, Transcranial Direct Current\n      Stimulation (tDCS), in conjunction with rehabilitation training intervention for a child\n      with hemiparesis proposes a synergistic approach to improving hand function. Application of\n      electrodes over certain targeted areas are placed with the intent to stimulate and influence\n      neuronal activity.\n\n      Our preliminary evidence suggests that in children with hemiparesis due to stroke, the area\n      for placement is variable as noted by electroencephalogram (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic\n      Stimulation (TMS) measurement methods, influencing the site location of optimal stimulation\n      for tDCS.\n\n      Due to this variation, the optimal site of stimulation warrants investigation  for the\n      optimal placement of tDCS.\n\n      Hypothesis: In typically developing children (TDC), use of conventional EEG landmarks to\n      determine the brain area that controls hand function will not differ from TMS-guided\n      determination of individual motor hotspots. In children with hemiparesis, however, those two\n      locations will diverge. The prediction is that TMS will best guide tDCS interventions"
