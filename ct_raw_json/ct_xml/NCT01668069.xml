  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our purpose is to determine whether ondansetron, a commonly used antiemetic, is equivalent
      in efficacy to the combination of pyridoxine and doxylamine, the currently recommended first
      line therapy for nausea and vomiting in pregnancy by the American Congress of Obstetricians
      and Gynecologists (ACOG). Since both treatments are safe in pregnancy, many physicians are
      using ondansetron as first line in practice. Despite this practice and the recommendations
      from ACOG, there is not data to suggest that ether practice is superior. This will be the
      first prospective, randomized, double blind, controlled trial comparing the two treatments.
      We hypothesize that ondansetron will be equally efficacious in reducing nausea and episodes
      of emesis. By alleviating nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy, patients will
      likely benefit from less Emergency Department visits, urgent clinic visits, and admissions
      for progression to hyperemesis gravidarum.
