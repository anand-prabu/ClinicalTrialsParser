  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to evaluate the feasibility of a 12-week exergaming dance program for
      adolescent girls. This study combines dancing, video games, and a full body work-out to test
      if video games can increase physical activity and promote healthy weight in adolescent
      girls. We hypothesize that girls who play the dance exergames, versus those in the control
      group, will lose weight, decrease body fat and visceral fat, improve cardiovascular health,
      increase physical activity, and improve psychosocial health including self-confidence and
      quality of life.

      Klub Kinect will last about 14 weeks for each participant. The program begins with a 3.5
      hour clinic visit, the intervention lasts for 12 weeks, and the participant comes in for a
      final 3.5 hour clinic visit.

    <description>The Microsoft Kinect gaming console and Dance Central  and Just Dance game series are commercially available, off-the-shelf, products. Dance Central and Just Dance are a series of rhythm games developed by Harmonix Music Systems exclusively for the Xbox 360 Kinect. The Dance Central suite of games (Dance Central 1, 2, and 3) and Just Dance will be played on the Xbox 360+ Kinect gaming console, which employs whole body movement using an infrared sensor that tracks body movements such that an external controller device is not required. The player performs dance moves demonstrated by on-screen characters and set to popular music, with a choice of over 650 dance moves, 90 dance routines, and over 300 songs.
The exergaming condition will wear a pedometer to record total steps during game play, and they will participate in private weigh-ins at each session to track body weight over the 12-week intervention.</description>
