We will enroll up to 280\n      participants in the study (160 pilot phase; 120 clinical phase), made up of physicians,\n      nurses, nursing assistants and other healthcare employees who are currently covered under\n      the respiratory protection program. Subjects will be screened to determine eligibility and\n      must pass fit-testing on the respirator he/she is randomized to. Participants in the pilot\n      phase of the study will wear the respirator while walking in the hall, while participants in\n      the clinical trial phase will wear the respirator while performing a series of motions that\n      simulate movements made by healthcare workers when performing patient care tasks.  There\n      will be no contact with patients during participation in either phase of the study. Feedback\n      via validated survey tool will be collected from all study participants on the comfort and\n      tolerability of the respirator worn."
