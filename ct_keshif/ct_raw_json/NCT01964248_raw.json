This act appears at\n      the top of the anticipated care as painful by the nursing teams.\n\n      In the literature, we find no study carried out with the eutectic mixture lidoca\u00efne\n      priloca\u00efne. Other local anesthetics and other local ways of administration were estimated\n      and the results diverge as for the efficiency of a local anesthetic for the arterial blood\n      sample at the level radial nerve. Finally authors showed a correlation between certain\n      factors(mailmen) and the painful character of the arterial blood sample, without defining\n      really of population.\n\n      In this context, it is necessary to estimate the interest of a local anesthetic before\n      arterial sampling of blood by a study randomized in insu double and versus placebo."
