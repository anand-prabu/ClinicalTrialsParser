The study consists of 3 phases:\n      screening, open-label treatment, and follow up phases. After screening, randomly assigned\n      participants will receive different dose levels of abiraterone acetate (Treatment A = 250\n      mg; Treatment B = 500 mg; and Treatment C = 1000 mg) on Day 1 in each of the 3 treatment\n      periods according to a randomized schedule under fasted conditions (Sequence 1 = ABC;\n      Sequence 2 = BAC; and Sequence 3 = CBA). Each treatment period will be separated by a\n      washout period (period when participant is not receiving any study medication) of at least 7\n      days. In the follow-up phase, study-related adverse events will be monitored by the\n      investigator. Serial blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be collected and safety\n      will be monitored throughout the study. The total study duration will be approximately 42\n      days."
