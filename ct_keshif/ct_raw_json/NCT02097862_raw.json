ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction\n      using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose\n      tissue specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.\n\n      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected from the patient's abdomen using a liposuction\n      cannula. In addition, a sample of peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of\n      platelet rich plasma.  The adipose tissue is processed for separation of the adipose\n      tissue-derived stem cells, which are then resuspended in platelet rich plasma and\n      transferred for intra-discal administration. The number of cells injected will vary\n      depending on the amount of tissue processed and the number of cells obtained from the\n      process.  Following the injections follow-up data will be collected 3, 6 and 12 months after\n      treatment.\n\n      Total study time frame is anticipated to be approximately 6 months. This study will enroll\n      approximately 100 patients."
