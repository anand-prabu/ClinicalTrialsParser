This study will help develop the\n      methodology necessary to further investigate the role of fat tissue in vitamin D metabolism\n      and will assess the relationship between levels of vitamin D in fat tissue and in blood. 50\n      subjects who are referred for gastric bypass surgery will be enrolled in this study.\n      Subjects will complete questionnaires about their medical history, travel history and food\n      intake.  Prior to or during surgery, subjects will be asked to provide a blood sample for\n      selected chemistries related to  vitamin D metabolism.  During gastric bypass surgery, the\n      surgeon will collect small pieces of fat tissue from the fat under the skin and within the\n      abdomen by surgical biopsy. These samples will be used to refine the methodology for\n      determining the levels of vitamin D in blood and fat tissue and for comparing levels of\n      vitamin D in various tissues."
