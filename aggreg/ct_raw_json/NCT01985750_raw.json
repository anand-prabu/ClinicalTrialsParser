            "textblock": "Dyspnoea is the uncomfortable shortness of breath that debilitates millions of patients with\n      lung disease, heart failure and cancer.  It is often very difficult to treat. The sensations\n      of dyspnoea are processed in the brain, and we believe that psychological factors modify and\n      amplify these sensations, frequently exacerbating symptoms.\n\n      This study aims to identify the importance of learning in the brain mechanisms of dyspnoea\n      by investigating a cohort of patients with chronic breathlessness undergoing pulmonary\n      rehabilitation .  Pulmonary rehabilitation is a six-week course of exercise, education and\n      group therapy that improves dyspnoea but does not improve lung function. This leads us to\n      hypothesise that some of the beneficial effects of PR maybe due to changes in brain\n      processing, potentially relating to a learning effect.\n\n      Therefore to probe whether learning is important in the beneficial effects of pulmonary\n      rehabilitation, we intend to modify learning with the drug d-cycloserine.  D-cycloserine is\n      an antibiotic that enhances learning due to its effects at N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA)\n      receptors in the hippocampus.  Our previous study in a similar group of patients\n      demonstrated the importance of the hippocampus in breathlessness perception, and we now wish\n      to investigate this in more depth.\n\n      The study involves collecting physiological, psychological and clinical measures on in\n      conjunction with brain scanning,  before, during and once after pulmonary rehabilitation.\n      Subjects will either receive d-cyloserine or placebo before the first four pulmonary\n      rehabilitation sessions."
