In addition, the proposed study will address a critical need in diabetes prevention\n      that has not received sufficient scholarly attention: the prevention of T2D in children. No\n      studies of diabetes prevention similar in scope to the DPP have been performed in\n      school-aged children; however, reducing childhood obesity is widely accepted as the primary\n      pathway to decreasing the growing prevalence of T2D in the pediatric population."

Because of the genetic components\n      involved, all children born by a woman afflicted with gestational diabetes mellitus have\n      elevated risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes.  This first intervention builds upon the\n      evidence-based curriculum used in the DPP and incorporates into the curriculum detailed\n      education regarding ways to help their children adopt healthier lifestyle behaviors. It will\n      be delivered in groups of mothers only at community sites using trained laypeople. The\n      second intervention will use the same parent curriculum, but adds a group program for\n      children that teach them (directly) strategies for eating better and increasing physical\n      activity. This program will be delivered to both mothers and children in separate groups.\n      The group sessions will take place at the same time and in the same location by a trained\n      facilitator. The third intervention is an existing weight management program that is\n      delivered to families as a unit by a trained health care team. This program, called Stop\n      Taking On Pounds (STOP) was carefully designed using evidence-based criteria for weight loss\n      in adolescents and children. It has been evaluated by IU Health Care, found to be effective\n      and subsequently incorporated in the clinics of Wishard Health Services. STOP is designed to\n      help increase families' understanding of how to manage weight in their children by using\n      three key elements: nutrition, exercise, and behavior modification. It strives to provide a\n      positive environment that encourages children to make changes that can benefit the entire\n      family and improve the child's self esteem and problem solving skills."
