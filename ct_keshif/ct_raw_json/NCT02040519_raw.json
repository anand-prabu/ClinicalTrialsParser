Success rates range from 70 to 80%, and good long-term results are\n      reported. The working mechanism of SNM is not completely understood, and the only prognostic\n      factor for good response to this treatment is a successful test stimulation period. There is\n      no consensus on the duration of this test stimulation period. The experience in our clinic\n      during test stimulation period is that for responders it takes up to one week to achieve\n      maximal effect, after the system is turned 'on'. On the other hand the investigators notice\n      that after turning the neuromodulation system 'off', it will take a few hours for symptoms\n      to return to the baseline situation. The fact is: no information concerning the so called\n      \"time of onset\" and \"time of offset\" (or popular called: wash-in / wash-out) of sacral\n      neuromodulation is available in current literature."
