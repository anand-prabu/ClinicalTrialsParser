The study uses a 4 arm approach consisting of 4\n      intervention groups, with each intervention lasting for 12 weeks. The investigators will\n      investigate the effect of each intervention towards cognitive function and gait.  All\n      interventions will be conducted on site at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center, and\n      will be focused on determining the effects of different combinations of walking, cognitive\n      remediation, healthy living courses, and reading. Cognitive measures will include objective\n      clinical measures related to dementia, and the gait analysis will include in clinic and\n      \"free living\" measures related to falls."
