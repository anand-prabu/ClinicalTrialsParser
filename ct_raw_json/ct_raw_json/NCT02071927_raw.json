To exploit the dependence of tumors on\n      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine\n      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with leukemia.\n\n      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in subjects with leukemia.  Part 1\n      is a dose escalation study to identify the recommended Phase 2 dose. Patients enrolled into\n      Part 2 will be treated with the recommended Phase 2 dose.  Both Parts 1 and 2 will enroll\n      patients with relapsed and/or treatment refractory Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) and Acute\n      Lymphocytic Leukemia (ALL).  All patients will be assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics\n      (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers\n      (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness in later studies), and tumor response."
