Participants will be asked to provide a set of demographic variables  and to complete a survey assessing elements of self-management, disease knowledge, social support, and quality of life. Paticipants will then use the PatientsLikeMe website for 6 weeks as much as they wish. After 6 weeks the participants are asked to complete a second survey."
