In the last few years,\n      several new treatments have been tried to address the problem of CME after cataract surgery\n      in diabetic and non-diabetic patients. However, no randomised controlled clinical trial\n      (RCT) has compared all the currently existing preventive interventions and no study has been\n      conducted to investigate whether combining different preventive strategies has an additional\n      effect. Therefore, the investigators will perform a large RCT with the aim to provide more\n      definite evidence-based recommendations for clinical guidelines to prevent the occurrence of\n      CME after cataract surgery in patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). The outcomes\n      of this RCT will be of benefit to all cataract surgeons."

The design of the study is a multicentre randomised controlled clinical trial with\n      a duration of 33 months. The study population will consist of 1050 non-diabetic patients and\n      300 patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) who require cataract surgery in at least one eye.\n      All patients will receive a phacoemulsification for cataract and placement of a posterior\n      chamber intraocular lens (IOL).\n\n      In the non-diabetic population, the patients will receive either bromfenac 0.09% eye drops\n      twice daily starting two days before surgery and continuing 2 weeks postoperative,\n      dexamethasone 0.1% eye drops four times daily starting two days before surgery and\n      continuing four times daily during the first postoperative week and one drop less per day\n      every following week or a combination of both drugs.\n\n      In the diabetic population patients will receive either:\n\n        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose;\n\n        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose and a\n           subconjunctival injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (Triesence/Vistrec);\n\n        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose and an\n           intravitreal injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab (Avastin);\n\n        -  Topical bromfenac 0.09% and dexamethasone 0.1% in the aforementioned dose, a\n           subconjunctival injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide and an intravitreal\n           injection of 1.25 mg bevacizumab.\n\n      The primary endpoint is the change in central subfield mean macular thickness in the 1 mm\n      area (central subfield macular thickness, CSMT) as compared to baseline within the first 6\n      weeks postoperative.\n\n      The secondary endpoint is the occurrence of postoperative clinically significant macular\n      edema (CSME) within 12 weeks postoperatively. Other study endpoints are mean CDVA in logMAR\n      at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively; OCT measured average retinal thickness in the\n      central inner circle (3mm), the outer circle (6mm), and the macular volume at 6 weeks and 12\n      weeks postoperatively; intraocular pressure at 6 weeks and 12 weeks postoperatively;\n      health-related and vision-related quality of life at 12 weeks postoperatively; incremental\n      cost-effectiveness ratios of the costs per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) and costs per\n      improved patient on the National Eye Institute Visual Functioning Questionnaire (NEI VFQ-25)\n      and Health Utility Index (HUI-3).\n\n      In case of clinically significant macular edema, treatment will be initiated and its effect\n      will be part of the evaluation at 12 weeks. Medical data of all patients who develop macular\n      edema during this study will be checked at least 6 months after surgery."
