Furthermore, many infertile couples refuse to undergo\n      bilateral salpingectomy or proximal tubal occlusion because these procedures remove any hope\n      of spontaneous pregnancy. Other less invasive options for patients with hydrosalpinges as\n      ultrasound-guided aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid, antibiotics (alone or combined with\n      aspiration) and hysteroscopic occlusion of fallopian tube were studied in order to find an\n      alternative to salpingectomy . Although these methods are simple and getting popular,\n      current data are inadequate to recommend these treatment options instead of salpingectomy\n      because most of the supporting evidences for these methods come from small retrospective\n      studies.\n\n      A recent randomized controlled trial revealed that the aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid\n      at the time of oocyte retrieval was associated with improved implantation rate and pregnancy\n      rates.\n\n      The aim of this randomized controlled trial is to compare the efficacy of ultrasound guided\n      aspiration of hydrosalpingeal fluid with salpingectomy in the management patients with\n      ultrasound visible hydrosalpinges undergoing IVF-ET"
