Blood stem cells are\n      very young blood cells that grow in the body to become red or white blood cells or\n      platelets. The transplant uses stem cells in the blood from another person. The donor can be\n      a family member or a volunteer donor. This is called an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n\n      The investigators want to see if palifermin and/or leuprolide acetate can help the immune\n      system recover faster after an allogenic transplant because experiments have shown they may\n      be able to do this."
