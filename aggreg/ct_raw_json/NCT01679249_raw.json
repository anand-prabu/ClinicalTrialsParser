Here we report the first study of\n      isotope BV measurement (IBVM) for assessing volume status in HD patients using indicator\n      dilutional method.\n\n      10 adult HD patients were enrolled in this prospective observational study. Multi-point IBVM\n      before and after HD was performed using BVA-100 (Daxor, New York, NY). BVA-100 calculates BV\n      with an accuracy of \u00b12.5%, by using <25\u03bcCi of iodinated I-131 albumin. It assumes normal BV\n      for a given individual on the basis of patients' deviation from ideal body weight. Fluid\n      loss from the extravascular component of the extracellular space (EV) was calculated by\n      subtracting absolute BV change from total weight loss. Intradialytic relative BV changes\n      were measured by CLM-III during the same HD session. Bland-Altman plot was used to compare\n      relative BV change pre- and post-HD by IBVM and CLM-III."
