      This study will examine the epidemiology (incidence and control of a disease), burden,
      clinical need, and treatment patterns of spasticity in patients with a diagnosis of Cerebral
      Palsy (CP), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), Stroke, Spinal Cord Injury (SCI), or Traumatic Brain
      Injury (TBI).
