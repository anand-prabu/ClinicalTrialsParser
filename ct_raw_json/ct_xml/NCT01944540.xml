  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed to analyze the outcomes after conventional endoscopic submucosal
      dissection (ESD) and optimized ESD with snaring (oESD-S) for colorectal neoplasm that is
      more than 20 mm in diameter of laterllay spreading tumor or flat elevated lesion without
      stalk.

      Optimized ESD with snaring means submucosal dissection followed by snaring when narrowed
      circumference of the remained submucosal tissue beneath the lesion is less than 5 mm in
      diameter with snaring, then resected by using an electric current.

      The investigators expect optimized ESD with snaring can provide more time-saving procedure
      with comparable en-bloc resection rate and perforation rate, when compared with the
      conventional ESD method.
