    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to better understand why pancreatic cancer develops in some
      people who are known carriers of the gene mutation (an abnormality) called BRCA, or its
      close relative PALB2. The investigators hope to do this by establishing a BRCA/PALB2
      mutation carriers Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (the common form of pancreatic cancer)
      Registry. A registry is a database of information.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  BRCA mutation carrier is defined as a person with any mutation of the BRCA gene,
             including BRCA1, or BRCA2. PALB2mut patients are also eligible.

          -  Relative of a BRCA PDAC patient is defined as a first-degree relative, which
             includes, parents, siblings or children.

        BRCAmut PDAC Group: Study Group

          -  Known BRCA mutation carrier.

          -  Ashkenazi Jewish Descent (at least one parent of Ashkenazi Jewish origin).

          -  Histologic proof of primary pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (at MSKCC or at a
             participating center).

          -  May have either potentially curable (resectable) primary PDAC, localized but
             unresectable primary PDAC, or metastatic (stage IV) PDAC.

          -  Prior personal history of other malignancy; either prior or currently active,
             including breast or ovarian cancer is allowed.

          -  Both previously treated and previously untreated patients are eligible. Previous
             treatment may include surgical resection, regional radiation therapy, or systemic
             therapy. Patient may be receiving active therapy.

          -  Willing to provide blood specimens for correlative studies.

          -  Willing to provide permission to obtain banked tumor tissue for analysis (previous
             biopsies or surgical material). New tumor biopsies are not required for entrance into

             localized but unresectable primary PDAC, or metastatic (stage IV) PDAC.

          -  Both previously treated and previously untreated patients are eligible. Previous
             treatment may include surgical resection, regional radiation therapy, or systemic
