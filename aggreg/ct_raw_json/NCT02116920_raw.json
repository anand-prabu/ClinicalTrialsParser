Opaque, dense, dull, definite, well defined aceto white lesions, touching the\n           squamocolumnar junction or close to the external os.\n\n        2. Strikingly dense acetowhite areas in the columnar epithelium.\n\n        3. Condyloma and Leukoplakia occurring closer to the squamocolumnar junction turning\n           intensely white after application of acetic acid.\n\n        4. Growth on the cervix turning acetowhite.\n\n      The screened women who are tested  Screen Positive   by the primary screening test  VIA\n      will become eligible for recruitment in the study . Screen positive women from the outreach\n      community screening programs will be referred to  TMH ( Preventive Oncology screening\n      clinic)  for further  diagnostic verification.\n\n      Participant Recruitment\n\n      The study participants will be recruited from Hospital  ( Preventive Oncology screening\n      clinic) and community based screening programmes in Mumbai. Medical Social Workers will\n      explain the details and the purpose of the study to participants attending the screening\n      clinic.  Apparently healthy women in the age group of 30-65 yrs with an intact uterus and no\n      past history of cervical neoplasia will become eligible to participate in the programme. If\n      they are fulfilling the inclusion criteria given above, a written informed consent in the\n      vernacular language (either Hindi or Marathi) will be obtained from the participant and a\n      unique participant identification number will be assigned to the eligible women.\n      Information on socio demographic and reproductive variables will then be collected using a\n      detailed questionnaire.\n\n      Demographic, reproductive and sexual history data will be  recorded at screening following\n      informed consent..\n\n      Screen positive women will be tested for the presence of oncogenic HPV types by Hybrid\n      Capture-II (HC-II) and HPV E6/E7 mRNA testing as diagnostic test. In addition to the above\n      two tests all the screen positive women will also further receive Colposcopy with guided\n      cervical biopsy,  the reference gold standard test.\n\n      Colposcopy will be performed by trained doctors and the colposcopy impression will be noted\n      down along with a punch biopsy from the aceto white area on the cervix detected by the\n      primary screening test VIA.  Biopsy specimens will be fixed in 10% formalin and will be\n      processed and reported by the pathology laboratory at the Tata Memorial Centre.\n\n      The reference standard for final disease status will be histology.\n\n      Post Test Counseling :\n\n      At the end of all testing procedures post test counseling will be done by the  Doctor and\n      Medical Social Worker to explain the significance and the results of the testing procedures\n      performed. The importance of follow up visit to understand the results of HPV/ mRNA E6/E7\n      and  cervical biopsy will be explained to the women.\n\n      Follow up and Treatment:\n\n      Treatment for opportunistic and reproductive tract infections (RTI) will be provided. Women\n      with High grade lesions (cervical precancers ) HSIL will be recommended to seek treatment\n      with cryotherapy or LEEP (Loop Electrosurgical Excision Procedure) or by cold knife\n      conization at the Tata Memorial Centre Mumbai.\n\n      Total Project Period:  Three years:\n\n      Proposal submission, training,  participant recruitment, data collection and analysis,\n      including follow-up of cases at the end of enrollment period"
