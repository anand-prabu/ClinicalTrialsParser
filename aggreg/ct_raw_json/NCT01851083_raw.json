There are no effective therapies to treat secondary brain\n      injury and the post-injury response of CNS apoptosis and neuroinflammation. This study is a\n      follow-up trial from a previously performed Phase I trial that demonstrated the safety and\n      potential CNS structural preservation effect of intravenous autologous bone marrow\n      mononuclear cells (BMMNC) after severe TBI in children. (Cox, 2011) The study is designed as\n      a prospective, randomized, placebo controlled, blinded Phase 2 safety/biological activity\n      study.  The investigators hope to determine the effect of intravenous infusion of autologous\n      BMMNCs on brain structure and neurocognitive/functional outcomes after severe TBI in\n      children."
