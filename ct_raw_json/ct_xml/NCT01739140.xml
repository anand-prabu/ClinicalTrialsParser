      This is a study to better understand how a yoga intervention helps improve symptoms in
      people with chronic low back pain.  This study will be a 12-week intervention of about 24
      participants with chronic low back pain where all individuals will receive weekly yoga
      classes and instructions for home practice.  The purpose of this study is to collect
      feasibility data and to conduct preliminary analyses in preparation for a larger planned NIH
      study.
