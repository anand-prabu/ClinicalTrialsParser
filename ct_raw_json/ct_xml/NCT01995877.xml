      To determine if laying down or standing up changes the diameter of the inferior vena cava.

      Patients are referred for IVC(inferior vena cava)filter placement secondary to trauma,
      surgery, a fractured pelvis or known blood clots in the lower extremities. The filter is
      placed to prevent blood clots from traveling into the lungs. The filters are placed during a
      interventional radiology procedure. During the procedure the diameter of the IVC(inferior
      vena cava)is measured with the patient in a horizontal position (laying down). The blood
      pressure in the IVC when a patient is in this position is relatively low in normal
      circumstances, but may increase substantially when the patient is vertical with secondary
      dilation of the IVC(inferior vena cava).

      Migration of IVC(inferior vena cava)filters is not frequent; however it is a serious
      complication, which may be caused by changes in the diameter of the IVC(inferior vena
      cava)related to changes in the position of the body and/or increased pressure in the
      abdomen.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much postural changes of the body affect the
      diameter of the IVC(inferior vena cava).

      For research purposes patients will have an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) performed to
      measure the IVC diameter before and after a Valsalva maneuver (having the subject hold their
      breath and bear down as if they were having a bowel movement). The angiographic table will
      be elevated and the measurements will be repeated.

    <description>There are times when a filter needs to be placed in the IVC(inferior vena cava) to help prevent blood clots from traveling from the lower part of the body to the lungs. Some reasons a filter may be necessary are; for patients who have had a pelvic fracture, or have blood clots in the leg or legs. Sometimes a filter placement is ordered when a patient is scheduled for major surgery that will require the patient to be on bed rest for a long period of time. There have been instances where a filter has migrated (moved) from where it was placed to another portion of the IVC(inferior vena cava). We believe that one of the reasons that they can move is because the diameter of the IVC(inferior vena cava) changes and becomes bigger when a patient changes positions.</description>

    <description>Subjects will have an intra vascular ultrasound (IVUS) performed while you are lying down on the exam table; this will be performed before the IVC(inferior vena cava) filter is placed and again after the filter has been placed. During the ultrasound measurements of the diameter of different areas of the IVC(inferior vena cava) will be taken. The table will then be moved so that you are in a standing position; the same measurements will be taken while you are standing.
The ultrasound will be performed by the physician performing your procedure. When you are lying down, a sheath (small catheter) will be inserted into a vein in your groin. The IVUS(intra vascular ultrasound)catheter will be inserted through the sheath and used to measure the size of the IVC(inferior vena cava) at various places.
The IVUS(intra vascular ultrasound) procedure will add approximately 30 to 45 minutes to the filter placement procedure.</description>
