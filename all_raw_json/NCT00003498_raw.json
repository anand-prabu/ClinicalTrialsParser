Antineoplastons may inhibit the growth of cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well antineoplaston therapy works in treating\n      patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not responded to high-dose chemotherapy and\n      bone marrow transplantation."

Treatment\n      continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. After 12 months, patients with responding or stable disease may continue\n      treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months\n      for years 3 and 4, and then annually for years 5 and 6.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
