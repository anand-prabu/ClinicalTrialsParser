            "textblock": "This research evaluates the effectiveness of a new drug called belatacept (Nulojix) for the\n      prevention of acute rejection and preservation of kidney function in transplant patients.\n      Belatacept was approved in 2011 by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and\n      is being marketed as Nulojix. The pharmaceutical company sponsoring this study is\n      Bristol-Myers Squibb.\n\n      Belatacept is a prescription medicine used in adults to prevent transplant rejection in\n      people who have received a kidney transplant. Transplant rejection happens when the body's\n      immune system senses that the new transplanted kidney is different or foreign, and attacks\n      it. Belatacept is used with corticosteroids and certain other medicines to help prevent\n      rejection of your new kidney.\n\n      The purpose of the research is to understand whether the new drug, belatacept, is better\n      than other anti-rejection drugs, such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus that are typically used\n      in the treatment against kidney rejection in transplant patients."

Patients with evidence of CNI\n      toxicity will be eligible for switch to belatacept-based regimen within the first three\n      months after transplant. All enrolled subjects will also receive concomitant maintenance\n      immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and corticosteroids.\n\n      Duration of Study: 6 months, with option to extend to 12 months of belatacept treatment\n      Number of Subjects: 20 Study Population: Kidney transplant recipients within the first three\n      months of their first transplant with evidence of CNI toxicity.\n\n      Criteria for Evaluation:\n\n      Primary Outcome Measures:\n\n        -  Donor specific antibody testing at Month 6\n\n        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to donor cell antigen by direct and\n           indirect stimulation at Month 6\n\n        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to CMV and EBV antigens by direct and\n           indirect stimulation at Month 6\n\n        -  Immunophenotyping to determine overall immune profile at Month 6\n\n        -  Patient and functional graft survival in stable renal transplant recipients\n\n      Secondary Outcome Measures:\n\n        -  Donor specific antibody testing at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)\n\n        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to donor cell antigen by direct and\n           indirect stimulation at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)\n\n        -  Cell surface cytokine secretion in response to CMV and EBV antigens by direct and\n           indirect stimulation at Months 1 and 3 (and month 12 if continuing in study)\n\n      Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment: Study patients will\n      receive intravenous belatacept at 5mg/kg every two weeks at day 1 and weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8,\n      and then monthly at months 3, 4, and 5. At month 6 patients may elect to continue for an\n      additional six month period of belatacept administration. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n      (PBMCs) and sera for antibody testing will be collected at time of study entry and at 4, 8,\n      12, and 24 weeks after belatacept start, frozen and banked at our center, and analyzed in\n      batch fashion for development of humoral and cell mediated immunity. Patients who elect to\n      receive an additional 6 months of belatacept treatment will undergo additional immunologic\n      analysis at 1 year after study entry."
