Patients\n      are stratified according to International Prognostic Scoring System score (low and\n      intermediate-1 vs intermediate-2 and high) and transfusion dependence (yes vs no). Patients\n      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral thalidomide once daily on weeks 1-24.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily on weeks 1-24. In both arms, patients\n           who have not progressed to leukemia after 24 weeks of therapy may receive open-label\n           thalidomide for an additional 24 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 220 patients (110 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
