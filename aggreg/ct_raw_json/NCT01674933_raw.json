TAU is the core Childsmile Nursery intervention\n      (supervised daily toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste, free dental packs of fluoride\n      toothpaste, toothbrushes and advice).\n\n      Children will be screened by asking parents whether or not the child has previously been\n      hospitalised with asthma or diagnosed with any allergies. Provided that a child has no\n      contraindications to fluoride varnish then the child can proceed to study inclusion. On the\n      day of the planned application, the dental nurse will carry out a risk assessment to reduce\n      the possibility of children with oral/facial infections being included. After excluding\n      non-eligible children, a baseline dental examination will take place, followed by\n      randomisation into treatment as usual or treatment as usual plus fluoride varnish. This\n      second group will receive up to four FV applications at 6 month intervals. After two years,\n      all study children will be offered a final dental examination."
