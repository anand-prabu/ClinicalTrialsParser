It is suggested that pat ents with\n      enhanced pain sensitivity report high level of disability. Despite fact that pain and\n      disability are associated in chronic LBP the exact mechanisms of sensitivity contribution in\n      LBP disability is unknown. It has also been suggested that muscle function changes may be\n      driven by pain. The possible role and contribution of trunk muscles function to pain and\n      disability phenomena remain unknown.\n\n      This study was aimed to estimate prevalence and possible correlation among pain\n      hypersensitivity and functional and electromyography parameters of trunk muscles in patients\n      reporting early phase of chronic LBP."
