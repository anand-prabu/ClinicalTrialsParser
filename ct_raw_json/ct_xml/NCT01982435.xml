  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the ocular and systemic adverse events of
      ranibizumab (Lucentis)for DME (diabetic macular edema) following previous treatment with
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I/II study of intravitreally administered 0.3mg ranibizumab
      (Lucentis) in subjects with DME (diabetic macular edema) previously treated with
      intravitreal bevacizumab (Avastin) with a randomized comparative dosing strategy, monthly vs
      &quot;treat-and-extend.&quot;   Thirty patients total will be enrolled in the study, 15 in each group.
       This study will have a 1-year treatment period. The recruitment period will occur over 1
      year with total potential study duration of 2 years.
