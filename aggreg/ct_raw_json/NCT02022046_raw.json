Nitric\n      oxide (NO) deficiency links CKD and CVD. Asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), a NO synthase\n      inhibitor, its level is increased in kidney disease and cardiovascular disease and serves as\n      a methylation biomarker.\n\n      In addition to ADMA, uremic environment, hyperhomocysteinemia (Hcy) and oxidative stress may\n      affect DNA methylation. S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) is an important human methyl donor.\n      S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) is demethylated product. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase\n      (MTHFR), a folate metabolism enzyme can regulate methylation pathway.\n\n      The investigators intend to examine whether ADMA, SAM/SAH ratio, Hcy, and MTHFR gene\n      methylation can serve as biosignature to predict CVD in children with CKD children."
