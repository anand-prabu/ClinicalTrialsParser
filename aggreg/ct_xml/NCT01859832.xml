  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing renal transplantation at London Health Sciences Centre, University
      Hospital and who are participating in the study &quot;A Comparison of Effects of Standard Dose vs
      Low Dose Advagraf with IL-2 Receptor Antibody Induction, MMF and Steroids, With or Without
      ACEi/ARB-based Antihypertensive Therapy on Renal Allograft Histology, Function, and Immune
      Response&quot; will be evaluated with the ImmuKnow Assay to assess the ability of this assay to
      predict underimmunosuppression (rejection) or overimmunosuppression determined by this test
      and to determine retrospectively whether decision making utilizing this novel assay would
      have improved outcomes over standard techniques.

      This study is designed to evaluate an in vitro assay (CylexÂ®ImmuKnow Assay) for the
      measurement of cell-mediated immune response in renal transplant patients receiving
      immunosuppressive therapy. This assay measures ATP as an activation response of CD4+ cells
      to stimulation with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) in whole blood samples as a reflection of the
      immune system of the patient at any point in therapy.   The natural history of the immune
      status of the renal transplant recipient as reflected by the ImmuKnow assay will be
      determined at specific time points of interest including: pre and post transplant, as an
      adjunct to therapeutic drug monitoring, and pre and post infectious or rejection episode.
      Analysis of the results of the assay at these time points will allow us to retrospectively
      study the effects of routine immunosuppressive agent modulation on immune function, and its
      subsequent effects in times of renal allograft insult.
