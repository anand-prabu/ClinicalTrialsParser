Recent expert opinion from the American College of Rheumatology\n      Guidelines is that allopurinol may be started during an acute, treated gout attack.  This\n      study is designed to test the hypothesis that allopurinol does not prolong an acute, treated\n      gout attack.  Patients will either take allopurinol capsules or and identical capsule\n      containing no allopurinol (placebo) over 28 days, starting within 72 hours of a gout attack\n      that is being treated with other standard measures.  During the study, neither the patient\n      nor the examiner will know what pills are being taken.  The time to resolution of the attack\n      is the primary outcome measure.  Pain level, serum uric acid level, and complications of\n      therapy will also be monitored.  A minimum of 32 patients completing the study are needed\n      for a meaningful conclusion."
