Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining\n      buthionine sulfoximine with chemotherapy may reduce resistance to the drug and allow more\n      tumor cells to be killed.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of melphalan, buthionine sulfoximine, and\n      G-CSF in treating children with progressive neuroblastoma that has not responded to previous\n      therapy."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Describe the toxic effects of combined chemotherapy with buthionine\n      sulfoximine (BSO) and melphalan (L-PAM) in pediatric patients with progressive\n      neuroblastoma. II. Determine the pharmacokinetics of BSO/L-PAM in pediatric patients. III.\n      Assess the ability of BSO to deplete glutathione by at least 90% in tumor metastatic to bone\n      marrow, in normal marrow, and in peripheral blood lymphocytes. IV. Estimate the response\n      rate in these patients treated with BSO/L-PAM within the confines of a pilot study.\n\n      OUTLINE: The following acronyms are used: BSO Buthionine sulfoximine, NSC-326231 L-PAM\n      Melphalan, NSC-8806 G-CSF Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor, NSC-614629 Single-Agent\n      Chemotherapy with Drug Resistance Inhibition. L-PAM/BSO.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 18 patients will be entered to provide an adequate number of\n      patients with marrow involvement; if the BSO dose is increased to achieve adequate GSH\n      depletion in the marrow, an additional 12 patients will be entered. If less than 50% of\n      patients have tumor metastatic to marrow at entry, there will be a proportional increase in\n      the total number of patients required."
