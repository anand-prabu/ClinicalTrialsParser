  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed clinical trial will study the effects of 12 months of therapy with ARN-509
      alone, or in combination with an LHRH agonist (LHRHa), each compared to LHRHa alone, in men
      with a rapidly rising serum PSA after prior definitive local therapy for prostate cancer.
      The endpoints selected reflect measurable short term effects of androgen deprivation therapy
      (ADT), including quality of life and several metabolic parameters.  In addition, the
      relative effect of each treatment strategy on PSA suppression as well as testosterone
      recovery (and subsequent PSA progression) after 12 months of therapy will be evaluated.
