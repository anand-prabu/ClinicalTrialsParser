      The objectives of this open-label follow-up study for subjects who previously were
      randomized and have completed the VIPES study for the treatment of peanut allergy, are:

        -  To assess the efficacy of Viaskin Peanut after up to 36 months of treatment.

        -  To evaluate the safety of long-term treatment with Viaskin Peanut.

        -  To evaluate sustained unresponsiveness to peanut after a period of 2 months without
           treatment in subjects showing desensitization to peanut after treatment with Viaskin
           Peanut.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common allergy in the United States, with a prevalence in the general
      population as high as 1%. So far, there is no approved treatment of peanut allergy. Peanut
      allergy management is based on strict peanut avoidance and injectable epinephrine after the
      allergic systemic reactions have started. Specific Immunotherapy methods currently available
      have shown some limitations in their use because of safety issues. Hence, there is an
      important unmet medical need for efficient and safe treatment of peanut allergy.

      DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery system, called Viaskin, a method
      based on delivering precise quantity of the allergen on the upper layers of the skin.
      Avoiding contact between the allergen and the bloodstream should confer to epicutaneous
      immunotherapy (EPIT) a higher level of safety as systemic reactions should be circumvented

      The OLFUS-VIPES study is an open-label follow-up study for subjects who previously were
      randomized and have completed the VIPES efficacy and safety study. Subjects will be offered
      enrollment in this follow-up study to receive an additional 24 months of Viaskin Peanut
      treatment followed by a period of 2 months without treatment while maintaining a peanut-free
      diet.

      The trial will be conducted at the same sites as the VIPES study with investigators and
      staff trained and experienced in the diagnosis and the management of peanut allergy and
      anaphylaxis, and who are capable of performing a double-blind placebo-controlled food
      challenge (DBPCFC) in adult and/or pediatric subjects.

      Subjects entering the OLFUS-VIPES study who had previously received Viaskin Peanut at any of
      the three doses in the VIPES study will continue at the same dose (i.e. 50 mcg or 100 mcg or
      250 mcg of peanut protein). Subjects entering the OLFUS-VIPES study who had previously
      received placebo in the VIPES study will be re-randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive
      Viaskin Peanut at one of the three doses of peanut protein. The study will remain blinded
      for all subjects until the VIPES study is unblinded.Once analyses of the VIPES study have
      been completed and the optimal clinical dose has been demonstrated, the initial treatment
      groups will be unblinded. It is planned that all subjects in the OLFUS-VIPES study will be
      switched to this optimal clinical dose of Viaskin Peanut. From this stage onwards, the study
      will continue in a full open-label manner at one dose. All subjects completing the
      OLFUS-VIPES study should receive overall 24 months of active treatment followed by a period
      of 2 months without treatment for those subjects being assessed for sustained
      unresponsiveness.
