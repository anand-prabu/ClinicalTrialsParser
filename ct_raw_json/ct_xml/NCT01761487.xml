  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to control the current national outbreak of Carbapenem-resistent
      Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP). In Israel, the death rate among CRKP carriers is 3.5 times
      higher than in Carbapenem-sensitive Klebsiella pneumonia carriers (44% vs. 12.5%,
      respectively).

      In the investigators' previous study: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial
      of Selective Digestive Decontamination (SDD) Using Oral Gentamicin and Oral Polymyxin E for
      Eradication of CRKP Carriage (Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol. 2012;33:14-19) the
      investigators have shown that the investigators' SDD regimen is effective for decolonization
      patients colonized with CRKP.

      The investigators' assumption is that a higher dose of polymyxin E together with gentamicin
      (SDD drugs) for a prolonged period is needed to overcome the likelihood of a high rate of
      drug inactivation in the gut, thereby reaching CRKP carriage eradication.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Provide a sighed and dated written informed consent document indicating that the

             aspects of the study

          -  Hospitalized men or women at least 18 years of age

          -  Rectal swab culture positive for CRKP in the last week

          -  Will be willing to initiate and remain on treatment, except for adverse events
             occurring

        Exclusion Criteria:
