Forty patients will be\n      recruited according to specific inclusion criteria. Randomization will be performed using\n      computer-generated tables; allocation will be concealed using sequentially numbered opaque\n      and sealed envelopes.The included 40 patients will be analyzed (age range between 20-60\n      years). They will be randomly distributed into two groups with 20 patients in each group\n      (1:1 allocation ratio).\n\n      Intervention: Excessively damaged and endodontically treated molars will be restored with\n      IPS.emmax endocrowns or  IPS.emmax crowns supported with composite core.\n\n      Main outcome measure:  marginal adaptation and anatomic form will be investigated\n      clinically and by apical radiographs at the baseline assessment using the modified (USPHS)\n      at  six assessment times during an 18-month observation period.\n\n      Assessor blinding will be employed."
