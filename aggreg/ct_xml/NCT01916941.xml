      The study uses neurobiological measures through brain imaging, neuropsychological measures,
      and selfreport measures to try to understand how an effective treatment for alcoholism
      works. On the whole, less than 50% of people with alcoholism get better with treatment. This
      study will help researchers develop better treatments for alcoholism because if the
      investigators know why the treatments the investigators use are working, and in whom the
      treatments work best, then the investigators may be able to make treatment more effective by
      targeting treatments to individuals who would be most likely to benefit and by guiding
      development of more effective treatments in the future.
