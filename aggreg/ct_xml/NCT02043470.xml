    <textblock>
      The investigators propose using retinal oximetry to assess for abnormalities in regional
      retinal oxygen consumption in previously- irradiated patients, and relate these
      abnormalities to changes in regional retinal function (i.e. visual field abnormalities).
      Since different regions of retina receive different radiation doses, the investigators will
      assess for a dose response as well.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy (RT) is a common treatment for patients with cancers of the sinonasal
      area, orbit, skull base, nasopharynx, and brain. Because of the close proximity of these
      targets to the eyes, the retina is often incidentally and unavoidably irradiated. As a
      result, some patients develop radiation retinopathy and possibly vision loss.
      Clinicopathologic studies suggest similar microvascular mechanisms for both radiation- and
      diabetic retinopathy: small vessel occlusion and ischemia that can lead to
      neovascularization, increased capillary permeability, and visual loss in the regions of
      retina perfused by damaged vasculature.  UNC has a novel, non-invasive retinal imaging
      technology called a Retinal Oximeter which measures hemoglobin oxygen saturation of retinal
      vessels. The difference in oxygen saturation between a retinal arteriole and venule pair
      reflects the oxygen consumption of the retinal region supplied by that vessel pair.
