            "textblock": "The research study will be conducted over a 12-week period. Overall, each participant will\n      meet with the researcher three times. During the first visit, after the participant has\n      signed the consent form, their blood pressure will be taken with a digital blood pressure\n      monitor. If her systolic blood pressure is greater than 140 mmHg or her diastolic blood\n      pressure is greater than 90 mmHg, she will not be eligible to take part in this study. If\n      the participant is able to take part in this study, she will be given a code number to\n      protect confidentiality and randomly assigned to one of two groups, Group I or Group II. The\n      participant will then be asked to state their age, ethnicity, menopausal status, and whether\n      or not they are taking oral contraceptives. Next, height and weight will be taken with an\n      instrument called a Health-O-Meter. Body mass index (BMI) and percent body fat will be\n      calculated using an instrument called a Body Composition Analyzer. After all measurements\n      are taken, participants will be given instructions on how to keep a 3-day diet and\n      supplement diary.  A booklet will be provided to help them record their diet for two\n      nonconsecutive week days and one weekend day. The 3-day diet and supplement diary is to be\n      completed during the week between the first and second session with the researcher. During\n      this session the participant will be asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire to\n      help the researcher asses the phytoestrogen content of her diet. At the end of the first\n      session, the researcher will schedule a second session with the participant.\n\n      The second session will take place one week after the first session. During the second\n      session, measurements taken will be height, weight, BMI, percent body fat, and blood\n      pressure. Participants will be asked to return the 3-day diet and supplement diary to the\n      researcher. The researcher will review the diary and ask questions to clarify foods\n      recorded. The participant will then be asked to complete a physical activity questionnaire.\n      Next, supplements will be distributed. The participants will not have knowledge of which\n      group they are assigned to. Group I will receive 168 capsules, each capsule containing 1\n      gram of wheat germ oil, in two pill bottles. One bottle will contain 100 capsules; the\n      second bottle will contain 68 capsules. Group II will receive 168 capsules, each capsule\n      containing 1 gram of pumpkin seed oil, in two pill bottles. One bottle will contain 100\n      capsules; the second bottle will contain 68 capsules. Participants will be instructed to\n      take 2 capsules per day, every day for 12 weeks. Two capsules per day are equal to\n      approximately a \u00bd teaspoon or 18 kilocalories. It does not matter if they choose to take\n      each capsule at the same time or at different times during the day. To help remind\n      participants to take their supplements each day, they will receive a 7 day pill organizer\n      and a daily check list. At this session, participants will receive a second 3-day diet and\n      supplement diary that is to be completed one week before the final session. At the end of\n      the second session, the researcher will schedule the final session with the participant.\n\n      The third and final session will take place 12 weeks after the initial session. Measurements\n      taken during the final session will be height, weight, BMI, percent body fat, and blood\n      pressure. The participant will be asked to complete a food frequency questionnaire identical\n      the questionnaire filled out during the first session with the researcher. Participant will\n      be asked to return their 3-day diet and supplement diary, daily check list, pill organizer,\n      2 pill bottles, and any unused supplements. After completion of the study the participant\n      will receive a $20 Target gift card at this session.\n\n      A potential risk of this study includes loss of confidentiality. Confidentiality will be\n      maintained by the use of code numbers rather than names on data containing documents.\n      Digital data analyses will be done using only code numbers and not identifiable data. Data\n      recorded on paper containing identifiable and non-identifiable participant information\n      (consent forms, data collection forms, 3-day diet and supplement diaries, physical activity\n      questionnaires, food frequency questionnaires, and participant daily checklists) will be\n      kept in a locked cabinet in Room 10132B in the Texas Woman's University, Houston Office of\n      Research.\n\n      Another potential risk of this study may be that the participant's normal schedule is\n      disrupted by coming to the Texas Woman's University, Houston campus. To minimize this risk,\n      sessions will be scheduled with the researcher in advance Monday through Friday, from 8 a.m.\n      to 5 p.m. to accommodate the participant's schedule."
