This is a phase I, open-label, multi-center, non-randomized, 2-part first time in\n      human (FTIH) study for GSK2879552. Part 1 is a dose escalation phase to determine the\n      recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) for GSK2879552 based on the safety, tolerability,\n      pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) profiles observed after oral administration\n      of GSK2879552. Any dose level(s) may be expanded up to 12 subjects in order to collect\n      additional data on PK and PD.The safety and PK/PD data will be reviewed prior to the dose\n      decision, and the dose escalation will be guided by the Neuenschwander -continuous\n      reassessment method (N-CRM).  Built-in safety constraints are in place to prevent exposing\n      subjects to undue risk of toxicity.  Once RP2D is identified, an expansion cohort (Part 2)\n      of up to 30 subjects will be enrolled to further evaluate the clinical activity and\n      tolerability of GSK2879552 in subjects with relapsed/refractory SCLC."
