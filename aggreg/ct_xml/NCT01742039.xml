  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to determine the safest and most effective therapeutic
      strategy to decrease the incidence of postoperative atrial fibrillation following cardiac
      surgery in an era with shorter ICU and hospital length of stay. A secondary goal is to
      evaluate the length of hospital stay associated with each treatment strategy.
