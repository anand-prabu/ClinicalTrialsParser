After 4 doses of rituximab, patients\n      without bone marrow involvement and cellularity greater than 50% expected receive rituximab\n      IV once weekly on weeks 6 and 7 and yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan IV over 10 minutes\n      with the final dose of rituximab (day 43).\n\n      Cohorts of 5-6 patients receive escalating dose of yttrium Y 90 ibritumomab tiuxetan until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 4 of 5 or 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 weeks, every 2-3 months for 2 years, and then every 6\n      months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
