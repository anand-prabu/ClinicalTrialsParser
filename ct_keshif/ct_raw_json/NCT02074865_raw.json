            "textblock": "The main challenge of the ChARLI program is to assess the clinical burden of severe neonatal\n      and childhood bacterial infections in low-income countries,in particular those caused by\n      antibiotic resistant bacteria. This program will address both healthcare associated, as well\n      as community acquired infections. Beside its main challenge, the ChARLI program will also\n      allow the assessment of the economic burden of these infections, the improvement of their\n      medical care and then ultimately help to set public health interventions and guide public\n      health measures necessary to combat bacterial infections and bacterial resistance in\n      children. It will also lead to set up more basic research investigation to better understand\n      how pathogenic and epidemic may be the resistant clones in these countries and to experiment\n      innovative strategies devoted to prevent these infections.\n\n      In order to achieve these objectives, an international paediatric cohort will be created,\n      and monitored a platform. This will be done first within the Institut Pasteur International\n      Network (IPIN) and possibly extended in some others low income countries where the IPIN has\n      no center. This constituted initiative will represent the first international pediatric\n      program of its size to be located in low-income countries and specifically focusing severe\n      bacterial infections and bacterial resistance to antibiotics"
