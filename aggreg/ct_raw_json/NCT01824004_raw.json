Pts were treated with S-1 (40-60 mg depending on BSA) b.i.d. for 3 wks, and cisplatin (60 mg/m\u00b2) iv on day 1, followed by a 2-wk rest period, within a 5-wk cycle. Subsequently, radiotherapy (RT) started which consisted of 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy to a total dose of 45 Gy in 5 wks (5 fractions/wk). On RT days, S-1 (40-60 mg depending on BSA ) b.i.d., 5 days/wk was given. One month after the completion of RT, two 5-wk cycles of S-1/ciplatin chemotherapy were given."

However, the high\n      recurrence rate makes gastric cancer a disease difficult to cure by surgery alone. Despite\n      the benefit of CRT on local recurrence, the distant recurrence is the leading pattern of\n      failure. We hypothesized that gastric cancer outcome could be improved using a more\n      effective chemotherapy regimen. This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical outcomes\n      and toxicity of adjuvant treatment including S-1/cisplatin chemotherapy followed by S-1\n      based CRT."
