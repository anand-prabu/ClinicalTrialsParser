We have developed a website, informational videos, and a brochure for\n      pituitary tumour patients and their families. The primary outcome measures will be 1) the\n      level of knowledge that patients have of their condition before and after reviewing the\n      materials provided; and 2) ease of use and user satisfaction of the materials. We\n      hypothesize that our informative multimedia educational package will not only improve the\n      health literacy and self-efficacy of patients and their families,  but will also improve\n      quality of care."

These materials include a website (containing videos,\n      illustrations and written materials) and plain language educational brochures. The\n      educational materials include information that patients will need throughout their\n      experience with a pituitary tumour, ranging from the signs and symptoms of tumours, to\n      long-term post-operative lifestyle changes. This evaluation will be a mixed-methods\n      evaluation.\n\n      Part A (Think aloud) will use \"think-aloud\" processes to evaluate the usefulness and ease of\n      use of a website that we have developed with patients and their families.\n\n      Part B (Resource assessment) will involve the use of questionnaires followed by\n      semi-structured interviews with patients and families before and after using the resources."
