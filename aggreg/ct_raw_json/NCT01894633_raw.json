All the patients were evaluated for quality of life (QoL) using the\n      EORTC QLQ-C30 questionnaire (Mexican version) before beginning radiotherapy and one month\n      later.\n\n      Results: The response rates (RRs) were 54% for the CLQ plus WBI arm and 55% for the control\n      arm (p=0.92). The progression-free survival (PFS) rates at one year were 83.9% (95% CI\n      69.4-98.4) for the CLQ group and 55.1% (95% CI 33.6-77.6) for the placebo group. Treatment\n      with CLQ was independently associated with increased PFS in patients with brain metastases\n      (RR 0.31, 95% CI [0.1-0.9], p=0.046).The only factor that was independently associated with\n      increased overall survival (OS) was the presence of < 4 brain metastases (RR 1.9, 95% CI\n      [1.12-3.3], p=0.017). WBI was associated with improvements in cognitive and emotional\n      function but also with worsened nausea in both patient groups. No differences in QoL or\n      toxicity were found between the study arms. However, this difference was not associated with\n      a difference in quality of life."
