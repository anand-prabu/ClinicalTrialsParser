The same holds true for pregnant women, but not much is\n      known about the use of these drugs in pregnancy. Blood sugar and liver problems caused by\n      anti-HIV drugs in nonpregnant patients are well known but their effects in pregnancy are\n      not. Also, certain physical changes brought about by pregnancy may affect the way drugs are\n      handled in the body. There remains a need for further study into the use of anti-HIV drugs\n      during pregnancy and their effect on the safety of the mother and baby."

            "textblock": "The dramatic impact of potent combination antiretroviral therapies on the course of HIV\n      disease has made the use of PIs routine in the care of HIV-1-infected individuals.\n      Combination therapy likewise has become the standard of care in pregnant individuals, even\n      though information on use of these drugs during human pregnancy is limited. There are no\n      published prospective evaluations of toxicities experienced by pregnant women on\n      PI-containing antiretroviral regimens, despite findings of metabolic disturbances of\n      glucose, fatty acids, and cholesterol, as well as lactic acidosis/hepatic steatosis in\n      nonpregnant individuals treated with antiretrovirals. Gastrointestinal (GI) side effects\n      also are well documented in nonpregnant individuals treated with PIs, but have not been\n      systematically evaluated in pregnancy. In addition, the physiologic changes brought about by\n      pregnancy may influence the pharmacokinetics, safety, and side effects of antiretroviral\n      drugs. There remains a need for further evaluation of the use of antiretrovirals during\n      pregnancy and their impact on maternal, fetal, and infant safety.\n\n      Patients are stratified according to whether or not they are on a PI-containing\n      antiretroviral regimen and the number of weeks of gestation (26 weeks or less versus greater\n      than 26 weeks). Patients are followed at 8-week intervals from the time of entry until\n      delivery or pregnancy termination, with an additional visit at 12 weeks after delivery or\n      pregnancy termination. All infants born to study participants are evaluated at the time of\n      delivery (anthropometrics and HIV DNA PCR) and are seen again at the mothers' 12-week\n      post-delivery visit. Glucose tolerance testing and other metabolic studies are performed\n      serially during pregnancy and again postpartum. This is an observational study and drugs are\n      not supplied. Patients receiving antiretroviral therapy must obtain their own medications."

The father of the\n             baby, if available, also must give consent.\n\n          -  Have taken the same anti-HIV drugs, including a PI, during the 8 weeks just before\n             study entry. If not taking a PI or any anti-HIV drug, must not have taken a PI during\n             the 8 weeks just before study entry.

Patients who have had diabetes caused by pancreas problems or steroid\n             use in the past, but now have normal blood sugar without having to take drugs or\n             special diets, are allowed. Patients who have had blood sugar problems in a past\n             pregnancy also are allowed.\n\n          -  Had a serious infection or medical condition within 30 days before study entry.\n\n          -  Are enrolled in another study which requires a lot of blood tests.\n\n          -  Take, or have taken in the 6 weeks before study entry, any of the following drugs:\n             hormones (growth hormone, testosterone, or steroids), thalidomide, interleukins or\n             interferons, efavirenz, hydroxyurea, drugs to control blood sugar, and anti-cancer\n             drugs.\n\n          -  Take, or have taken in the year before study entry, steroids, e.g., prednisone, for\n             more than 14 days in any 3-month period. Inhaled steroids and steroid\n             creams/ointments are allowed.\n\n          -  Take, or have taken in the 30 days before study entry, PIs with lovastatin or\n             simvastatin (2 drugs that lower the amount of fat in the blood).\n\n          -  Have an ultrasound showing a major abnormality in the baby.\n\n          -  Have problems with their pregnancy and/or are expecting more than 1 baby.\n\n          -  Abuse drugs or alcohol."
