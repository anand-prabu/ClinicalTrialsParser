      The main objectives is evaluate to safety and efficacy of oral Reconnect ® (food supplement
      composed by NADH, Coenzyme Q10, serine y vitamin C) in the maximum heart rate variability
      during ergometric test in CFS patients.

    <textblock>
      Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) is a serious, complex and extremely debilitating chronic
      illness, but often misunderstood characterized by prolonged fatigue, the hallmark of the
      condition and multiple nonspecific symptoms. The World Health Organization has recognized
      CFS as a disease that affecting the nervous system (ICD-10 G93.3) and multiple body systems.
      The etiology is unknown. Previous studies have demonstrated in CFS patients a significant
      reduction in plasma and intracellular Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells concentrations of
      CoQ10 and NADH, which correlate with clinical symptoms of the disease. Hypothesis:
      Supplementation with CoQ10 plus NADH could be beneficial in the improvement of clinical and
      molecular parameters in this disease. The primary endpoint is to evaluate the efficacy of
      oral Reconnect ® suplementation in CFS patients in the variations of the maximum heart rate
      during the exercise test. The secondary endpoint are to evaluate the effect of Reconnect ®
      suplementation at maximum load reached during the exercise test, maximum oxygen consumption,
      maximum C02 production, perception of fatigue assessed by the FIS, pain perception; McGill
      Pain Index questionnaire, and sleep dysfunction; Pittsburgh Sleep Index Questionnaire.

      Patients and Methods: A total of 80 consecutive women patients with a diagnosis of CFS
      according to the 1994 CDC Fukuda's case definition criteria were initially evaluated and
      enrolled in this study. The majority were excluded for no meet the inclusion criteria of the
      study. All subjects are treatment with ReConnect® containing NADH plus CoQ10 versus placebo.
      Fatigue, pain and sleep disturbances are scored using the Fatigue Impact Scale, McGill Pain
      Questionnaire and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, respectively.

      Discussion: To our knowledge, no previous studies have yet evaluated the effectiveness of
      oral ReConnect supplementation in CFS patients. ReConnect containing the combination of
      CoQ10 plus NADH and other nutrients (phosphoserine/serine and Vitamin C) can help to improve
      clinical symptoms and restore mitochondrial function and oxidative stress damage reducing
      fatigue, pain and sleep impairments in CFS patients. The combination of these supplements
      can result in a safe and effective therapy to reduce fatigue, chronic pain and help restore
      quality of life of CFS patients.

    <description>Researchers hypothesize that the low Heart Rate Variability in CFS is tied to the brain via the autonomic nervous system, which regulates the body's automatic functions. Dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system is called dysautonomia and is believed to be a feature of CFS patients.</description>
