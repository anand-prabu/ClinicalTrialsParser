We\n      will collect baseline ethnographic and survey data from approximately 27 IDU or MSM sites in\n      India.  We will use baseline data to select 22 sites for the trial (12 IDU and 10 MSM) and\n      to stratify sites according to key baseline characteristics.  We will perform stratified\n      randomization to assign sites to either the ICC intervention or to standard services.  ICCs,\n      which will be either IDU or MSM-focused, will provide an accepting atmosphere in which\n      members of vulnerable groups can drop-in, receive rapid HIV voluntary counselling and\n      testing, risk reduction counseling and services, and antiretroviral therapy.  ICCs will be\n      scaled-up from existing governmental or non-governmental organizations and services provided\n      at ICCs will be supported by the National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) of India.  After\n      providing services in communities for two years, we will conduct an evaluation survey (with\n      biological and behavioral measures) of approximately 1000 subjects in the target populations\n      in each of the 22 study sites.  Integrated care centers have the potential to improve access\n      to HIV prevention and treatment services among vulnerable, high-risk populations."
