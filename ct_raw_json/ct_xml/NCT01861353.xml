  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cranberry and cranberry-lingonberry juice prevented urinary tract infections in children and
      in adults in our earlier clinical trials. The preventive effect was, however, observed late
      in the follow-up and the next recurrence was not prevented in children. The investigators
      hypothesize that cranberry-lingonberry juice should be started already during the
      antimicrobial treatment of acute urinary tract infection in order to maximize the preventive
      efficacy of the juice. In addition, the investigators aim to find the explanation for the
      efficacy of cranberry-lingonberry juice by analyzing the concomitant changes in the chemical
      composition of urine and feces as well as the changes of gut microbiota.

    <description>Cranberry-lingonberry juice. Cranberry 12.8%, Lingonberry 12.4%, together 38g/l, contains added sugars 10g/dL.
Dose is 5 mL/kg/day, max. 300 ml/day per day. Juice was manufactured and donated by Eckes-Granini, Finland</description>

    <description>Contains no cranberry or lingonberry extracts. Added sugars 10g/dL (same as in the active juice group). Contains natural cranberry flavour and red anthocyanin colour. Contains 5.5 g/L citric acid. Has been tested by chemists and does not contains PAC-compounds which are thought to be the main active compound in cranberry juice.
Placebo juice was manufactured by Eckes-Granini. Dose is 5 mL/kg/day, max. 300 mL/day.</description>
