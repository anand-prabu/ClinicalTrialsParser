Participants with DSRCT in the abdomen\n      and/or pelvis or with tumor that cannot be removed by surgery alone or has spread to other\n      parts of the body will be included in Group B.

Doxorubicin will be omitted following a total cumulative dose of 375\n      mg/m^2. Local control measures (surgery and/or radiation therapy) will be instituted after 6\n      courses of chemotherapy.  Total duration of treatment is approximately 29 weeks.\n\n      Group B:\n\n      Participants eligible for the window therapy will receive two courses (21 days duration\n      each) of mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan.\n      Irinotecan (20 mg/m^2) will be administered IV on a protracted schedule of daily for 5 days,\n      2 days off, repeated daily x 5 [(qdx5)x2], temozolomide (100 mg/m^2) PO daily x 5 days and\n      temsirolimus 35 mg/m^2 IV weekly on day 1 and 8.  Following window treatment (weeks 1 - 6),\n      participants will proceed to induction chemotherapy (weeks 7 - 33) consisting of interval\n      compressed (every 2 weeks) alternating courses of chemotherapy with vincristine,\n      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) with ifosfamide and etoposide (IE).

Local control measures\n      (surgery and/or radiation therapy) will be instituted after 6 courses of induction\n      chemotherapy (week 19).  Participants whose tumors respond to window therapy will receive\n      temsirolimus, temozolomide and irinotecan at weeks 29 and 31 in place of ifosfamide and\n      etoposide.
