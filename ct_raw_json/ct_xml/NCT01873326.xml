  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about the safety and effectiveness of two different
      drug combinations in patients who have intermediate- and poor-risk germ cell tumors (GCT).
      One combination of drugs, paclitaxel, ifosfamide and cisplatin (TIP), is experimental. The
      other combination of drugs, bleomycin, etoposide and cisplatin (BEP), is the standard of
      care treatment for intermediate- and poor-risk germ cell tumors. However, BEP does not cure
      every patient and therefore newer treatments are needed.

    <description>Favorable best response is defined as complete response or partial response with negative tumor markers. Patients will be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint of favorable response within the first 6 months if they complete at least 3 cycles of study treatment (without switch to an alternative chemotherapy regimen) and achieve a confirmed partial response with negative markers or confirmed complete response (considered as favorable responses). Patients will also be considered evaluable for the primary endpoint if they develop disease progression during the treatment portion of the study regardless of how many cycles of chemotherapy they  received or if they achieve an incomplete response after completion of study treatment (considered as not having a favorable response).&quot;</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patients ≥ 18 years of age.

        - Patients with newly diagnosed GCT

          -  Pathology confirmation of GCT histology at MSKCC or a collaborating treating
             institution. In exceptional circumstances, patients without pathological diagnosis
             may be included in the study following discussion with the national principal
             investigator, Dr. Feldman,(or national Co-PI or MSKCC Co-PI if the national PI is
             unavailable) if they meet the one of the following criteria:

               -  Patients with a testicular mass (detected clinically and/or by ultrasound),
                  and/or mediastinal or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy or pineal tumor AND
                  elevated serum tumor markers (HCG and/or AFP). Patients with elevated LDH only
                  will not be included without pathological confirmation of GCT since LDH is a
                  nonspecific marker for GCT and could potentially be elevated in other
                  malignancies such as lymphomas.

        This is because patients may present with a clinical scenario consistent with GCT
        (elevated serum tumor markers, testicular mass and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy) with a
        concurrent life-threatening oncologic emergency that require immediate treatment. In this
        case, initial treatment without biopsy confirmation is usually recommended and tissue
        confirmation may be obtained after initiating therapy.

          -  Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease.

          -  Patients who received prior radiation therapy (RT) for treatment of germ cell tumor
             are eligible for this study as long as there is evidence of progressive disease
             determined by tumor markers or other sites of metastases outside of the radiated
             site. Radiation must be completed prior to starting chemotherapy with the exception
             of brain metastases where chemotherapy and radiation can be given concurrently.
             Toxicity from radiation must have recovered to grade 1 or less prior to initiating
             chemotherapy.

          -  Patients must have recovered from prior surgery based on treating physician's
             discretion.

          -  Patients of reproductive potential must agree to use effective contraception during
             the period of therapy

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Diffusion lung capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin ≥60%
             predicted, except if related to high volume metastatic GCT to the lungs in which case
             there is no minimum DLCO requirement. In rare cases, such patients who may not be
             able to undergo PFT testing due to the severity of their presentation. Since there is
             no minimum DLCO for these patients, under these extraordinary circumstances, this
             will be allowed. Patients in this situation will be expected to receive
             disease-stabilizing chemotherapy.

          -  Laboratory criteria for protocol entry (obtained ≤ 14 days before initiation of
             therapy):

               -  WBC ≥ 3000/UL and Platelet count ≥ 100,000/UL

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 mg/dL or estimated GFR (by Cockcroft-Gault) ≥50mL/min or
                  12 or 24 hour urine creatinine clearance ≥ 50 mL/min, unless renal insufficiency
                  is due to tumoral ureteral obstruction in which case eligibility will be
                  determined by national the principal investigator (or national co-PI or MSKCC
                  co-PI if the national PI is unavailable) with notification of the MSKCC IRB.

               -  AST/ALT ≤ 3 x ULN and total bilirubin ≤ 2.0 x ULN. In the setting of metastatic
                  disease to the liver, AST/ALT may be ≤5x ULN and total bilirubin ≤2.5 x ULN. If
                  a patient is known or suspected to have Gilbert's disease, total bilirubin up to

                  ≤2.5 x ULN is allowed..

        Patients must be classified as having intermediate or poor-risk NSGCT, as follows:

        o Intermediate-risk (Modified*)

        a) Testis or retroperitoneal primary with lymph node and/or lung metastasis but without
        non-pulmonary visceral metastasis AND any of the following pretreatment serum tumor marker
        (STM) values:

        i. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) from 3 to &lt;10 x ULN (*This differs from the original IGCCCG
        criteria which includes patients with LDH from 1.5 to 10 x ULN).

        ii. Serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) from 5,000 to &lt; 50,000 MIU/mL

        iii. Serum alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) from 1,000 to &lt;10,000 ng/mL

          -  Seminoma histology regardless the primary site or serum tumor markers with any
             non-pulmonary visceral metastasis (liver, bone, brain, etc)

               -  Poor-risk (any of the following):

                    1. Testis or retroperitoneal primary with non-pulmonary visceral metastasis
                       (liver, bone, brain, etc) regardless the STM values.

                    2. Mediastinal primary site of disease regardless the presence/absence of
                       visceral metastasis or STM values.

                    3. Testis or retroperitoneal primary without non-pulmonary visceral metastasis
                       but with poor-risk STM values: i. LDH ≥ 10 x ULN ii. HCG ≥ 50,000 MIU/mL
                       iii. AFP ≥ 10,000 ng/mL

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any prior chemotherapy. The only exception will be patients with a history of stage I
             seminoma treated with adjuvant carboplatin for 1 or 2 cycles.

          -  Concurrent treatment with any cytotoxic therapy.

          -  Known concurrent malignancy (except for non-melanoma skin cancer).

          -  Patients known to be HIV positive and receiving HAART.

          -  Presence of an active infection. Patients with fever assessed to be &quot;tumor fever&quot; but
             without active evidence of infection (e.g. blood cultures are negative) are eligible.
             In addition, patients who have an infection but without evidence of fever for 48
             hours on antibiotics will be eligible.

          -  Inability to comply with the treatment protocol or to undergo prespecified follow-up
             tests for safety or effectiveness.

          -  Pregnant patients are ineligible
