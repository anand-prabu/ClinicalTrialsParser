      The investigators hypothesize that conventional or EBUS-TBNA will have equal efficiency in
      diagnosing sarcoidosis when performed in conjunction with endobronchial and transbronchial
      lung biopsy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic procedures like transbronchial lung biopsy (TBLB), transbronchial needle
      aspiration (TBNA) and endobronchial biopsy (EBB) are routinely used to obtain pathological
      confirmation of pulmonary sarcoidosis. Real-time convex probe endobronchial
      ultrasound-guided TBNA (EBUS-TBNA) has shown immense potential, however it is costly, labor
      intensive and still has limited availability, especially in low and middle income countries.
      In the past, TBLB has been the bronchoscopic procedure of choice for diagnosis of
      sarcoidosis however currently its role is being debated with the advent of EBUS. We have
      observed that EBUS even though has high yield yet the optimal diagnosis is obtained only
      when combined with EBB and TBLB. The investigators hypothesize that conventional or
      EBUS-TBNA will have equal efficiency in diagnosing sarcoidosis when performed in conjunction
      with endobronchial and transbronchial lung biopsy.

      The study compares the diagnostic yield of EBUS-TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) vs. conventional
      TBNA (plus EBB and TBLB) for diagnosis of sarcoidosis.
