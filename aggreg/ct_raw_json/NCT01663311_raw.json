            "textblock": "Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or\n      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with\n      the ability to lead a normal life. Treatment remains difficult. Most available therapies\n      focus on habituation rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus has been shown to be generated\n      in the brain, as a result of functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and\n      tonotopic maps in the central auditory system. Low-frequency rTMS applied to the\n      temporoparietal areas has been investigated for the treatment of hyperexcitability disorders\n      such as auditory hallucinations and tinnitus. Pilot data indicate that taking into account\n      affective components of the multiple overlapping neural networks responsible for the\n      generation of a bothersome subjective tinnitus might enhance the efficacy of Repetitive\n      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment in chronic tinnitus. A newly developed\n      coil, the so-called double cone coil will be examined with regard to feasibility, safety and\n      clinical efficacy in patients suffering from chronic tinnitus in a controlled pilot trial."
