    <textblock>
      The main goal of the study is to evaluate if the ad libitum use of the THS 2.2 Menthol for 5
      days in confinement and after 85 days of product use in an ambulatory setting, by Japanese
      adult healthy smokers results in a reduction in the levels of biomarkers of exposure for
      selected harmful and potentially harmful smoke constituents (HPHCs) compared to smokers
      continuing smoking their own preferred brand of menthol conventional cigarette (mCC) and
      smoking abstinence (SA).
