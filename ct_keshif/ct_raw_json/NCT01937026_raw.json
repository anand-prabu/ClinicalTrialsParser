The study doctor will measure the amount of\n      baricitinib that is absorbed into the blood stream and the time that it takes to remove\n      baricitinib from the body.  The safety and tolerability of these drugs will be studied.  The\n      study will last about 18 days from the first dose to the end of the study (not including\n      screening.)"
