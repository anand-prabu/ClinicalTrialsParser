It\n           is normally necessary to use one diagnostic catheter and guiding catheter in primary\n           percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST elevation myocardial infarction\n           (STEMI). It is unknown whether using a single guiding catheter for both nonculprit and\n           culprit vessel angiography and intervention during transradial primary percutaneous\n           coronary intervention (PCI) is feasible.\n\n        2. objective:The aim of this study is to investigate the feasibility of using a single\n           guiding catheter for left and right coronary angiography and intervention in patients\n           with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI).\n\n        3. This was a single-center, prospective, randomized study,patients with STEMI indicated\n           for transradial primary PCI were randomized into two groups : group I consisted of\n           patients who underwent coronary angiography and primary PCI by using a single guiding\n           catheter.GroupII included patients who first underwent coronary angiography with\n           diagnostic catheter followed by guiding catheter selection for intervention.\n\n        4. the primary Endpoints\n\n           a.Cath Lab door to balloon time (C2B)\n\n        5. the Secondary endpoints:\n\n             1.
