      Following a small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the
      current study will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (n=60) that will compare
      BATD to Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, contact with positive reinforcement
      in the environment, treatment satisfaction, therapeutic alliance, and perceived stigma. In
      addition, participants' adherence rates to each of the therapies and their maintenance of
      clinical gains at a 1-month follow-up, will be examined.

      Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is highly prevalent and widely-impairing across racial and
      ethnic groups. Higher rates of MDD have been observed among Latinos with limited
      English-language proficiency relative to the general population. Although MDD is a highly
      treatable condition, barriers to treatment access and delivery have been implicated in
      precluding this group from utilizing and receiving mental health services. Fortunately,
      Latinos tend to endorse positive attitudes toward psychosocial treatments for depression by
      applying the valued belief of &quot;poner de su parte&quot; or being able to do their part in one's
      recovery, a concept that is highly consistent with the framework of behavioral treatments
      for depression.

      The Behavioral Activation Treatment for Depression (BATD), based on reinforcement theory,
      may be well-equipped to address disparities associated with higher depression prevalence
      rates and receipt of care among Latinos with limited English-language proficiency. Following
      a small, open-label pilot study that yielded very promising results of BATD, the current
      study will consist of a larger, randomized control trial (N = 60) that will compare BATD to
      Supportive Counseling in outcomes of depression, activity level, and contact with positive
      reinforcement in the environment.

      Initial eligibility will be determined via a telephone screener, which will include
      questions from the Mood Disorders, Substance Use and Dependence, and Psychotic Disorders
      modules of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR (SCID-IV; First, Spitzer, Gibbon
      &amp; Williams, 2002).

      Inclusion criteria consist of the following: 1) be a minimum of 18 years of age, 2) be of
      Latino descent, 3) report limited English language proficiency, 4) meet current MDD
      criteria, 5) have completed the 4th grade or higher either in their country of origin or in
      the US, 6) not have current substance abuse or dependence, 7) have no Bipolar or Psychotic
      Disorders, and 9) not be currently receiving psychotherapy, and 10) if currently taking
      antidepressants, demonstrate pharmacological stability as indicated by 3 or more consecutive
      months of use. Excluded individuals will be referred to mental health resources within the
      community.
