In primigravid women, if contractions have not commenced after 2 doses, the dosage may be increased to 50mcg every 2 hours. Once in labour (regular painful contractions with a cervical dilatation of at least 4cm) no more misoprostol will be used and artificial membrane rupture and/or oxytocin infusion will be used as clinically indicated.  If labour has still not commenced after 24 hours, they will be deemed to have a 'failed induction' and the decision on further management will be made by the clinical team (their choice could include the use of repeat misoprostol, Foley catheter, dinoprostone, caesarean section or delay as deemed appropriate)."

If the Foley catheter falls out within 12h, membranes will be ruptured and/or oxytocin infusion started.   If the Foley catheter does not fall out within 12h, it will be removed at 12h and oxytocin commenced with an artificial rupture of membrane when possible.

            "textblock": "Between 40,000 and 80,000 pregnant women die annually from pre-eclampsia and eclampsia.\n      Magnesium sulphate and anti-hypertensive therapies can reduce the morbidity associated with\n      pre-eclampsia. The only cure, however, comes with delivery.  Prompt delivery of the baby,\n      preferably by vaginal route, is vital in order to achieve good maternal and neonatal\n      outcomes. Induction of labour is therefore a critical intervention in order to prevent\n      morbidity to both mother and baby.  Two low cost interventions - oral misoprostol tablets\n      and transcervical Foley catheterization - are already used by some in low resource settings,\n      but their relative risks and benefits are not known. These interventions could optimize the\n      care pathway for women needing induction of labour. This is especially important in low\n      resource settings where improvement is most needed and the potential to reduce the maternal\n      and neonatal mortality and morbidity is the greatest. The ideal induction agent would result\n      in a relatively short induction to delivery interval without risk to fetus and with low\n      rates of emergency caesarean section. The induction to delivery interval is especially\n      important in pre-eclampsia and eclampsia where the condition may deteriorate rapidly until\n      delivery.  Inductions with prostaglandins, including misoprostol, are sometimes associated\n      with uterine hyperstimulation and consequent fetal hypoxia, whilst the effectiveness and\n      safety of Foley catheter as an induction agent has been persistently questioned. This study\n      will identify the risk, benefits and trade-offs in efficacy, safety, acceptability and cost\n      of these two low cost induction methods."
