Approximately 70% of all MM patients receive one or more radiotherapies in\n      the course of their illness. The relief of pain is obtained in 75 - 100%. Recalcification is\n      achieved in 40 - 50% of the irradiated bone destructions.There were a lot of randomized\n      trials showed the same effect of single (SF) and multiple fractions (MF) in pain relief and\n      recalcification for patients with painful bone metastases from solid tumors. The role of\n      different palliative radiotherapeutic regimens for MM is not well established due to lack of\n      clinical trials. Our prospective study analyzed the effect of two different radiotherapeutic\n      regimens in the treatment of MM on pain relief, analgesics consumption and recalcification."
