  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema, is the most common inflammatory skin disorder
      of children, affecting 10-20% of children and 1-2% of adults.

      This skin disorder can be associated with unbearable itchiness and an increased
      susceptibility to skin infections.  The cause of AD is currently poorly understood;
      therefore, there are no targeted treatment options at present. There have been recent
      studies in adults with AD that explain the cause and give us new routes to investigate
      treatment options, however no major studies in this arena have been done in children. We
      hope to evaluate the skin and blood biomarkers that are found in pediatric AD and compare
      them to adult AD.

      Hypothesis: The immune system worsens the skin barrier issues that are common in atopic
      dermatitis. We believe there are similar immune and skin abnormalities in adult versus
      pediatric atopic dermatitis. Finally, blood levels of the activated molecules in atopic
      dermatitis can serve as surrogates for skin immune activation and will correlate with
      disease severity.

      Objectives:

        1. To define the cellular and molecular biomarkers of atopic dermatitis in skin biopsies
           and blood samples from a pre-adolescent pediatric population and correlate it with
           disease severity.

        2. To measure the skin barrier in atopic dermatitis.

        3. To determine quality of life in atopic dermatitis through various questionnaires.

        Subjects will be recruited at Ann and Robert H. Lurie Children's Hospital of Chicago
        Division of Dermatology outpatient clinics.

        Subjects will be between the ages of 3 months to 12 years old. Both male and female
        subjects will be recruited.

        A total of 30 subjects with moderate to severe AD, and 30 age-matched and sex-matched
        healthy (no evidence of atopy: atopic dermatitis, asthma, or allergic rhinitis) controls
        will be enrolled to obtain blood samples.

        20 children with moderate to severe AD and 20 age-and sex-matched healthy (no evidence of
        atopy: atopic dermatitis, asthma, or allergic rhinitis) controls will be enrolled to
        obtain skin biopsies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects may be of either sex and must be between the ages of 3 months and 12 years
             at the time of enrollment (controls and AD patients)

          -  Controls may have no inflammatory disease or atopy (urticaria, food allergy, allergic
             rhinitis or conjunctivitis, asthma)

          -  Controls for skin sampling may have no observable abnormality in the sampled skin
             and, to further assure the normality of the &quot;normal&quot; skin edges, must not have
             evidence of inflammation or epidermal change in the lesion to be surgically removed

          -  Subjects have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, (assessed by Scoring Atopic
             Dermatitis (SCORAD) clinical tool with a score of greater than 25), with either new
             onset disease within the last 6 months or with an acute exacerbation of AD

          -  Subjects should not have administered systemic immunosuppressant therapy in the month
             before the study

          -  Subjects should not use more potent topical steroids in the week before the study,
             but may use class IV-VII topical steroids or calcineurin inhibitors in the week prior
             to blood and biopsy sampling

          -  Subjects should not have applied topical immunomodulators (steroid or calcineurin
             inhibitors) to the planned biopsy sites and the surrounding 4-5 cm of skin within 1
             week of the biopsy

          -  Subject should not have applied emollients to the planned biopsy sites within 12
             hours before biopsy, but can have been applied elsewhere

          -  Subjects and guardians of minors must sign Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
             consent form(s) prior to initiation of the study protocol

          -  Subjects who have mild atopic dermatitis (assessed by SCORAD questionnaire by study
             personnel and with a score of less than 25)

          -  Subjects who administered anti-inflammatory systemic and topical therapy or
             emollients that do not comply with inclusion criteria prior to blood and biopsy
             sampling
