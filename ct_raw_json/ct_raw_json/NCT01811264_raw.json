The paper-based PPA uses adult learning principles to limit and\n      sequence plain language messages that have been framed from a patient's perspective. The PPA\n      uses theory-based design to increase patients' involvement in the medical visit by modeling\n      - through text and images - how a patient can: 1) set the visit agenda, 2) formulate\n      questions, and 3) assert personal preferences. The specific aims of this study are to: 1-\n      Assess the effectiveness of the PPA to increase patient involvement during clinical\n      encounters. 2- Evaluate the effectiveness of the PPA to improve patient psychosocial\n      outcomes. 3- Explore if the effect of the PPA varies by patients' literacy skills. To\n      achieve this aims, the investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial to evaluate\n      the PPA among patients with a new diagnosis or progression of metastatic breast cancer at\n      two cancer centers that serve diverse patient populations."
