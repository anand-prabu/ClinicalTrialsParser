      Of the three most commonly/routinely performed surgical technique of patellar resection
      during total knee arthroplasty performed at the Mayo Clinic, which results in the most
      symmetrically resected patella (knee-cap)?

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resection of the patella to prepare it for placement of a patellar prosthesis  is a
      procedure that is performed routinely in the vast majority of total knee arthroplasties
      (TKA) in the United States and at the Mayo Clinic.  This procedure is performed by a number
      of different techniques that have been proved to be safe and effective.  Despite this,
      patellar instability, tilt, obliquity, and maltracking are all possible complications of
      improperly resected patellae during TKA.  The goals of resection are to create a patella
      that is symmetrical, absent of obliquity (slanting), and thick enough to receive a patellar
      prosthesis. Although outcomes are generally good for most described methods, to date, little
      has been published regarding direct comparison of these methods.

      A total of 90 patients undergoing TKA with planned patellar resection will be randomized to
      have their patella resected by one of three methods during primary TKA: 1) use of a cutting
      guide, 2) haptic feedback, or 3) free-hand resection guided by four quadrant measurements.
      There will be three experienced fellowship trained arthroplasty surgeons (hip and
      knee)performing the procedures who are all familiar and experienced with each of the three
      techniques being investigated.  Each surgeon will, within a group of 30 of their patients,
      perform a total 10 resections using each of the three methods listed above (30 resections
      per surgeon for a total of 90 resections). The patients will be randomized (like the flip of
      a coin) to one of the three resection techniques.

      Before and after resection measurements of knee-cap thickness will be taken and used to
      determine patellar symmetry.  The resulting symmetry of each of the three techniques will
      then be compared between and within each of the three techniques and surgeons.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the three resection techniques most commonly used at
      the Mayo Clinic to determine which surgical procedure results in the most symmetrically
      resected patella.

    <description>The vast majority of total knee replacement instrument sets include the option of using a patellar guide to resect the patella, and the guide/jig is typically supplied with the instruments.  The guide is clamped onto the patella and tightened so that it remains stable.  The guide has a slot that allows insertion of a standard sagittal saw blade, and this slot guides the blade as it is advanced across the patella.  The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved.  Additional resection may be performed as needed.</description>

    <description>This is likely the most commonly used method of patellar resection in the US, although its prevalence has never been formally studied.  It consists of a free hand cut (no guide used) with a standard sagittal saw that is oriented based on osteo-cartilaginous landmarks and haptic palpation of the patella by the surgeon.  The resection thickness/obliquity can be altered based on haptic feedback of the patella. The thickness is then measured in the center of the patella to ensure that the resection goal is achieved.  Additional resection may be performed as needed.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Resection is performed in a free handed fashion (similar to haptic feedback method), but after resection, the thickness of the patella is measured separately in all four quadrants (superolateral, superomedial, inferomedial, and inferolateral).  Additional resection is performed as needed based on the quadrant measurements and the measurements are repeated after each resection until satisfactory resection thickness and symmetry are obtained.</description>
