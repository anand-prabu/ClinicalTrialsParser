    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of standard of care
      therapy (docetaxel) with or without the addition of 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan (referred to as
      indoximod) an experimental drug to find out which treatment is better.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that 232,340 US women will be diagnosed with and 40,030 women will die of
      breast cancer in 2013. Metastatic breast cancer is a terminal condition and treatments are
      palliative in nature. The median survival for patients with metastatic breast cancer is
      approximately 2.5 years. The standard therapies currently in use include anti-estrogen
      therapies (anastrazole, letrozole, fulvestrant, tamoxifen), chemotherapy agents (taxanes,
      capecitabine, navelbine, gemcitabine, eribulin, ixabepilone), targeted therapies
      (trastuzumab, lapatinib), and supportive care agents (zolendronic acid, denosumab). While
      breast cancer typically responds well to treatment, the response is transient and their
      disease becomes more refractory with continued therapy. Also, quality of life is a
      significant issue for these patients as many of these therapies are associated with
      significant side effects. Well tolerated, novel agents which improve the efficacy of
      existing chemotherapy agents would prove quite useful in managing metastatic breast cancer.

      Preclinical data derived from MMTV-Neu mice with autochthonous tumors studied the
      interaction between indoximod and various chemotherapeutic agents. Mice with 5-10mm tumors
      were enrolled into control and treatment groups. Mice were treated with indoximod alone,
      chemotherapy alone (paclitaxel, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, and others), and the
      combination of indoximod and chemotherapy. treatment with indoximod or paclitaxel alone
      caused retardation of tumor growth in this model but no regressions were seen. the
      combination of indoximod plus paclitaxel caused 30% tumor regression and histologically
      there was significantly enhanced tumor cell death with the combination versus either agent
      alone. This synergism was abrogated when the mice underwent CD4+ T cell depletion prior to
      treatment with the combination, suggesting the immune response played a role in the observed
      effect. Based on this data and other reports suggesting systemic immunomodulating drugs like
      indoximod can synergize with chemotherapy agents such as taxanes, the decision was made to
      devise this combination of therapy of docetaxel with indoximod in metastatic breast cancer.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed estrogen/progesterone receptors (ER/PR)
             +/-; human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-, metastatic breast cancer.

          -  Measureable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately measured
             in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for non-nodal lesions and
             short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional techniques or as ≥10 mm
             with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Any number of prior endocrine therapies in the metastatic setting are allowed. The
             patient must not have received any prior chemotherapy agents in the metastatic
             setting. Prior treatment with adjuvant docetaxel is allowed if disease relapse
             occurred greater than 12 months from the completion of adjuvant therapy.

          -  Age ≥18 years.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤1 (Karnofsky ≥60%).

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 4 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below: leukocytes
             ≥3,000/mcL, absolute neutrophil count ≥1,500/mcL, platelets ≥100,000/mcL, total
             bilirubin within normal institutional limits,  aspartate aminotransferase AST(SGOT)/
             alanine aminotransferase ALT(SGPT) ≤2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal,
             creatinine within normal institutional limits OR creatinine clearance ≥60 mL/min/1.73
             m^2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal.

          -  Patients with known brain metastases will only be eligible after their tumors have
             been treated with definitive resection and/or radiotherapy and they are
             neurologically stable for at least 1 month off steroids.

          -  Male and female subjects of child producing potential must agree to use adequate
             forms of contraception or avoidance of pregnancy measures prior to study entry, while
             enrolled on study and for a minimum of one month after completion of the study.

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 3 weeks (6 weeks for
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not
             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 3 weeks earlier.

          -  Patients who are currently receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known active, untreated brain metastases should be excluded from this
             clinical trial. Those with previously treated inactive brain metastases with no
             evidence of active disease documented on brain MRI at least 4 weeks after radiation
             and off all steroids may be eligible.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to docetaxel or tryptophan containing substances. This would include
             L-tryptophan or 5-hydroxy-tryptophan supplements. Also patients with a history of
             severe hypersensitivity reactions to docetaxel or to other drugs formulated with
             polysorbate 80 are excluded.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan is an
             immunoregulatory agent with the potential for abortifacient effects due to fetal
             rejection by the maternal immune system. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             1-Methyl-D-tryptophan, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated
             with 1-Methyl-D-tryptophan. Also, docetaxel is a category D cytotoxic agent and is
             not administered to pregnant females.

          -  Known HIV-positive patients and those with other acquired/inherited
             immunodeficiencies are ineligible due to the possibility of affecting the response to
             indoximod and the higher risk of active opportunistic infections.

          -  Patients with more than one active malignancy at the time of enrollment.

          -  Patients who have received any prior experimental active immunotherapy consisting of
             targeted monoclonal antibodies (ipilimumab) or pharmaceutical compounds are excluded.

          -  Patients with any active autoimmune disease (i.e. psoriasis, extensive atopic
             dermatitis, asthma, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), multiple sclerosis (M.S.),
             uveitis, vasculitis), chronic inflammatory condition, or any condition requiring
             concurrent use of any systemic immunosuppressants or steroids for any reason would be
             excluded from the study. Any patient with an allo-transplant of any kind would be
             excluded as well. This would include those with a xenograft heart valve to avoid the
             potential risk of any immune reaction causing valvular degeneration.
             Mild-intermittent asthma requiring only occasional beta-agonist inhaler use or mild
             localized eczema will not be excluded.
