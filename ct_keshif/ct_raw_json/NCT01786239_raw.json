            "textblock": "This study looks to investigate whether patients with schizophrenia for 2 years or less may\n      benefit from omega-3 supplements. The main hypothesis to be tested in this study is that\n      white matter integrity assessed with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and erythrocyte membrane\n      omega-3 concentration may provide the means for identifying patients most likely to derive\n      clinical benefit from omega-3 supplementation.\n\n      To test this hypothesis the investigators will enroll 58 patients with recent-onset\n      schizophrenia into a 16-week long randomized double blind placebo-controlled study of\n      risperidone versus risperidone plus omega-3 supplementation. Study assessments after consent\n      will include a baseline MRI and an MRI at the final visit, blood-work, clinical interviews\n      to assess symptoms, and medical assessments for side effects. DTI exams and peripheral\n      omega-3 concentration will be obtained prior to the initiation of treatment and the primary\n      outcome measure will be the total Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale Score.\n\n      Specific aims are:\n\n        -  To examine the efficacy of omega-3 fatty acids as an adjuvant agent in the treatment of\n           patients with recent-onset schizophrenia. The investigators hypothesize that patients\n           treated with omega-3 fatty acids will demonstrate greater Brief Psychiatric Rating\n           Scale (BPRS) reductions compared to the placebo group.\n\n        -  To identify whether pre-treatment fractional anisotropy (FA) assessed by DTI predicts\n           which patients will derive clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators\n           hypothesize that patients with lower fractional anisotropy will derive greater clinical\n           benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation.\n\n        -  To identify whether pre-treatment peripheral omega-3 fatty acid concentrations predict\n           which patients will derive clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acids. The investigators\n           hypothesize that patients with lower peripheral omega-3 fatty acid concentrations will\n           derive greater clinical benefit from omega-3 fatty acid supplementation."
