Recently, one polymorphic variant in MATE1 (PMT4302, g.-66T>C)\n      showed decreased promoter activity by 40-45% (p<0.01), and one MATE2-K variant (PMT5597,\n      g.-130G>A) showed increased promoter activity by 30% (p<0.05), compared to the reference.\n      Both are the most common promoter variants in each gene (the frequencies of PMT4302: 32.1%\n      and 23.1% in Caucasian and Asian; PMT5597: 26.2% and 48.5% in Caucasian and Asian)\n      (unpublished data, Giacomini group).  Specifically, the investigators will measure renal\n      clearance of metformin, and plasma glucose and insulin levels, in healthy Caucasian and\n      Asian subjects who carry either the reference or variant alleles in order to evaluate the\n      effects of these variants on metformin disposition and response."
