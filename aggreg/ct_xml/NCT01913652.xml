  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a rare group of malignant heterogenous tumors (&gt; 50
      histological subtypes, including liposarcoma, the commonest subtype of STS) with distinct
      genetic, pathological and clinical profiles, and varying patterns of tumor spread. The
      optimal cytotoxic treatment for this group of patients remains uncertain.  Single agents
      which are most effective include doxorubicin and ifosfamide, but objective response rates
      and progression-free survival times remain modest. There is clearly a need to improve
      treatment options for liposarcoma. Eribulin, a antimicrotubule agent that targets the
      protein tubulin in cells, interfering with cancer cell division and growth , has
      demonstrated activity in STS. Therefore, it is reasonable to explore whether other
      anti-microtubule agent like  cabazitaxel have a role in STS. Cabazitaxel has been shown to
      be a relatively safe, effective and tolerated. This drug has been approved by FDA for
      prostate cancer. The main objective of this trial is to determine whether cabazitaxel or
      prolonged infusional ifosfamide demonstrate sufficient antitumor activity for liposarcoma.
