            "textblock": "Chronic lower back pain (CLBP) is a significant health care issue in the United States and\n      the world. CLBP contributes to decreased quality of life, decreased function and increased\n      utilization of health care resources. The causes of CLBP tend to be multi\u2010factorial.\n      Arthropathy of the lumbar facet joints is thought to be a common etiology (15\u201045%).\n      Radiofrequency Ablation (RFA) of the medial branch nerve of the facet joint is a\n      well\u2010established treatment modality used to decrease facet joint pains. However, a wide\n      range of temperature is being used (70\u201090 degrees Celsius). In addition, the optimal\n      temperature that provides the best patient outcomes with the least side effects is not well\n      established in the pain management literature.\n\n      This study will determine if lumbar facets medial branches RFA at 90 degrees Celsius\n      provides more overall pain relief (i.e., percent of improvement), when compared to ablation\n      at 80 degrees Celsius with no additional adverse events.  Furthermore, ablation of the\n      lumbar facets nerve supply at 90 degrees Celsius will provide better improvement in the\n      functionality level, general mood and quality of life as measured by VAS ( Visual Analog\n      Scale) pain score, Pain Disability Index (PDI), McGill Pain questioner scores and Beck\n      Inventory (BI) scores as those receiving the ablation at 80 degrees Celsius. Also, it is\n      associated with less opioid consumption, no additional unwanted adverse events and/or\n      complications along with less need to repeat RFA procedure over one year period."
