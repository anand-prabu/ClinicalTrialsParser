    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, phase 1, dose escalation study with expansion cohorts
      that will evaluate the safety (establish the MTD and inform the RP2D), tolerability, PK,
      pharmacodynamics, and antitumor activity of MLN7243 in patients with advanced malignant
      solid tumors.

        Inclusion Criteria

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. Male or female patients 18 years or older.

          2. Patients must have a histologically confirmed diagnosis of an advanced, metastatic
             malignant solid tumor and must have failed or exhausted standard therapies or for
             which no standard therapy is available.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          4. Patients with adequate hematologic and organ function

          5. All patients must have radiographically detectable tumors; however, measurable
             disease as defined by RECIST (version 1.1) is not required for participation in the
             dose escalation part of this study.

          6. Patients undergoing a biopsy procedure must have accessible lesions which are safe to
             biopsy.

          7. Recovered (ie, ≤ Grade 1 toxicity) from the reversible effects of prior
             antineoplastic therapy, except alopecia.

          8. Female patients who are postmenopausal for at least 1 year before the screening
             visit, surgically sterile, or agree to practice 2 effective methods of contraception,
             at the same time, from the time of signing the informed consent form through 4 months
             after the last dose of study drug, or agree to practice true abstinence.

             Male patients who agree to practice effective barrier contraception during the entire
             study treatment period through 4 months after the last dose of study drug or agree to
             practice true abstinence.

          9. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling including PK sampling.

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. Patients with clinically significant pre-existing cardiac impairment.

          2. Patients with known active CNS lesions are excluded. Systemic antineoplastic therapy
             or investigational agents within 21 days before the first dose of study drug.

          3. Radiotherapy within 14 days before the first dose of study drug is not allowed except
             for limited field radiotherapy for palliative bone pain.

          4. For patients where tumor biopsies are required or requested:

               -  Any known coagulation abnormalities that would contraindicate the tumor biopsy
                  procedure.

               -  Ongoing therapy with any anticoagulant or antiplatelet agents (eg, aspirin,
                  clopidogrel [Plavix®], heparin, or warfarin).

          5. Major surgery within 28 days before the first dose of MLN7243.

          6. Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer.

          7. Any evidence of active infection or antibiotic therapy within 14 days before the
             first dose of MLN7243.

          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positivity or AIDS-related illness,
             hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.

          9. Patients whose weight is &lt;40 kg.

         10. History of uncontrolled sleep apnea syndrome and other conditions that could result
             in excessive daytime sleepiness, such as severe chronic obstructive pulmonary
             disease.

         11. Female patients who are lactating and breastfeeding or have a positive serum
             pregnancy test during the Screening period or a positive urine pregnancy test on Day
             1 before first dose of study drug.
