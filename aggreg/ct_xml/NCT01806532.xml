  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to investigate acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and to examine the distribution of inflammation,
      as measured by neutrophil metabolic activity.

    <description>Each patient will undergo PET-CT scans and the regional 2-18F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (18F-FDG) activity will be measured.  This is a measure of regional neutrophil metabolic activity and is used to assess inflammation in the lung. The degree of inflammation will be related to the regional expansion of the lung, as measured by CT scan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Mechanically ventilated patients scheduled to undergo a CT scanning for their routine
             clinical care

          -  More than 24 hours of mechanical ventilation

          -  Less than 15 days of mechanical ventilation if patient presents ALI/ARDS (in order to
             exclude the late, fibrotic, stage of ARDS).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age less than 18 years

          -  Hemodynamic instability, defined as: systolic blood pressure (SBP) &lt; 90mmHg without
             the use of vasopressors or inotropic agents. We will exclude from the study patients
             on vasopressors, with the exception of: dopamine up to a dose of 3 mcg/kg/min, or
             norepinephrine up to 4 mcg/min, or neosynephrine up to 40 mcg/min

          -  Hypoxemia, defined as: PaO2 &lt; 70 mmHg on an inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) greater
             than or equal to 0.9; FiO2 greater than or equal to 0.8 at baseline

          -  Patients requiring more than one vasopressor

          -  Hemodynamic and/or respiratory instability (as defined, respectively, in 2 and 3),
             that develop when the patient is mobilized during routine nursing care

          -  Any acute or chronic condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might
             confound the imaging measurements (such as, but not limited to, severe bronchospasm,
             pulmonary infection, and lung tumor)

          -  &quot;Air leaks&quot; requiring tube thoracostomy (e.g., pneumothorax, bronchopleural fistula)

          -  Pregnancy (since this is a study which would expose a fetus to radiation risk)

          -  Patients who have neither an arterial nor a central venous line at the time of the
             enrollement
