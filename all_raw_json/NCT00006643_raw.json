The\n      SPECT scan, which takes a picture of the liver, has been found to be effective in\n      determining liver damage but studies need to be done in patients with hepatitis. This study\n      will compare the effectiveness of the liver biopsy and SPECT scan in determining liver\n      disease in patients with HIV and HCV. The SPECT scan might be a good replacement for the\n      liver biopsy if it is found to be as good as or better than liver biopsies."

A direct comparison between SPECT results and\n      liver pathology has been examined in patients with liver disease other than infectious\n      hepatitis. SPECT has been found to be more accurate than standard liver-spleen scans in\n      assessing liver pathology. While current data suggest that liver pathology may correlate\n      with SPECT, which specific SPECT parameters are predictive of certain hepatic pathology is\n      unknown. The pilot study will compare SPECT parameters with the results of liver biopsies to\n      determine the limitations of SPECT.\n\n      All screened patients are registered into Step 1, in which they receive a radioactive tracer\n      injection and SPECT scan. Specific SPECT parameters will be measured to determine a grading\n      scale corresponding to that used in liver biopsy results. Some patients undergoing a second\n      liver biopsy in A5071 are enrolled into Step 2, with permission from protocol co-chairs, in\n      which a pregnancy test and second SPECT scan are performed. Patients are reimbursed for\n      completing each SPECT scan. SPECT scans or copies are reviewed to establish which parameters\n      correspond to category E of the Knodell stage based on severity of fibrosis."
