            "textblock": "Schizophrenia is a chronic and disabling illness that typically begins in the late teen and\n      early adult years.1  This illness is associated with significant impairments in areas such\n      as independent living, social functioning, and vocational functioning.2  Indeed, only 10% of\n      people with schizophrenia are employed, translating into annual lost wages of nearly 15\n      billion dollars.3,4  Schizophrenia also represents an important societal burden as this\n      illness has been estimated to cost over 40 billion dollars each year in the United States\n      alone.5\n\n      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a novel treatment for\n      neuropsychiatric illness.  A non-invasive intervention, rTMS utilizes the application of a\n      repetitively pulsed magnetic field over the scalp to induce an electric field within a\n      discrete area of the cerebral cortex.  This electric field results in altered ion flow\n      across the neuronal cellular membrane and ultimately changes in neuronal polarization.  The\n      end result is altered neuronal activity in the area of the cerebral cortex where the rTMS is\n      applied.12  rTMS is a safe and well-tolerated intervention that received FDA approval for\n      treatment refractory major depressive disorder in 2008 and has since become commonly used in\n      clinical practice.13\n\n      This study proposes to examine the application of rTMS for the treatment of cognitive\n      dysfunction in FEP.  This is an important population for study because if effective, rTMS\n      may represent a preventative treatment for the development of social and vocational\n      impairment that is associated with cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.  This study will\n      also seek to refine the understanding of the brain circuitry that mediates the potential\n      pro-cognitive effects of rTMS through the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging\n      (fMRI) at baseline and following the course of rTMS administration."
