It is recommended to propose\n      allogeneic Standard Induction and Consolidation Therapy (SCT) to all eligible patients with\n      a suitable donor and to continue imatinib with or without additional therapy in patients not\n      undergoing SCT.\n\n      This protocol is a study for newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute\n      lymphoblastic leukemia in patients aged 18 to 55 years.\n\n      The objective of this strategy is to improve the overall results in the treatment of adult\n      ALL with the addition of specific molecules to the common chemotherapeutic schedule."
