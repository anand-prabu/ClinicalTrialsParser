    <description>The primary endpoints in this study were subjective assessment of comfort and quality vision at 1-week follow-up.   Subjective assessment of comfort and overall quality of vision were performed using the Contact Lens User ExperienceTM (CLUE) questionnaire. CLUE was a validated patient-reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire to assess patient-experience attributes of soft, disposable contact lenses (comfort, vision, handling, and packaging) in a contact-lens wearing population in the US, ages 18-65. Scores follow a normal distribution with a population average score of 60 (SD 20), where higher scores indicated a more favorable/positive response with a range of 0 to 120.</description>

             -0.50 to -7.50D in each eye.

          -  The subject must be a habitual and adapted wearer of daily disposable contact lens in
             both eyes.

          -  The subject must self-report their race as Asian

          -  The subject must have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

             be discontinued).

          -  Any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact lens
             wear.

          -  Any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication that may interfere
             with contact lens wear.

             classification scale, any previous history or signs of a contact lens-related corneal
             inflammatory event (e.g., past peripheral ulcer or round peripheral scar), or any
             other ocular abnormality that may contraindicate contact lens wear.

          -  Any ocular infection.

          -  Any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable contact
             lens wear.

          -  Monovision or multi-focal contact lens correction.

          -  Participation in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14 days
