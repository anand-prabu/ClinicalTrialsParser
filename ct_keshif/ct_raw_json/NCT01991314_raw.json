            "textblock": "Iron deficiency anaemia is common in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), affecting at least\n      20% patients at any one time. Hepcidin, a recently described anti-microbial peptide\n      synthesized by the liver, is a key regulator of iron homeostasis. It interferes with\n      absorption of iron into enterocytes, macrophages and hepatocytes by binding to ferroportin.\n      Hepcidin levels rise when total body iron levels rise and protect against iron overload;\n      conversely, in iron deficiency, levels are low.  Hepcidin levels also rise under the\n      influence of interleukins (IL)-6 and -1, a factor likely to contribute to iron deficient\n      erythropoesis in active IBD. Whether hepcidin levels predict resistance to oral iron therapy\n      in IBD is unknown, though it may impair its immediate oral absorption. Adult IBD patients\n      who are anaemic report quality of life and fatigue scores comparable to those seen in\n      malignancy.\n\n      IBD diagnosed in adolescence interferes with growth, education and employment as well as\n      psychosocial and sexual development.  Not surprisingly, adolescents with IBD have a high\n      prevalence of psychological distress, particular depression. Limited historical, and our own\n      data suggest that children and adolescents with IBD are more anaemic than adults, and less\n      often treated with oral iron. What is not clear is whether the apparent under-utilisation of\n      oral iron in paediatric care is because of a perceived lack of benefit or doctors' concerns\n      about possible side effects including worsening disease activity.\n\n      To address these questions, the investigators propose a comparative study of 6 weeks of oral\n      iron supplementation in adolescents and adults with iron deficiency anaemia in IBD.\n      Patients will be given oral iron supplementation. Before and after iron therapy, the\n      investigators shall assess haemoglobin concentrations; IBD activity; quality of life (QOL),\n      perceived stress, mood and fatigue; iron metabolism, including serum hepcidin."
