Another study participant in the household\n\n               2. Pregnancy or current breastfeeding by any household member\n\n               3.

Presence of a serious congenital anomaly or chronic medical condition that in\n                  the opinion of the investigators would contraindicate participation in any\n                  household member, including history of gastrointestinal surgery, chronic\n                  gastrointestinal illness, abnormal intestinal anatomy, or abnormal bowel\n                  functionality\n\n                  2)  Allergy to penicillin or cephalosporins or gentamicin 3) History of\n                  antibiotic use in the last 30 days 4) Use of probiotic products within the past\n                  90 days, including masato (local product with fermenting bacteria) and yogurt\n                  products containing live bacterial cultures.\n\n                  5)   History of diarrheal illness within the past 30 days 6)  Presence of fever\n                  or a pre-existing adverse event monitored in the study 7)  Positive results on\n                  serum diagnostic tests for antibodies to HIV.\n\n                  Testing for Hepatitis B core antigen, and Hepatitis C is not necessary in\n                  children as in adults, since there is universal vaccination for Hepatitis B\n                  among children in this community, and both forms of hepatitis are rare and\n                  largely asymptomatic in this age group.\n\n                  8) Presence of severe anemia, defined as serum hemoglobin < 8 gm/dL\n\n                  9)   Out of range laboratory values for tests monitored as potential adverse\n                  events, as described in Appendix 2, B.
