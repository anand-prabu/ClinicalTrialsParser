Surgeons attempt sampling and\n      identification of all ipsilateral, mediastinal, and hilar lymph nodes. When accessible,\n      lobar lymph nodes must also be sampled. If the tumor margins are positive, further resection\n      of the margins must be attempted. Open thoracotomy may be required for technical reasons.\n\n      Eligible patients begin radiotherapy 2-8 weeks postoperatively. Patients with complete\n      resection undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5.6 weeks. Patients with incomplete\n      resection undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 6.6 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 66 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 22 months."
