  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This exploratory cross-sectional study proposes, firstly, to objectify in a population of
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 1A (CMT 1A)if there is a correlation between the recording
      of electrical parameters and upper limb muscle strength of the thigh and in a second step,
      to seek a relationship between the measured parameters.

      Patients suffering from CMT 1A neuropathy will be invited to go through a series of tests
      such as:

        -  Electromyography

        -  Isokinetic test

        -  Podiatric assessment

        -  Functional evaluations: Hand dexterity, limbs muscles  strength

        -  Quality of life assessment with questionnaires
