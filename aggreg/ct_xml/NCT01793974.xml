  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective study that will study adults and has the objective of examining
      'Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults' (LADA) to understand how this trait is influenced by
      genetic factors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A case-control study approach will be used to compare the allelic frequencies of
      Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) markers of the cases (i.e., LADA patients) to a randomly
      selected control samples that does not have the trait under study.  To study the role of
      genetic factors in LADA, the study seeks to determine if certain genomic regions that are
      captured or mirrored by selective Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are genotyped,
      are over or underrepresented in those with the disease compared to those who do not. The
      level of auto-antibodies is the serum can also be studied as a quantitative trait where we
      ask the question if there is correlation with specific SNP alleles that are genotyped.  The
      markers that are found to be over or under-represented in the study cases will then be
      tested in an independent set of patients also recruited in this study. This allows us to
      filter markers that show significance simply by chance and prevents us from being misled.
