This is done by starting at a dose lower than\n      the one that does not cause side effects in animals. Patients are given romidepsin and GDP\n      and watched very closely to see what side effects they have and to make sure the side\n      effects are not severe. If the side effects are not severe, then more patients are asked to\n      join the study and are given a higher dose of romidepsin (with GDP). Patients joining the\n      study later on will get higher doses of romidepsin (with GDP) than patients who join\n      earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes severe but temporary side\n      effects. Doses higher than that will not be given."
