    <textblock>
      This single-center, open label, randomized, 3-period cross-over study will compare 3
      modified-release formulations of RO4917523 in healthy volunteers. Subjects will be
      randomized to one of six sequences to receive single oral doses of RO4917523 slow, target
      and fast release modified release (MR) capsules along with a reference intravenous microdose
      with the target capsule. A washout period of at least 21 days will occur between treatments.
