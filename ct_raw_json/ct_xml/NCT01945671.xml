  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obese women have a higher prevalence of infertility than their lean counterparts. Obesity is
      a risk factor for anovulation , including in response to gonadotropin treatment .Further,
      even in women who are cycling regularly, obesity is associated with increased
      time-to-pregnancy  and decreased chance of natural pregnancy.

      During obesity or periods of overnutrition, lipid accumulates in nonadipose tissues, notably
      skeletal muscle, liver, heart, and pancreas  due to cellular uptake of exogenous fatty
      acids, triglycerides, and cholesterol as well as de novo lipogenesis in response to elevated
      glucose. The accumulation of intracellular lipid leads to high levels of free fatty acids
      that are subject to oxidative damage and the formation of cytotoxic and highly reactive
      lipid peroxides, which ultimately are detrimental to intracellular organelles, particularly
      the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and mitochondria. Exposure of the ER to high levels of free
      fatty acids and lipid peroxides causes structural alterations that perturb ER function  and
      lead to accumulation of unfolded proteins and calcium release. Failure of the UPR to
      reestablish ER homeostasis can lead to apoptosis .When mitochondria are exposed to high
      levels of free fatty acids, these can become oxidized by mitochondrial reactive oxygen
      species, forming lipid peroxides that damage essential proteins and uncouple mitochondrial
      function. This results in mitochondrial damage, which can cause further accumulation of
      lipids that cannot be catabolized, disrupted cellular homeostasis, and ultimately apoptosis
      .

      The cellular mechanisms by which obesity causes decreased conception rates are not known.
      Based on extensive evidence of obesity-induced lipotoxicity in other cells, it was
      hypothesized that obesity results in the activation of lipotoxicity pathways in the ovary.
      It was shown  that lipid accumulation, ER stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis
      occur in ovarian cells and the oocyte in response to a high-fat diet.

      The aim of our study was to evaluate the influence of high BMI on oocytes, granulose cells
      and metabolites in the follicular fluid.

    <textblock>
      All women undergone IVF-ICSI cycles will be recruited in the study. They will be divided
      into 3 subgroups according to their BMI: 18.5-24.9 -normal; 25-29.9 - overweight ; ≥30 -
      obese.

      i. A blood sample will be collected on the day of OPU and several markers will be checked-
      triglycerides, free fatty acid, cholesterol (HDl, LDL), insulin,  glucose, lactate, IGF-1,
      Leptin E2, Progessterone, IL-1, Il-6 and TNF-α.

      ii. After isolation of the oocytes from the follicular fluids - a blood free fluid from the
      leading follicle will be collected in a container for further evaluation of metabolic
      markers including triglycerides, free fatty acid, cholesterol (HDl, LDL), insulin,  glucose,
      lactate, IGF-1, Leptin E2, Progessterone, IL-1, Il-6 and TNF-α , ROS.

      iii. Cumulus cells will be collected after denudation of oocytes for ICSI and will be
      analyzed for apoptosis marker - Caspase 3 staining , Tunnel iv. Oocytes diameter - all
      denudated oocytes will be captured in the inverted microscope and the diameter will be
      measured.

      v.  GV oocytes, M1 and M2 that fail to fertilize will be analyzed for triglycerides, FFA and
      cholesterol concentration.

      vi. GDF-9, BMP-15, BMP-6, TNF-α, SMAD family will be analyzed by western blott as marker for
      oocytes quality.

      vii. Number of oocytes, mature (M2) oocytes, fertilization rate, cleavage rate, number
      embryos transferred, implantation rate, and pregnancy rate will be followed as well.
