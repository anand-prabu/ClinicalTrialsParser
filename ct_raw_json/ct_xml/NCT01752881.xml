    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the antibody response to each of the three
      influenza vaccine strains included in the licensed seasonal flu vaccine, as measured by
      hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) at three weeks post immunization in non-elderly and
      elderly subjects in compliance with the requirements of the current European Union (EU)
      recommendations for the evaluation of the immunogenicity for a new formulation of a licensed
      flu vaccine (CPMP/BWP/214/96).

    <time_frame>At 3 weeks after vaccination</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The seroconversion is defined as the HAI titer of the post-vaccination serum is at least 1:40 for those who had a negative pre-vaccination HAI serum titer or a four-fold or greater increase in HAI titers in subjects who had a positive pre-vaccination HAI serum titer. The seropositive is defined as the HAI titer ≥ 1:10, and the seronegative is defined as HAI titer &lt; 1:10.</description>

    <measure>Safety: Reactogenicity events</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days after vaccination</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Reactogenicity events are pre-specified adverse events systematically recorded for 7 days after vaccination. The selection of the events to be collected systematically is based on events expected to occur with wild-type influenza infection including fever (≥38°C), runny nose or nasal congestion, cough, sore throat, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, nausea and malaise. Furthermore, the local (injection site) reactions will also be evaluated that include soreness/pain, swelling, redness, ecchymosis and limitation of arm motion.</description>
