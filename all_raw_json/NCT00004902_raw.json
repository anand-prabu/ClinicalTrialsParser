Evaluate the\n      efficacy of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive 8-chloro-cyclic adenosine monophosphate (8-chloro-cAMP) over 120\n      hours every 2 weeks for up to 4 courses. Beginning with course 5, patients with stable or\n      responsive disease receive 8-chloro-cAMP over 120 hours every 3 weeks until disease\n      progression. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 29 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
