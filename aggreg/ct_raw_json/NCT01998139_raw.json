            "textblock": "Sepsis is a major global health problem, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality\n      despite medical care. The initial diagnosis of sepsis is a clinical challenge, as it is\n      based on nonspecific systemic criteria. Excessive endothelial activation is a cardinal\n      feature of sepsis and contributes to microvascular leak, edema, circulatory shock and organ\n      failure. Activated endothelial cells shed endothelial microparticles (EMPs) which can be\n      measured in plasma and are found at low levels in healthy subjects. Elevated EMPs have been\n      reported in sepsis, but whether their effect is beneficial or deleterious is unclear. In\n      this context, we hypothesize that circulating EMP levels can be assessed as a biomarker\n      differentiating sepsis from non-sepsis critical illness, and furthermore, that in septic\n      subjects, EMP levels will correlate with 30-day mortality. We propose to measure circulating\n      EMPs at ICU admission in subjects with suspected sepsis. Final diagnoses will be adjudicated\n      using standard criteria and 30-day mortality ascertained. Subjects determined not to have\n      sepsis will serve as the control group. EMP levels will be correlated with diagnosis to\n      ascertain the utility of EMP levels as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. For those subjects\n      with proven sepsis, EMP levels will be correlated to 30-day mortality to assess EMP level as\n      a prognostic marker in sepsis."
