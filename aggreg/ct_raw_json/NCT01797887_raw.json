Ayurveda-treatment is based on Ayurvedic\n      diagnosis and has a special focus on lifestyle and nutritional counseling, based on the\n      individual constitution of the patient. Ayurvedic counseling can easily be followed by the\n      patients in their day-to-day life and is an inexpensive way of self-care. In Ayurveda it is\n      often used for the treatment of burnout-syndrome. However, no systematic data is available\n      on its effectiveness in comparison to conventional standard diet and lifestyle counseling.\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Ayurvedic diet and lifestyle\n      counseling compared to conventional standard diet and lifestyle counseling in outpatient\n      mothers with burnout-syndrome."
