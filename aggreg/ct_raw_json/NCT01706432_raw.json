To determine the progression free survival, overall survival, pattern of failure, and\n      toxicity of hypofractionated image guided radiotherapy to all active sites (=< 5) of\n      metastatic disease.\n\n      II. To assess the feasibility of the Interferon-Related DNA Damage Resistance Gene Signature\n      (IRDS) for its predictive value in treatment failure, both in and out of the radiation\n      field.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients with metastases in the lung, liver, abdomen, and extremities undergo 10 fractions\n      or less of hypofractionated radiation therapy and patients with brain metastases undergo a\n      single fraction of stereotactic radiosurgery.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 weeks for 2 months, at\n      3 months, every 3 months for a year, and then every 6 months thereafter."
