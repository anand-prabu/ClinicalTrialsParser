            "textblock": "The surgical management of long bone infections is often challenging. Adequate surgical\n      debridement decreases the bacterial load, removes dead tissues, and gives a chance for the\n      host immune system and antibiotics to arrest infection. Adequate debridement may leave a\n      large bony defect. An appropriate management of the dead space is essential to arrest the\n      disease, and for maintenance of the bone's integrity. The current strategy includes the use\n      of antibiotic-loaded bone cement that can be used to sterilize and temporarily maintain the\n      dead space. The cement are usually removed after 2 to 4 weeks and replaced with a cancellous\n      graft harvested from the hip of the patient.\n\n      CERAMENT\u2122/ G is a CE-marked  resorbable ceramic bone graft substitute composed by calcium\n      sulfate and calcium hydroxyapatite, intended to fill gaps and voids in the skeleton system\n      and to promote bone healing. The antibiotic gentamicin is included in the ceramic to prevent\n      colonization of gentamicin-sensible microorganisms in order to protect bone healing.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate the device absorption and bone in-growth of\n      CERAMENT\u2122/ G in a surgically revised bone infection. In addition, bone healing and infection\n      non-recurrence will be evaluated during 12 months of follow-up. The investigators expect a\n      treatment success of >90 % and that a similar bone healing will be obtained as with a\n      standard two-stage surgical procedure. In addition, the investigators believe that the use\n      of CERAMENT\u2122/ G will be of advantage for the patient as bone healing will be achieved with a\n      one-stage surgical procedure (in combination with antibiotic therapy), instead of a\n      two-stage procedure, thus decreasing potential surgery-related complications."
