After that, the baseline measurement\n      of all outcome measures will be taken. All of them will then be randomly assigned to one of\n      the four study groups, including three treatment groups, namely massage therapy in MSE\n      (MT-MSE), MSE only and massage therapy in usual care environment (MT), and one control\n      (routine care) group.\n\n      The effects of the three proposed interventions and routine care only groups on the study\n      outcomes, including frequency and severity of challenging behaviour, adaptive behaviour,\n      alertness level, and heart and respiration rate, will be compared between groups at\n      baseline, interim (i.e., 5 weeks after the interventions started), immediately after\n      completion of the interventions (i.e. 10 weeks after the interventions started), and 2 weeks\n      follow up (i.e. at 12 weeks from the start of intervention, but no intervention at week 11\n      and 12).  A pilot study will be conducted to review the feasibility and clarity of the study\n      procedure, intervention protocols, and outcome measurements in around 30 patients with\n      similar clinical characteristics (i.e., 8 subjects per groups) before starting the main\n      study.\n\n      Primary outcomes of the study are frequency and severity of challenging behaviours, and the\n      physiological signs (i.e., respiration and pulse rate). The secondary outcomes are the\n      levels of alertness and adaptive behaviours.\n\n      Primary nurses who are responsible to formulate the individualized MSE and/or MT programs of\n      the participants in the three treatment groups will be invited to participate a face-to-face\n      semi-structured interview in order to explore their perceptions and opinions towards the\n      strengths and limitations of the intervention(s) used, factors influencing the challenging\n      behaviours of the disabled residents, and their suggested strategies in reducing their\n      clients' challenging behaviours in their work setting."
