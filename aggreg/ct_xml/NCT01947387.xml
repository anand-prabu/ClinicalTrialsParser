    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multi-center study evaluating the outcomes of using Integra® skin
      sheet bilayer or single layer products for complex soft tissue reconstruction of lower
      extremity diabetic wounds compared to other treatments. Participating sites will collect
      information for all patients who received Integra, free flap, local tissue flap, or negative
      pressure therapy over a 5 year period. The patient must be a minimum of 1 year from index
      procedure, with index procedure being defined as the application of Integra, free flap,
      local tissue flap, or negative pressure. Any follow-up occurring during the year is eligible
      for inclusion.

        All patients who received Integra, free flap, local tissue flap, or negative pressure
        wound therapy over a 5-year period.  The patient must be a minimum of 1 year from the
        index procedure, any follow-up occurring during the year is eligible for inclusion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diabetic (I or II) male or female, age greater than 18 years

          -  Lower extremity wounds that required operative application of Integra, free flap,
             local tissue flap, or negative pressure wound therapy.  Complex wounds are defined as
             wounds that involve exposed deep tissue (e.g. bone, tendon, fascia, ligament)

          -  The patient must be a minimum of 1 year from the index procedure, any follow-up
             occurring during the year is eligible for inclusion.
