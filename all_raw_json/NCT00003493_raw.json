Define the qualitative\n      and quantitative toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified into newly diagnosed (group A) and previously treated\n      (group B) patients. Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 2.5 hours, followed by\n      vincristine by bolus IV over 5 minutes on day 1. Dexamethasone is administered orally or by\n      IV on days 1-4. Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks for a minimum of 6 courses, and 2\n      courses after maximum response unless unacceptable toxic effects or disease progression\n      occur. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 33 patients from group A and 34 patients from group B will\n      be accrued for this study within 6-14 months."
