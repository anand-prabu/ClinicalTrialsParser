  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effects of treating subclinical
      hypothyroidism (SCH) with thyroid hormone replacement in children and adolescents with Down
      syndrome (DS). We hypothesize that treatment of SCH with thyroid hormone replacement will
      improve cardiometabolic health and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends yearly screening of thyroid studies in
      DS. Clinical experience suggests that TSH concentrations in the subclinical hypothyroid
      range (5-10 milli international units(mIU/L)) are not uncommon in DS, but the benefits and
      risks of treating SCH in the DS population are not known. In adults, SCH has been associated
      with increased cardiometabolic risk (CMR) and individuals with DS may be at increased
      cardiometabolic risk as well.

      Data in children with SCH are limited. Despite the recommendations to screen for thyroid
      dysfunction, evidence to guide management of elevated TSH in children with DS is equally
      sparse. In non-DS children, TSH&gt;4.65 mIU/L was associated with lower HDL. One year of
      levothyroxine treatment in short children with subclinical hypothyroidism and short stature
      improved growth velocity. Left ventricular (LV) function and LV mass (by echocardiography)
      was not different in 16 children with DS and subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH&gt;6.5 mIU/L; mean
      TSH = 7.8 mIU/L) vs. 25 children with DS and normal TSH. However, these findings may be
      limited by the small sample size. An intervention study of 7 subjects age 2-42 years with DS
      and hypothyroidism, defined as low T4 and normal or elevated TSH (0.2-18.9 mIU/L) on 8 weeks
      of levothyroxine treatment did not improve developmental or functional outcomes.
      Anthropometrics and CMR factors were not examined. In contrast, increased TSH in the absence
      of overt congenital hypothyroidism is common in neonates with DS and prompted a randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) in 181 neonates with DS. TSH-directed levothyroxine treatment was
      associated with better growth, weight gain, and motor development after 24 months compared
      to placebo. These findings highlight that the &quot;asymptomatic&quot; component of subclinical
      hypothyroidism may have medically-relevant effects. This study will provide potentially
      clinically relevant preliminary evidence for the treatment of subclinical hypothyroidism in
      DS.

    <description>Subject who are found to have SCH at the 6-month visit will be randomized to receive either levothyroxine or placebo during months 6-12. Levothyroxine dose will be between 0.5 - 1 mcg/kg/day. There will be 1 blood draw visit at month 7.5 (6 weeks after randomization) and 1 study visit at month 12 that will provide the opportunity for dose adjustments if needed.
From months 12-18, all subjects will receive levothyroxine. Levothyroxine dose will be between 0.5 - 1 mcg/kg/day. There will be one blood draw visit at month 13.5 that will provide the opportunity for dose adjustments if needed.</description>

    <description>Subjects will be observed for the first 6 months of the study to ensure that the subclinical hypothyroidism is persistent. Subjects who do not have SCH at 6 months will not proceed to the treatment phase.
Subjects that have TSH &gt;10 mIU/L during the 6 month Observational Phase will not be considered subclinical and will not qualify to continue the study. They will be referred to an endocrinologist for treatment.</description>
