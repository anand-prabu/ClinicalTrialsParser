Patients are stratified\n      according to age (under 40 vs 40-59 vs 60 and over), type of cancer (non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\n      vs Hodgkin's lymphoma vs breast vs germ cell vs small cell lung cancer vs other), and\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral levofloxacin once daily for 7 consecutive days during the\n           expected neutrophil nadir of each chemotherapy course.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive an oral placebo once daily for 7 consecutive days as in arm I.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable side\n      effects or allergy or a clear continuing indication for the prophylactic use of\n      antibacterial agents during subsequent courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,500 patients (750 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
