  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Olanzapine is licensed for use in adults in Canada and in teens in the US with mental
      illness.  It is also often used for the management of mental illness in children. This study
      will describe the feasibility of giving olanzapine plus other usual medications to prevent
      chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting  (CINV) to 15 children aged 4 to 18 years.

      What has been done already? - In adult cancer patients, olanzapine improved the control of
      CINV.  None of the adults studied experienced any serious side effects from olanzapine.

      What is being studied and how will the study be conducted? - On each day that chemotherapy
      is given, olanzapine will be given to 15 children along with their regular medications to
      prevent CINV.  Investigators will study each child only during one chemotherapy cycle.
      Participants' blood sugar, liver function tests (AST and ALT), prolactin and triglyceride
      levels, blood pressure, weight, mood and behavior during the time they receive olanzapine
      will be evaluated to see if they change.  Investigators will record anything serious that
      happens while children receive olanzapine.  If any child stops olanzapine early or decides
      to decrease the dose, the reason will be recorded.  Each child and their guardian will
      record their nausea severity and the times they vomit or retch on each day they receive
      chemotherapy and for 8 days afterwards.

      How will the study help? - This study will help investigators decide if it is feasible to
      conduct a larger study to find out if olanzapine improves CINV control in children.  If most
      children are able to take olanzapine as set out in the study without having significant side
      effects, then a larger study would be feasible.

A parent/guardian/caregiver will complete the Side Effect Rating Scale (SERs) at least twice while thier child is receiving olanzapine.
