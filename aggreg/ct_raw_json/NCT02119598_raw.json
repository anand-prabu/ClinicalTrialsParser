The slogans 'Time is brain' and 'Competence is brain' adequately\n      point out that acute stroke is a time-critical medical emergency requiring specialized\n      treatment.\n\n      Pursuant to ongoing technological developments and in line with the American Stroke\n      Association and the European Stroke Organisation guidelines, the implementation of\n      telestroke for optimizing inhospital stroke care is currently applied in several countries.\n      Research on prehospital telestroke systems is recommended by the American Stroke\n      Association, as it may facilitate early stroke diagnosis, assessment of stroke severity and\n      selection of patients for specific stroke treatments.\n\n      The experience with prehospital telemedicine for assessment of stroke severity, however, is\n      limited to the TeleBAT project and two recent pilot studies conducted in healthy volunteers.\n      Prehospital telestroke is a very promising concept, facilitating specialized stroke care in\n      very early stage based on integration of bidirectional audiovisual communication with point\n      of care laboratory analysis, vitals and decision support software.\n\n      As part of the Prehospital Stroke Study at the Universitair ziekenhuis Brussel (PreSSUB), we\n      have developed and tested several prototypes for prehospital telemedicine. The current\n      system consists of commercially available hardware and a Web-based telemedicine platform.\n      The data are transmitted to a multimedia server unit over a mobile (ultra)broadband\n      connection (3G or 4G). Data privacy is secured by password-protected logins, role-based\n      access control, and hypertext transfer protocol secure encryption.\n\n      The results of a feasibility study using the 4G network in healthy volunteers have recently\n      been reported  and feasibility data using the 3G network in healthy volunteers are\n      available.\n\n      Building further on the reassuring safety and feasibility data specified above, the next\n      logical step is to evaluate this system for prehospital telemedicine in the real-life\n      situation involving transportation of patients in the Paramedic Ambulance team\n      (PIT)-ambulance to the UZ Brussel."
