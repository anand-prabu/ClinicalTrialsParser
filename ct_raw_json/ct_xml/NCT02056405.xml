    <textblock>
      Background Postoperative Ileus is defined as the transient postoperative functional
      inhibition of propulsive bowel activity. The ethiology of this process can best be described
      as multifactorial. In its pathogenesis different mechanisms are involved such as hormones
      and neuropeptides, inflammation, narcotics and the Autonomic nervous system. Is one of the
      most common causes of prolonged hospital stays after abdominal surgery, thereby increasing
      health-care resource utilization. More importantly, it causes patient discomfort in the form
      of nausea, vomiting, and stomach cramps. It has a variable duration but is usually solved in
      3 to 4 days. Prolonged Ileus is associated with postoperative complications like an increase
      on urinary and pulmonary infections, profound venous thrombosis and wound-site
      complications.

      Mosapride is a prokinetic agent that acts as a selective serotonin agonist (5- HT4) that
      facilitates acetylcholine release from the intrinsic plexus. This accelerates gastric
      emptying and propulsive peristaltic movements on the lower intestines.  Mosapride has no
      action over the central nervous system therefore the lesser side effects like cardiac
      arrhythmias and extrapyramidal symptoms. For being a safer drug we chose it to be the center
      of our research.

      Two randomized controlled trials studied Mosapride concluding it shortens PI after
      colorectal surgery. However these trials took place on specific populations (Orientals) with
      less than 50 patients and only one of them included laparoscopic treatment specifically.
      Also the end point of these studies didn't consider the impact of PI over hospital stay or
      costs to the health system.

      We therefore decided to conduct a prospective randomized study in patients undergoing
      laparoscopic colorectal surgery for colon cancer. The patients will be randomized to receive
      treatment or placebo after surgery. With this study we intend to prove that patients treated
      with mosapride immediately after surgery suffer from shorter postoperative ileus with
      earlier oral intake and shorter hospital stay.

      Aim The primary aim of the trial is to assess the effectiveness of the use of Mosapride in
      shortening the duration of the Postoperative ileus in patients undergoing colorectal
      laparoscopic surgery. The trial hypothesis is that the standardized use of Mosapride
      immediately after colorectal laparoscopic surgery is safe and accelerates the recovery of
      propulsive bowel activity, thereby shortening postoperative ileus and hospital stay.
