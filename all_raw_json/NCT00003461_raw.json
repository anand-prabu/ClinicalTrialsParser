Patients receive one dose of astatine At 211\n      antitenascin monoclonal antibody 81C6 (At 211 MAb 81C6) via the intralesional catheter.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at escalating doses of At 211 MAb 81C6. The maximum\n      tolerated dose is the highest dose at which no more than 3 of 6 patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed initially at 4 weeks, then at approximately 12 weeks, at 24 weeks, and\n      then every 12 weeks for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
