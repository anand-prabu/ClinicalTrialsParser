    <textblock>
      The purpose of this ancillary study is to measure energy intake and energy expenditure
      during and after pregnancy. We hypothesize that obese pregnant women with weight gain above
      the IOM guidelines, 'High Gainers', will have increased energy intake but no evidence for
      changes in energy expenditure after adjustment for the weight gained when compared to women
      with appropriate gestational weight gain, 'Normal Gainers'.

      The MomEE study is an ancillary study to Expecting Success which is part of the National
      Consortium 'LIFE-Moms: Lifestyle Interventions in Expectant Moms' that aims to determine how
      to help manage weight gain during pregnancy. Expecting Success will compare how three
      programs help manage weight gain during pregnancy-- SmartMoms- Clinic, SmartMoms- Phone, and
      Physician Directed. As an ancillary study, the MomEE study will evaluate energy intake and
      energy expenditure during pregnancy and 12 months postpartum in obese women enrolled in the
      Expecting Success study.

    <description>Participants in the Smart-Moms Clinic group attend study meetings with a weight management counselor. During the second trimester study meetings occur 4 times per month. During the third trimester study meetings occur 2 times per month. These meetings will cover many topics  about weight management during pregnancy. Different tools to help monitor weight will be provided to participants. Participants will be asked to record their body weight (using a scale provided) as well as recording food intake and exercise habits.</description>

    <description>Participants in the Smart-Moms Phone group will attend two individual sessions with a weight management counselor. At the first session, participants will receive a scale and other technology to help manage weight during pregnancy. Each week participants will receive information from a weight management counselor via a Smartphone. The information will cover topics to help manage weight during pregnancy. Different tools to help monitor weight will be provided to participants. Participants will be asked to record their body weight (using a scale provided) as well as recording food intake and exercise habits.</description>
