Recent\n      reports suggest that 56.5 per 100 000 of the population will suffer from AP annually; this\n      figure is more than double the highest previous estimated incidence. In the majority of\n      patients the condition is mild, but about 25% of patients suffer a severe attack and between\n      30 and 50% of these patients dies. The usual cause of death is multiple organ failure\n      secondary to systemic leukocyte activation (mainly neutrophils), accompanied by the systemic\n      inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS).\n\n      Studies with omega-3 fish oil have shown to control inflammatory process and improve the\n      outcome especially in hyperinflammatory conditions.\n\n      This research will look at the effects of supplementing omega-3 fish oil to patients with\n      severe acute pancreatitis (severe inflammation of the pancreas).\n\n      Patients with severe acute pancreatitis will be prospectively and blindly randomised into\n      either a study group who will receive (Lipidem, lipid emulsion contains essential fatty\n      acids and omega-3 fish oil) or a control group that will receive (Lipofundin, lipid emulsion\n      contains only essential fatty acids and no omega-3 fish oil). Normal and standard clinical\n      care will be provided to all patients as per the national management guidelines. Each\n      patient will receive either Lipidem or Lipofundin emulsions daily until they are deemed fit\n      for discharge by their own medical team or for a maximum of SEVEN days.\n\n      The main aim of this study is to examine whether lipid emulsions enriched with omega-3 fish\n      oil could improve the clinical outcome in patients with severe acute pancreatitis."
