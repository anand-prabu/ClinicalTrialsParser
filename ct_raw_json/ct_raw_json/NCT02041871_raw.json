To date, the effects of\n      preoperative oral immunonutrition (ORAL IMPACT) in non cirrhotic patients undergoing liver\n      resection for cancer are unknown. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the\n      administration of a short-term preoperative oral immunonutrition can reduce postoperative\n      morbidity in non-cirrhotic patients undergoing liver resection for malignant tumours."
