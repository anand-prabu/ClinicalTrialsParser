A cohort is\n      defined by a pathology and a crizotinib-target alteration (eg gastric cancer with MET\n      amplification).\n\n      For each cohort a two-stage design will be implemented. In the situation where expected\n      accrual allows for a sufficient number of patients to be accrued, the alpha and beta errors\n      will be fixed at 10%. However, in very rare diseases, such as inflammatory myofibroblastic\n      tumor (IMT), neuroblastoma, glioblastoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), it is anticipated that\n      the target number may not be achievable in a reasonable timeframe; for these cohorts, the\n      alpha and beta errors will be fixed at 15%. Consequently three different statistical designs\n      will be a priori considered according to the expected response rate and incidence."
