      In order to perform research smoothly, the process of information extraction is required for
      translating data in clinical text into available format for analysis and statistic. In
      medical research, the problem of missing data occurs frequently. It is important to develop
      the method with better imputation performance in the stability and accuracy. The purposes of
      this project are to provide the data integration and extraction methods for handling the
      structured and unstructured data sources in more efficient ways, to provide the validation
      scheme for facilitating the data reviewing of extracted results produced by information
      extraction modules, to increase the quality of clinical data by comparing the data from
      different data sources and correcting data errors and inconsistent, to handle the clinical
      data with the properties of time series and incompleteness, to increase accuracy of data
      analysis and increase quality of health care by improving the completeness and correctness
      of clinical data, to provide flexibility of methods in the platform. In the project, the
      disease topic is focused on the liver cancer patients' clinical data and we hope the methods
      in the projects can be extended to handle other diseases by replacing these knowledge models
      in the future.

      Because of the increasing adoption of Electronic Medical Record (EMR) systems, the data
      access of EMR is more and more convenient. However, there still have difficulties in
      analyzing all the clinical data directly due to a large number of records using the
      narrative format. In order to perform research smoothly, the process of information
      extraction is required for translating data in clinical text into available format for
      analysis and statistic. In medical research, the problem of missing data occurs frequently.
      It is important to develop the method with better imputation performance in the stability
      and accuracy. The purposes of this project are to provide the data integration and
