      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the combination of ibuprofen and
      acetaminophen, is more effective than either single agent alone in treating pain from acute
      musculoskeletal injuries in the emergency department. We hypothesize that the combination
      will be more effective than either agent alone in patients presenting to the emergency
      department with acute pain from musculoskeletal injuries such as sprain, and bruises.  While
      each agent alone is effective to some degree, many patients do not find complete relief with
      them and often narcotic agents (with all of their potential side effects) are added.  In
      this study patients experiencing any pain will be randomly given either ibuprofen OR
      acetaminophen OR their combination and their degree of pain severity will be measured every
      15 minutes up to one hour.  At the end of this 1 hour patients still experiencing pain and
      requiring additional pain relief will receive additional analgesics at the discretion of
      their treating physician.  We will not only measure how much the pain severity was reduced
      but also the percentage of patients that require some form of additional or &quot;rescue&quot;
      medication.
