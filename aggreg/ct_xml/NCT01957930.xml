    <textblock>
      We aim to investigate the relationship between skin microvascular function and the first
      hospitalization for ischemic foot ulcer in patients with type 1 diabetes former randomized
      during 7.5 years to intensified conventional insulin treatment (ICT) compared to standard
      insulin treatment (ST).

      The Stockholm Diabetes Intervention Study (SDIS) aimed to determine whether intensified
      insulin treatment were feasible and led to less serious diabetic complications. 102 patients
      with type 1 diabetes mellitus were randomiz (October 1982 to March 1984) to intensified
      conventional treatment (ICT; n=48) or standard treatment (ST; n=54). The randomized SDIS
      study lasted for 7.5 years, whereas 96 patients were fully evaluated. Thereafter patients
      were assigned to their regular clinical visits.

      In the present study, 96 patients from the SDIS study were asked to participate in current
      study and to investigate their skin microcirculation, in which 72 patients agreed (ICT; n=35
      vs. ST; n=37). Exclusions criteria were; any history or ongoing ischemic foot ulcer or
      peripheral artery disease or osteoartropathy. The iontophoresis investigation took place 5.5
      years ± 2 months, after the primary randomization ceased (7.5 years). Also, nineteen healthy
      subjects participated as controls for the method of iontophoresis, with no intention to be
      followed-up. All participants (except the control subjects) were then followed-up until
      first time hospitalization for ischemic foot ulcer or until 31 december 2011.
