            "textblock": "Subjects that have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma are invited to take part in this\n      gene transfer research study.\n\n      We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene called a chimeric antigen\n      receptor (CAR) into T cells that will make them recognize neuroblastoma cells and kill them.\n      In a previous clinical trial, we used a CAR that recognizes GD2, a protein found on almost\n      all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into T cells and gave them back to\n      patients that had neuroblastoma. The infusions were safe and in patients with disease at the\n      time of their infusion, the time to progression was longer if we could find GD2 T cells in\n      their blood for more than 6 weeks. Because of this, we think that if T cells are able to\n      last longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.\n\n      Therefore, in this study we will add new genes to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells\n      to live longer. These new genes are called CD28 and OX40. The purpose of this study will be\n      to determine the highest dose of iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40 (iC9-GD2) T cells that can safely be\n      given to patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma."

After the new gene has been put into the T cells, the cells will be tested\n      to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and then frozen until the\n      patient is ready for their infusion.\n\n      The infusion will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's\n      Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. The injection will take between 5 and 10 minutes.\n\n      There will be follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks during the first 2 months and then they will\n      be spaced out over a total of 15 years. Because the cells are modified with a new gene we\n      must follow patients for at least 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of\n      gene transfer. During the visits, we will see how the patients are doing and during certain\n      time points we will obtain extra blood samples to learn more about the way the iC9-GD2 T\n      cells are working and how long they last in the body."
