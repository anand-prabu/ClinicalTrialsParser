      This study is an 8-week open-label trial testing Lurasidone (Latuda®) as a treatment for
      mania in children and adolescents with Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Bipolar Spectrum
      disorders. We hypothesize that Lurasidone will be safe, tolerable, and effective in
      improving the core symptoms of bipolar disorders in children and adolescents ages 6-17.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects 6-17 years of age

          2. Subjects must weigh at least 20 kg

          3. Subjects with the diagnosis of bipolar I, bipolar II, or bipolar spectrum disorder
             and currently displaying manic, hypomanic, or mixed symptoms (with or without
             psychotic features), by DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV), as manifested
             in clinical evaluation and/or the Mania module of the structured interview, completed
             by the study clinician.  Bipolar Spectrum Disorder (or sub-threshold bipolar
             disorder) is operationalized as having severe mood disturbance, which meets DSM-IV
             Criteria A for bipolar disorder but displays fewer elements in Criteria B (only
             require 2 items for elation category and 3 for irritability)

          4. Subjects must score ≥ 20 on the YMRS (Young Mania Rating Scale)

          5. Subjects and their legal representative must have a level of understanding sufficient
             to communicate intelligently with the investigator and study coordinator, and to
             cooperate with all tests and examinations required by the protocol.

          6. Subjects and their legal representative must be considered reliable reporters.

          7. Each subject and his/her authorized legal representative must understand the nature
             of the study.  The subject's authorized legal representative must sign an informed
             consent document and the subject must sign an informed assent document (if ≥ 7 years
             old).

          8. Subject must be able to participate in mandatory blood draws.

          9. Subject must be able to swallow pills.

         10. Subjects with co-morbid PDD (Pervasive Developmental Disorder) and depressive
             disorders will be allowed to participate in the study provided they do not meet any
             of the exclusionary criteria.

         11. For concomitant therapy used to treat ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity
             Disorder), subjects must have been on a stable dose of the medication for 1 month
             prior to study enrollment, and the dose of the ADHD therapy cannot change throughout
             the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Investigator and his/her immediate family; defined as the investigator's spouse,
             parent, child, grandparent, or grandchild.

          2. Serious, unstable illness including hepatic, renal, gastroenterological, respiratory,
             cardiovascular (including ischemic heart disease), endocrinologic, neurologic,
             immunologic, or hematologic disease.

          3. Uncorrected hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism.

          4. Non-febrile seizures without a clear and resolved etiology.

          5. DSM-IV substance (except nicotine or caffeine) dependence within past 6 months.

          6. Judged clinically to be at serious suicidal risk or have a C-SSRS (Columbia Suicide
             Severity Rating Scale) score ≥ 4.

          7. Any other concomitant medication with primary central nervous system activity other
             than specified in the Concomitant Medication portion of the Protocol.

          8. Current diagnosis of schizophrenia.

          9. Mental retardation (IQ &lt; 75)

         10. Pregnant or nursing females

         11. Known hypersensitivity to Latuda®

         12. A non-responder or history of intolerance to Latuda®, after treatment at adequate
             doses as determined by the clinician.

         13. Severe allergies or multiple adverse drug reactions.
