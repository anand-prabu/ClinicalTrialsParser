One of the therapeutic approaches of inflammatory diseases such as alopecia\n      areata is the induction of tolerance. This tolerance induction can be obtained by\n      stimulating regulatory T cells (Treg). The low-dose interleukin-2 plays a central role in\n      the development, expansion, regulation and survival of regulatory T cells CD4 + cluster of\n      differentiation 25 (CD25) + forkhead box protein 3 (FoxP3). Recently, recombinant\n      interleukin 2 (IL2-R) with low dose showed very promising results in two inflammatory\n      disease (GVHD vasculitis and cryoglobulinemia secondary to hepatitis C): clinical efficacy,\n      increased population Treg in the blood and an excellent safety profile. We hypothesized that\n      administration of IL2-R in patients with severe alopecia areata might allow regrowth via\n      activation of Treg and thus induce regrowth of the air."
