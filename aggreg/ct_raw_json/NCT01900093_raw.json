Thus, we propose to conduct a small open-label proof-of-concept trial to\n      evaluate the response to ACTHAR gel therapy in patients who have failed to make a\n      satisfactory recovery after treatment with high dose IVMP. Documentation of the clinical\n      course as well as any adverse events related to IVMP use will be made. The investigators\n      propose to study the potential benefit of a 14-day course (the dose historically used since\n      the landmark clinical trial of Rose et al1) of subcutaneous ACTHAR gel in 10 patients who\n      have demonstrated inadequate improvement after a course of IVMP, 1000 mg daily, for 5\n      treatments (over a maximum of 8 days). These would be patients for whom PLEX would be\n      considered as a treatment possibility. The primary outcome measure will be improvement in\n      the targeted neurological deficit, as measured on the appropriate functional system score\n      (FSS) of the EDSS."
