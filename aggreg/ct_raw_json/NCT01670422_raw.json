There is no quantitative analysis or report\n      about the causes of or risk factors for the two problems. Doctors identify the causes or\n      risk factors only through clinical experience. The investigators performed a retrospective\n      study of 322 patients with chronic suppurative osteomyelitis of the jaw. The risk factors\n      for the above mentioned two problems were analyzed by logistic regression analysis. The\n      investigators found that some of the patients' general conditions, including age, admission\n      temperature, admission white blood cell count, pre-admission antibiotic administration\n      without consultation, location of the lesion, and general patient condition, were the risk\n      factors. The results indicate that doctors should be mindful of those risk factors and that\n      the management should be more aggressive when the above risk factors are present."
