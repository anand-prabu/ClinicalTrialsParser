    <textblock>
      The study objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and clinical efficacy of Bertilimumab administered to subjects
           with active moderate to severe UC

        -  To evaluate the bioactivity, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) effects of
           Bertilimumab to subjects with active moderate to severe UC.

      Study design:

      This will be is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group multi-center
      study in adult subjects with active moderate to severe UC . Eligible subjects will be
      randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups, bertilimumab or matching placebo.

      The study will consist of three periods: a screening period of up to two weeks, a 4-week
      double-blind treatment period, and approximately 9-week safety and efficacy follow-up
      period.

      Bertilimumab is a recombinant human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that neutralizes human
      eotaxin-1 (eotaxin). Bertilimumab will be administered every other week for 4-weeks, by IV
      infusion over 30 minutes.
