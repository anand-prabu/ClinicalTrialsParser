The neurocognitive exercise protocol contains ten\n      exercises involving specific instruments (e.g., table inclined with a board with five\n      concentric circles, sponges of various texture). Each subject, randomly assigned to either\n      neurocognitive therapeutic exercise (group 1) or traditional therapeutic exercise (group 2),\n      will be submitted to one-hour session for three times a week for five weeks. The outcome\n      measures used will be the Quick-DASH questionnaire, the Constant-Murley shoulder outcome\n      score, the ASES score, a visual analogic scale (VAS) and the assessment will be performed at\n      baseline (T0), at the end of treatment protocol (T1), at 3 months (T2) and 6 months (T3)\n      from the end of treatment."
