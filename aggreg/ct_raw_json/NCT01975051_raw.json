            "textblock": "Background:Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis is a skin disorder caused by the Leishmania\n      donovani and usually develops after treatment for visceral leishmaniasis. The public health\n      importance of this condition is that it plays as an inter-epidemic reservoir of visceral\n      leishmaniasis.It is believed that the condition is associated with sodium stibogluconate\n      (SSG) monotherapy for visceral leishmaniasis; however evidence is lacking to support this.\n      Further no study has been carried out to explore the pathogenesis of PKDL in Bangladesh.\n      Also no information is available related to development of PKDL after treatment of VL with\n      miltefosine monotherapy in Bangladesh.Better knowledge on pathogenesis of PKDL will help to\n      predict and design intervention to prevent the development of PKDL. This will help to reduce\n      the numbers of inter-epidemic reservoir for VL and hence will contribute to the national\n      kala-azar elimination program.\n\n      Objectives:1. To investigate the incidence of PKDL after SSG or Miltefosine mono-therapy for\n      VL; 2. To investigate serum level of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and markers of lipid metabolism (serum\n      cholesterols) before and after treatment of PKDL; 3. To investigate the mRNA expression of\n      IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 in skin lesion of PKDL; 4. To investigate the association of gene polymorphism\n      of IL-10, TGF-\u03b2 and PKDL; 5. To develop a new diagnostic tool for diagnosis of PKDL by\n      detection of LD antigen in the skin tissue by punch biopsy using immunofluorescence\n      technique; and, 6. To investigate leishmania antigens and anti-leishmania antibodies in\n      urine before and after treatment of PKDL and evaluate possibility to use them as diagnostic\n      tools.\n\n      Methods:1. The incidence of PKDL after treatment for VL will be investigated through\n      studying a retrospective cohort which will be identified by cross-sectional survey; 2. serum\n      level of cytokines and lipid profile will be measured respectively by cytometric bed-array\n      and autoanalyzer before and after treatment for PKDL; 3. mRNA expression of cytokines will\n      be measured real-time PCR before and after treatment for PKDL; 4. gene polymorphism will be\n      investigated by DNA sequencing; 5. the new diagnostic tool will be developed using\n      immunofluorescence technique; and, 6. urine antigens and antibodies will be detected by\n      ELISA."
