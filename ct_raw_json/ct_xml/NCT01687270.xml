  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm study of GS-7977 and ribavirin (RBV) in subjects who have
      had a liver transplant which has become re-infected with hepatitis C. The treatment period
      is 24 weeks with up to 48 weeks of follow up. The total time in this study will last up to
      72 weeks not including the screening visit.

    <description>Virologic failure is defined as virologic breakthrough (participant achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels during treatment but subsequently had detectable HCV RNA while continuing treatment), non-response (HCV RNA ≥ LLOQ through 24 weeks of treatment), or relapse (participant achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels during treatment maintained undetectable HCV RNA for the duration of treatment or achieved undetectable HCV RNA within 4 weeks of the end of treatment but did not achieve SVR at 4, 24, and 48 weeks posttreatment).</description>
