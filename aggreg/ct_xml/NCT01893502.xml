  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation improves mortality, even in patients with existing smoking-related
      morbidity. Telephone follow-up after smoking cessation counselling as been shown to be an
      important method to provide support to smokers and to improve quit rates, especially if
      three or more calls were used in addition to face-to-face counselling. While it is
      reasonable to assume that more counselling leads to better smoking cessation outcomes,
      little evidence exists over the amount of telephone follow-up counselling that is required
      for optimal and sustained abstinence. We aim to investigate if six-months of weekly
      telephone follow-up is superior to one-month of weekly telephone follow-up.
