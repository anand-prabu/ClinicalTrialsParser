  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advance care planning has been recommended as an integral part of care for patients with
      life-limiting disease, but relevant development in Hong Kong is still in its infancy. This
      proposed study attempts to address this service gap by promoting advance care planning to
      patients with advanced disease. It is hypothesized that the proportion of patients whose
      end-of-life care preferences were known in the experimental group will be significantly
      higher than that in the control group.

      This study aims to evaluate the impacts of a community-based advance care planning programme
      on end-of-life care of patients with advanced disease. A mixed-method approach, including a
      randomized controlled trial and qualitative interviews, will be used. Participants in the
      experimental group will received a structured advance care planning programme delivered by a
      trained facilitator. It includes an educational component, reflection and a family meeting.

    <description>In this study, end-of-life care preferences include goal for end-of-life care and decisions over the use of life-sustaining treatments relevant to individual's anticipated health changes. So, whether the patients' end-of-life care preferences is known at different timepoints will be determined based on (1) the congruence between patients' end-of-life care preferences and family carers' predicted end-of-life care preferences for patients; and (2) whether patients' end-of-life preferences are documented in their medical record.</description>

    <description>The SURE test (Legare, Kearing, Clay, Gagnon, D'Amours, Rousseau &amp; O'Connor, 2010) will be used to measure the patient's level of decisional conflict in making decisions related to future care. Patients will be asked to rate their certainty in their future care on four items by using a dichotomous response format: yes or no. Good construct validity and reliability were demonstrated. It has previously been translated into Chinese and tested among local older people .</description>

    <description>Participants in the experimental group will receive a structured advance care planning programme, namely Let Me Talk, delivered by a trained nurse facilitator. The programme will be conducted on individual basis through three one-hour home visits, once weekly. Family carers of the participants will be invited to all sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants  in the control group will receive three weekly home visits with basic health assessment and education provided by the trained nurse facilitator. If they request advance care planning information or assistance, an advance directive form, which is available on the Internet for public access, will be provided to them for their information.</description>

    <description>It is a multi-faceted programme which includes an educational component with support of multimedia materials, reflection on personal values and a facilitated discussion between patient and family carer over future care. It will be  delivered to each pair of participant and family carer on individual basis. By the end of the programme, each participant will have a personal workbook summarising the advance care planning process for record.</description>
