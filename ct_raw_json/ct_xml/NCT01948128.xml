  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is a randomized, phase 2 &quot;window of opportunity&quot; trial assessing the
      biological effects of short term oral vitamin D administration on breast cancer clinical and
      translational markers in patients awaiting surgery at the Ottawa Hospital. It takes
      advantage of the current wait times (2-8 weeks) for breast cancer surgery as a &quot;window of
      opportunity&quot; to rapidly assess biological changes with vitamin D intake.
