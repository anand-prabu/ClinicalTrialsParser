Once the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) is determined, or after all subjects have been evaluated and found to tolerate the highest dose, the study will end."

Treatment of\n      malignant glioma using gene transfer modalities typically consists of surgical debulking of\n      the tumor mass followed by the administration of the viral vectors into the brain tissue\n      surrounding the tumor cavity. This study will combine direct tumor cell killing (TK) and\n      immune-mediated stimulatory (Flt3L) gene transfer approaches delivered by first generation\n      adenoviral vectors."
