The device can also collect and transmit relevant disease-specific data, which are indicative of their current state of health, via an attached Fingertip Pulse Oximeter (Nonin, Onyx II % SpO2), a Digital Blood Pressure Monitor (Model UA-767, plus BT-C) and a scale. The device can measure four vital signs, which are transferred wirelessly: blood pressure, pulse, blood oxygen saturation and weight. The tablet can be activated and give a sound, when it is time for taking measurements again."

COPD patients can make appointments with their general practitioner or practice nurse free of charge in order to get help in managing COPD. Community based care and practical help varies. As a rule community care comes at regular intervals based on a clinically based estimate of the patients' needs, but the personnel are not necessarily certified nurses and often not fully educated in COPD and definitely not on call"

The first objective is to evaluate whether a\n      particular telehealth solution, in addition to standard treatment and care, lead to a\n      significant decrease in the mortality and an increase in health related quality of life for\n      patients suffering from COPD that may benefit from telehealth compared with only standard\n      treatment and care. The second objective is to examine the additional costs of the\n      telehealth solution and assess whether this solution is a cost-effective way to care for\n      patients with COPD across patients and municipality districts.\n\n      It is hypothesized that telehealth care will increase patients quality adjusted life years\n      at both the cluster and individual level compared to usual practice, since no difference in\n      mortality and a higher health related quality of life is expected. Furthermore, it is hoped\n      that there will be a 30% reduction in the number of admissions and readmissions to hospitals\n      and a 30% reduction in the number of outpatient visits resulting in fewer costs for\n      hospitals. However, it is uncertain as to whether these savings are offset by other costs\n      such as more visits to general practitioners, community care or the implementation costs."
