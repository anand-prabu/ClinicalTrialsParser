  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether non-invasive mechanical ventilation(NIV),
      playing the role as a rescue therapy , are effective in relieving exertional dyspnea in
      stable severe COPD patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease(COPD) is a preventable and treatable illness, which is
      clinically characterized by persistent airflow limitation that is usually progressive. It's
      well known that airflow limitation lead to air trapping particularly during exercise,
      resulting in increased dyspnea and limitation of exercise capacity. Thus, COPD patients
      often unconsciously adopt a sedentary lifestyle, probably due to distressing exertional
      dyspnea. The sedentarism results in physical deconditioning and alterations of the
      peripheral muscles, and the latter one causes more exertional dyspnea and fatigue, which in
      turn leads to much more sedentarism, forming the vicious cycle of sedentarism,
      dyspnea/fatigue and more sedentarism. Thereby, measures should be taken to interrupt this
      vicious cycle. Some previous studies suggested that niv acting as an add-on therapy could
      help unloading the inspiratory muscle, reducing the dynamic compression of the airway,
      diminishing the dynamic hyperinflation,to some extent, relieved dyspnea during exercise in
      COPD patients. However,those measures were taken during exercise, acting as an add-on
      therapy. Whether NIV can play a role as a rescue therapy to relieve exertional dyspnea while
      the patients are already undergoing optimal treatment with bronchodilator and
      anti-inflammatory medication is still not quite clear. Therefore, we hypothesize that niv as
      a rescue-therapy has the same effect on relieving dyspnea in stable severe COPD patients
      just like the add-on therapy.
