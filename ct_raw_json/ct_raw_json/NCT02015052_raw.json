However, no large clinical trial has demonstrated the\n      ability of vitamin D supplementation to prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. The\n      objective of the Vitamin D and type 2 diabetes study (D2d) is to determine whether vitamin\n      D3 supplementation will decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. D2d will evaluate, in 2382\n      people study-wide (150 at the Phoenix site), whether supplementation with vitamin D3 will\n      prevent progression to type 2 diabetes in a high-risk population, compared with placebo.\n\n      Study Population:\n\n      American Indians are at a disproportionate risk for developing type 2 diabetes and carry a\n      disproportionate burden of disease as a result. The Phoenix site of D2d will recruit\n      American Indian participants exclusively, to ensure representation by this population.\n      Potential participants will be eligible if they do not have diabetes, have a BMI at least 25\n      kg/m2, and meet at least two out of three criteria for pre-diabetes (fasting plasma glucose\n      100-125 mg/dl, 2-hour plasma glucose 140-199 mg/dl, and HbA1c 5.7-6.4%). Exclusion criteria\n      include any condition that would increase the risk of complications due to vitamin D3\n      supplementation (e.g., history of kidney stones, hypercalcemia, or intolerance to vitamin D3\n      supplements).\n\n      Design:\n\n      Participants eligible for D2d will be randomly assigned to either vitamin D3 supplementation\n      (4,000 international units daily by mouth) or placebo. Participants and staff will be\n      blinded to treatment assignment. Both intervention groups will be offered education on\n      lifestyle changes to prevent diabetes.\n\n      Participants will be followed every 6 months at a formal clinic visit at which blood will be\n      drawn for fasting glucose and HbA1c. At annual visits a 75-gm 2-hour oral glucose tolerance\n      test will also be done.\n\n      Outcome Parameters:\n\n      The primary outcome of the study will be time to onset of type 2 diabetes. Diabetes will be\n      diagnosed if a participant has a fasting plasma glucose of at least 126 mg/dl, a 2-hour\n      glucose of at least 200 mg/dl, or a HbA1c of at least 6.5%, confirmed. Secondary outcomes\n      will include variability in response to vitamin D3 supplementation by baseline\n      characteristics and by adherence to the intervention."

The planning committee selected 50 mL/min as the\n        exclusion cutoff to ensure that participants maintain GFR >  40 mL/min during the study.\n        Please note: to prevent potential confusion, GFR units will be denoted as mL/min\n        throughout the protocol and associated documents.\n\n        31.-Hypercalcemia, defined as serum calcium concentration greater than or equal to the\n        upper limit of normal, measured at the clinical site   s laboratory.\n\n        Hypercalciuria, defined as spot urine (morning void) calcium-creatinine ratio >  0.275.\n\n        Other\n\n        33.-Participation (within 30 days of screening) in another interventional research study.\n\n        34.-Previous randomization in the D2d study.
