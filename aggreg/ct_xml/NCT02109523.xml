  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) surgery is often performed in elderly patients, but
      non-adherence to post-CABG guideline medications is a common and serious clinical concern in
      this age group. A recent systematic review found that higher medication adherence
      significantly improved primary and secondary prevention of coronary artery disease outcomes
      in all the included studies. Another systematic review  assessed studies published from
      1999-2009 about motivational interviews, such as implementation intention, in relation to
      cardiovascular health. They found that motivational interview was an effective means of
      changing behavior, while offering promise in improving cardiovascular health status. The
      study is aimed to investigate effectiveness of long term volitional intervention in proving
      medication adherence in the CABG patient.

    <description>In order to facilitate behavior change by the patients a Motivational Interviewing (MI) is designed to resolve patient ambivalence about change. The interview is conducted individually face to face by an experienced trainer. The MI was used a semi-structured format and lasting for 40 minutes for a single session (the first session). The counselors ask participants to express what they want to discuss about. Moreover, counselors ask some questions which were important in the patient's life (e.g. what they will do after discharge, what they think about their life). These questions help the counselors to make a confident relationship between the counselors and patients. Furthermore, the counselors try to elicit adolescent's concerns on their current situations by asking some questions (What concerns you about your current situation? What are some reasons you might see for making a change? How do you feel about your treatment?)</description>

    <description>The second session will be based on action and coping planning strategies, according to the theoretical principles of implementation intention (Sniehotta et al. 2006), a self-regulatory strategy that matches concrete responses to possible future situations. Our intervention consists of two face-to-face meetings (at baseline, during the person's visit to the clinic). With the help of one of the authors, at the baseline interview, participants in the intervention group elaborate up to three action plans about when, where and how they intended to take their medication prescribed for cardioprotection and symptom relief of CAD. Similarly, participants identify up to three barriers to take the medication. Then, one or more strategies to overcome each barrier were identified, to accomplish the coping planning strategy. The number of barriers is limited to three because many of the participants are older adults and would have difficulty in memorizing too many strategies (Scholz et al. 2005).</description>
