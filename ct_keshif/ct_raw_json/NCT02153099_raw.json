This study will look at side effects and lab results in people who took\n      ENV8058. This study was designed as a randomized, sequential-panel, single rising dose\n      study.\n\n      The study population will consist of 5 Cohorts with 8 participants in each Cohort; with 6\n      participants randomized to receive a single dose of ENV8058, and 2 participants to receive\n      placebo. Participants in each Cohort will receive a single dose of study drug after a\n      10-hour fast. The starting dose is 15 mg followed by administrations of 45, 135, 270 and 400\n      mg.\n\n        -  ENV8058: 15, 45, 135, 270 or 400 mg oral solution\n\n        -  Placebo (dummy inactive) - this oral solution looks like the study drug but has no\n           active ingredient\n\n      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United States. The overall time to\n      participate in this study is up to 14 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic,\n      including one 5-day period of confinement to the clinic. All participants will be contacted\n      by telephone 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment."
