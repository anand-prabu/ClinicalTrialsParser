Evaluate\n      and quantify the toxicity of GPX-100 in this patient population. III. Identify any changes\n      in disease status in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter, dose escalation study. Patients receive GPX-100\n      IV once every 3 weeks. Patients receive 2 courses of treatment in the absence of disease\n      progression or dose limiting toxicity. Treatment may continue for up to 6 courses (4 courses\n      with prior doxorubicin) in patients with responding or non-progressing disease. One patient\n      is entered at each of the first 3 dose levels. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are entered at\n      subsequent dose levels. The maximum tolerated dose of GPX-100 is defined as the dose at\n      which no more than 2 instances of dose limiting toxicity are observed in 6 patients.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
