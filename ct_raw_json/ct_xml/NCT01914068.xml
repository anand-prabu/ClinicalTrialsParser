  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients' ability to tolerate surgery is associated with physical fitness: less fit patients
      have an increased rate of death and serious complications following major surgery. Combined
      chemotherapy and radiotherapy (x-rays) prior to rectal cancer surgery is known as
      neo-adjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NACRT) and is associated with improved cancer removal but
      adversely affects physical fitness. In Liverpool, the investigators have pre-pilot data
      showing that NACRT reduces objectively measured physical fitness (measured by
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing) in patients having surgery. This pre-pilot study
      investigated the effects of a 6-week structured responsive endurance training programme
      (SRETP) after NACRT and before cancer surgery. This programme has improved both their
      fitness and their health related quality of life(HRQL). Now, the investigators are
      undertaking a randomised controlled trial to compare changes in patient's physical fitness
      in response to SRETP with a group of patients who will be given exercise advice. The SRETP
      group will exercise 3 times a week for 9 weeks. The investigators will make objective
      measurements of physical fitness in both groups. The investigators will monitor patient's
      perceptions of the training programme, HRQL, daily activity (using an accelerometer), and
      outcomes after surgery. The investigators believe that, patients in the exercise group will
      improve their physical fitness prior to surgery, change behaviour towards exercise, improve
      activity and HRQL following NACRT. These results will contribute to the design of a large,
      multi-centre trial to determine whether a SRETP increases physical fitness with a reduction
      in adverse outcome following surgery. The investigators will conduct an adequately powered
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a SRETP with 'exercise advice' in 46 rectal
      cancer patients. Specifically, we will test the following hypotheses and outcomes: PRIMARY
      HYPOTHESIS A 9-week, structured responsive endurance training programme (SRETP) compared
      with a control group (no training) will result in a clinically significant difference in
      physical fitness (2.0ml/kg/min VO2 at LT) post-NACRT prior to surgery.

      SECONDARY OUTCOMES

        1. A 9-week SRETP compared with a control group (no training) will result in a clinically
           significant difference in physical fitness (2.0ml/kg/min VO2Peak) in patients who have
           had NACRT prior to surgery.

        2. SRETP following NACRT and prior to cancer surgery will provide psychological health
           benefits and improve patient's HRQL (assessed by semi-structured interviews and
           questionnaires -EORTC QLQ-30 and EQ-5D). This will provide vital exploratory
           information that will inform a future application to deliver a larger appropriately
           powered RCT exploring the hypothesis that patients with greater pre-operative fitness
           will encounter lower postoperative morbidity and mortality. Specifically, these
           exploratory outcomes are:

      EXPLORATORY OUTCOMES

        1. To investigate whether SRETP following NACRT and prior to surgery is associated with a
           change in overall physical activity (assessed by the number of steps while active using
           an accelerometer).

        2. To investigate whether there is a change in the day 7 surgical morbidity (using the
           Post-Operative Morbidity Survey) and mortality.

        3. The effect of SRETP on cancer downstaging post-NACRT (Tumour, Node and Metastasis
           Staging-TNM staging).
