  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the advent of effective antiretroviral treatment for HIV has come a marked increase in
      the number of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA), with the highest prevalence since the
      epidemic began of more than 1.2 million. While PLWHA survive longer, they also experience
      increased burdens of chronic conditions related to lifestyle factors, treatment side
      effects, and age. PLWHA are a population at great risk for high symptom burden, impaired
      coping and social functioning, decreased quality of life, and inadequate end-of-life care.
      The remarkable shift in attitudes towards HIV, from an inevitably fatal disease to a chronic
      condition, has been accompanied by a lessening emphasis on symptom management and
      end-of-life planning. However, while mortality from AIDS-defining conditions has decreased,
      PLWHA continue to have unaddressed needs for coordinated care, symptom management and
      proactive advance care planning.  Palliative care, focused on comprehensive management of
      physical, psychological, social, and spiritual needs of persons with incurable, progressive
      illnesses, is a health service uniquely designed to meet these needs. This research project
      will test a model of early palliative care for PLWHA at high risk of mortality and
      morbidity. First, focus group methods will be used to explore views of PLWHA regarding their
      needs for symptom management and social support, and attitudes towards advance care planning
      and end-of-life concerns. We will then conduct a randomized trial of a novel HIV Navigation
      Program, which will be a modification of an existing navigation program that uses trained
      and experienced volunteers as a core component, offered by a large, comprehensive hospice
      and palliative care organization. The specific aims of this study are 1) to identify needs
      and preferences for palliative care and advance care planning of PLWHA, in order to tailor
      an existing Patient Navigation Program to the specific needs of PLWHA with chronic
      conditions; and 2) to test the effect of an HIV Patient Navigation Program intervention on
      outcomes of quality of life, symptom burden, coping ability, and advance care planning; and
      3) to determine if effectiveness of the HIV Navigation Program intervention differs by age,
      gender, ethnicity, education, income level, and level of palliative care service need.
      Because of the increasing prevalence of HIV coexisting with chronic conditions, there is an
      urgent need to assess palliative care needs and preferences of PLWHA and design effective
      interventions. This interdisciplinary study will test, at the community level, a novel
      health service designed to meet the unique needs of chronically ill PLWHA, and improve and
      support advance care planning. Results from this study will increase understanding of who
      are PLWHA at highest risk for need of palliative services and provide a model for providing
      early palliative care support for PLWHA.

    <description>Subjects randomized to the intervention / patient navigation arm will be formally &quot;admitted&quot; to the navigation program, provided through a local community partner agency. Each of these subjects will be assigned an advanced practice registered nurse (APRN) and licensed social worker (LSW) as co-case managers, with their relative contributions depending on the nature of the subject's needs. Level of need will be confirmed for each patient. Depending on the level of need (1,2 or 3) a varying amount of in-person and phone call contacts will be made to provide on-going support and monitoring of patients.
Additionally, this group will meet with the research team for data collection at enrollment and at four 9-month intervals for a total of 5 time points.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Usual Care</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>The control group will receive &quot;usual care&quot; - medical care and support provided by their primary care provider. They will not be exposed to any of the navigation program services. To provide control for the effects of attention, we will contact these subjects at baseline, one week after enrollment, and every other month thereafter, either by phone or during their regularly scheduled appointments with the primary care provider. During these contacts, we will ask about resource use (hospitalizations, clinic and emergency department visits) and medication adherence and ask a scripted &quot;social&quot; query (e.g. &quot;How are things going for you?&quot;). A subject who raises any health issues or need for specific information will be referred to the primary care provider.
Additionally, this group will meet with the research team for data collection at enrollment and at four 9-month intervals for a total of 5 time points.</description>
