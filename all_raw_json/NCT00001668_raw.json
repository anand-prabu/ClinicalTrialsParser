Binding of the VHL proteins\n      to two subunits of this elongation factor inhibits transcription and may play a crucial role\n      in the clinical development of the von Hippel Lindau phenotype."

Other agents will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for their potential to\n        cause ototoxicity and thereby interfere with audiologic data interpretation.\n\n        Patients with an ELST in an only hearing ear will be excluded from the protocol for\n        surgical treatment of ELST's (except in cases where other medical indications necessitate\n        intervention for the welfare of the patient).\n\n        Patients with only unilateral vestibular function on the side affected by the ELST, as\n        documented by caloric ENG testing, will be excluded from the surgical treatment group in\n        most cases.\n\n        No patients with the inability to understand all of the requirements of the study or\n        inability to give informed consent and/or comply with all aspects of the evaluation."
