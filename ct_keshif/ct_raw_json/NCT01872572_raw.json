The study originally planned to enroll 4 cohorts of 8 subjects each\n      (N=32); however, upon review cohort (Cohort 1-A) was necessary in order to fully define the\n      PK profile of SC RB006. Therefore, 36 subjects were enrolled in this study.\n\n      Each cohort was balanced by sex with no more than 2/3 of one sex enrolled in any particular\n      cohort (i.e., 5 of 8 subjects in each cohort).  No subject participated in >1 dose group,\n      and progression to the next higher dose only occurred if the prior dose level was well\n      tolerated, as assessed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC)"
