No external\n      intervention is planned for control facilities, although enhanced monitoring, surveillance\n      and data collection will occur throughout the study in all facilities in the four districts.\n\n      The package includes 3 interventions: 1) To train health care professionals in emergency\n      obstetric and perinatal care using an innovative high-fidelity, low-tech, in situ,\n      multidisciplinary simulation training curriculum (PRONTO); 2) To design and implement a\n      social marketing strategy that promotes institution-based delivery; and 3) To integrate the\n      role of obstetric nurse and professional midwife in intervention communities to act as\n      liaisons between traditional birth attendants (TBA) and public health units. A fourth,\n      cross-cutting component involves ongoing analysis, monitoring, surveillance and evaluation\n      to strengthen information systems and monitor perinatal outcomes throughout the two years of\n      the study."
