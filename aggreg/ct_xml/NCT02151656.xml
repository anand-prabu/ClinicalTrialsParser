          -  For a minimum of 1 year and maximum 5 years, well-documented diagnosis with the first
             hospitalization for acute exacerbation of schizophrenia

          -  Since the diagnosis of schizophrenia, the average number of hospitalisations should

             weeks prior to Visit 1

          -  No significant improvement of PANSS total score between enrolment (Visit 1) and
             inclusion (Visit 2) corresponding to a score improvement &lt; 20% on positive symptoms
