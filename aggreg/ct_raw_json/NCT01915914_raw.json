            "textblock": "Background Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic relapsing skin disease caused by the\n      intervention of plural unspecific stimulation or specific allergens accompanied with\n      cutaneous physiologic dysfunction.  AD is one of the most common skin diseases which effects\n      up to 20% of Children and 1-3% of adults in most of countries of the world. The data from a\n      Chinese epidemiologic research shows the prevalence rate of AD is 10.9%in school-age\n      adolescent and 15.3%  in preschool children in 2010.\n\n      Around 65% patients with AD develop the symptoms in the first year of life; and 90% patients\n      develop the symptoms before 5 years of age. Onset of atopic dermatitis in adolescence or\n      later is uncommon.\n\n      The objective of treatment in AD is to relief symptoms and reduces the cutaneous\n      inflammation.  Emollients as the mainstay of maintenance therapy are able to restore  skin\n      barrier function. Topical glucocorticoids recommended as first line treatment are important\n      anti-inflammatory drugs to be used in AD, especially in the acute phase.\n\n      One of the most troublesome features of AD is its chronic relapsing nature suggesting the\n      need for a long-term therapy of this disease. The common long-term treatment of AD is a\n      reactive treatment approach based on the daily application of emollients accompanied by the\n      application of topical glucocorticoids (TCS) or calcineurin inhibitors (TCI) 'as needed'.\n      However, a new alternative treatment 'proactive therapy' has been proven its effective and\n      well-tolerated to reduce AD relapse in clinical trials   and recommended by guidelines.\n\n      This proactive therapy starts with an intensive topical anti-inflammatory therapy until all\n      lesions have virtually cleared, followed by long-term, low-dose intermittent application of\n      anti-inflammatory drugs to previous affected and now clinically healthy-looking skin\n      combined with daily application of emollients to always unaffected areas.\n\n      Latest Chinese guideline of AD recommends the application of emollients or moisturizers in\n      both the acute and maintenance phase, and intermittent application of topical\n      corticosteroids with daily use of emollients and moisturizers as the first-line option of AD\n      therapy.\n\n      However, the concept of 'proactive therapy' of AD has not been well accepted by Chinese\n      dermatologists. In context, the studies demonstrated 'proactive therapy' efficacy has been\n      done mainly in Caucasian subjects instead of in Chinese population. For this reason, there\n      still exist unmet medical needs to generate data on combination use of fluticasone\n      propionate with moisturizer in AD maintenance therapy in China.\n\n      Rationale Fluticasone propionate (FP) is a synthetic fluorinated corticosteroid of medium\n      strength for the topical treatment of skin disease. The established glucocorticoids showed\n      anti-inflammatory, anti-proliferative and immunosuppressive effects.  FP has been\n      demonstrated havinga moderate anti-inflammatory effect associated with good compliance among\n      patients, a low incidence of cross-sensitivity reactions and a weak atrophogenicity.\n\n      FP does not show a significant effect on the hypothalamic pituitary axis (HPA), due to its\n      lipophilicity, and its rapid hepatic biotransformation, reflecting a favourable ratio\n      between topical and systemic activity. The results from a clinical trial with moderate to\n      severe AD demonstrate that FP does not cause any major local side-effect. First-line therapy\n      of AD in paediatric patients consist of the application of a mildly to moderately potent\n      topical glucocorticoid combined with emollients . FP cream 0.05% has also been proven safe\n      for the treatment of moderate to severe AD for up to 4 weeks in children 3 months of age and\n      older.\n\n      More than one study has been demonstrated the efficacy and safety of FP 0.05% cream for\n      proactive therapy of AD. A large multicentre study compared an intermittent dosing regimen\n      of FP 0.05% cream (twice per week) with its drug-free vehicle in reducing the risk of\n      relapse in adults and children (44% and 66% respectively) aged 3 months to 65 years with\n      moderate or severe, but stabilized AD. Both regimens were added to regular daily emollient.\n      The results showed patients receiving intermittent FP cream in the maintenance phase were\n      7.7 times (paediatric patients even 8.1 times) less likely to have an AD relapse compared\n      with patients under vehicle cream. And the maintenance therapy with FP turned out to be safe\n      and well-tolerated.\n\n      Subsequent similar large scale study was to compare the efficacy and safety of both FP 0.05%\n      cream and 0.005% ointment in reducing the risk of relapses. The difference was that only\n      patients aged 12-65 years with moderate to severe AD who were experiencing a flare were\n      enrolled. FP 0.05% was more effective in reducing relapses than FP 0.005%: the former\n      reducing the risk of relapses six fold and the latter two fold compared with emollient\n      alone. Median time to relapse was 6 weeks for emollient alone compared with more than 16\n      weeks for additional FP. Both medications were well-tolerated with a low risk of local\n      adverse effects.\n\n      First-line therapy of AD in paediatric patients consist of the application of a mildly to\n      moderately potent topical glucocorticoid combined with emollients . Except for topical\n      glucocorticoid, emollients are the basic treatment of AD, which have been recommended and\n      emphasized by almost all the AD guidelines. PHYSIOGEL lotion, as a hypoallergenic emollient,\n      contains physiological lipids, which mimics the structure and composition of the skin's\n      protective lipid barrier with DMS (Dermal Membrane Structure) technique. PHYSIOGEL lotion\n      provides immediate and long lasting moisture to prevent skin dryness, which has been\n      recommended by dermatologists in AD adjunctive daily care. It is advised to apply a thin\n      film of PHYSIOGEL lotion once to twice daily ideally for people of all ages with dry,\n      sensitive and barrier dysfunction skin (including people suffering from AD).\n\n      In summary, a superiority of a proactive therapy with combination of FP and emollient over\n      the drug-free vehicle or emollient alone has been demonstrated. Proactive therapy with FP\n      prevented, delayed, and reduced the occurrence of exacerbations and AD relapses without any\n      obvious safety concerns. Besides, PHYSIOGEL lotion, an emollient with physiological lipids\n      and DMS technology, has good efficacy in repairing skin barrier. In this regard, it is\n      possibly meaningful to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of a FP and PHYSIOGEL lotion\n      combination in reducing AD relapse.\n\n      OBJECTIVE(S) This study is aimed to demonstrate the risk of AD relapse can be significantly\n      reduced by extended intermittent dosing with Fluticasone propionate (FP) 0.05% cream in\n      addition to regular emollient therapy (PHYSIOGEL lotion) in the maintenance treatment (20\n      weeks) of atopic dermatitis (AD) as compared with application of emollient alone.\n\n      The secondary objective is to evaluate the safety of FP 0.05% cream and emollient\n      combination usage in AD maintenance treatment and determine the optimal treatment regimen in\n      Chinese paediatric patients with AD.\n\n      Study Design This is an open-label, randomized, comparative study. The study includes 4\n      phases: SCREENING, ACUTE, MAINTENANCE and FOLLOW-UP.\n\n      After subjects sign the written informed consent form (Visit 1), they will enter the\n      SCREENING phase to check the eligibility within 7 days before the 1st dose of FP 0.05%\n      cream. During SCREENING phase, investigator will collect subjects' demographic data, medical\n      history, Atopic Dermatitis' diagnosis and treatment history, concomitant medications.\n      Investigator needs to assess AD Severity and conduct physical examination. Substance abuse\n      will be evaluated. And pregnant test must be conducted to check for Women of childbearing\n      potential (WOCBP).\n\n      -Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must be using an adequate method of contraception\n      to avoid pregnancy throughout the study (and for up to 6 weeks after the last dose of\n      investigational product) in such a manner that the risk of pregnancy is minimized.\n\n      WOCBP include any female who has experienced menarche and who has not undergone successful\n      surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy)\n      or is not postmenopausal.\n\n      Women who are using oral contraceptives, other hormonal contraceptives (vaginal products,\n      skin patches, or implanted or injectable products), or mechanical products such as an\n      intrauterine device or barrier methods (diaphragm, condoms, spermicides) to prevent\n      pregnancy, or are practicing abstinence or  here their partner is sterile (e.g., vasectomy)\n      should be considered to be of childbearing potential.\n\n      The Visit 2 will be occurred before the 1st dose of FP 0.05% cream. At Visit 2, investigator\n      needs to evaluate Eczema Area, AD Severity and Visual Skin Assessment. Vital signs will be\n      measured and recorded. Subjects need to complete the questionnaire of QoL under the\n      investigator's instruction. Investigator must confirm subjects' eligibility for ACUTE phase\n      after all of inclusion and exclusion criteria have been checked.\n\n      All subjects eligible for ACUTE phase will receive twice daily FP 0.05% cream. FP 0.05%\n      cream will be applied to affected sites and any newly occurring AD sites.\n\n      The efficacy and safety in ACUTE phase will be assessed every 2 weeks up to 4 weeks or until\n      Treatment Success dependent on which time point comes first. At each visit (Visit 3,\n      W-2\u00b12days; Visit 4, W0\u00b12days) in ACUTE phase, investigator needs to assess Eczema Area, AD\n      Severity, Visual Skin Assessment, and conduct physical examination, vital sign measurement.\n      Randomization will be processed once investigator confirms the subject's eligibility for\n      MAINTENANCE phase.\n\n      The day of randomization is D0 in MAINTENANCE phase. If patients achieve Treatment Success\n      and meet the criteria of MAINTENANCE phase during the visit intervals of ACUTE phase, Visit\n      4 can be moved earlier than scheduled date. If the time of treatment success is within 2\n      weeks after Visit 2, the subject can enter Visit 4 directly by skipping Visit 3.\n\n      If patients don't achieve Treatment Success for 4-week FP 0.05% cream treatment, they will\n      be discontinued study treatment and conduct End of Therapy Visit. The subjects eligible for\n      MAINTENANCE phase will be 1:1 randomized to receive either emollient twice daily plus  FP\n      0.05% cream once daily twice a week (Group A), or emollient twice daily (Group B). FP 0.05%\n      cream will be applied to all healed sites and any newly occurring sites.\n\n      The efficacy and safety in MAINTENANCE phase will be assessed every 4 weeks up to 20 weeks\n      or until AD relapse dependent on which time point comes first. At each visit (V5, W4\u00b12days;\n      V6, W8\u00b12days; V7, W12\u00b12days; V8,W16\u00b12days;V9,W20\u00b12days), Investigator needs to evaluate\n      Eczema Area, AD Severity, Visual Skin Assessment, and conduct physical examination, vital\n      sign measurement. The questionnaire of QoL needs to be completed by subjects at the end of\n      maintenance phase.\n\n      In MAINTENANCE phase, once subjects experience AD Relapse, they will be discontinued study\n      treatment and conduct End of Therapy Visit.\n\n      On the contrary, if subjects don't experience relapse during MAINTENANCE phase, all of them\n      will enter FOLLOW-UP phase applying emollient twice daily.\n\n      The efficacy and safety in FOLLOW-UP phase will be assessed every 4 weeks up to 12 weeks or\n      until AD relapse dependent on which time point comes first. At each visit (V10, W24\u00b15days;\n      V11, W28\u00b15days; V12, W32\u00b15days), investigator needs to evaluate Eczema Area, AD Severity,\n      Visual Skin Assessment, and conduct physical examination, vital sign measurement.In\n      FOLLOW-UP phase, once subjects experience AD relapse, they will be discontinued study\n      treatment and conduct End of Therapy Visit.\n\n      At End of Therapy Visit, investigator needs to evaluate Eczema Area, AD Severity, Visual\n      Skin Assessment, and conduct physical examination, vital sign measurement. Subjects need to\n      complete the questionnaire of QoL and Subjects' post-study evaluation to drug.\n\n      Subjects need to conduct Early Withdrawal Visit once they meet Withdrawal Criteria. At Early\n      Withdrawal Visit, investigator needs to evaluate Eczema Area, AD Severity, Visual Skin\n      Assessment, and conduct physical examination, vital sign measurement. Subjects need to\n      complete the questionnaire of QoL and Subjects' post-study evaluation to drug.\n\n      At each study visit, concomitant medications will be collected after receiving subject's\n      written informed consent form, and AEs should be collected and documented after the first\n      dose of FP. For the female subjects who has experienced menarche, urine pregnant test need\n      to be done when subjects enter the study and be repeated at the end of the entire study. If\n      the result is positive, the subject will quit from the study. The treatment compliance will\n      be evaluated at each visit after the 1st dose of FP 0.05% cream.\n\n      Total study duration is up to 37 weeks."
