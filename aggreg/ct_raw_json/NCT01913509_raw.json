            "textblock": "Hemiplegic shoulder pain affects from 16%-84% of stroke patients and fatigue occurs among\n      39%-72% of stroke victims, which can have an adverse impact on rehabilitation outcomes by\n      interrupting treatment process, daily functions, and quality of life (QOL) for stroke\n      patients. Considering the high prevalence and detrimental effects of poststroke shoulder\n      pain and fatigue, it is vital for monitoring these symptoms and therapeutic interventions to\n      be developed for those suffering from poststroke pain and fatigue. Therefore, to validate\n      existing assessments of pain/fatigue, and to evaluate the efficacy of potential pain/fatigue\n      interventions are needed.\n\n      A vertical Numerical Rating Scale with Face Rating Scale (NRS-FRS) could be used by all\n      stroke patients as pain and fatigue measurement. The Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) and Brief\n      Fatigue Inventory (BFI) measure intensity and interference, which might provide more\n      information. The first aim of this research will be to examine the psychometric properties\n      of the vertical NRS-FRS, BPI, and BFI.\n\n      Functional electrical stimulation (FES) appears to offer benefits in relieving painful\n      hemiplegic shoulder. Electrical stimulation of the posterior deltoid and supraspinatus\n      muscles has shown beneficial effects on pain, subluxation, range of motion, and arm\n      function. It is suggested that graded treadmill training (GTT) could be useful in relieving\n      fatigue by improving fitness reserve and lowering of the energy cost of hemiparetic gait.\n      For non-ambulatory stroke patients, body weight supported treadmill training (BWSTT) is an\n      encouraging intensive, task-specific practice. Therefore, the second aim of this research\n      will investigate whether the combined therapy of FES and GTT (FES-GTT) or that of FES and\n      BWSTT (FES-BWSTT) could reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain and poststroke fatigue as compared\n      with conventional rehabilitation (CR). Whether interventions could lead to better functional\n      performance and higher QOL would be of interest.\n\n      This 3-year project will be implemented in four stages and will recruit 160 patients with\n      chronic stroke. At the first stage, we will conduct a test-retest study to investigate the\n      reliability and validity of outcome measures on hemiplegic shoulder pain and poststroke\n      fatigue in 80 patients. At the second stage, we will conduct a randomized controlled trial\n      (RCT) to investigate the relative effects of the FES-GTT versus CR for 40 ambulatory stroke\n      patients with hemiplegic shoulder pain, poststroke fatigue, and moderate-to-mild motor\n      impairment. At the third stage, we will conduct another RCT to investigate the relative\n      effects of the FES-BWSTT versus CR for 40 non-ambulatory stroke patients with hemiplegic\n      shoulder pain, poststroke fatigue, and moderate motor impairment. Treatment regimens will be\n      designed to ensure that patients in the 2 groups at stage 2 and 3 receive an equivalent\n      intensity of treatment (1 hour/day, 3 days/week for 4 weeks). The fourth stage determines\n      clinimetric properties of the outcome measures."
