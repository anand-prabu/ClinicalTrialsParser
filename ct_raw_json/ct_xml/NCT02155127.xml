  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects more than 26 million individuals (13 percent) of the
      U.S. population, with a projected 70 percent increase by the year 2015 to over 40 million
      individuals.  Impairments in physical function and mobility limitations have been reported
      in older Chronic Kidney Disease patients, however the consequences of impaired functioning
      on participation in daily life and quality of life have not been studied.  Early
      identification and interventions to mitigate deterioration in physical function and mobility
      should lead to improved health and quality of life outcomes in older patients with Chronic
      Kidney Disease.  Although older individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease have reduced
      survival expectancy, maintaining physical function and mobility may contribute to longer
      active life expectancy, and higher quality of life despite their diagnosis.
