The chemotherapy regimen used in our institution, called DCF\n      (docetaxel,cisplatic, 5-fluorouracil) is active, resulting in tumor reduction and dysphagia\n      relief. however, it is toxic, causing approximately half of patients severe inflammation of\n      the mucosa (lining) of the mouth and gut. This results, in turn, in mouth sores, vomiting\n      and diarrhea. Similar regimen called FLOT (5-FU, oxaliplatin,docetaxel) appears to be at\n      least equally active, but less toxic.\n\n      Our ultimate plan is to perform a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT. Before embarking\n      upon this, we are conducting this pilot trial in 10 subjects with the FLOT regimen. If less\n      than 5 patients develop severe mouth sores, vomiting or diarrhea, plans will be made to\n      proceed with the next trial, a randomized comparison of DCF and FLOT"
