  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity in the developed world has increased markedly over the last 20
      years. Considering the prevalence of obese and overweight adult subjects, and the fact that
      pregnancy itself induces a state of insulin resistance and inflammation, maternal obesity
      may be the most common health risk for the developing fetus. It is well established that
      what we eat has a major impact on our health. However, there is growing evidence to suggest
      that diet during pregnancy and lactation may be particularly important as not only does it
      influence the health of the mother, it may have a permanent effect on the health of her
      children and even her grandchildren. The concept that environmental factors, such as
      nutrition during early development, influence both our health span and lifespan has been
      termed the developmental origins of health and disease hypothesis.

      The objective of the study are:

        -  to compare subjects with frailty (condition developed with ageing) with controls and
           characterize the unhealthy aged condition with the measurements described below

        -  to examine if signs of frailty can be reversed by lifestyle induced modifications
           (exercise training programme) of its primary components (IR, sarcopenia, psychological
           profile) in offspring of overweight/obese vs lean mothers.

      The study consists of 40 frail old subjects, age ≥ 65 sub-grouped in 20 offspring of
      overweight and obese mothers during pregnancy, and 20 offspring of lean mothers and 15 non
      frail controls. These subjects will be studied with positron emission tomography (PET),
      computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and spectroscopy (MRS) and ultra
      sounds (US). In addition functional MRI (fMRI) will be performed. Subjects will be
      physically examined and anthropometric data will be measured along with blood sampling.
      Adipose tissue biopsies will be taken.

      Subjects will undergo characterization of biohumoral markers, a 75 g oral glucose tolerance
      test, imaging biomarkers (PET/CT, US, fMRI-MRS), genetic biomarkers (DNA and telomere
      damage) and inflammatory biomarkers (macrophage infiltration) before and after the 4-month
      lifestyle intervention period (physical exercise). By PET/CT it will be measured
      tissue-specific IR in skeletal muscle, adipose tissue, liver, intestine, myocardium and
      targeted brain regions. MRS will be used to measure organ steatosis in the skeletal muscle
      and liver, MRI will be used to measure fat masses in the visceral and subcutaneous abdominal
      areas, and skeletal muscle masses in the legs, and fMRI will be performed to assess
      activation in brain regions regulating cognition and appetite/energy control. US will be
      used to assess cardiovascular markers (IMT, strain and function). Absolute and body weight
      normalized values as well as fat/muscle mass ratios will indicate the diagnosis of
      sarcopenic obesity. Frailty related osteopenia will be measured via CT. CT will be used to
      measure fat masses around the heart and calcium score.
