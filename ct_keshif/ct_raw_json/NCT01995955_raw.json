Injections of 3 mL of room-temperature saline were made down the coronary artery, and the resting mean transit time (Tmn) was measured. CFR was calculated as resting Tmn divided by hyperemic Tmn. FFR was calculated by the ratio of Pd/Pa at maximal hyperemia.IMR was defined as distal coronary pressure multiplied by the hyperemic mean transit time (mm Hg \u2022 seconds, or units [U]). Myocardial Heterogeneity Index (Hi) was measured by an automated analysis developed in our research unit. Hi was finally calculated from images SPECT using a Markovian analysis. For this study Hi is given by the equation: Hi = \u03a3m [1/(1+m)2]Pd(m).",
