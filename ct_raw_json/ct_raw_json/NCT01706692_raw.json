This includes conventional systemic therapy\n      such as fumaric acids, methotrexate, cyclosporin A, retinoids, systemic PUVA, Acitretin and\n      biological treatments such as etanercept, infliximab, adalimumab and within a\n      pre-registration program ustekinumab. While short- and middle-term efficacy of most systemic\n      treatments has been shown in clinical studies (and is incorporated in international\n      guidelines), knowledge about long-term outcomes, optimal treatment and effectiveness under\n      real-world conditions is still missing. SDNTT, the Swiss registry on the treatment of\n      moderate to severe Pso and PsA documents the long-term course of patients being administered\n      a defined biologic or conventional systemic drug. Following outcomes are observed:\n      Effectiveness on the long-term, of combined/alternating treatments and under comorbidity\n      conditions; patient-defined benefits and quality of life, maintenance dosages, prediction of\n      response and safety.\n\n      The study evaluates the long-term course of patients with Pso and PsA in systemic\n      treatments. A patient will be included at first initiation of the treatment and will remain\n      in the registry for 5 years, regardless of subsequent therapy. Nationwide, initially 35\n      (long-term approx. 50-80) dermatologic practices and hospital ambulances with expertise in\n      systemic and biologic treatment will consecutively enroll patients. Follow-ups will be every\n      3 months, comprising patient and treatment characteristics, clinical parameters,\n      patient-defined benefit, quality of life and adverse events. Standardized questionnaires\n      will be addressed to the patient and to the dermatologist 12 times at the dermatologic\n      centres. In interim intervals, patients are directly contacted another 9 times by mail."
