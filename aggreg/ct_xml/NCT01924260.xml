      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of alisertib when given
      together with gemcitabine hydrochloride in treating patients with solid tumors or pancreatic
      cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by surgery. Alisertib may stop the growth of
      tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving
      alisertib with gemcitabine hydrochloride may be an effective treatment for solid tumors or
      pancreatic cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate the feasibility and safety of MLN8237 (alisertib) when given in
      combination with gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) to patients with advanced solid
      tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MLN8237 when given in combination with
      gemcitabine to patients with advanced solid tumors and to recommend a phase II dose for the
      combination.

      II. To obtain preliminary evidence of efficacy as judged by response rate and
      progression-free survival for this combination.

      III. To investigate the pharmacokinetics of MLN8237 given in combination with gemcitabine in
      an expanded cohort of patients with pancreatic cancer.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of alisertib.

      Patients receive gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8,
      and 15 and alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.
