            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Amongst many surgical subspecialties particularly the field of neurosurgery has made major\n      advancements in the last decade in regards to microsurgical techniques such as continuously\n      pushing the boundaries of radical tumor resection while ensuring patient security and\n      functional integrity nonetheless to mention just one aspect. However, once the surgeon has\n      closed up and the patient is transferred to the intensive care or intermediate care unit for\n      observation for the crucial early postoperative hours the brain tissue is exposed to\n      hemodynamic and respirational changes.\n\n      Early postoperative bleeding and brain swelling are the most feared complications after\n      elective craniotomy in neurosurgery. Unfortunately, there is no bedside monitoring to\n      diagnose these complications at a very early state. Patients become symptomatic by a\n      clinical neurological deterioration or an early postoperative seizure. Therefore, much\n      attention has been paid to provide a close monitoring and observation of the patient usually\n      at a critical care unit during the first hours after brain surgery.\n\n      Although not substantiated by hard evidence, the major postoperative strategies are the\n      following:\n\n        1. Parameter oriented: Periods of arterial hypertension, hypoventilation with arterial CO2\n           increase, low oxygen saturation, extensive coughing, pressing, and pain are strictly\n           avoided. In order to achieve this goal the patient remains intubated and sedated during\n           the first hours postoperatively.\n\n        2. Symptom oriented: The awakened patient is monitored clinically as early as possible for\n           a deterioration of consciousness, seizure or the development of a new neurological\n           deficit. Thus, the patient is extubated in a timely fashion postoperatively.\n\n      Evidently, both strategies are opposite to each other, since strategy 1 requires keeping the\n      patient sedated and intubated over a longer period of time and weaning from artificial\n      ventilation is performed at the critical care unit. This hinders early diagnosis of a\n      neurological deterioration and timely action. On the contrary, strategy 2 aims at a very\n      early extubation of the patient immediately after completing the surgical procedure, which\n      exposes the patient to more hemodynamic and cardiopulmonary stress which may lead to a\n      higher likelihood of a secondary neurological injury.\n\n      Since, to the best of the investigators' knowledge, there is no prospective data, depending\n      on the philosophy of the neurosurgeon, the anesthetist and the neuro-intensivist one\n      strategy is preferred over another. For this clinical study, the Department of Neurosurgery\n      Berne is conducting a prospective observational study to show that early tracheal extubation\n      following elective brain surgery is feasible and safe.\n\n      Objective\n\n      The investigators aim to provide prospective data with respect to complications of early\n      extubation and to compare these results to existing data in the literature with the delayed\n      extubation strategy after elective craniotomy. The investigators believe early extubation\n      and continuous clinical monitoring does not coincide with a higher rate of postoperative\n      complications. Furthermore, strategy 2 might even be superior to strategy 1 in that respect.\n      Also, by conducting this clinical trial the investigators hope to get a more profound\n      insight to further improve the postoperative patient management after elective brain\n      surgery.\n\n      The primary endpoint is the incidence of significant postoperative intracranial hemorrhage,\n      brain swelling or seizure leading to either surgical intervention or any new, secondary\n      neurological deficit, coma, palliative care or death related to postoperative events.\n\n      As a secondary endpoint the investigators will assess the role of routine early\n      postoperative CT imaging before transfer to the ward and surgical drains.\n\n      Methods\n\n      This clinical study is designed as a prospective monocenter observational trial. Data as\n      defined in a case report form will be collected of patients undergoing elective craniotomy\n      at the departments of neurosurgery of the University Hospitals in Bern. Patient data\n      collection begins at admission and ends at hospital discharge except for a mortality\n      follow-up of 30 days postoperatively. Statistical analysis will be performed as defined in\n      the study protocol."
