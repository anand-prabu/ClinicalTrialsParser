            "textblock": "Deficits in memory, attention, cognitive, and executive functions are the most common\n      disabilities after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Dopamine (DA) neurotransmission is\n      implicated in these neural functions and dopaminergic pathways are recognized to be\n      frequently disrupted after TBI. One of the most widely used DAergic drugs is methylphenidate\n      (Ritalin\u00ae).  Methylphenidate increases synaptic DA levels by binding to presynaptic dopamine\n      transporters (DAT) and blocking re-uptake. PET with methylphenidate challenge to measure\n      tonic DA release provides valuable insight into the molecular basis of attention-deficit\n      hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and addiction, as well as practical information regarding\n      likely effectiveness of therapy (1). The objectives of this study are to use PET imaging\n      with [11C]-raclopride, a D2/D3 receptor ligand, before and after administering\n      methylphenidate, to measure endogenous DA release in patients who are experiencing problems\n      with cognition, attention and executive function in the chronic stage after TBI.  In\n      addition, we will use TMS to test short intracortical inhibition, a gamma-aminobutyric acid\n      receptor A (GABAA) - mediated phenomenon, which is under partial DA control, as a measure of\n      dopaminergic activity on and off methylphenidate."
