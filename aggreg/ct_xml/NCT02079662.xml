    <textblock>
      The goal of this behavioral research study is to look at the relationship between lifestyle
      factors and cancer-related outcomes, such as the risk of the disease coming back, patient
      quality of life, physical functioning, and bodily reactions (such as hormones and immune
      function).

      Baseline Visit:

      If you are found to be eligible and you agree to take part in this study, you will come in
      to the clinic for the baseline study visit, which will take place before your first
      radiation therapy visit.  During the baseline visit, you will be asked to fill out
      questionnaires about your sleeping habits, how you have been feeling, diet, exercise, and
      the general quality of your life.  This should take about 60-80 minutes. You will be given a
      hand held computer to do this unless you prefer a paper copy. All follow-up questionnaires
      will be delivered electronically, but you can be given paper copies if needed.  You will be
      asked to create a user name and password for use on the password-protected study website.
      All information you enter into this website is encrypted and stored on institutional servers
      to protect your privacy.    You will be able to use this website to contact the study staff,
      access information, schedule appointments, and so on.  You will be taught how to use the
      website in your first orientation visit and any technical support will be available upon
      request.

      You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG - a test to measure the electrical activity of your
      heart), a body composition scan (called a dual-emission x-ray absorptiometry [DEXA] scan) to
      measure your body-fat level, a brief 30-second strength tests of both your upper and lower
      body, and fitness testing (which is performed on a treadmill or stationary bike).  This
      should take up to 90 minutes total.  Women who are able to become pregnant will have a urine
      pregnancy test performed before the DEXA scan.  A DEXA scan has about 1/10 the radiation
      dose of a standard x-ray.  If you are prescribed a DEXA by an outside physician or for some
      other reason are getting a DEXA, please let us know as to avoid excess scans. If you are
      pregnant, you will not have DEXA scans.

      At every study visit, your height and weight will be measured and any swelling in your arms
      will be measured with a device called a perometer.  This device uses a sensor to measure the
      size of your arm.  Your arms will be measured one arm at a time. You will insert your arms
      into a tube-like structure as the sensor slides up and down.   This will take only a few
      minutes and is will not cause any pain.

      Blood (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn for tests to measure hormones and your immune
      system responses. This should take about 15 minutes. You will need to fast for 12 hours
      before this blood draw. You will be provided with healthy snacks after your blood draw.

      Saliva Testing:

      The day after your baseline visit (the day you enrolled), you will be asked to provide
      saliva samples to measure the level of cortisol (a stress hormone).  These saliva samples
      will be collected 4 times a day for 3 days in a row.  You will be asked to collect the
      samples when you first wake up, about 45 minutes later, about 10 hours after waking, and
      then at bedtime. To collect each saliva sample, you will chew on a cotton ball for a few
      seconds and then put the cotton in a small plastic tube. You will write down the times at
      which you took these samples. You will then mail the samples back to MD Anderson in
      postage-paid envelopes that will be provided to you.  The tubes will also be provided at no
      cost to you.  These saliva samples will be destroyed after being studied.

      Fitness Testing:

      You will also wear an accelerometer (a pedometer-like instrument that records activity)
      clipped to your waistline, for 5 days.  The accelerometer will record information about your
      movements.

      Dietary Assessments:

      Within 2 weeks of your consent date, you will be contacted by telephone on 3 random days for
      a dietary recall. A trained nutritionist employed by the Arizona Cancer Center Behavioral
      Measurements Assessment Laboratory will be making this call and will ask you about the foods
      and beverages you have consumed in the last 24 hours.  You do not need to change anything
      about the way you eat for this, and you will not know exactly when they will call.  You will
      receive a phone call from study staff if they are unable to reach you.

      Study Groups:

      After your baseline visit, you will be assigned to 1 of 2 groups:

        -  Group 1 will take part in a Comprehensive Lifestyle Change Program that consists of
           intervention sessions (described below).

        -  Group 2 will take part in the Assessment-Only Program and only take part in the
           follow-up visits (described below).

      Neither you nor the study staff can choose which group you are assigned to.

      Intervention Sessions (Group 1 Only):

      If you are assigned to Group 1, you will first attend an orientation visit where you will
      get to know everyone who will work with you during the study.  Here you will learn how to
      use the website, schedule your own appointments, and log your behaviors in the website. You
      will then have 3-5 days of intervention sessions per week over the course of your radiation
      treatment. The sessions will offer a variety of instruction and counseling including:
      nutritional coaching (one session per week); behavioral therapy (one session per week); yoga
      and meditation practice (2 sessions per week); resistance training (2 sessions per week);
      and a weekly meal sharing and cooking class. You will also be scheduled for a grocery store
      tour.  Each session will take between 1 and 3 hours, depending on that day's combination of
      activities. Each session will include up to 5 study participants and a session leader, but
      some sessions may be conducted one-on-one. All counseling sessions will be done one-one-one.

      You will also be asked to participate in 30-60 minutes of supervised and/or unsupervised
      aerobic exercise up to 6 days a week.   If you choose to participate in classes at a local
      gym, for which we will offer memberships, this will count toward your aerobic training.  We
      will also provide transportation from the clinic if needed.

      After the end of radiation therapy, you will also have either phone or computer-based
      meetings up to 1 time a week for 6 months, and then 1 time a month for 6 more months with
      the study psychologist.  The meeting times are on a flexible schedule.  If you do not have a
      computer and/or internet access, these will be provided to you while you are on study.

      You will have 2-hour face-to-face meetings at all of your follow-up appointments during the
      first year after completing radiation therapy.

      You will be assigned a study coach for each part of the intervention program:

      Physical activity: A coach will work with your individual fitness level to create an
      exercise program for you.  Coaching on strength training may be done during or after you
      finish radiation therapy, and you will be given a pedometer and elastic workout bands to
      help you practice at home.  You will be provided with a gym membership at no cost for up to
      one year after radiation therapy is over, and you will work with community-based coaches.
      You will also be given a voucher for a local athletic shoe store.  After you finish
      radiation therapy, you will be contacted at least once a week by your outside-community
      coach. You will be asked to use your profile on the study website to track your exercise.

      Diet/Nutrition:  You will work with a dietician every week to learn how to shop and cook
      during radiation therapy.   You will be asked to use your profile on the study website to
      track your eating habits.   You will be given cookbooks and a blender along with recipes for
      the blender and kitchen items such as a magnet, grocery tote bag, and water bottle.

      Mind-body practice:  You will meet once a week with a mind-body instructor. During these
      meetings, you will be instructed in a seated meditation and a movement-based practice. You
      will be asked to use your profile on the study website to track your mind-body practice.
      You will be given a yoga mat to facilitate your practice.

      Social support/social network:  You will meet with a psychologist once a week during
      radiation treatment. You will take part in cognitive behavioral therapy to help support the
      behavior changes. You will receive a welcome box including helpful items such as a journal,
      along with the book Anticancer. During this therapy, the psychologist will work with you to
      help you recognize the barriers that may keep you from changing your behavior, so that you
      can understand how to develop new habits.  Although the psychologist will be calling you
      once you have completed your treatment, you can request to have additional consults with any
      one of the study personnel at any time you would like.

      Smoking cessation counseling (if needed): If you smoke, you will be offered smoking
      cessation treatment from the MD Anderson's Tobacco Treatment Program.

      Intervention sessions will be recorded in order to protect you and ensure the program is
      delivered as safely and effectively as possible.  If there is any video recording, it will
      be only to capture your instructor.   Most recordings will only be audio and will again be
      directed at your instructor or counselor.  Once the recordings have been reviewed they will
      be destroyed.

      Follow-up Visits After Finishing Radiation Therapy (Both Groups):

      At the end of radiation treatment, at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months after the end of radiation
      treatment, and then once a year for up to 3 years after that, you will be asked to return to
      the clinic for follow-up visits. These visits will take place at the same time as your
      medical follow-up visits at MD Anderson.

      During these follow-up visits, the following tests will be performed for all participants:

        -  You will fill out a set of questionnaires and fitness measures that was very similar to
           the ones you filled out at baseline. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about
           your sleeping habits, how you have been feeling, your diet and exercise habits, and the
           general quality of your life. This will take about 60-80 minutes to complete.

        -  You will also have an ECG that will take no more than 20 minutes to complete. Blood
           (about 6 tablespoons) will be drawn to measure hormones and your immune system
           responses. You will need to fast for 12 hours before the blood draw.

        -  You will be asked to provide 4 saliva samples a day for 3 days in a row. You will
           follow the same process as you did for the baseline saliva samples.

        -  You will wear an accelerometer 24 hours a day for 5 days in a row to collect the same
           data as before.

        -  You will be receiving 3 calls within 2 weeks of each timepoint for your dietary
           recalls.

      After completing the questionnaires, saliva sample collection, and accelerometer
      participation, you will return all materials to the research staff, using a prepaid mailing
      envelope.  If you fill out the questionnaires electronically, these do not need to be
      printed and returned.

      You will have follow-up DEXA scans to measure body composition at the end of your radiation
      treatment, and then 6, 12, and 24 months later.  Women who are able to become pregnant may
      have urine pregnancy tests before each DEXA scan.  If you are pregnant, you will not have
      DEXA scans during your pregnancy.

      Length of Participation:

      Your participation on this study will be over about 5 years after the end of radiation
      therapy.

      This is an investigational study. Group 1 participants will be provided with a 1-year
      membership to an outside gym at no cost.  If needed, Group 1 participants will also be
      provided with the use of a computer and internet access in order to complete the on-line
      interventions.

      Up to 150 patients will take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.
