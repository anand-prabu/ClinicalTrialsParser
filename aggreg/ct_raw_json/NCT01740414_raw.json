Recent preclinical\n      studies demonstrate that while ibudilast increases the analgesic effects of opioids, it\n      decreases the rewarding effects of such drugs.

A secondary aim\n      is to verify the ability of the drug to decrease opioid withdrawal symptoms during the\n      initial inpatient detoxification.\n\n      This study will include two, 20-day phases. During Phase 1, participants will be detoxified,\n      randomized to receive placebo or 50 mg MN-166 BID (po at 0800 and 2000 hr), and then\n      stabilized on the medication. Thereafter, participants will complete laboratory sessions.\n      Subsequently, during Phase 2, participants will cross over to the other treatment arm (Pbo\n      to MN-166 or MN-166 to Pbo), stabilize, and complete laboratory sessions.\n\n      Days 1-11 of Phase 1 will include a morphine taper and withdrawal assessment, while days\n      12-20 of each phase will consist of 6 laboratory sessions (3 sample sessions and 3 choice\n      sessions). During sample sessions, participants will receive one dose of oxycodone (0, 15,\n      or 30 mg/70 kg, PO) that will be available during the choice session the following day. At\n      least 72 hrs after the previous sample session, the second sample session will be completed,\n      followed by a choice session the next day. And then at least 72 hrs after the second sample\n      session, the third and final sample session will be completed, followed by the final choice\n      session the next day. The analgesic, subjective, performance, and physiological effects of\n      oxycodone will be measured. During the choice session, a drug versus money\n      self-administration paradigm will be employed, and the progressive ratio that is completed\n      for drug and/or money will be measured.\n\n      We hypothesize that MN-166 will dose-dependently decrease oxycodone self-administration and\n      positive subjective responses while increasing the analgesic effects of the drug. We further\n      hypothesize that participants randomized to receive the active dose of MN-166 will exhibit\n      fewer opioid withdrawal symptoms during and subsequent to the morphine taper than those\n      assigned to placebo MN-166.\n\n      A secondary additional objective is to collect exploratory information on potential\n      predictors of prescription opioid self-administration including genetic polymorphisms,\n      neurocognitive functioning, and response to stress. Blood samples will be collected to\n      measure various genetic markers hypothesized to contribute to opioid drug effects (e.g.,\n      OPRM1, OPRD1, OPRK1, PENK, PDYN, DRD2, CYP3A4, and CYP2D6 genes). Performance on\n      neurocognitive tasks and physiological response to the Trier Social Stress Test will be\n      assessed in all participants."
