      We will observe if ICG fluorescence correlates with margins of breast tumours after iv
      injection of the contrast agent

      In the operating room:

      ICG 0.25 mg/kg will be given as an iv injection at least 20 minutes before the beginning of
      the operation.

      The surgeon will remove the tumour (and the axillary lymph nodes) as usual.

      Optionally, peroperative &quot;in vivo&quot; imaging of the dissection of the tumour using the PDE
      camera will be performed.

      In the Laboratory of Pathology:

      The &quot;fresh&quot; tumorectomy piece will be processed as usual, and the thick sections for the
      evaluation of the margins as well as the tissues samples from each margins will be imaged
      using the PDE in comparison with the fluorescence in the mid part of the tumour and the
      fluorescent areas will be so delimited (and later analyzed in comparison with standards of
      known fluorescence intensity).

      After fixation, the tumoral tissues will be thereafter processed &quot;as usual&quot;.

      If fluorescent foci are identified at the level of the axillary piece (in case of CALND),
      they will be dissected and processed as other lymph nodes. Additionally, metastatic lymph
      nodes -if present- will also be controlled for their microscopic fluorescence or not.

      Using the near-infrared fluorescence microscope, the slides corresponding to the
      macroscopically fluorescent structures will be analyzed.

             node dissection,

          -  Informed consent form signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of mammary cancer established by &quot;gross&quot; biopsy,

          -  Age less than18 years old.

          -  Inability to give informed consent.
