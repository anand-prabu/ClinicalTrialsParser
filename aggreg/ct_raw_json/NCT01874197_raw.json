            "textblock": "A physician modified branched thoracic endograft is a commercially available, off-the-shelf\n      endograft that has been altered at the time of the procedure by creating reinforced\n      fenestrations in the graft through which covered stent grafts can be deployed to preserve\n      blood flow into visceral branch vessels. The graft is deployed on a sterile working table in\n      the operating room. The locations of the fenestrations are marked on the graft according to\n      the pre-procedure measurements. The graft fabric is cut and simultaneously heat sealed using\n      thermal Cautery. These fenestrations/cuffs are marked with medical grade metal markers to\n      facilitate fluoroscopic visualization during the procedure. Furthermore, the fenestrations\n      are reinforced with a short ring of PTFE. This added material is essential as it strengthens\n      the fenestration and creates a ring within which the branch grafts can seal. After the\n      fenestrations have been created, marked, and reinforced, additional metal radio-opaque\n      markers are sewn to the graft to assist in device orientation under fluoroscopy. Additional\n      sutures may be used at that time to constrain the endograft, either in a temporary or\n      permanent fashion to facilitate subsequent deployment. The device is the re-constrained and\n      re-sheathed within the original Zenith\u00ae TX2\u00ae delivery sheath.\n\n      The modified stent graft is then deployed to reline the peri-visceral abdominal aorta.\n      Proximal and distal fixation and seal can be achieved using the modified TX2\u00ae device,\n      additional unmodified TX2\u00ae devices and/or the Cook Zenith\u00ae Flex\u00ae or Endologix AFX\u2122 devices\n      depending on the aortic anatomy.\n\n      Once the aortic stent grafts are deployed, the branches are then created. Wires and\n      catheters are used to cross through the reinforced fenestrations into the target visceral\n      arteries. Covered stents are then deployed to extend from the modified aortic graft to the\n      target vessel. The branch stents must create a hemostatic seal with the main endograft as\n      these branches will be constructed within the aneurysm sac. Single or multiple stents may be\n      required for any given branch."
