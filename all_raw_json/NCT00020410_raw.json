Peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of monoclonal antibody therapy and\n      kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed or\n      metastatic breast cancer."

After at least day 7, patients undergo autologous PBSC reinfusion.\n      Patients receive G-CSF SC daily beginning 7 days after PBSC reinfusion and continuing until\n      blood counts recover.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB B3 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 week, 1 month, and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 24-36\n      months."
