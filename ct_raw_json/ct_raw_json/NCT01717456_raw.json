            "textblock": "Fecal incontinence (FI) affects 9% of U.S. adults and occurs weekly or more often in 2.7%.\n      Prevalence increases with age reaching 15% by 70 years. FI has a devastating impact on\n      quality of life and substantially increases caregiver burden when patients have comorbid\n      conditions requiring caregiver assistance. The investigators propose an effectiveness trial\n      whose overall goal is to determine whether a conservative intervention which has been shown\n      to be effective in single-site studies will sustain its efficacy when disseminated to a home\n      bound population by home health care nurses. The treatment includes patient education about\n      the physiology of how continence is maintained, pelvic floor exercises, behavioral\n      strategies for preventing FI, and use of fiber or nonprescription medication to treat\n      diarrhea or constipation. To minimize drift when the treatment is disseminated to a large\n      group of providers, patient education and other basic components of treatment are included\n      in a printed training manual and are available to nurse providers on a website; however,\n      nurse supervision to individualize treatment remains important. The study will be carried\n      out in 8 counties in central North Carolina which are served by the University of North\n      Carolina Home Health Care and Rex Home Health Care agencies (partners in this study). Nurses\n      in these agencies will be randomly assigned to two groups. For the first two years all\n      patients of the nurses in one group will receive the active intervention while all patients\n      of nurses in the other group will receive usual care plus a training manual and symptom\n      monitoring to control for expectancy. After two years, all patients in these home health\n      care agencies will receive the active intervention. After excluding patients with severe\n      cognitive impairment and those with stomas, the investigators estimate 252 - 340 patients\n      with FI who are over age 50 will receive treatment (at least 189 in active treatment and 63\n      controls). Specific aims are (1) to show that the active treatment is more effective than\n      the control treatment for improving FI severity, patient quality of life, and caregiver\n      burden, and that improvements are maintained for at least 6 months; (2) to identify\n      moderators of treatment effectiveness (candidate variables are cognitive status, mobility\n      impairment, willingness of family caregiver to assist with treatment, anxiety, depression,\n      age, and race); and (3) to explore whether successful treatment of FI reduces the risk of\n      nursing home referral."
