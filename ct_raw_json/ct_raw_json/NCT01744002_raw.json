The\n      clinicians affiliated with this study have experience in data collection and have\n      participated in a recent trial that was sponsored by Walsh University.\n\n      At baseline, after consent for the study, patients will be randomized into two groups: 1)\n      shoulder treatment and active mobilization to the neck and 2) shoulder treatment and placebo\n      mobilization to the neck. Baseline data will be collected including all self-report\n      measures.\n\n      Both groups will receive shoulder treatment with an emphasis on 1) range of motion\n      activities, 2) joint mobilization, 3) rotator cuff strengthening and 4) a home exercise\n      program that consists of shoulder strengthening exercises. The active neck group will\n      receive UPA's to the cervical spine; applied as 3 X 30 seconds, to each comparable (stiff or\n      painful) segment. The physical therapist will place their hands on the neck of the patient\n      for the placebo group but will not perform the oscillations that are characteristic of\n      mobilization.\n\n      All patients will receive a home program designed to increase range of motion and strength.\n      None of the home program focused exercises will be targeted to the neck. The shoulder\n      exercises will be tailored to each specific patient and will not be standardized.\n\n      Patients will be treated for the duration of their care using the same foci (1) range of\n      motion activities, 2) joint mobilization, 3) rotator cuff strengthening and 4) a home\n      exercise program that consists of shoulder strengthening exercises). The length of the\n      treatment will be determined by the progress of the patient and by the attending therapist."
