Indeed, an increasing number of reports over the last\n      few years indicate a good response to Kineret (Anakinra),  in colchicine-resistant FMF ,also\n      in children ,however, no controlled study has thoroughly evaluated the efficacy and safety\n      of this treatment.\n\n      Study outline:\n\n      The study aims to run at the FMF centre in Sheba Medical Center, covering more than 10,000\n      patients. The study will evaluate the effect of recombinant IL-1 receptor antagonist,\n      Kineret (Anakinra), on the frequency of FMF attacks in patients that, despite maximum\n      tolerable dose of colchicine, present with more than one attack per month.\n\n      The study is designed as a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. 50 patients\n      will be randomised to treatment with either Kineret (Anakinra), or placebo treatment for 4\n      months."
