Amifostine may improve blood counts in patients with\n      myelodysplastic syndrome. Combining azacitidine with amifostine may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of azacitidine plus amifostine in\n      treating patients who have myelodysplastic syndrome."

Evaluate the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these\n      patients. III. Assess the rate of progression to acute myeloid leukemia and overall survival\n      in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Evaluate the relationship between response\n      status and cytogenetics, FAB class, ras mutations, and the presence of nonclonal\n      hematopoiesis with this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Assess the effect of this\n      treatment regimen on the number of bone marrow hematopoietic progenitor cells in these\n      patients. VI. Evaluate neutrophil adhesion and chemotaxis in these patients before and after\n      this treatment regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive amifostine IV over 1-3 minutes on days 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 22,\n      24, and 26 plus azacitidine subcutaneously on days 1-7. Treatment repeats every 28 days for\n      4 courses. Patients who achieve complete remission receive an additional 3 courses, and\n      patients who achieve hematologic improvement or partial remission continue treatment until\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-32 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 2 years."
