            "textblock": "BACKGROUND Resistance exercise training with free weights or weight machines clearly\n      improves glycemic control in type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, many patients with T2D would\n      prefer not to, or are not able to attend an exercise facility,for reasons of cost, comfort\n      or convenience. Coinvestigator Dr. Jonathon Fowles developed a home-based exercise program\n      for people with T2D using resistance bands. Before-after studies using this intervention\n      have found improvements in glycemic control, strength, and blood pressure. However, the\n      effects of resistance-bands training (RBT) on glycemic control in T2D have not been\n      evaluated in a high-quality randomized trial.\n\n      RESEARCH QUESTIONS To determine the effects of six months of progressive, facility-based or\n      home-based RBT plus aerobic exercise, versus home-based aerobic exercise alone, in\n      previously-sedentary people with T2D.\n\n      METHODS After a 2-week run-in period to assess adherence, 555 T2D subjects not currently\n      engaging in regular exercise will be randomized in equal numbers to 3 arms: primarily\n      group-based RBT (RBT-G), primarily home-based RBT (RBT-H) or aerobic only control (ATO) .\n      All groups will also do aerobic training: accumulation of 150 minutes per week of walking or\n      jogging, measured by accelerometers. The RBT workout will include 12 distinctive exercises,\n      targeting all major muscle groups. Subjects will be trained in groups led by a Kinesiologist\n      (exercise specialist) twice per week for two weeks during run-in. After randomization, the\n      RBT-G and RBT-H groups will perform RBT three times per week. RBT-G participants will have\n      RBT group sessions twice/week supervised by a Kinesiologist plus one weekly session at home,\n      while RBT-H participants will perform RBT three times per week primarily at home, with\n      supervised group sessions weekly in weeks 1-4, every 2 weeks in weeks 5-8, and every 4 weeks\n      thereafter to ensure proper form and appropriate progression. Adherence to RBT will be\n      verified through direct supervision of group sessions, and completion of detailed exercise\n      logs for home-based and group sessions. Participants will photograph the log after each\n      session and email the photo to a designated email address. Study outcomes will be assessed\n      at baseline, and 12 and 24 weeks post-randomization. Dietary advice will be standardized\n      through repeated sessions with a dietician, and doses of medications altering glucose,\n      lipids and BP will be held constant unless change is medically urgent. Primary analyses will\n      be intention-to-treat, using repeated measures mixed modeling. Per-protocol analyses will be\n      done including only subjects who completed >70% of prescribed exercise sessions and all\n      end-of-study outcome measures.\n\n      SIGNIFICANCE The global burden of type 2 diabetes is increasing, and complications of the\n      illness occur primarily in those whose glycemic control is fair or poor. If home-based\n      exercise training with resistance bands improves glycemic control and other vascular risk\n      factors, it could be beneficial to the large numbers of patients who prefer not to have to\n      travel to a gym or cannot afford gym membership. If resistance exercise is then adopted by\n      more patients, it is likely that the morbidity associated with type 2 diabetes will be\n      decreased. This is particularly true if such training also improves quality of life, and\n      more people are thus inclined to continue exercising in the long term. If only the\n      fully-supervised facility-based program improves glycemic control and other study outcomes,\n      this would indicate a need for full supervision in order to achieve these benefits, and\n      would temper enthusiasm for home-based RBT."
