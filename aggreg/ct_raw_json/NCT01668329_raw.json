Its\n      outcome has not been improved despite the knowledge on inflammatory processes; a reason for\n      these lack of results may lay on the lack of data on the precise dynamics of inflammatory\n      and anti-inflammatory cascades and their consequences. We intend to achieve accurate\n      monitoring of the inflammatory process on a small group of non-immunocompromised patients.\n      Our goal is to obtain quality data, repeated over time, by limiting the technical\n      variability."
