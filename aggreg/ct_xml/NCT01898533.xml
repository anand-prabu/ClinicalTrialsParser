  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, investigators intend to measure changes in BOLD contrast in the breast
      induced by breath-holding for subjects receiving radiation therapy to the breast.  This
      study will provide the preliminary data and experience needed to successfully apply BOLD to
      quantify changes in oxygenation and blood flow of breast and tumor for a larger cohort of
      breast radiotherapy patients.  The current study has the following objectives:

        1. To determine the feasibility of BOLD contrast MRI of the breast, induced by
           breath-hold.

        2. To measure the change in BOLD contrast of the breast and / or chest wall tissue for
           females undergoing radiotherapy

    <description>The imaging technique will be considered feasible if for any of the proposed imaging sequences, breath-holding induces a measurable (≥3× standard deviation of background) BOLD contrast signal in at least 30% of the subjects. Contrast will be measured by comparing breath hold sequences  to normal breathing.</description>
