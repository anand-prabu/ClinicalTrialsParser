A prednisone dose of < 20 mg/day is allowed. Inhaled, topical and\n             intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study\n             protocol within the period starting 30 days before the first dose of study vaccine(s)\n             (HZ/su and/or FLU-D-QIV vaccines) and ending 30 days after the last dose of HZ/su\n             vaccine.\n\n          -  Administration of an influenza vaccine during the six months preceding entry into the\n             study or planned administration up to the last blood sampling with the exception of\n             the FLU-D-QIV vaccine given during this study.\n\n          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs (e.g. infliximab) within six\n             months prior to the first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during\n             the study period.\n\n          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study\n             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a\n             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).\n\n          -  Previous vaccination against VZV or HZ and/or planned administration during the study\n             of a VZV or HZ vaccine (including an investigational or non-registered vaccine) other\n             than the study vaccine.\n\n          -  History of HZ.\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting\n             from disease (e.g., malignancy, HIV infection) or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy\n             (e.g., medications used during cancer chemotherapy, organ transplantation or to treat\n             autoimmune disorders).\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccines.\n\n          -  History of Guillain Barr\u00e9 syndrome.\n\n          -  Hypersensitivity to latex.\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C /99.5\u00b0F for oral, axillary or tympanic\n                  route, or \u2265 38.0\u00b0C /100.4\u00b0F on rectal route. The preferred route for recording\n                  temperature in this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory\n                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the 3 months\n             preceding the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study\n             period.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating female.\n\n          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive\n             precautions before 2 months after the last dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from\n             participating in the study.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular\n             injection unsafe."
