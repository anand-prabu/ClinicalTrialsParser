    <textblock>
      The use of soy-isolate protein based formula for infants with cow's milk protein intolerance
      is common in Indonesia, however, there has not been any systematic collection of clinical
      data to determine the formula's gastrointestinal tolerance, and the parent's perceptions
      regarding the formula.
