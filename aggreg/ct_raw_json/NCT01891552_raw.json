It appears to be particularly useful if carried out with the new\n           embolization materials.\n\n        -  An 80% response rate  was reported using TACE with Irinotecan pre-loaded Beads in\n           patients with liver metastases from colon cancer, who had been pretreated with 2 or\n           more lines of chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Since a greater activity was attained by a combination of Cetuximab and Irinotecan\n           versus Cetuximab in monotherapy, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal\n           Products (EMEA) has granted authorization to the use of Cetuximab in association with\n           irinotecan in the treatment of irinotecan-refractory CRC-LM.\n\n        -  In this study we want to collect data on on time to progression and tolerability using\n           DEBIRI+Cetuximab in LM-CRC"

Day  +90: In case of response, a third\n      administration following the above procedures will be repeated\n\n      Program B ( for Centers in which Cetuximab is available) 5.2 Cetuximab administered as per\n      standard scheme: Day -15: loading dose with 400 mg/mq i.v. over a 2-hour period Day +21 and\n      subsequent weekly administrations: 250 mg/mq i.v. over a one hour period.\n\n      It is pointed out that administration of Cetuximab will be continued following the timeline\n      of the first infusion relative to the intra-arterial administration.\n\n      Evaluation of response\n\n      Response must be assessed by repeating the following examinations at Day 30, Day 90 and Day\n      120 after start of treatment:\n\n      Chest-abdomen CAT scan with and without contrast medium (refer to Section 4). Evaluation\n      will be based on the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) cancer markers\n      (CEA, Carbohydrate Antigen (CA) 19.9)\n\n      Assessment of quality of life The Edmonton Symptom Assessment System (ESAS) is used to\n      monitor health conditions and quality of life.\n\n      The questionnaire must be filled in by the patient unaided by family members or by health\n      care personnel, over a period of about 15 minutes. Assessment of quality of life will be\n      performed during the baseline visit and at Day 30, Day 60 and Day 120 from start of\n      treatment.\n\n      It is important for the questionnaire to be completed by the patient before undergoing the\n      physical examination, in other words before discussing with the physician about any\n      examinations which might give an indication of the favorable or unfavorable course of the\n      disease. In providing the questionnaire to the patient, the physician will explain how to\n      complete it without discussing the contents of the questions, and once the patient has\n      completed the questionnaire, the physician will check that all questions have been answered."
