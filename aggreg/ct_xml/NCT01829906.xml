  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is the only long-term established treatment for morbid obesity. However,
      some patients experience suboptimal weight loss after surgery and/or experience a
      significant weight regain. Unfortunately there are very few studies in this area and little
      is known about the causes for lack of success or the best approach to treat this group of
      patients. The main aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of two different lifestyle
      treatment programs in this group of patients: 1) Hospital-based outpatient program or 2) an
      inpatient treatment program consisting of 3 - 3-week stays at a rehabilitation center over a
      1-year period. Secondary aim is to determine potential reasons for suboptimal weight loss
      after bariatric surgery.

    <description>Multidisciplinary outpatient programme including both individual and group-based therapy. During the first visit, every patient will have an individual consultation with the dietician, physiotherapist and psychiatric nurse. After this, the patients will be followed up in groups every month for the first four months and every two months afterwards up to one year. The intervention will focus on nutritional education, healthy eating, increased physical activity levels (aiming initially at 10 minutes/day, then increasing to 30 minutes/day) and cognitive therapy.</description>
