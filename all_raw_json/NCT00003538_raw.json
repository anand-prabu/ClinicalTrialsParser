Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells can make an immune response against the body's normal tissues. Stem cells\n      that have been treated in the laboratory to remove lymphocytes may prevent this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to prevent graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing bone\n      marrow transplantation."
