  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of sitagliptin in
      enhancing engraftment following umbilical cord blood transplantation (recovery of blood
      counts after transplant).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) is more commonly used for transplantation in children but is
      being used in adults more often. However, because adults are larger than children, the
      relatively smaller stem cell dose in UCB is major limitation for transplantation in adults
      and engraftment can be delayed. This study is trying to find out if the drug sitagliptin can
      be used to increase and speed up engraftment in adults receiving UCB transplantation.
