The aim of the study is to investigate the effects of using Functional Electrical\n      Stimulation/Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO) or splint as an assistive mobility device over a 12\n      week period in people with MS who experience foot drop. Patients who are clinically\n      prescribed FES will be invited to participate in the FES arm of the study. Patients who are\n      clinically prescribed an AFO will be invited to participate in the AFO arm. Participants\n      will be asked to make four visits to the gait laboratory at Queen Margaret University. Four\n      weeks before the start of device use (Baseline - 4 weeks), start of device use (Baseline),\n      after 6 weeks and 12 weeks of device use. Participants' walking will assessed using\n      computerised three dimensional motion analysis, which will provide a detailed description of\n      the movements (kinematics) of the lower limbs. Participants will also be asked to carry out\n      a 10 metre walk and a two minute walk. Both gait analysis and the walking performance tests\n      will be carried out with and without an assistive device\u037e apart from their first session\n      where participants will only be assessed without their assistive device.\n\n      Participants will be asked to wear an activity monitor for 7 days after each assessment. In\n      addition participants will be asked to complete four short standardised questionnaires (MS\n      walking scale, MS impact scale (MSIS-29), Fatigue severity score and the Leeds MS Quality of\n      life score) at each assessment."
