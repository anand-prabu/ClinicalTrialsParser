All subjects may receive rescue warming if their core temperature falls below\n      35.5\u00b0C. Rescue warming is optional and defined as the institution's standard of care to\n      prevent hypothermia.\n\n      The primary purpose is to investigate if there is a clinically relevant difference in core\n      body temperature between the two treatment groups.\n\n      A total of 60 subjects will be included in the investigation, i.e. 30 subjects in each\n      treatment group.
