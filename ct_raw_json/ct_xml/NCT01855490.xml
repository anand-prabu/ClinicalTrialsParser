  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as an open labeled pilot trial to analyze the acute responses of
      glucose, GLP-1, GIP, insulin secretory,and glucagon to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT) or
      intravenous glucose tolerance tests (IVGTT) with and without pretreatment with Exenatide
      (Byetta) 5 mcg sc.

      The investigators will also test the effects of Exenatide on gastric emptying during the
      MMTT.
