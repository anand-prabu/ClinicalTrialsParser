Determine the number of patients with\n      at least 50% decrease in CA125 when treated with this regimen. III. Determine the time to\n      tumor progression, overall survival, and toxicity profile in this patient population treated\n      with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ILX-295501 once weekly for 3\n      weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 3\n      months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
