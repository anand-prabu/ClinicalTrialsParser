Up to approximately 150 participants are to be enrolled. The study includes\n      screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Participants will receive daratumumab by\n      intravenous infusion (28-day cycles) until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or\n      other protocol-defined reasons. For all study drug administrations, participants will\n      receive pre- and post-infusion medications for the prevention of infusion related reactions.\n      Follow-up will continue until death, loss to follow up, consent withdrawal for study\n      participation, or study end, whichever occurs first. The study will consist of 2 sequential\n      parts (Part 1 and Part 2). The purpose of Part 1 is to select a dose and schedule for Part 2\n      of the study. Assessment of tumor response and disease progression will be conducted\n      according to IMWG response criteria. Serial pharmacokinetic blood samples and a\n      pharmacogenomic blood sample will be collected. Safety will be monitored throughout the\n      study. At the end of the study (18 months after last participant receives first dose of\n      study drug), participants who are benefiting from treatment with daratumumab will have the\n      option to continue treatment in a long-term extension study."
