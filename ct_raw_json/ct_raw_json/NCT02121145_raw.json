Some of these\n      Salmonellae are common causes of diarrhoea in travellers (0-30% of travellers diarrhea\n      depending on the area). In a recent controlled study, the investigators showed that a\n      cross-reactive immune response is elicited against different Salmonella spp. in healthy\n      volunteers immunized with either the oral (Vivotif\u00ae ) or parenteral (Typherix\u00ae) typhoid\n      vaccines (ISRCTN68125331).\n\n      In the present study immune responses will be studied in a group receiving both of these\n      vaccines and in previously immunized  volunteers after booster immunization (same groups\n      receive same vaccines 2-4 years after primary immunization; groups: Vivotif / Typherix /\n      Vivotif + Typherix).
