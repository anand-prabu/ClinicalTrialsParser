Study HER2 status by\n      immunohistochemistry on prostate cancer biopsy samples. III. Study associations between HER2\n      protein expression on tumor cells and post-therapy changes in PSA in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive trastuzumab IV over 30 or 90 minutes once a week. Treatment\n      continues for a maximum of 24 weeks in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients are followed for time to progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-9\n      months."
