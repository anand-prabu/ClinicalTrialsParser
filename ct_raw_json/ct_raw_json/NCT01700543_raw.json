Sequentially, all eligible patients will be offered study enrollment at each center\n      to avoid potential selection bias.  All potential subjects will be required to participate\n      in an informed consent process and sign the EC approved written Informed Consent prior to\n      study enrollment.\n\n      The study is designed to be prospective to ensure that the study population is\n      representative of the type of population that the device is intended to treat.  Patients\n      will be selected according to the subject selection criteria described in section 8.  All\n      subjects will undergo preoperative, intraoperative and immediate postoperative assessments\n      including physical examinations, radiographic evaluations and collection of quality of life\n      metrics.  Follow-up evaluations are to be conducted at 3 and 6 months, 1, 2, 5, 7 and 10\n      years postoperation."
