      This is an observational study to collect information by use of performance-based measures
      and survey questionnaires.  It does not include interventions aimed at altering patient
      outcome.

      Advances in pediatric hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (SCT) have resulted in
      improved survival and prompted increased attention to the potential adverse late effects of
      this procedure. Survivors of SCT are thought to be at risk for neurocognitive deficits as a
      result of their exposure to a number of potentially neurotoxic agents.  Prior studies done
      by our group and others have demonstrated generally stable cognitive function in the first 5
      years following transplant, with little evidence of significant declines.  However, there
      has been almost no research to date on the status of very long-term (&gt; 5 years
      post-transplant) survivors.  In this study, we will evaluate a large sample of long-term
      survivors of allogeneic SCT using measures of intelligence, academic achievement, and
      specific cognitive functions such as attention, working memory and processing speed.  We
      will also obtain measures of behavioral functioning and quality of life.  We will examine
      how this group of survivors are functioning relative to normative expectations, and in
      comparison to community controls without a history of serious illness, matched on age,
      gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.  We will also examine the relationship
      between cognitive function and psychosocial function and quality of life in this population.

      This study will involve a one-time assessment using both performance based measures as well
      as both self- and parent-report questionnaires.  During their yearly visit to St. Jude,
      eligible patients who agree to participate will undergo a single neurocognitive evaluation.
      This evaluation will take place in the Psychology Clinic. The administration time for the
      assessment battery is estimated at 2.5-3.5 hours, with variability depending on the age of
      the patient and the speed of completion of the tasks. All measures selected for the study
      have well-established psychometric properties, including acceptable reliability and
      validity. All measures were standardized on large, representative samples of children and
      adults and have age-specific norms.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

      To examine and describe psychological outcomes in long-term (&gt; 5 years) survivors of
      allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation (SCT) in childhood.  This will be
      conducted in a one-time cross-sectional assessment using both performance based measures and
      survey questionnaires.  Comparisons will be made to established normative data on well
      validated standardized instruments and to control participants in the community without a
      history of serious illness, matched on age, gender, race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.

        -  To describe global cognitive and academic outcomes in this SCT cohort using measures of
           intelligence and academic achievement.

        -  To examine performance in specific neuropsychologic domains, including working memory,
           processing speed and other executive functions.

        -  To examine psychosocial function and quality of life among long-term SCT survivors
           using both self- and parent-report.

        Survivors of SCT who are &gt; 5 years since transplant and are returning for a transplant
        clinic outpatient follow-up visit will be recruited to participate on study.  We will
        recruit patients beginning at age 8 years, with no upper age limit, although we anticipate
        that most patients will be between 8 and 25 years at the time of assessment.  For patients
        in the age range 8-21 we will obtain data by both self- and parent-report.  However, if
        patients age 18-21 present to clinic without a parent, they will still be eligible for
        study, and for these patients, as well as those ≤ 21 years, we will obtain performance
        based and self-report measures only.
