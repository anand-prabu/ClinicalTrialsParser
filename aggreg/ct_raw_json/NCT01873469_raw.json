Also site of recurrence will be correlated with the\n      [11C]MET imaging before and early during radiochemotherapy. All imaging information will be\n      included in treatment planning or treatment decisions.\n\n      The study provides a basis for later radiation dose escalation trials on the base of\n      [11C]MET imaging."

After\n      resection or biopsy, patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme will receive a\n      [11C]MET-PET/MRI scan before start of concurrent radiochemotherapy (~1-4 weeks after\n      surgery). A fusion with the planning CT for irradiation treatment planning will be\n      performed. Postoperative radiotherapy will be applied in daily fractions of 2 Gy given 5\n      days per week for 6 weeks, for a total dose of 60 Gy (50 Gy and a boost of 10 Gy), with\n      concomitant administration of daily Temozolomide (75 mg/m2 p.o.) from the 1st day to the\n      last day of radiotherapy. Follow up with [11C]MET-PET/MRI will be performed every 3 months\n      until recurrence or until death of the patient.\n\n      The uptake of [11C]MET-PET (as standard uptake value - SUV) in tumour and in normal\n      contralateral grey matter before start of concurrent radiochemotherapy will be determined.\n      For each tumour, the ratio between tracer uptake in the tumor and contralateral gray matter\n      will be calculated (lesion-to-gray matter ratio [l/g]).\n\n      Primary end point will be time to recurrence (TTR) as function of [11C]MET uptake before\n      chemoradiotherapy. Secondary endpoints will be overall survival; toxicity; C-Index/ROC curve\n      (sensitivity, specificity, optimal threshold for normal/tumour tissue index), necrosis rate;\n      site of recurrence.\n\n      The primary analysis will use the Cox proportional hazard model to establish the linear\n      association between [11C]-MET and time-to-recurrence using a one-sided alpha = 0.1.\n\n      Parallel translational studies with orthotopic GBM xenografts (generated from the patients\n      material in the trial) in nude mice will be performed in our laboratory to evaluate\n      [11C]MET-PET as a tool for tailoring high precision radiotherapy. Histological, biological\n      and genetic studies are planned to validate the imaging finding and to explore the\n      underlying mechanisms."
