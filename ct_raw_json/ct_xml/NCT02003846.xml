  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are various methods to generate the pressure needed for Nasal CPAP. Some  neonatal
      intensive care units (NICU) use an underwater bubbling system and others use a ventilator to
      generate the pressure. There is no right or wrong way to generate the pressure and both
      methods are approved and accepted.

      The aim of this study is to compare the two systems of Nasal CPAP by placing the baby on
      each for a defined time period and reviewing the infant's vital signs. The investigators
      expect that the pressure generated by bubble CPAP will be better and lead to improved vital
      signs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Neonates between 26-32 weeks gestational age who have been on Nasal CPAP for at least
             48hrs on fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) of &lt; or = 0.3. Parental consent will be
             obtained prior to enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Infants with severe congenital anomalies, such as airway or chest wall deformities,
             pulmonary hypoplasia, congenital heart disease, neurologic abnormalities including
             severe intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) and need for surgery eg. for necrotizing
             enterocolitis will be excluded from the study. Any infants with genetic/chromosomal
             abnormalities will be excluded.
