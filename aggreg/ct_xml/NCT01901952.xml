      The primary aim of the LIFE study is to compare low-income African American diabetes
      patients in a lifestyle intervention group with those in a standard of care control group on
      change in glycemic control at 12-months.  We hypothesize that, on average, participants in
      the intervention group will achieve greater glycemic control at 12-months relative to their
      baseline A1c, than those in the control group.

    <textblock>
      This project is a randomized controlled trial to test an innovative lifestyle intervention
      to achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control among low-income African American
      diabetes patients. The LIFE (Lifestyle Improvement through Food and Exercise) program is a
      diabetes self-management program focused on diet and exercise, informed by anthropological
      research on models of food and health among low-income African-Americans. Pilot work
      demonstrated that the LIFE Program is effective in improving glycemic control among
      low-income African Americans at 6-months. The main goal of the current study is to determine
      whether the LIFE Program can achieve sustained improvements in glycemic control for 12
      months. The trial will randomize low-income African American adults with diabetes to a
      control group, which receives standard diabetes education, or an intervention group, which
      receives the LIFE Program (28 group meetings with peer support telephone calls) followed by
      a 6-month maintenance phase (quarterly group sessions with monthly peer support phone
      calls). The primary aim of the proposed research is to compare low-income African American
      diabetes patients receiving the LIFE Program with those in a standard of care control group
      on change in glycemic control at 12 months. Our primary hypothesis is that patients in the
      intervention group will achieve a change in A1c from baseline that is less than patients in
      the control group. Secondary aims are to compare low-income African American diabetes
      patients receiving the LIFE Program with those in a standard of care control group on (a)
      change in glycemic control at 18 months; (b) change in physical activity and total energy
      intake at 12 months; (c) change in physical activity and total energy intake at 18 months;
      and (d) to obtain estimates needed for a subsequent trial, including weight, blood pressure,
      and diabetes-related hospitalizations. For secondary aims we hypothesize that a) the
      intervention group will achieve a mean 18-month change in A1C that is less than the change
      in the control group; b) at 12 months, a greater proportion of intervention patients will
      have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week, and the
      intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from baseline in mean total energy
      intake than the control group; and c) at 18 months, a greater proportion of intervention
      patients will have achieved the activity goal of 150 minutes of moderate activity per week,
      and the intervention group will achieve a greater reduction from baseline in mean total
      energy intake than the control group.
