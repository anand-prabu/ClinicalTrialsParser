The investigators\n      will assess participants at baseline,  immediately post-intervention (i.e., at 4 weeks), and\n      at 3-, 6-, and 12-month measurement points following the intervention. This assessment\n      approach will allow the investigators to examine the trajectory of HIV risk reduction change\n      including the decay or emergence of intervention effects."
