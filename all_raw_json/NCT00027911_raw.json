Combining vaccine therapy with sargramostim may be\n      effective in treating soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with\n      sargramostim in treating patients who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV soft tissue\n      sarcoma."

Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously once\n      daily beginning 2 days before every vaccination and continuing for 5 days. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 months."
