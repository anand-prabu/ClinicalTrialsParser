They, too, will be monitored at enrollment, 3\n      weeks into cetuximab treatment and at the end of cetuximab treatment for adherence, side\n      effects and quality of life.\n\n      If a subject is assigned to this group and they develop a severe skin rash, the study doctor\n      will treat their rash according to standard treatment recommendations, which may include\n      Hydrocortisone 1% cream, Doxycycline capsules or other medications.\n\n      There will be a follow-Up period for both extensive treatment and standard  care groups.  At\n      6 months, 12 months, 18 months and 24 months, after the end of the subject's 8 week study\n      treatment period, they will be contacted by telephone or discussed during their routine\n      clinic visit."
