Pragmatically, Dutch guidelines advise 10-14 days\n      of antibiotics, which is the current standard of care. Recently it has been shown that\n      antibiotic treatment for pneumonia and urinary tract infections can safely and significantly\n      be shortened. Importantly, in an outpatient setting, treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis\n      with 5 days of antibiotics was as effective as 10 days. We hypothesize that there is no\n      difference in outcomes when patients hospitalized with cellulitis are treated with either a\n      short-course (6 days) or standard-course (12 days) of antibiotics."
