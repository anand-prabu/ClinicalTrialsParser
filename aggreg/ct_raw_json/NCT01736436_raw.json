This is\n      expected to translate in an improved erythropoiesis and ameliorated anemia in MDS patients.\n\n      APG101 might, therefore, be a valuable addition to current treatments of low- or\n      intermediate MDS patients suffering from anaemia.\n\n      Transfusion-dependent patients with low or intermediate risk MDS according to WHO Prognostic\n      Scoring Scale (WPSS) can be included in this study.\n\n      Treatment consists of 100mg APG101 intravenous as a weekly treatment over 12 weeks + 6\n      months follow up phase.\n\n      Primary objective of the trial is safety and tolerability of APG101; secondary objectives\n      are\n\n        -  Hematologic, cytologic and cytogenetic response rate using modified International\n           Working Group (IWG) response criteria\n\n        -  Incidence and time to leukemic progression at 37 weeks\n\n        -  OS (Overall survival) at 37 weeks"
