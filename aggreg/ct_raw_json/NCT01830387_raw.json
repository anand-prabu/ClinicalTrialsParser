The hypothesis is that the use of\n      polymetric clips for ligation of the appendix will result in decreased operative cost with\n      no change in morbidity when compared to endoscopic staplers. Eligibility will include all\n      patients 18 years or older that are scheduled for laparoscopic appendectomy because of a\n      diagnosis of appendicitis. In conducted trials the risks associated with the use of\n      Hem-o-lok\u00ae for ligation of the appendix is negligible compared to other standard ligation\n      techniques including endoscopic staplers and endoloop. The study team does not perceive any\n      additional risk to study participants beyond the risks associated with laparoscopic\n      appendectomy. The average length of the operation is one and a half hours. Categorical\n      variables will be compared using a Chi-square analysis, while continuous variables will be\n      analyzed using Student's t-test. A statistician with the department has reviewed and\n      approved the \"Data Analysis & Statistical Considerations.\""
