This study involves a two part approaching including a\n      computerized cognitive remediation program (CCRP, Posit Science, CA) in combination with a\n      Social Cognitive Training (SCT) program.  The computer-based training program has shown\n      encouraging results in improving learning deficits in individuals with schizophrenia and we\n      now seek to adapt them to children with 22q11DS, who have unique needs due to their lower IQ\n      and high risk of psychosis in late adolescence and adulthood. The SCT is a small-group\n      intervention program based on cognitive enhancement therapy, which has been shown to improve\n      social cognition and functionality in adults with schizophrenia. A preliminary study will be\n      performed using this two-pronged approach, to establish the feasibility and gather\n      preliminary data on neurocognition before and after the intervention in these children;\n      these data would enable a larger randomized controlled study to assess the efficacy of this\n      approach."
