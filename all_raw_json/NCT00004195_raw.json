II. Evaluate the ability of eniluracil to\n      inactivate DPD in the tumor, PBMCs, and normal tissue in this patient population. III.\n      Assess DPD recovery and uracil levels in PBMCs following surgical resection in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, placebo controlled study. Patients are stratified according\n      to colorectal tumor (primary vs metastatic). Patients are randomized into one of two\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral eniluracil twice daily on days -2 and -1\n      followed by surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive an oral\n      placebo as in arm I followed by surgical resection and tissue harvest on day 0. Patients are\n      followed weekly for 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients (10 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
