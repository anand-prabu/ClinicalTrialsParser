Ranolazine is a novel late sodium current inhibitor\n      shown to be effective in treating angina in patients with chronic stable coronary artery\n      disease without affecting the blood pressure heart rate product. It has been shown to reduce\n      myocardial energy utilization by enhancing diastolic myocardial relaxation and possibly by\n      increasing myocardial blood flow. While ranolazine has been demonstrated to improve size and\n      severity of stress-induced myocardial perfusion defects, it's direct effect on myocardial\n      metabolism and cellular ischemia has not been tested in humans. We propose using cardiac\n      magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) and phosphorous-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy (31P\n      MRS) to evaluate patients with chronic stable angina before and after 4 weeks of a stable\n      dose of ranolazine to detect changes in myocardial blood flow, ventricular function,\n      myocardial scar and metabolic parameters of cellular ischemia."
