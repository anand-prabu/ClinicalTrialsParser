  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a major public health problem in the U.S. and more than 35%
      of Veterans are at high risk for OSA. OSA is associated with progression of hypertension, an
      important health problem in Veterans. African Americans with OSA are at increased risk for
      poorly controlled hypertension and its health consequences. Implementing a care plan to
      increase the percentage of Veterans in whom blood pressure goals are achieved has been
      prioritized by Veterans Administration hospitals. Recent studies show that hypertension
      control can be improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment of OSA.
      The aim of this proposal is to examine and compare the effects of CPAP treatment on 24-hour
      arterial blood pressure and central aortic blood pressure (measured non-invasively with a
      cuff on the upper arm) in African American and European American Veterans.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) and hypertension are both common and severe problems in
      African American individuals (as noted in the International Society on Hypertension in
      Blacks consensus statement). CPAP treatment of OSA is effective in controlling hypertension
      in patients with OSA, but has not been studied in African Americans, a high-risk population
      with potentially large health gains. This is an area of significance because poorly
      controlled hypertension leads to progression of CVD and morbidity in this population. By
      identifying CPAP treatment-response and relevant moderators of this response in African
      Americans with hypertension and OSA, targeted treatment of OSA can be implemented, reducing
      the excess burden of CVD. We will determine the relative magnitude of hypertension response
      to CPAP treatment (ambulatory blood pressure and central aortic blood pressure) in 220
      African American and European American Veterans with hypertension and newly diagnosed OSA
      (specific aim 1). We will measure changes in pathogenic biomarkers (urinary cumulative
      sympathetic nervous system activity and oxidative stress) that are responsive to CPAP
      treatment in addition to hypertension assessments. Further, we will examine the role of
      excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), a potentially important moderator of treatment response,
      in these two patient populations (specific aim 2). Finally, we will adjust our outcomes
      assessment for the anticipated biological heterogeneity among self-identified African
      Americans by measuring genetic ancestry (exploratory aim). This award will provide the
      foundation for the goals of this research program to reduce CVD disparity in diverse
      populations with targeted treatment of OSA.
