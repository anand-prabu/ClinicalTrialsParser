  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Feeding preterm infants is of great challenge in the NICUs. Mother's own milk is considered
      as the best for the digestive system followed by donor milk. Preterm infant formula is
      related to more feeding problems and other gut complications in these babies, such as
      necrotizing enterocolitis. Bovine colostrum contains higher amounts of protein, growth
      factors and immuno-regulatory components (e.g. immunoglobulins), which has been used in many
      other situations to promote health. The investigators plan to give bovine colostrum to
      preterm infants with birth weights between 1000 and 1800 g, in order to promote feeding and
      intestinal health in these babies. This current study is a feasibility pilot study and the
      investigators hypothesized that Supplementing BC to MM (if available) is safe and tolerable
      when used within the first 10 days of life in preterm infants with birth weights between
      1000 and 1800 g.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (&lt;37 weeks gestation) occurs in 10% of all pregnancies worldwide and the
      optimal way to feed a newborn preterm infant, when breast-feeding is impossible, is not
      clear. Excessive enteral feeding predisposes to various complications and necrotizing
      enterocolitis (NEC) that occur in 7% of preterm infants born with less than 1500 g body
      weight. Minimal enteral nutrition (MEN) is a widely used method where small volumes of milk
      are fed within the first few days after birth with the purpose to promote GIT maturation and
      add some nutrients and energy. It is assumed that MEN feedings allow more rapid advancement
      to full enteral feeding (EN, e.g 120-160 ml/kg/d) and weaning from parenteral nutrition
      (PN). This is important to reduce PN-related complications (e.g. sepsis) and to better
      stimulate body and organ (e.g. gut, brain) development. However, it remains unclear what is
      the best milk diet when mother's own milk is not available. Infant formula (IF) and banked
      human donor milk (DM) are the most frequently used alternatives to motherÂ´s own milk (MM).
      MM is superior to IF in promoting feeding tolerance, body growth, intestinal function, and
      NEC resistance in preterm infants. Feeding with DM is also believed to be beneficial,
      relative to IF, although this pasteurized milk obtained from mothers later in lactation may
      less beneficial, relative to the first MM, colostrum. There are differences in the amount
      and composition between human colostrum and bovine colostrum (BC), but relative to mature
      human milk, BC contains higher amounts of protein, growth factors and immuno-regulatory
      components (e.g. immunoglobulins). Large amount of protein in BC provides higher enteral
      protein intake and may enable a reduction in the use of PN and central venous catheters, and
      hereby reduced risk of infection. Also this may lead to reduced weight loss and improved
      growth of the brain and the body. In addition, maturational and NEC-protective effects of BC
      have repeatedly been documented in preterm pigs when BC is used as the first diet after
      birth. The investigators therefore plan to investigate whether using BC as MEN for preterm
      infants is safe, tolerable, and helps to provide nutrients and gut maturation in preterm
      infants, when MM is not in sufficient amounts or not available.
