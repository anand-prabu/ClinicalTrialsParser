      This research is being done to study the molecular effects of topically applied itraconazole
      ointment on the growth of basal cell carcinomas.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer in Caucasians worldwide.
      Although rarely metastatic, it can be locally destructive causing disfigurement and pain.
      Current therapies include surgical removal, local destruction, radiotherapy and others.

      Advances in understanding the molecular basis behind BCCs indicate that mutations in the
      hedgehog signaling pathway can lead to the development of many sporadically occurring BCCs.
      An oral drug that targets the hedgehog signaling pathway has been shown to be effective in
      treating patients with metastatic and inoperable BCCs. There is evidence that itraconazole,
      a commonly prescribed antifungal medication may also affect this pathway.  It is not known
      whether itraconazole ointment applied topically can affect the growth of BCCs.

    <description>Itraconazole comes in the form of capsules and liquid (oral solution). It is FDA approved for treatment of systemic Blastomycosis, Histoplasmosis and Aspergillosis in immunocompromised and non-immunocompromised patients at doses ranging from 200mg to 400mg daily. The current FDA approved dosage recommendation for treating toenail onychomycosis (nail fungus) is 200mg PO per day for 3 months. Test materials in this study will be prepared as an ointment (compounded in petrolatum jelly).</description>
