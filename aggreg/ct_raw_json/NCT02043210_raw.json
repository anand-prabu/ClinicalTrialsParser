Secondary outcomes will include\n      treatment utilization and cost, several measures intended to detect whether web-based\n      CBT4CBT retains key characteristics of traditional clinician-administered CBT (e.g.,\n      acquisition of coping skills, use of change strategies), participant characteristics which\n      will be evaluated as potential moderators of outcome, as well as participant satisfaction\n      and treatment credibility."
