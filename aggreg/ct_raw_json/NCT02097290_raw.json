Subjects who have an implanted functional endocardial right ventricular\n             defibrillation lead or who will receive a endocardial right ventricular\n             defibrillation lead\n\n          3.

Subjects with a RV or LV lead revision or extraction within 30 days of enrollment\n\n          7.

Subjects with an active implanted LV lead that is greater than 8 years old, unless\n             the lead will be abandoned\n\n         10. Subjects preexisting unipolar pacemaker that will not be explanted/abandoned\n\n         11. Subjects with a life expectancy less than 6 months\n\n         12. Subjects with a prosthetic mechanical tricuspid heart valve\n\n         13. Women of childbearing age who are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. NOTE: women of\n             childbearing potential with an uncertain pregnancy status must have a negative\n             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to enrollment. Pregnancy tests are required as\n             part of standard routing clinical practice at all centers whenever female patients\n             are exposed to x-ray radiation. Since this protocol does not require any exposure of\n             the female patients to x-ray and x-ray exposure is part of the clinical procedure, it\n             is the responsibility of the investigators to ensure that pregnant females will not\n             be exposed to x-ray at any time\n\n         14. Subject enrolled in a concurrent study, except national/governmental registries that\n             do not require a signed informed consent form, without the written approval from\n             Boston Scientific\n\n         15. Subjects who are not geographically stable, to the extent that it would prevent\n             attending the study follow-ups at the investigational center"
