      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 when
      given together with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with melanoma that has
      spread to another place in the body or cannot be removed by surgery and has come back after
      previous treatment (recurrent). Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of AT13387
      (Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387) given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in
      patients with v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) inhibitor resistant,
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free
      survival (PFS) and document the 6-month PFS and 1-year overall survival (OS) of patients
      with BRAF inhibitor resistant, BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with
      AT13387 given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib.

      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and AT13387.

      III. To explore pharmacodynamic effects of AT13387 given weekly in combination with
      dabrafenib and trametinib to patients with BRAF inhibitor resistant, BRAF-mutant metastatic
      or unresectable melanoma by comparing pre- and on-treatment biopsies.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387.

      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and trametinib PO once daily (QD)
      on days 1-28, and Hsp90 inhibitor AT13387 intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and
      15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days.
