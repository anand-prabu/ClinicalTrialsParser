Hallett and\n      colleagues in 2008 showed that for Zimbabwe specifically, HIV incidence could be reduced\n      between 25% to 35% if about 50% of men are circumcised. All modelings conducted show that MC\n      programs must be part of a comprehensive HIV prevention package as MC alone will not tip the\n      HIV epidemic into a terminal decline.\n\n      The PrePex Device offers hope for rapid scale up of adult male circumcision in resource\n      limited settings.\n\n      Once the safety and efficacy have been established, it is important to conduct operations\n      research to determine how best to implement both device and surgical circumcisions in the\n      national program. Thus, the Zimbabwe MOHCW is planning a three phase trial in order to\n      determine the safety of the PrePexTM device, its performance and the ease of use in an\n      implementation roll out."
