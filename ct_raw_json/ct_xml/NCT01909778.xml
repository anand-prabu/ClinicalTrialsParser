        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with liver cirrhosis, that is histologically proven in a previous liver
             biopsy; possible aetiologies are: cured HCV infection, former alcohol abuse, genetic
             haemochromatosis, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or others.

          2. Compensated liver disease, as indicated by Prothrombin time or INR prolonged to &lt;1.7
             x ULN, serum bilirubin &lt; 2 mg/dl, albumin &gt; 3.5 g/dl, no ascites or encephalopathy
             (Child-Pugh grade A, score &lt; 7)

          3. Age 18 years or older

          4. Male patients, or female with documented hysterectomy, ovariectomy or tubal ligation
             OR menopausal female with last menstrual period at least 12 months prior to screening
             OR female of childbearing potential with a negative serum pregnancy test at screening
             and day 1 and willing to ensure consistent and correct contraception

          5. Written informed consent prior to study enrolment which must be consistent with
             international conference on harmonisation Â¿ good clinical practice (ICH-GCP) and
             local legislation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Serological evidence of active HBV, HCV or HIV infection (i.e. seropositivity for HBs
             antigen, anti-HIV-1 or -2 antibodies; if anti-HCV antibody positive, patients must
             have documented negative HCV RNA for at least 12 months)

          2. Usage of any drug within 7 days or 5 halftimes, whichever is longer, prior to
             treatment; or the planned usage of a drug during the course of the current study

          3. Usage of any investigational drug within 30 days prior to treatment; or the planned
             usage of an investigational drug during the course of the current study

          4. Decompensated liver disease within past 12 months, as indicated by variceal bleeding,
             ascites, encephalopathy, Prothrombin time or INR prolonged to &gt; 1,7 x ULN, serum
             bilirubin &gt; 2 mg/dl or albumin &lt; 3,5 g/dl (i.e. Child-Pugh grade B)

          5. ALT or AST levels &gt; 5xULN, Alkaline Phosphatase &gt; 2xULN

          6. Liver cirrhosis due to primary or secondary biliary cirrhosis, sclerosing
             cholangitis, vanishing bile duct disease

          7. History of alcohol abuse within the past 3 months

          8. Known hypersensitivity to any content of the study drug

          9. Pregnant or breast feeding females

         10. Females of childbearing potential who are not willing to ensure consistent and
             correct use of condoms and at least one additional medically accepted method of
             contraception (diaphragm with spermicidal substance, cervical caps) or who are
             unwilling to comply to complete abstinence, from the date of screening until 6 months
             after the last dose of study drug

         11. AFP value &gt; 100 ng/ml; if AFP is &gt; 20 and &lt;= 100 ng/ml, patients can be included if
             liver cancer is excluded by two congruent imaging studies (i.e. ultrasound plus CT
             scan or MRI)

         12. Evidence of chronic kidney failure (i.e. serum creatinine &gt; ULN)

         13. Haemoglobinopathy (e.g., thalassaemia major or sickle cell anaemia)

         14. Concomitant intercurrent illnesses including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance
             with trial requirement or which are considered relevant for the evaluation of the
             pharmacokinetic parameters or safety of the trial drug.

         15. Active or suspected malignancy or history of malignancy within the last 2 years (with
             the exception of appropriately treated basal cell carcinoma or in situ carcinoma of
             the uterine cervix)
