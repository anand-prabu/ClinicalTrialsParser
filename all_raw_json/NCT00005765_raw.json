In a\n      series of 6 experiments, the researchers will attempt to quantify the effects of\n      qualitatively different reinforcers (money, cigarettes, alcohol, nicotine gum) and their\n      interactions.  This work represents a continuation of research by this investigator in the\n      area of addiction and pharmacology."
