However BG levels following spine surgery have never been\n      described before. Our primary purpose is to measure postoperative changes in BG levels of\n      non-diabetic patients undergoing spine surgery.\n\n      Methods: Non-diabetic consecutive adult patients undergoing spine surgery are going to be\n      prospectively included during a 6 months period. BG capillary measures are collected from\n      the preoperative fasting period to the end of postoperative day 3, six times a day.  Three\n      main glycemic parameters are calculated: Delta Day 0 (DD0), Day 2 mean (D2), and\n      Hyperglycemic Index (HGI). In the peri operative period, no change in oral intake nor in\n      intravenous fluids is prescribed. Patients are followed-up for three months postoperatively\n      for any early adverse event, requiring or not surgical revision."
