Test Purpose:\n\n           The aim of clinical test is to collect weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass,\n           and muscle mass reading value which measured by DUT and reference device.\n\n        2. Target Subject:\n\n           The subject database shall contain at least 25 male and 25 female subjects and all\n           above 18 years old.\n\n        3. Test procedures:\n\n             1. Record the name, age, gender, and height of each subject.\n\n             2. Let subject seated calmly for two minutes before test, dry the feet.\n\n             3. Use device to measure weight, body fat, total body water, bone mass, and muscle\n                mass; record reading value.\n\n             4. For each subject, repeat 3) to get 3 pairs measurements.\n\n             5. Repeat step 1) to 4) for every device (DUT: GBF-1251-B, BF-1255-B, BF-1256-B, and\n                GBF-1257-B; and reference device: GBF-950-D).\n\n             6. Repeat step 1) to 5) for each subject.\n\n        4. Note:\n\n             1. No motion and speaking are allowed during the measurement.\n\n             2. All DUT use the same algorithms and contact the patient at the same body locations\n                (feet), and operate on the same frequency.\n\n             3. Test environment: Temperature: 22\u00b11\u2103; Relative humidity: 40~70%."
