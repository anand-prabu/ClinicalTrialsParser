  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase Ia study aims to establish the maximum tolerated dose of once-weekly IV infused
      PG545 and to evaluate its safety in subjects with advanced solid tumours. In addition, the
      study will explore whether PG545 exposure results in changes to chemicals produced by the
      body that are associated with cancer growth and spread.

    <description>The MTD will be determined by assessing dose limiting toxicities at the end of the first month's treatment. Dose escalation and de-escalation will continue until an MTD is identified. Each cohort of patients will receive weekly doses at a single dose level for the duration of the study.</description>

    <description>PG545 will be administered once weekly, as a one hour IV infusion. Patients will be treated until they exhibit disease progression, withdraw due to poor tolerability, or the study reaches its defined end-point. This study is a dose escalation study with doses of 25 mg to 300 mg anticipated.</description>
