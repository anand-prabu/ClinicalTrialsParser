It is most often used with other chemotherapy drugs. Researchers want\n      to test it with an experimental drug, ISIS 183750. They want to see if the drugs are a safe\n      and effective treatment for advanced solid tumors or colorectal cancer that has not\n      responded to other treatments.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of ISIS 183750 with irinotecan for advanced solid\n      tumors or colorectal cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors or colorectal cancer that has\n      not responded to other treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will also be collected. Tumor tissue samples may be collected as well before\n           and after treatment. Imaging studies will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will take ISIS 183750 once a week for 28-day cycles of treatment.

Upregulation of eIF4E is an early\n      event in colorectal cancer (CRC) and correlates with CRC progression. ISIS 183750 is a\n      second-generation antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) designed to inhibit the production of the\n      human eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) protein.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Primary:\n\n      To establish Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) and establish safety for the combination of ISIS\n      183750 and irinotecan in advanced solid tumors.\n\n      Secondary:\n\n        -  To evaluate Response Rate, PFS, OS for the combination of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan in\n           advanced irinotecan-refractory colorectal cancer.\n\n        -  To perform correlative studies to evaluate the effect of eIF4E inhibition on relevant\n           regulated proteins and immune cells.\n\n        -  To characterize the plasma pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters for ISIS 183750 in the\n           absence and presence of irinotecan\n\n        -  To characterize the plasma PK parameters for irinotecan in the presence of ISIS 183750\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      -Adult patients with irinotecan-resistant colorectal cancer.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This is a single-arm phase I/II study whereby all patients will receive the combination\n           of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan. All cycles are 28 days.\n\n        -  Cycle 1 only: ISIS 183750 will be administered intravenously on Cycle 1 Days 1, 3, 5,\n           8, 15 and 22.\n\n        -  Cycle 2 and beyond: ISIS 183750 will be administered as an intravenous infusion every\n           week without break, i.e. Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of a 28-day cycle. Patients will be\n           re-staged every 8 weeks.\n\n        -  Irinotecan will be administered at a dose of 160mg/m2 as an intravenous infusion every\n           second week commencing on Day 15 of Cycle 1. The primary endpoint of the study will be\n           to establish MTD for the combination of ISIS 183750 and irinotecan in advanced solid\n           tumors.
