            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Ablation is a procedure that heats tumor tissue to a high temperature to destroy it.\n      Doctors perform this procedure by putting a probe in the tumor. This delivers heat to the\n      site. Currently, doctors tell what area is heated by using the probe   s manufacturer\n      estimates. These estimates are imprecise. Doctors insert small needles to measure the\n      temperature around the area being heated. Doctors also perform scans of the area, but these\n      cannot show which tissue has been heated and which has not. Right now, only contrast scans\n      can show that. But researchers have developed software that uses images from routine scans\n      to create a temperature map. They want to test the software to see if doctors can monitor\n      the procedure without using more needles and without contrast scans.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test software that might help doctors perform ablations better in the future.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - People over 18 years of age already scheduled to have an ablation.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history.\n\n        -  Participants will visit the clinic for their already-scheduled ablation. The doctor\n           will use the study software to\n\n      analyze the temperature in the area being heated. The software will not come into contact\n      with a participant   s body.\n\n      - Participants will undergo scans that are necessary for the procedure, but one or two\n      additional scans may be done as part of this study."
