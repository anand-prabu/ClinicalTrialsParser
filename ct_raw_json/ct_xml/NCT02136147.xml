  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ADHD medication of children and adolescents is becoming increasingly common. Clinical
      experience and scientific studies have proven that approximately 30% of children/adolescents
      with ADHD do not benefit from this treatment. However, there is insufficient knowledge about
      who these children are. All children and adolescents, who start treatment with ADHD
      medication at the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry units in Stockholm, will be asked to
      participate in the study. The investigators intend to monitor the patients´clinical symptoms
      and possible side-effects after treatment start. The investigators will collect background
      information, saliva and blood samples to be able to study if there are any genetic
      (hereditary) or other markers that can predict positive or negative outcomes of the ADHD
      medication. With this information, the investigators aim at, to a greater extent, be able to
      individualize treatment choices for children and adolescents with ADHD without unnecessary,
      costly and possibly unfavorable treatment attempts.

      The specific aims for the ADAPT study are:

        1. Investigate if certain gene polymorphisms are associated with poor effect of ADHD drugs
           (non-responders).

        2. Investigate if other biologically, phenotypic or psychosocial factors are associated
           with poor effect of ADHD drugs (non-responders).

        3. Investigate if the frequency of side-effects of ADHD drugs differs between children
           with different genotypes.

        4. Investigate if the frequency of side-effects of ADHD drugs differs between children
           with different phenotypic and/or psychosocial factors

      Method:

      This study has a naturalistic design. The aim is to map all new treatments with ADHD drugs
      at all BUP units (i.e. at BUP Stockholm and Prima Barn AB) in Stockholm County. The
      participation means that medication is initiated as planned in normal clinical practice by
      the child´s ordinary physician, and beyond this only means a somewhat denser and more
      structured follow-up. In addition, the investigators will ask for saliva and a blood sample.
      The investigators aim at including at least 1000 individuals in total in the study.

      Part of the data will be collected via the national Quality Register for ADHD Treatment
      Follow-up (BUSA), which has approved security procedures approved by the Swedish Data
      Inspection Board.

      Case report forms are computerized and separate from the database registry for collected
      study data. The database and detailed variable lists are constructed in collaboration with
      professional database managers.

      Standard Operation Procedures are designed in collaboration by project coordinator, study
      nurse and principal investigator, and may be revised after pilot phase.

      Collected samples will be stored at KI biobank.

      Data analysis:

        1. To judge if the patient is a responder to ADHD drugs the SNAP-IV rating of ADHD
           symptoms (before and after medication start) is used. The patients who at 3 months have
           an at least 40% reduction in SNAP-IV score are reckoned &quot;responders&quot; and those who at
           the same time point have a less than 20% change in SNAP-IV score are reckoned
           &quot;non-responders&quot;. Differences between the groups will be analyzed with logistic
           regression, with responder status as depending variable, and genotype and the other
           risk markers (biological, phenotypic, and psychosocial markers) as independent
           variables after correction for symptoms at baseline. Even a 50% drop-out rate will
           (i.e. 1000 out of estimated 2000 eligible individuals) give a 98% power to identify a
           49% increase in non-responder proportion for a specific genotype.

        2. Concomitantly, the outcome in side-effects, heart rate, blood pressure, weight
           (z-score) and length (z-score) will be analyzed with linear regression with the same
           independent variables.

        3. The analyses are performed separately for each ADHD drug.

        4. There are significantly more boys than girls (about 4:1) with ADHD. Given the sex
           difference in prevalence it is obvious to also include sex as a covariate in our
           analyses of treatment outcome.

        5. Missing data will be treated according to the principles of complete case and multiple
           imputation.
