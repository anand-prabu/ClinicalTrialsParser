Patients are stratified according to the reason for\n      the visit (general gynecological screening vs colposcopy referral).\n\n        -  Stratum 1 (general gynecological screening): Patients undergo Pap smear, visual\n           inspection aided by acetic acid (VIA), a colposcopy, and finally a visual inspection\n           aided by toluidine blue (VIT) followed by an acetic acid wash. A biopsy may be\n           performed at this initial visit. Within 2-3 weeks, patients are notified of results.\n\n        -  Stratum 2 (colposcopy referral): Patients undergo Pap smear, VIA, colposcopy, VIT, and\n           possible biopsy as in stratum 1. During the same visit, patients receive histologic\n           evaluation and treatment with See-and-Treat loop electrosurgical excision procedure\n           and/or endocervical curettage.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 600-1,000 patients (300-500 per stratum) will be accrued for\n      this study."
