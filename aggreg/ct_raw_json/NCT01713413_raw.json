It is compatible with a wide variety of oxygen sources. In a reservoir,\n      the Oxymizer\u00ae stores pure oxygen so that the concentration of inhaled oxygen is increased.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate the potential benefit of the Oxymizer\u00ae with regard\n      to the blood oxygenation during exercise testing. Given that the \"endurance time\" is very\n      sensitive for little changes in exercise capacity, this test will be used to show the\n      difference between the Oxymizer\u00ae and a conventional nasal cannula regarding exercise\n      duration at 70% of peak Watt and oxygenation.\n\n      The tests will be accompanied by blood gas analysis, partial pressure of carbon dioxide and\n      heart rate."
