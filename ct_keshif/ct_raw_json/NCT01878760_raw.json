            "textblock": "Despite the introduction of better-structured programmes for paediatric anaesthesia training\n      and the development of some recommendations for paediatric anaesthesia services, the\n      incidence of severe critical events in children is still unknown in Europe. Considering that\n      the major life-threatening complications following general or regional anaesthesia are\n      uncommon, it is therefore crucial to consider a large multinational, multicentre trial in\n      order to establish a realistic statistical estimation and identify the risk factors for\n      severe critical events. Thus, this prospective observational multicentre cohort study is\n      designed to identify the incidence and potential risk factors of severe critical events in\n      children undergoing anaesthesia in Europe.\n\n      The study aims to include all children from birth to 15 years old scheduled for an elective\n      or urgent diagnostic or surgical procedure under sedation or general anaesthesia with or\n      without regional analgesia or under regional anaesthesia. This represents the denominator\n      dataset for calculation of the incidence of severe critical events, which is the primary aim\n      of the study. The anaesthesiologist in charge will record the occurrence of selected severe\n      critical events during and up to 60 minutes after anaesthesia or sedation AND requiring\n      immediate intervention. These severe critical incidents include: Laryngospasm, Bronchospasm,\n      Pulmonary aspiration, Drug error, Anaphylaxis, Cardiovascular instability, Neurological\n      damage, Perianaesthetic cardiac arrest and postanaesthetic Stridor. The secondary endpoint\n      is represented by the risk factors and the consequences for the occurrence of these severe\n      critical events including in-hospital mortality established up to 30 days or at discharge.\n      Relevant aspects of the child's medical and family history will be recorded.\n\n      Following sample size estimation, we plan to recruit at least 25 000 children over a period\n      of two consecutive weeks including weekends and after-hours across the 30 European countries\n      represented at the European Society of Anaesthesiology Council or part of geographical\n      Europe. The 2-week recruitment period will be chosen by each site commencing on 15 March\n      2014.The last possible inclusion date will be decided by the Study Steering Committee\n      depending on the recruitment rate. Participating hospitals will be provided with data\n      acquisition sheets that enable anonymous standardized recording of all patients' parameters,\n      which will be used by the local institution to fill in the electronic case report form\n      (eCRF).\n\n      Descriptive statistical analysis will be performed for the primary endpoint (occurrence of\n      severe critical events and 95% confidence interval). Univariate and multivariate analysis\n      will be performed to test factors associated with the endpoint. Results of logistic\n      regression will be reported as adjusted odds ratio (OR) with 95 % confidence intervals."
