      This is a single-arm observational longitudinal study in of patients with metastatic
      castrate-resistant prostate cancer designed to assess the longitudinal trajectory of pain
      and other symptoms.  The study aims to address several key methodological questions that
      will inform the design of future clinical trials with symptom endpoints in this population,
      including: the definition of &quot;clinically meaningful&quot; pain; criteria for concluding a
      clinically meaningful pain reduction; criteria for concluding clinically meaningful pain
      progression; reliable methods quantifying analgesic use (given that &quot;equianalgesic tables&quot;
      and &quot;point scoring systems&quot; are generally considered unreliable by pain researchers and
      regulatory agencies , , ); ideal recall periods for pain questions; tradeoffs of different
      frequencies of symptom reporting; symptom trajectories over time; and associations of pain
      scores with other metrics used in prostate cancer research (imaging, PSA values, circulating
      tumor cells, etc).

    <description>Determine the proportion of pain palliation responders and the proportion experiencing pain progression will be presented along with 95% confidence intervals.</description>

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Determine the clinical significance of pain score changes.  Pain score changes will be compared with each of the following &quot;anchors&quot;: patient rating of change in pain, as well as changes in patient functional status, analgesic use, and various measures of disease status (imaging, PSA, circulating tumor cells). ROC curves derived using logistic regression analyses will be used to characterize the association between  change in pain scores and clinically important improvement (defined by anchor variables).</description>

    <time_frame>3 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Descriptive statistics, including Kaplan-Meier, will be used to report findings for the proportion of asymptomatic men who ultimately develop pain, the median time until asymptomatic men develop pain, the median time until men with pain experience pain progression, and the median time until men with pain experience pain palliation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantifying analgesic medication use</measure>
    <time_frame>26 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Three different approaches to calculating a single value to represent total analgesic use will be compared: 1) equianalgesic tables published in guidelines of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) which convert various drugs and doses to &quot;morphine equivalents&quot;; 2) point scoring systems used in prior pivotal phase 3 trials based on the World Health Organization analgesic ladder in which lower points are assigned to weaker agents/doses and vice versa for stronger agents/doses; and 3) individual drug dose quantification, a dose recently suggested by the FDA but never empirically evaluated, in which each analgesic is considered individually and a 25% change in dose is considered an increase or decrease for each.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Frequency of pain reporting</measure>
    <time_frame>7 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Seven consecutive days of reporting a pain item with a 24-hour recall item will be compared with a single administration of a pain item with a 7-day recall, in order to evaluate if the latter alone is sufficient for measuring pain.</description>

    <description>This single-arm observational study will be conducted at The University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, and four institutions in the Prostate Cancer Clinical Trials Consortium (PCCTC): Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; Johns Hopkins; University of Washington; and Oregon Health &amp; Science University.  UNC is the coordinating center.  The target enrollment is 500 patients, with at least 300 experiencing &quot;moderate or worse&quot; pain intensity at baseline, defined as a score of ≥4, the preferred regulatory cutoff. Targeted enrollment will be used to help ensure that 60% of the patients have at least moderate pain at baseline.</description>

    <intervention_name>Telephone survey system</intervention_name>
    <description>Patients will report pain and analgesic use through the automated telephone system, for 7 days in a row, once every 6 weeks.  Data from diagnostic tests (CT Abdomen/Pelvis, Bone Scan, PSA, and circulating tumor cells) conducted during the study period will be collected from medical records by local personnel and entered into the secure online database quarterly, but no specific tests or schedules will be required in this observational study.  Patients will remain on study for up to 26 months (slightly longer than the expected median survival in this population based on data from docetaxel, abiraterone, and MDV3100 pivotal phase 3 trials).</description>
