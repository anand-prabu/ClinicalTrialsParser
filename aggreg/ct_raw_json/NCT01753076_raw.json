Following a\n      screening period of up to four weeks, eligible subjects will be randomised (1:1) to receive\n      IV placebo or 15 milligram (mg)/ kilogram (kg) IV ozanezumab every 2 weeks for a period of\n      48 weeks with a follow-up visit around 14 weeks after the last infusion. A total of\n      approximately 294 eligible subjects will be randomised from approximately 37 centers\n      worldwide. The primary objective is to assess the effect of ozanezumab on the physical\n      function and survival of ALS subjects over a treatment period of 48 weeks. Function will be\n      measured using the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised (ALSFRS-R). Secondary objectives\n      include the evaluation of other clinical outcomes associated with ALS (respiratory function,\n      muscle strength, progression free survival and overall survival) in support of the primary\n      objective. Quality of life, safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics\n      (ozanezumab and riluzole) will also be assessed."
