Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (leukemia or lymphoma vs solid tumor or other malignancy).\n\n      Patients receive topotecan intrathecally or intraventricularly continuously on days 1-7.\n      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose- limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
