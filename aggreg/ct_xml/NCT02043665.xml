      This study will consist of 2 sequential parts: the first part (VLA009A)is a study of
      intravenous CVA21 as a single agent for the treatment of 4 different advanced solid tumours;
      the second part (VLA009B) is a study of intravenous CVA21 in combination with cytotoxic
      therapy appropriate for the solid tumour selected in the first part. Both parts will be
      open-label, multi-centre, ascending dose escalation (3+3 design) dose-finding and signal
      seeking studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically-confirmed (1) NSCLC, (2) bladder cancer, (3) castrate-resistant
             prostate cancer which are metastatic, or (4) stage 3C or stage 4 melanoma.

          -  VLA009A: Locally advanced and/or metastatic disease for which curative surgery and/or
             radiation therapy is not possible and judged not to be a candidate for the current
             standard of care treatment. VLA009B: locally advanced and/or metastatic disease and
             judged to be a candidate for the selected cytotoxic therapy to be used in combination
             with CVA21.

          -  Patients with metastatic CRPC must have progressive disease despite surgical
             castration or ongoing use of gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists with confirmed
             castrate levels of testosterone.

          -  All subjects in Cohort 3 or Phase 2 dose (P2D) must have a lesion accessible for FNA
             or core or open biopsy on day 8 of the first treatment cycle.

          -  No CVA21 neutralising antibody (≤ 1:16)

          -  ECOG score 0-2

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Patients must give informed written consent

          -  Women of childbearing potential must have negative pregnancy test

          -  Measurable or evaluable disease

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating

          -  HIV, hepatitis B or C infections

          -  Serious neurologic or psychiatric disease

          -  Second primary malignancy within the past 2 years (except non-melanoma skin cancer,
             in situ carcinoma of the cervix, breast cancer)

          -  Active uncontrolled infection

          -  Concurrent immunosuppressive therapy and no known immunosuppressive disease other
             than primary tumour

          -  Residual effects from previous therapy that has not resolved to grade 1 or less
