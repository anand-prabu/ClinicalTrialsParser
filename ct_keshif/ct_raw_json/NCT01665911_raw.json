            "textblock": "The evidence of milk fluoridation as a public health measure in caries prevention has been\n      demonstrated in many clinical studies.  While these data are encouraging, the main focus now\n      should be on the optimization of milk fluoride programs.  This protocol will concentrate on\n      the parameters of fluoride dose and concentration utilizing an in situ model, the intra-oral\n      caries test or model (ICT). The ICT is an established model which features the use of\n      gauze-covered specimens to facilitate plaque growth and to simulate a caries-prone/plaque\n      stagnation area. After subject has been consented and enrolled in the study per the\n      inclusion/exclusion criteria, two to three days following a dental cleaning, two partially\n      demineralized specimens will be placed in the buccal flange area of the subject's mandibular\n      partial denture. During each of the five, three-week test periods, subjects will drink their\n      assigned milk test product once per day for either five (100 ml milk) or ten (200 ml milk)\n      timed minutes, wearing their mandibular partial dentures 24 hours a day during the test\n      period. Fluoride free toothpaste will be used two to three days before and continuously\n      during each treatment period. After each three-week test period, the two partially\n      demineralized specimens will be removed from the subject's partial denture and analyzed\n      using the surface microhardness test. Mineral content change (as percentage of surface\n      microhardness recovery) in these artificially induced incipient enamel lesions will be the\n      primary outcome variable. Each subject (n = 28) will serve as his or her own control."
