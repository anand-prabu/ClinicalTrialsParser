    <textblock>
      This study is an open label, non-randomized phase I single-armed study in women with
      metastatic breast cancer (MBC). The purpose of the study is to estimate the pharmacokinetic
      (PK), tumor necrosis factor-α(TNF-α) and interleukin-β(IL-β), Interferons, IL-1β, IL-2,
      IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, IL-21 and IL-25 levels and pattern after single and multiple
      BP-C1 injections. Additionally to perform a pharmacodynamic (PD) analysis by PK-PD modelling
      with interleukins and change in tumour size.

      All six MBC patients will be recruited from the single participating site. Each included
      patient will participate in a screening period of maximum 21 days + 32 days treatment period
      + 28 days follow-up period. If no further treatment is indicated beyond 32 days as per the
      principal investigator, the maximum duration for one patient will then be 81 days.

      The patients will be treated continuously in 32 days with one intramuscular (IM) injection
      of 0.035 mg/kg bodyweight (0.07 ml/Kg) of BP-C1 daily. This represents a cumulative dose of
      1.12 mg/kg bodyweight (2.24 ml/kg).
