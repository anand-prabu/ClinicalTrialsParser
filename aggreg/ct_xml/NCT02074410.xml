        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Voluntarily provide informed consent, or have a legally authorized representative
             (LAR) provide informed consent with subject assent, in accordance with local
             regulations and governing Institution Review Board (IRB) requirements prior to any
             procedures or evaluations performed specifically for the sole purpose of the study
             (other than the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) to assess capacity to provide
             informed consent). Capacity to provide informed consent will be determined by the
             MoCA and investigator judgment according to the following:

               -  Have a score of greater than or equal to 21 on the MoCA and is competent to
                  provide informed consent, in the judgment of the investigator.

               -  Have a score of less than 21 on the MoCA and is competent to provide informed
                  consent, in the judgment of a mental health professional (independent of the
                  investigator).

               -  Have a score of less than 21 on the MoCA and is not competent to provide
                  informed consent, in the judgment of a mental health professional (independent
                  of the investigator), and has a LAR provide informed consent with assent by the
                  subject.

          2. Have a clinical diagnosis of HD, confirmed by either CAG repeat number of greater
             than or equal to 39 or a positive family history (a first degree relative with a
             clinical diagnosis of HD) if CAG repeat number is not known.

          3. Are 18 to 65 years inclusive at screening visit (Visit 1).

          4. Have a UHDRS Total Functional Capacity greater than or equal to 7 at Visit 1.

          5. If currently taking antipsychotic medication(s), have been on a stable regimen for at
             least 60 days prior to randomization.

          6. Have completed at least 10th grade or equivalent of formal education.

          7. Are fluent in English.

          8. If female, are either a) not of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized
             or post-menopausal for more than 1 year) or b) have a negative pregnancy test and if
             sexually active must agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception
             throughout the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include a reliable
             intrauterine device, hormonal contraception or spermicide in combination with a
             barrier method.

          9. If male, are either a) not of reproductive potential or b) if sexually active must
             agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception throughout the study.
             Acceptable methods of birth control include spermicide in combination with a barrier
             method, or subjects' female partner is willing to use medically acceptable methods of
             birth control.

         10. Have normal clinical laboratory test results and ECG, or results with minor
             deviations, which are not considered to be clinically significant by the
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Have a history or presence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,
             renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or neurological disorders other than HD which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of the study drug or may confound
             the interpretation of study measures.

          2. Have unstable or severe depression, in the opinion of the investigator.

          3. Have alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and
             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.

          4. Have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 60 days prior
             to Visit 1.

          5. Are pregnant or lactating.

          6. Are an employee of Omeros, an investigator, or study staff member, or their immediate
             family member.
