WE\n      hypothesize that subjects with OSA will have a higher Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) with\n      desaturation and the investigators expect that post-operative CPAP treatment in the PACU\n      will significantly improve the AHI and therefore improve patient safety in the PACU. The\n      investigators also hypothesize that subjects with OSA have a greater decrease in oxygen\n      saturation in response to opioid administration by patient-controlled opioid analgesia\n      (PCA)."

It seems logical to evaluate if these patients would benefit from\n      post-operative CPAP treatment in the PACU. The results of this multidisciplinary study will\n      have an impact on PACU treatment of patients with OSA and will further optimize patient care\n      at MGH."
