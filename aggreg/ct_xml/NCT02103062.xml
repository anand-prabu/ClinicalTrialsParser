      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Abraxane
      (nab-paclitaxel) in subjects with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer.  Subjects
      will be placed into two separate cohorts based on their KRAS mutation status.

      ABI-007-COLO-001 is a Phase 2, single arm, open label, multicenter study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of Abraxane (nab-paclitaxel) given on days 1, 8 and 15 of a 28 day cycle
      in subjects with previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer. Subjects will be enrolled
      into cohorts by KRAS mutation status (wildtype or mutated). Stage 1 in a given cohort will
      enroll 15 subjects in the Intention to Treat population and if more than 8 subjects have
      Progression Free Survival at the 8 week assessment, then Stage 2 will open in the respective
      cohort.  Stage 2 will enroll an additional 28 subjects for a total of 43 subjects in each
      cohort.  The study will be positive if more than 26 subjects with Progression Free Survival
      at the 8 week assessment are observed in 43 subjects per cohort.

             therapy, defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without

             pneumonitis or multiple allergies 14. Subject has any other concurrent severe and/or
             uncontrolled medical condition that would, in the investigator's judgment,
             contraindicate subject participation in the clinical study (e.g. chronic
             pancreatitis, chronic active hepatitis, etc.) 15. Subject is enrolled in any other
             clinical protocol or investigational study with an interventional agent or
             assessments that may interfere with study procedures 16. Subject has any significant
             medical condition, laboratory abnormality, or psychiatric illness that would prevent
             the subject from participating in the study 17. Subject has any condition that
             confounds the ability to interpret data from the study 18. Subject is unwilling or
             unable to comply with study procedures 19. Subject is a pregnant or nursing female
