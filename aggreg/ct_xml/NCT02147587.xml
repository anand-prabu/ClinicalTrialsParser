      This study will evaluate immune response following administration of zoster vaccine in
      subjects with rheumatoid arthritis  who are receiving background methotrexate and initiate 5
      mg twice daily of tofacitinib or placebo for tofacitinib at least 2 weeks following
      vaccination.
