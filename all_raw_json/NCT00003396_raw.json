Evaluate the use of donor peripheral blood stem cells without\n      graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis to maximize the probability of graft-versus-tumor\n      effect in patients with hematologic malignancies refractory to standard chemotherapy and\n      unlikely to be cured with high dose chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: Prior to peripheral blood stem cell transplant, patients undergo preparative\n      cytoreduction. Patients receive total body irradiation (TBI) beginning on day -5.\n      Radiotherapy is administered in 9 doses over 3 days (3 doses per day for 3 days). Male\n      patients with acute lymphocytic leukemia receive an additional dose of radiation to the\n      testicles. Patients who are ineligible for TBI due to prior radiotherapy receive 2 doses of\n      melphalan IV on day -3. All patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -2 and\n      -1. Anti-thymocyte globulin is also administered IV over 6 hours on days -2 and -1.\n      Approximately 24-36 hours after the last dose of cyclophosphamide, peripheral blood stem\n      cells obtained from the HLA matched related donor are infused into the patient. Patients do\n      not receive graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis after transplant; however, all other forms\n      of supportive care are provided. Patients are followed for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 42 patients will be accrued for this study."
