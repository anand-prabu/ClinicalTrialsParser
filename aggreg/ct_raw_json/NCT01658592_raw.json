The included patients have been\n      treated so far with drugs that inhibits alcohol, or psychological behavior training.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that bilateral NAc-VC DBS will significantly reduce the craving for\n      alcohol and thus enable the patients to decrease their alcohol intake substantially."

The ventral anterior\n      internal capsule(VC) is proved a effective target to obsessive compulsive disorder(OCD).\n      Like other addiction behaviors most alcohol addicts contain obsessive compulsive symptom. We\n      explored an operation method, that is, in the Leksell stereotactic positioning system take\n      VC as the point of entry, take NAc as the point of target, then make sure that the distance\n      between entry and target points are included in the four contacts of electrode of DBS. When\n      stimulator is ON the investigators can adjust parameters so that the coverage of electrode\n      contains both Vc and NAc. The investigators suppose that bilateral NAc-VC DBS will\n      significantly reduce the craving for alcohol and thus enable the patients to decrease their\n      alcohol intake substantially."
