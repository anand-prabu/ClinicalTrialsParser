It was planned to include patients undergoing laparoscopic colorectal surgery with\n      a predetermined anaesthesia protocol.\n\n      Patients will receive a standardized general anesthetic and thoracal epidural anaesthesia.\n      Ventilatory parameters will be adjusted to maintain ETCO2 35 mmHg, Paw 25 cmH2O.Patient age,\n      gen-der, BMI, ASA classification, the duration of surgery, anesthesia, Trendelenburg\n      position and pneumoperitoneum. Hemodynamic parameters, blood gas analyzes, ventilation\n      parameters and EtCO\u2082 values will be recorded. We determined 6 timelines to compare the\n      difference between PaCO\u2082 and EtCO\u2082. These timelines were the times where we could collect\n      the most data regarding blood gas analyzes. Preoperative period: to, 10th minute after the\n      first insuflation and trendelendburg position: t\u2081,the first hour after the first insuflation\n      and trendelendburg position: t\u2082, 10th minute after desuflation and supine position: t\u2083, 10th\n      minute after the second insuflation and trendelendburg position: t\u2084, and 10th minute after\n      the second desuflation and supine position:t\u2085. Primary outcome measure is the difference\n      between PaCO\u2082 and EtCO\u2082 a difference greater than 5 mmHg was assumed to be important."
