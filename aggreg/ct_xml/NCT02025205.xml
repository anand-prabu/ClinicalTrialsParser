  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this prospective, randomized, controlled study is to assess and compare the
      efficacy of the Zephyr endobronchial valves vs. Standard of Care (SoC) in patients suffering
      from COPD with Homogeneous Emphysema. The primary objective is the variation of FEV1 between
      baseline and 3-month follow-up visit. The secondary objectives will evaluate quality of
      life, exercise capacity, dyspnea (including BODE index) changes, target lobe volume
      reduction, as well as safety outcomes.
