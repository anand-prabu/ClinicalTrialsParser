            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the virus that causes AIDS. HIV can hide in the blood\n      for many years, even in people who have their HIV infection under control. HIV that is\n      hiding in the blood is called the    latent HIV reservoir.    Researchers want to find out\n      more about it in this study. This knowledge may help them develop new ways to prevent or\n      control HIV. This study will draw its participants from the Rakai Health Sciences Program in\n      rural southwestern Uganda.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To measure and learn about the latent HIV reservoir in Ugandans with HIV.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Men and women at least 18 years of age with HIV.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. Their medical records will\n           be reviewed. Researchers will ask participants about their health and recent illnesses.\n           Participants able to get pregnant will have their urine tested for pregnancy.\n\n        -  Participants will have their finger pricked to see if they have enough red blood cells\n           to be eligible for the study.\n\n        -  If eligible, participants will have blood drawn through a needle in the arm. Their\n           blood will also be tested for other diseases.\n\n        -  After the blood draw, participants will be asked to stay seated or lying down if they\n           are not feeling well for up to 30 minutes."

            "textblock": "Despite prolonged antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV   1 can persist as transcriptionally\n      inactive proviruses in resting memory CD4+T cells. This latent reservoir has a long half\n      life, and is believed to be the largest impediment to a cure by ART alone. The latent\n      reservoir may be established when activated CD4+ T cells become infected and subsequently\n      revert back to a resting memory state. A major approach to eradicating HIV   1 involves\n      reversing latency in patients on ART. Cells harboring induced proviruses could be lysed by\n      HIV   1   specific cytolytic T lymphocytes, while ART blocks new rounds of infection. The\n      descriptions of the    Berlin patient    and    Mississippi baby    suggest that a\n      functional cure for HIV is possible. This has led to an expansion of research examining HIV\n      latency in the context of sustained viral suppression with an eye towards developing a\n      possible cure regimen that could be used on a large scale. However, it has recently been\n      demonstrated that the latent HIV reservoir could be 60 times larger than previously\n      believed. The recent report that two HIV patients receiving CCR5    competent bone marrow\n      transplants had a reemergence of circulating HIV after fully suppressive therapy was\n      discontinued suggests that a functional cure for large groups of individuals will continue\n      to be an elusive goal.\n\n      The vast majority of HIV   infected individuals currently live in sub   Saharan Africa where\n      fully suppressive ART is expanding rapidly. Due to this expansion, a large number of\n      Africans will be eligible candidates for cure treatment when one comes available. However,\n      strategies needed to establish a functional cure may differ in African populations due to\n      differences in endemic infectious disease load and in cellular immune activation among\n      Africans as compared to Western populations. To date, there have been no systematic studies\n      to quantify the latent reservoir in HIV   infected Africans. This is a crosssectional,\n      descriptive study to measure the size of the latent HIV reservoir in virally suppressed\n      HIVinfected individuals residing in Uganda and to examine the immunological and virologic\n      correlates of the latent reservoir. The study will draw its participants from a National\n      Institutes of Health (NIH) International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) site,\n      located at the Rakai Health Sciences Program (RHSP) in rural southwestern Uganda. One group\n      of subjects will be comprised of 70 HIV   infected patients who are on ART with suppressed\n      viral loads < 40 copies per ml over a period of 10   18 months. A second group will be\n      comprised of 10 HIV   infected subjects with suppressed viral load < 40 copies per ml over a\n      period of 10   18 months and not on antiretroviral drugs (elite suppressors). Study\n      participation will require only one visit with a fingerstick hemoglobin screening and a\n      blood draw. Plasma and cells from the blood will be separated and processed for quantitative\n      viral latency, circulating cytokine and chemokine analysis, co   culture, and flow\n      cytometric and serologic assays for selected immunological parameters. Viral latency results\n      will be interpreted in relation to values previously collected from HIVinfected individuals\n      in the United States."
