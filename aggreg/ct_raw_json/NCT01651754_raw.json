            "textblock": "Background PCF is a frequently occurring, severe, and invalidating problem in cancer\n      survivors, impairing quality of life. The prevalence of PCF observed in longitudinal\n      follow-up studies ranged from 19-39%. Cognitive behavior therapy, especially designed for\n      PCF, seemed to be an effective treatment option for PCF. However, although it is now\n      possible to effectively treat PCF, the nature of the underlying physiology of PCF remains\n      unclear.\n\n      Hypotheses about mechanisms explaining cancer-related fatigue have already been described,\n      including dysregulation of brain serotonin, dysregulation of the\n      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis responsiveness, disruption of the circadian rhythm,\n      alterations in muscle and ATP metabolism, and activation of the vagal afferent nerve.\n      Furthermore, the presence of an underlying immunological problem has been suggested as an\n      explanation for PCF.\n\n      Another group of patients suffering from severe fatigue symptoms are patients with CFS. The\n      estimated worldwide prevalence of CFS is 0.4-1%. In the Netherlands, about 100.000 patients\n      are suffering from chronic fatigue, of which 30.000 to 40.000 suffer from CFS. In contrast\n      to fatigue in patients with PCF, in patients with CFS no clear precipitating factor could be\n      identified. Also for patients with CFS, a cognitive behavior therapy is designed, which is\n      proven to be effective, but the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS remains unclear.\n\n      Hypotheses explaining the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS include morphological and\n      metabolic alterations in the brain, diminished central activation of muscles, altered\n      central nervous system functioning, a neuroendocrine disturbance, or cognitive impairment.\n      Furthermore, the presence of an underlying immunological problem has been suggested as an\n      explanation for CFS.\n\n      If an underlying immunological problem is present, PCF and CFS patients might have an\n      altered response to vaccination.\n\n      Aim Therefore, the aim of this study is to compare the humoral and cellular immune responses\n      upon vaccination, using seasonal influenza vaccination as a model of a vaccination, in PCF\n      and CFS patients, non-fatigued cancer survivors, and healthy controls.\n\n      Research questions\n\n        1. Is the humoral and/or cellular immune response after influenza vaccination different\n           between fatigued patients (PCF and CFS) and non-fatigued individuals?\n\n        2. Is the humoral and/or cellular immune response after influenza vaccination different\n           between PCF and CFS patients? Design The immune responses upon influenza vaccination\n           will be assessed in 20 PCF patients and in 20 CFS patients. As a control group for PCF\n           patients, 20 non-fatigued cancer survivors will be included. Additionally, 20 healthy\n           controls will participate in this study as a control group without a cancer history and\n           without fatigue symptoms. These four groups will be age- and sex-matched.\n\n      At baseline, participants will complete the Checklist Individual Strength, a questionnaire\n      about the current use of medicines, and a questionnaire about their vaccination history. All\n      participants will be intramuscularly vaccinated with a single dose of the seasonal influenza\n      vaccine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells will be collected at baseline (day 1) and 7 days\n      after vaccination (day 8), and serum will be collected at baseline and 21 days after\n      vaccination (day 22). Half a year after vaccination, all participants will be contacted to\n      check whether a possible infection by influenza had taken place in the meantime or not.\n\n      The humoral immune responses on influenza vaccination will measured at day 1 and day 22 in\n      serum by the haemagglutination-inhibition antibody test. The cellular immune responses will\n      be measured at day 1 and day 8 by T lymphocyte proliferation, activation, and cytokine\n      secretion.\n\n      Relevance of this study To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to explore both the\n      humoral and cellular immune responses after influenza vaccination in both PCF and CFS\n      patients. By means of this study, we would like to improve the understanding of the\n      underlying physiology of PCF and CFS."
