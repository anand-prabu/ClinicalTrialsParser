  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this project is to develop a panel of cardiovascular risk biomarkers
      that can detect differences in the cardiovascular safety of various tobacco products,
      whether conventional, new or emerging, in order to help the FDA with the task of regulating
      them. This will be achieved through 4 aims:

      Aim 1: Determine the relative contributions of nicotine and combustion products to the
      cardiovascular risk of active cigarette smoking.

      Aim 2: Determine which cardiovascular risk biomarkers are affected by exposure to secondhand
      smoke.

      Aim 3: Determine the cardiovascular risk of smokeless tobacco use. Aim 4: Determine the
      cardiovascular risk of electronic cigarettes and the respective contributions of nicotine
      and electronic cigarette vapor.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoking is  a major cause of cardiovascular disease (CVD).1 In contrast, the
      cardiovascular risks of other popular tobacco products (smokeless tobacco), new tobacco
      products ( e-cigarettes) and proposed products (reduced nicotine cigarettes) are not
      adequately understood. The FDA will need information about the cardiovascular safety of
      these products to inform their regulatory decisions. While long-term clinical outcome
      studies of the cardiovascular risks of these tobacco products would be optimal, they take
      too long to provide the data that the FDA needs now. Disturbances in the function of
      vascular endothelium (the lining of arteries, which plays an important role in regulating
      vascular function) and the activation of the autonomic nervous system, as well as increased
      inflammation, oxidative stress and propensity to thrombosis (clotting), are key mechanisms
      in the progression of CVD and validated biomarkers of CVD risk. These biomarkers form the
      basis for our model to assess the CVD risks of tobacco product use and secondhand smoke
      exposure. We will conduct controlled, short-term exposures of human subjects to test
      products that provide a wide range of nicotine, particle, and other cardiovascular toxin
      concentrations to determine how these components associated with tobacco use adversely
      affect cardiovascular risk.
