    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical performance of the Arcos
      Revision Stem system, determine the stability of the implants, and evaluate any relationship
      between Paprosky bone defect level and the success of the Arcos Stem.

      Primary Endpoint: Harris Hip Score at 1 year follow-up Secondary Endpoints: Stability and
      Fixation of Arcos Hip by radiographic assessment, Overall Survivorship, and Relationship
      between Paprosky bone defect level and survivorship in years.

      Case Report Forms: Demographic Data, Paprosky Acetabular/Femoral Defects, Operative Data,
      Oxford Hip Score, Harris Hip Score, EQ-5D, Collection of X-rays, Radiographic Evaluation
      form, Adverse Events, Revisions, Lost to Follow-up, and Protocol Deviations

      200 Patients: 100 with BoneMaster HA, 100 without BoneMaster HA Up to ten sites will be used
      to fulfill enrollment to this study

      All cases enrolled will be those implanted with either the Cone, Broached, or Calcar
      Proximal Body and one of the five distal options (Slotted, Bullet-tip, Interlocking, STS, or
      ETO).

      To be included in the study, a patient must be prescribed a revision total hip arthroplasty
      with the Arcos system. The Arcos system is to be used in accordance to the indications for
      use and contraindications detailed in the approved labeling of the device.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Noninflammatory degenereative joint disease including osteoarthritis and avascular
             necrosis

          -  Rheumatoid arthritis

          -  Correction of functional deformity

          -  Treatment of non-union, femoral neck fracture, and trochanteric fractures of the
             proximal femur with head involvement, unmanageable using other techniques.

          -  Revision of previously failed total hip arthroplasty.

        The Arcosâ„¢ Modular Femoral Revision System hip components are single-use implants,
        intended for uncemented use only.

        Only subjects who have received or have already been scheduled to receive hip surgery with
        the Arcos Revision Stem System will be included in this outcomes study.

        Additional Inclusion Criteria:

          -  No age limit, however, the patient must have reached full skeletal maturity.

          -  Willing to return for follow up evaluation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Absolute contraindications include: active infection, sepsis, and osteomyelitis.

        Relative contraindications include:

          -  Uncooperative patient or patient with neurologic disorders who are incapable of
             following directions

          -  Osteoporosis

          -  Metabolic disorders which may impair bone formation

          -  Osteomalacia

          -  Distant foci of infections which may spread to the implant site

          -  Rapid joint destruction, marked bone loss or bone resorption apparent on
