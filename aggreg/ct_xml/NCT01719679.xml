  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The provision of adolescent vaccination in a school setting will be feasible and acceptable
      to parents as evidenced by the  number and percentage of students immunized within each
      school compared to those in schools without a program. The likelihood of vaccination for
      diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis (Tdap), human papillomavirus (HPV), and meningococcal
      conjugate vaccine (MCV4) and all three combined) among eligible students enrolled in schools
      with a comprehensive school-based immunization program will be significantly higher than
      that of students enrolled in schools without a school-based immunization program.
