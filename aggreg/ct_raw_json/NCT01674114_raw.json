Postoperatively the patient gets routinely a combination of\n      Paracetamol and NSAID`s orally and Morphine intravenously as required. The side-effects of\n      Morphine (nausea, vomiting, itching and sedation) do interfere, dose dependent, with the\n      interaction between mother and child, breastfeeding and postpartum experience.\n\n      Previous studies have compared transversus abdominis plane block (TAP block) with reduction\n      of morphine consumption in C-section (up to 50%! (1,2). So far no one has compared TAP-block\n      with local infiltration in C-section patients.\n\n      Ultrasound guided TAP-block is done by an anaesthesiologist at the end of the operation, and\n      it is viewed as a safe and easy procedure to perform. The investigators assumption is that\n      the TAP-block reduces the morphine consumption with 50% as compared to local infiltration.\n      Due to maximal dosage of Bupivacaine, it is not possible to give both types of anaesthesia\n      at the same time."
