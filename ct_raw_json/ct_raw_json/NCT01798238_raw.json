Also there is inconvenience, such as adjusting\n           metformin dose depending on patient's condition.\n\n        -  MP-513 is expected to be safely used as a treatment for type 2 diabetes because it has\n           no risk of hypoglycemia and/or weight gain which are reported in pre-existing diabetes\n           therapies and no inconvenience related to dose adjustment depending on patient's\n           condition, and no cases of fatal side effects.\n\n        -  Furthermore the inhibitory effect on Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV was stronger and half-life\n           was longer compared with other dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibitors in non-clinical\n           trial, and blood glucose moderating effects are proven to be clinically significant in\n           clinical trials conducted in Europe and Japan in that its development as a therapeutic\n           agent for patients with type 2 diabetes is considered to be promising.\n\n        -  Based on these previous studies, the objective of this study is to investigate the\n           efficacy and safety in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus that is not adequately\n           controlled with exercise and diet."
