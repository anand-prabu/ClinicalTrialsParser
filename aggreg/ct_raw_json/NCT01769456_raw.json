Assignment to behavioral intervention, which include Many Men, Many\n      Voices (3MV) and Personalized Cognitive Counseling (PCC), will occur at the level of the\n      site.  Subjects will first complete the behavioral intervention offered at their respective\n      site and will then be provided with open label emtricitabine (FTC)/tenofovir (TDF)\n      (Truvada\u00ae) as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).  Behavioral and biomedical data will be\n      collected at baseline and at 0, 4, 8, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks.  Any subject who becomes HIV\n      infected during the course of the study will be discontinued from the study agent and be\n      followed for an additional 24 weeks after the study visit at which HIV infection is\n      confirmed.  Those subjects who meet specific bone or renal criteria at the Week 48 visit or\n      the 24-Week HIV Seropositive visit will be followed for an additional 48 weeks in the\n      Extension Phase to more closely monitor longer-term outcome of potential concerns."

The study will also examine patterns of\n      sexual risk behavior among high-risk HIV-1 uninfected YMSM in the U.S. who are provided with\n      open label FTC/TDF (Truvada\u00ae) as PrEP.  The study will also explore the feasibility and\n      acceptability of implementing two different types of efficacious risk reduction\n      interventions prior to the provision of PrEP - 3MV and PCC.  The inclusion of a behavioral\n      intervention in this project not only addresses our ethical responsibility of providing at\n      least the minimum risk reduction education to all subjects given the high HIV risk of our\n      study population, but also builds behavioral skills to assist subjects in reducing their\n      risk when not taking PrEP.  Furthermore, the study will evaluate the process of protocol\n      implementation to better understand how to best implement PrEP research and program practice\n      at adolescent medicine sites, including an evaluation of consent procedures and the\n      acceptability/feasibility of allowing youth minors to consent for their own participation in\n      this HIV prevention intervention, to the extent allowable by local laws and regulations, and\n      to allow youth minor participation in a clinical trial without requiring disclosure of their\n      sexual orientation and risk behaviors to their parents or guardians."
