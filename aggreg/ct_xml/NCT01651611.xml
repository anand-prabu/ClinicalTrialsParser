    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether public housing residents trained in
      Tobacco Cessation and Motivational Interviewing Techniques to become Tobacco Treatment
      Advocates(TTA) will be effective in increasing the quit rate of smokers in Boston Public
      Housing. The investigators hypothesize that smokers that receive multiple TTA visits will be
      more likely to (1) use smoking cessation resources and (2) quit compared to smokers who
      receive a single visit.

      The study is a group-randomized trial in which 10 pubic housing developments (PHDs) are
      randomized to the experimental condition and 10 to the control condition.  All smokers who
      enroll in the study at a particular PHD receive the same intervention. Smokers at control
      sites receive written materials that offer strategies for quitting and information about
      availability of treatment programs, as well as a one-time meeting with a Tobacco Treatment
      Advocate (TTA). The intervention group receives the same written materials but also has much
      more extensive interactions with a TTA. TTAs provide peer counseling (Peer Counseling is
      defined as: performance of limited counselor functions, under counselor supervision, by
      person of similar age,gender, race, ethnicity and/or SES of  the counselee) to smokers
      during in- person Motivational Enhancement meetings (target range 7-9) as well as additional
      in person and phone contacts, as needed for each participant, over a 6-month period. TTAs
      receive intensive training in motivational interviewing and smoking cessation counseling
      deliver the intervention components (counseling activities and provision of environmental
      supports) in addition to encouraging utilization of smoking cessation treatment programs
      such as the Smokers' QuitLine (SQL) and clinic-based programs. In order to avoid the
      potential for contamination due to TTAs interacting with participants at both intervention
      and control sites, meetings with participants at control sites are conducted by special
      Control TTAs. Data are collected from study participants at baseline, 3 months, 7 months and
      12 months, and also from the SQL and clinics.
