  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess safety and
      tolerability of GSK2330672 administration in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC)
      and symptoms of pruritus. It is a double-blind, crossover study with subjects receiving
      placebo or GSK23306772 in random order during two 14-day treatment periods.  Additionally,
      the study will determine GSK2330672 exposure and interactions with ursodeoxycholic acid
      (UDCA). The total duration of subject participation will be 12 weeks for screening (28 days)
      and the treatment period. Subjects who are eligible for enrolment will participate in a
      2-week placebo run-in period. Subjects will be randomized in a crossover fashion (Sequence 1
      / Sequence 2) to receive placebo or GSK2330672 treatment during two consecutive 2-week study
      periods. Subjects will then participate in a 2-week placebo dosing period ending in
      follow-up assessments. Study results will be utilized to form a benefit: risk profile for
      GSK2330672 in PBC that will determine plans for progression to exploratory efficacy trials

             immunosorbent assay [ELISA]) or PBC-specific antinuclear antibodies (antinuclear dot
             and nuclear rim positive); liver biopsy consistent with PBC.

          -  Screening AP value between 1.2 and 10 × upper limit of normal (ULN).

          -  Subjects should be on stable doses of UDCA for &gt;8 weeks at time of screening.
