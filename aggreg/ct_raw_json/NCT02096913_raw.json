The primary safety\n      analysis is based on the incidence of severe gastrointestinal bleedings. In addition, the\n      feasibility of recruitment procedure, and oral administration of the compound within the\n      multidisciplinary setting of acute intensive medical care will be explored. Furthermore, the\n      pharmacokinetics of Ibuprofen under the condition of acute motor complete SCI will be\n      investigated. Secondary endpoints will permit preliminary statements about effects on\n      neuropathic pain, spasticity, and neurological function."
