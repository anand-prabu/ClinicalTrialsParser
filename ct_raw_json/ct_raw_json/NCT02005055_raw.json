The planning target volume was defined as a cylinder along the axis of the scar, with a central diameter of 5mm. Patients received 2 fractions of HighDoseRate brachytherapy. Within 4 hours after the resection, the first brachytherapy fraction of 6 Gy at 5mm of the source axis was given. Within 24 hours after the first fraction a second fraction of 6Gy was administered to a total dose of 12Gy in 2 days. After the second fraction the catheter was gently removed.",
