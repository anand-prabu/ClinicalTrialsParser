Epidemiological data showed\n      adynamic bone disease (ABD) is the most frequent bone disorder in CKD stage 5D diseases. Low\n      PTH, diabetes mellitus, malnutrition, metabolic acidosis, hypogonadism and low 1,25(OH)2D\n      vitamin D deficiency are known risk factors for ABD. Mounting experimental data point\n      towards a role of protein-bound uremic retention molecules (p-cresyl sulfate and indoxyl\n      sulfate) in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD. ABD is not only recognized as a risk\n      factor for fractures but also for arterial calcification.\n\n      The aim of the present study is  (1) to investigate the role of indoxyl sulfate and p-cresyl\n      sulfate in the pathogenesis and progression of ABD and arterial calcification in CKD stage5\n      and (2) to investigate the influence of renal transplantation on bone and arterial\n      metabolism."
