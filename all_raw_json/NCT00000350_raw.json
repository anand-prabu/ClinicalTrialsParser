To determine whether\n      DA synthesis capacity, assessed by FDOPA uptake, in the striatum is altered in Coc or Meth\n      dependence.  To determine whether the PET tracers, WIN or FDOPA, will differentiate Meth\n      induced alterations from those induced by Coc use. To determine whether the PET\n      characterization of striatal alterations observed at 3-5 days since last drug use persists\n      at least 3 months after last drug use."
