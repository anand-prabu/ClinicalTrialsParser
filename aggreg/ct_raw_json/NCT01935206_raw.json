This suggests latent sensitization.\n\n      In the present study, investigators hypothesize that naloxone (2 mg/kg) can reinstate\n      secondary hyperalgesia 168 hours after a first-degree burn-injury. Investigators aim\n      therefore to show that latent sensitization is present in humans and is modulated by\n      endogenous opioids."
