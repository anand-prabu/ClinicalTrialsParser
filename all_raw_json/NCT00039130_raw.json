            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab can locate tumor cells and either kill\n      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the numbers of immune cells\n      found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from\n      the side effects of chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with rituximab and filgrastim may\n      kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining rituximab with chemotherapy\n      and filgrastim in treating patients who have Burkitt's lymphoma or Burkitt's leukemia."

Patients are stratified according to disease (leukemia\n      vs lymphoma).\n\n        -  Course 1: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 5-15 minutes daily on days 1-5 and\n           oral prednisone on days 1-7.  Allopurinol PO will be given on days 1-14.\n\n        -  Courses 2, 4, and 6: Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-5;\n           vincristine IV over 10 minutes and methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1; leucovorin\n           calcium IV over 15 minutes every 6 hours on day 2; cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 4\n           and 5 and etoposide IV over 1 hour daily on days 4 and 5; oral dexamethasone daily on\n           days 1-5; and methotrexate and cytarabine intrathecally (IT) on day 1. During course 2,\n           patients receive rituximab IV over 1-4 hours on days 8, 10, and 12. During courses 4\n           and 6, patients receive rituximab IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive\n           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood\n           counts recover.\n\n        -  Courses 3, 5, and 7: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 5-15 minutes daily on\n           days 1-5; vincristine IV over 10 minutes and methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1;\n           leucovorin calcium IV every 6 hours on day 2; doxorubicin IV daily on days 4 and 5;\n           oral dexamethasone daily on days 1-5; methotrexate and cytarabine IT on day 1; and\n           rituximab IV over 1 hour on day 8. Patients also receive G-CSF as in courses 2, 4, and\n           6. After course 3, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
