Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of AAG until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
