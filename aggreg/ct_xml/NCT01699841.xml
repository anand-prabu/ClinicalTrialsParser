      The purpose of this study is to understand how breast milk may protect infants from
      infection and promote favorable immunological, growth and development outcomes. By following
      mothers and their infants, we will evaluate the important interactions between infant immune
      responses and infectious disease events in relation to breast milk composition and feeding
      patterns. Our aim is to identify a set of predictive factors corresponding to healthy early
      infant growth and development in this setting in Northern Tanzania.
