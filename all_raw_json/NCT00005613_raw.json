Combining chemotherapy with allogeneic or autologous peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs\n      and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of allogeneic stem cell transplantation\n      with that of autologous peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease."

Compare the relapse rate, progression free survival, and overall survival in\n      patients with high risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease treated with allogeneic\n      vs autologous stem cell transplantation. II. Compare the toxicities (short and long term) of\n      these 2 regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Cytoreductive therapy: Patients receive 3 courses of salvage chemotherapy (e.g.,\n      dexamethasone, high dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (DHAP); etoposide, methylprednisolone,\n      high dose cytarabine, and cisplatin (ESHAP); fludarabine, mitoxantrone, and dexamethasone\n      (FND)). Harvest: Patients with an HLA identical sibling donor are assigned to the allogeneic\n      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation group. Patients without an HLA identical\n      sibling are assigned to the autologous PBSC transplantation group. Allogeneic OR autologous\n      PBSC are harvested. Conditioning regimen: Patients receive high dose chemotherapy comprised\n      of cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -6 to -3 and carmustine IV over 3 hours and\n      etoposide IV over 3 hours on days -6 to -4. PBSC are infused on day 0. Patients are followed\n      weekly for 3 months, then monthly for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years."
