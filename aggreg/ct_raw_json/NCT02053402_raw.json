The sample size calculations are based on the hypothesis that\n      vitamin D supplementation will result in a 25% improvement in asthma symptoms as measured by\n      the Asthma Treatment Assessment Questionnaire (ATAQ) and peak flow readings. The children\n      will be randomized into one of two groups; one group will be given 1200 IU of vitamin and\n      the other a placebo. The vitamin D or placebo will be given in the morning daily to each\n      child for six months. The children will be assessed monthly by the study physician, to\n      evaluate for signs of poor asthma control e.g.  persistent cough and recurrent wheezing. The\n      heights and weights and peak expiratory flow meter readings will also be obtained monthly\n      for six months. Blood samples will be taken for Vitamin D levels, calcium, phosphorus levels\n      at baseline, third month and at the end of the study. All enrolled children will be required\n      to produce their tablet containers for pill counting on a monthly basis to ensure adherence."
