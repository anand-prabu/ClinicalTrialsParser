The blood will be drawn\n      by putting a needle into a vein in the subject's arm.  Each time, one small tube of blood\n      will be taken. This will take about five minutes. The Investigators anticipate that the\n      total volume of blood taken over the course of study from each subject will be around 110\n      milliliters.\n\n      The subject will have their blood pressure measured with a blood pressure cuff during each\n      visit. The height, weight and pulse rate will also be measured. This will take about five\n      minutes.\n\n      The subject will have an ultrasound of her liver at the 6 week postpartum visit and 12 month\n      postpartum visit.  This will take about 30 to 60 minutes.\n\n      The subject's understanding and approval of these procedures is required if they are to\n      participate in this study.\n\n      The investigator's study coordinator will call the subject twice: 3 months and 9 months\n      after the subject has had the baby. During each phone call, the study coordinator will ask\n      the subject how the baby is being fed. The investigators will also update information about\n      development of any new medical problems and medications the subject's doctor might have\n      started."
