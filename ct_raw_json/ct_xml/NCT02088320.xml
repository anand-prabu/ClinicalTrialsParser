    <textblock>
      The focus of the present study is to further develop an echocardiographic technique to
      measure cardiopulmonary transit time (PTT) and pulmonary blood volume (PBV) using ultrasound
      contrast.

      The Specific Aims for the present study are as follows:

        1. To compare echocardiography-based PTTs and cardiac MRI-based PTTs obtained using a
           'peak-to-peak' method

        2. To further quantify the relationship between echocardiographically-derived PTT, using
           Optison, and existing echocardiographic methods used to determine ventricular function

        3. To measure the reproducibility of echocardiographically-based PTT using Optison.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female sex, age &gt;18 years who are having an echocardiogram done for clinical
             reasons.  Based on the potential for further support of our work, this may expand to
             include volunteers who would otherwise not be undergoing an echocardiogram.

          2. Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential

          3. If eligible for cMRI, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &gt; 30 mL/min

          4. If eligible for cMRI, cMRI checklist obtained

          5. Able to give informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Unable to give informed consent

          2. Known right-to-left, bidirectional, or transient right-to-left cardiac shunts

          3. Currently participating in another clinical treatment trial

          4. Known allergic reaction to Optison ultrasound contrast

          5. If eligible for cMRI, known allergic reaction to cMRI contrast

          6. If eligible for cMRI, contraindication to cMRI

          7. If eligible for cMRI, pre-cMRI eGFR &lt; 30 mL/min

          8. Pregnancy/Nursing
