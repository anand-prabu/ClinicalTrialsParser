Determine overall survival, time to disease progression, objective reponse\n      rate, safety profile, and quality of life in patients with inoperable gastric adenocarcinoma\n      when treated with doxorubicin HCl liposome.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks. Treatment\n      continues for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression. Patients with responding disease may continue therapy past the 6 courses until\n      documented disease progression. Quality of life is assessed prior to every treatment course.\n      All patients are followed at 1 month. Patients with stable or responding disease are then\n      followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 24 months."
