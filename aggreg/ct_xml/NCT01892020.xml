    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of biphasic insulin aspart 50 (BIAsp 50) twice daily versus biphasic human insulin 50
      (BHI 50) twice daily, both in combination with metformin, in Chinese subjects with type 2
      diabetes mellitus.
