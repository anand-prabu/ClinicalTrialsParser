            "textblock": "Background New oral antiplatelet agents such as ticagrelor and prasugrel are superior in\n      comparison with clopidogrel in acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients in reducing morbidity,\n      according to the PLATO and TRITON-TIMI trials with a cost of increasing bleedings rate [1,\n      2]. The PLATO trial also showed reduction in mortality rate in the ticagrelor group compared\n      with clopidogrel, which was evident in a wide array of patient subgroups. Both studies\n      included patients treated with aspirin in addition to P2Y12 inhibitors, which may have\n      contributed to the higher bleeding rate. This was evident in the CURE trial [3], which\n      compared dual antiplatelet comprising aspirin and clopidogrel to aspirin treatment alone.\n      The CURE trial have shown improved outcome of ACS patients with dual therapy vs. monotherapy\n      with aspirin.\n\n      However, a geographic analysis of the PLATO trial has shown that patients in the USA had no\n      morbidity and mortality benefit with ticagrelor compared with clopidogrel, which was\n      associated mainly with different dose of aspirin treatment[4]. In further analysis it has\n      been shown that, while patients who were treated with low dose of aspirin benefited from\n      treatment with ticagrelor compared to clopidogrel, while in patients who were treated with\n      high dose aspirin and clopidogrel group had a lower incidence of ischemic events compared\n      with low-dose aspirin, regardless of geography. Interestingly, among ticagrelor patients,\n      high-dose aspirin conferred an increased risk of ischemic events compared to low dose\n      aspirin (<100mg).\n\n      Currently, a large multi-center trial is recruiting patients following PCI in order to\n      evaluate the addition of aspirin to ticagrelor beyond one month, and is scheduled to finish\n      in 2016 [5].\n\n      A recent consensus paper has acknowledged the importance of platelet reactivity testing\n      result as a prognostic factor in ACS patients [6], emphasizing the importance of platelet\n      reactivity role in the evaluation of ACS patients risk for both ischemic and bleeding\n      events.\n\n      A few studies have shown that Clopidogrel reduces platelet response not only to ADP but also\n      to arachidonic acid (AA), which is considered aspirin specific pathway[7,8]. Recent studies\n      conducted among healthy volunteers have shown that more potent P2Y12 inhibitors reduce\n      platelet response to AA, and that the addition of aspirin produces neglect additional\n      inhibitory effect [9,10].\n\n      These findings lead to the astounding hypothesis that the addition of aspirin to the novel\n      P2Y12 inhibitors has no impact on platelet reactivity and thus no beneficiary effect on\n      patients morbidity and mortality[11].\n\n      In addition, it has been shown that aspirin contributes to 2-3 times higher rate of\n      gastrointestinal bleeding even in lower dosage [12, 13], which have a detrimental impact on\n      morbidity and mortality among cardiac patients[14, 15].\n\n      Thus far, no study has evaluated the impact on aspirin in addition to the newer and more\n      potent P2Y12 inhibitors, among ACS patients and current guidelines recommend dual\n      anti-platelet therapy consisting of aspirin and a novel P2Y12 inhibitor in this population.\n\n      Objective Our goal is to examine the effect of aspirin in addition to new anti-platelet\n      agent (ticagrelor\\prasugrel) on platelet reactivity in comparison with placebo, among ACS\n      patients treated percutaneously.\n\n      Design The proposed study is a randomized-controlled, double blind trial, conducted among\n      ACS patients treated percutanousely. Eligible patients will recruited during hospitalization\n      due to ACS after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), and randomization by envelopes on\n      1:1 basis will take place a month after the index event, at a follow-up visit at the cardiac\n      clinic.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria\n\n        -  Age>18 years\n\n        -  ACS defined according to the 3rd universal definition of MI\n\n        -  PCI therapy Exclusion Criteria\n\n        -  Indication for anticoagulant therapy\n\n        -  ACS on new P2Y12 inhibitors treatment\n\n        -  Contraindication to P2Y12 therapy\n\n        -  Renal failure defined as creatinine \u22651.5 mg/dL\n\n        -  Non-compliance\n\n        -  Life-threatening extra-cardiac disease or malignancy with a life expectancy below 1\n           year\n\n        -  Inability to sign an informed consent\n\n        -  Participation in another trial during the previous 6 months\n\n      Baseline characteristics and in-hospital therapy will be recorded, including, comorbidities,\n      medications, clinical presentation, ECG data, blood test results including troponin and CPK\n      levels, hemoglobin and renal function test, angiographic characteristics and therapy and\n      in-hospital events such as arrhythmias, heart failure, recurrent ischemia and bleeding.\n\n      Platelet function tests will be include platelet aggregometry (PA) evaluated by a\n      turbidimetric PACKS-4 Aggregometer (Helena Laboratories, Beaumont, Texas), using adenosine\n      diphosphate (ADP) 10 m M and arachidonicacid 1.6 mM as agonists, in addition to VerifyNow\n      test and platelet activation by FACS.\n\n      Platelet reactivity will be performed during hospitalization at least 72 hours following\n      initiation of ticagrelor or prasugrel therapy. Randomization will be performed after a month\n      of dual anti-platelet therapy with aspirin and new P2Y12 inhibitors in order to reduce risk\n      of early stent thrombosis.  Patients will be summoned to the cardiac ambulatory clinic and a\n      second platelet function tests set will be performed. After which, patients will be\n      randomized to two groups receiving aspirin or placebo for two weeks and a third tests set\n      will be taken. Thereafter the patient groups will be crossed over for an additional two\n      weeks and a last set of test will be taken.\n\n      After the last set of tests, patients will be switched back to open-label 100 mg aspirin\n      therapy a day and PA will be repeated at 2 weeks follow-up. All patients will be followed-up\n      for an additional month for the occurrence of clinical events.\n\n      End-points The primary end-point is PA in response to AA. Secondary end-points will include\n      platelet reactivity according to the PA and VerifyNow test in response to ADP and platelet\n      activation.\n\n      Clinical outcomes including all-cause and cardiac mortality and hospitalizatios, recurrent\n      ischemia and stent thrombosis, and bleeding events along with blood transfusions, will be\n      recorded as safety end-points.\n\n      Statistical Analysis The primary and secondary endpoints of the study will be assessed by\n      treatment allocation on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\n      The required sample size is based on the primary end point of the study, with the use of a\n      meaningful difference between the aspirin vs. placebo groups of one standard deviation from\n      mean baseline values. Using a 1:1 randmization design, a total of 30 patients will be\n      required to obtain at least 80% power and a 5% one-sided type I error , assuming \u226415%\n      withdrawal rate following enrollment.  Student's t-test will be used to test for a\n      difference in prespecified endpoints between  the 2 randomized groups in an\n      intention-to-treat bassis.\n\n      In the analysis, if the assumption of normality is violated, a nonparametric test\n      (Mann-Whitney test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test) will be performed.\n\n      The effect of treatment allocation on the clinical secondary end points will be assessed\n      using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis."
