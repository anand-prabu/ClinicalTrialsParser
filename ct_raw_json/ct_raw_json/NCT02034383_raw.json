Studies have demonstrated that\n      Atwater general factors overestimate the energy derived from protein and fat, as well as the\n      measured metabolizable energy of mixed diets, particularly those that are high in dietary\n      fiber. Studies are lacking, however, that examine how different processing methods affect\n      the metabolizable energy of a food due to differences in chemical structure and\n      availability."
