In addition, the study will examine whether the effectiveness of d-cycloserine\n      depends on the timing of the pill administration (i.e., 1- hour before the session or\n      immediately after the session) as well as the success of the CBT therapy sessions. The\n      investigators hypothesize that the tailored post-session DCS administration condition will\n      outperform the other conditions (pre-session DCS, placebo, and non-tailored post-session\n      DCS). This will be evidenced by short- and long-term improvements in social anxiety\n      severity."

Sessions 2-5 emphasize repeated exposure tasks, which consist of role-play activities to confront fearful situations in a group setting while disputing cognitive distortions (coupled with the fading of safety behaviors). At the conclusion of each exposure session, patients will be encouraged to continue to apply home-practice strategies (such as giving speeches in front of a mirror). Continued practice of the interventions will be considered part of treatment, and patients will be asked to refrain from alternative treatment for four weeks following completion of the last treatment session.",
