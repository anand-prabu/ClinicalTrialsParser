Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine the progression-free and overall survival of patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      II. Determine the effects of prognostic factors (i.e., initial performance status and\n      histological grade) in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\n      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 12 years."
