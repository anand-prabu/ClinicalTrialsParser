            "textblock": "The possibility that humans can taste non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) - so-called fat\n      taste - is a relatively new area of research.  Previous work suggests that subjects require\n      an average of between two and three testing sessions of approximately an hour each before\n      they can reliably detect NEFA, and the average number of visits to get the lowest threshold\n      is six.  Streamlining this process is of great interest to researchers who wish to test many\n      people as quickly as possible. Other taste qualities, including umami and sweet, have shown\n      improvement in detection sensitivity in subjects that have undergone ten second exposures to\n      these taste qualities for 10 days upon subsequent re-testing.  We seek to determine if the\n      same improvements can be seen with fat taste."
