  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the investigators are trying to determine if there are measurable
      changes in prostate MRI that will help predict those who will or will not respond to
      Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) and External Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT) The first
      baseline prostate MRI prior to the start of treatment is standard of care. The participant's
      ADT/EBRT treatment is also standard of care, as advised by their doctor. It is the 3 follow
      up prostate MRIs during ADT/EBRT treatment, and 4 follow up serum PSA levels that are part
      of this research study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If the participant chooses to take part in this research study, the participant will have 3
      follow up prostate MRIs during a 6 month time period, while the participant is having their
      ADT/EBRT treatment. These follow-up prostate MRIs will use a standard imaging protocol
      without the use of an endorectal coil. The participant will also have a total of 4 blood
      samples to measure serum PSA. 1-2 mls (just less than ½ teaspoon) will be taken for each
      sample.

      Research Study Plan

        -  Baseline Visit (routine standard of care screening visit): PSA blood test and prostate
           MRI

        -  Visit 1 (8 weeks after starting ADT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

        -  Visit 2 (6 weeks after starting EBRT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

        -  Visit 3 (on last day of EBRT): PSA blood test

        -  Visit 4 (6 months after finishing EBRT): PSA blood test and prostate MRI

      Planned Follow-up: The investigator would like to keep track of the participant's prostate
      cancer status while they continue to see their doctor at DFCI. The investigators would like
      to do this by collecting the following data from the participant's medical records, to look
      at long-term outcome of their ADT/EBRT treatment.

        -  PSA values

        -  Clinical results of your treatment. The investigator will not contact the participant
           to obtain this information.

    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is whether mpMR parameters measured after 2 months of neoadjuvant ADT therapy (TP1) correlate with nadir PSA post 8-weeks of ADT. In addition, we will determine whether mpMR parameters in areas of tumor (T) in those who fail neoadjuvant ADT (defined as PSA end ADT values &gt;.3 ng/ml) are different to those who respond to ADT (defined as PSA end ADT ≤.3ng/ml)</description>

    <description>A secondary endpoint of this study is whether mpMR parameters measured after 6 weeks of EBRT (TP2) and 8 weeks after completion of EBRT (TP3) correlate with end PSA (defined as PSA level immediately after EBRT treatment). In addition, we will determine whether mpMR parameters in areas of T in those likely to fail combined ADT/EBRT (defined as PSA end values &gt;.5ng/ml) are different to those of responders (PSA end values ≤.5ng/ml).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult males with unfavorable intermediate- to high-risk localized disease, defined
             as:

          -  Clinical or radiographic T2b-T4 primary tumor

          -  Gleason score 7-10 in any core

          -  PSA ≥ 10 prior to initiation of therapy

          -  Patients are deemed suitable for therapy with ADT and EBRT.

          -  Subjects must to able to provide informed written consent prior to study entry.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The standard exclusion criteria for MRI exams will apply which include patients with
             pacemakers, non-compatible intra-cranial vascular clips, inner ear implants, and
             severe claustrophobia.

          -  Patients who because of age, general medical or psychiatric condition, or physiologic
             status unrelated to the presence of prostate cancer are unlikely to be candidates for
             repeat MRIs, or cannot give valid informed consent.

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to undergo the multiparametric MRI exam (non-endorectal
             coil).

          -  Patients with a history of allergic reaction to latex or Gadolinium containing
             intravenous contrast agents.

          -  Individuals with renal disease or other contraindications to gadolinium will be
             excluded.  The BWH standard MRI contrast screening criteria will be used to establish
             renal status.

          -  Patients who have had prior prostatectomy or prior androgen therapy.

          -  Patients with hip implant or any other metallic implant or device that results in
             significant distortion of the local magnetic field and compromise of the quality of
             the multiparametric MRI data.
