            "textblock": "Pregnant women experience unique physiological changes that may result in clinically\n      significant alterations in drug PKs. Unfortunately, there have been few clinical trials to\n      study the PKs of ARV, TB, and hormonal contraceptive drugs in pregnant women. The\n      development of appropriate dosing regimens for the HIV-infected pregnant woman is critical\n      to the health of both mother and fetus. Overdosing may lead to maternal adverse events and\n      increased risk of fetal toxicity, while underdosing may lead to inadequate virologic\n      control, increased risk of developing drug resistance mutations, and a higher rate of\n      perinatal HIV transmission. This study will evaluate dosing regimens that are most effective\n      in preventing perinatal HIV transmission and in maintaining the health of both mother and\n      fetus; evaluate the PKs of ARVs used during pregnancy; evaluate TB drugs used during\n      pregnancy, both in women who are HIV-positive and also taking ARVs and in women who are\n      HIV-negative and not taking ARVs; and evaluate the PKs of hormonal contraceptive medications\n      taken along with ARVs.\n\n      There will be four main groups of study arms: HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs\n      without TB treatment, HIV-infected pregnant women taking ARVs with TB treatment,\n      HIV-uninfected pregnant women taking no ARVs with TB treatment, and HIV-infected pregnant\n      women taking ARVs with postpartum hormonal contraceptives. Participants will not receive\n      medications through this study\u2014they will continue on ARV, TB, and/or contraceptive\n      medications prescribed by their health care providers.\n\n      Women who are 20 0/7 weeks to 34 6/7 weeks pregnant will be enrolled in this study and will\n      remain in the study for 24 weeks after delivery. Postpartum women will be enrolled at 2 to\n      12 weeks after delivery and followed until 6 to 7 weeks after starting contraceptives.\n      Infants will be followed until 24 weeks of life. At all study visits, women will undergo a\n      medical history, a physical exam, and blood collection. At some visits, women in some arms\n      will undergo a vaginal swab. Blood collection from the mother and the detached umbilical\n      cord will occur during delivery. Intensive PK sampling will be performed at study visits\n      during the second and third trimester of pregnancy and between 2 and 3 weeks, 2 and 8 weeks,\n      or 6 and 12 weeks postpartum, with the first sampling occurring within 72 hours of\n      enrollment. The timing of antepartum and postpartum PK samplings will vary by study arm.\n      Additional study visits may occur depending on the ARV drug regimen prescribed."
