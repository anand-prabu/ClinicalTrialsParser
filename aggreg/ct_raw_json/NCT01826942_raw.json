The investigators will also evaluate the effect of shallow fractional laser\n      treatment versus deep parameters settings. If effective treatments could be performed at\n      time of surgery, this would result in both time and cost saving to the patient and to the\n      healthcare system and will improve patient's self-image post surgeries."
