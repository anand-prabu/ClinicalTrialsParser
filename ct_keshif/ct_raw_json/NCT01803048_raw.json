The purpose of this\n      study is to use two advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques called\n      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and resting state functional MRI to compare structural and\n      functional connectivity between individuals with documented mild TBI and healthy controls.\n      To evaluate the significance of structural and functional connectivity for behavior, the\n      brain imaging data will then be related to measures of cognition and emotion. Over a 4-year\n      period, 150 adults with documented mild TBI and 30 healthy controls will participate in the\n      study.\n\n      The study will investigate the following questions and hypotheses:\n\n        1. Evaluate the DWI metric fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of white matter\n           integrity across multiple stages of recovery following mild TBI relative to healthy\n           controls.  It is hypothesized that mild TBI will be associated with greater white\n           matter abnormalities than healthy controls.\n\n        2. It is hypothesized that there will be a relationship between FA, cognition and emotion\n           as a function of the injury.\n\n        3. It is hypothesized that functional connectivity will be related to FA."
