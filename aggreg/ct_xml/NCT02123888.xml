  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The cone beam image is a part of the radiotherapy treatment machine and uses lower energy
      xrays as the head of the radiotherapy machine moves around the patient in a circle. This
      takes pictures that give 3-dimensional information, somewhat like a CT scan. These images
      are better at showing the position of the tumour and surrounding soft tissues than the
      standard xrays that were previously used. Cone Beam Imaging Technology is not new and has
      been used regularly at The Christie for many years. The standard cone beam scan is taken
      before the actual radiotherapy treatment or after the treatment has been delivered.

      Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT or Arc Radiotherapy) is a novel method of delivering
      radiotherapy that involves the continuous movement of the radiotherapy treatment machine
      head around the patient and MLC during radiation.  Arc radiotherapy has been clinically
      implemented at The Christie for prostate radiotherapy treatments and work is in progress for
      implementation in lung radiotherapy. The continuous gantry rotation inherent to VMAT
      delivery makes this simultaneous imaging possible, although there are concerns associated
      with the impact that this may have on patient dose and image quality.

      The aim of this research is to assess whether the image quality of cone beam scans taken
      during treatment are as good as standard cone beam scans taken before or after treatment
      used to determine the accuracy of patient position and the tumour coverage by radiotherapy.
