This study will attempt to obtain at least 120 subjects that will\n      be randomized into two groups: bracing and a general strengthening program vs. bracing and a\n      Pilates/motor learning program combined with a general strengthening program.\n\n      This study will begin with an initial examination and continue with treatment sessions\n      2x/week for 6 weeks.  A follow up phone call will be conducted at 3 months after completing\n      the 6-week protocol. The follow up phone call will be an oral conducted GROC and ODI outcome\n      measures."

            "textblock": "Location: Akron Children's Hospital, Sports Medicine. For research purposes, the study will\n      conclude at the end of the 6 weeks, however, if the patient has not met their physical\n      therapy goals, then physical therapy may continue upon collaboration with the patient and\n      his/her parents (if a minor), physical therapist, and referring physician.\n\n      Initially, there will be a letter to discuss the opportunity to participate in the research\n      study within initial intake paperwork. This will allow the patient and parent to have some\n      preliminary information prior to consulting with the therapist. As is customary, the patient\n      will be assigned to a licensed PT for the initial examination. The initial examining\n      therapist will be responsible to discuss and provide the patient with the pre-enrollment\n      information and informed consent (estimation of time needed approximately 15 minutes) and\n      may obtain consent any time after the pre-enrollment discussion or until the start of the\n      patient's second session. Upon agreement of participation in the study, the patient will be\n      able to complete the additional paperwork required as part of the study (outcome measures).\n      The patient will be randomized after self-inclusion in to the study into one of two groups\n      by role of dice where 1, 3, 5 is the intervention group and 2, 4, 6 is the clinical control\n      group.\n\n      The initial examination will include a subjective history taking, and objective assessment\n      with physical testing of the spine including active range of motion, passive range of\n      motion, strength assessment/endurance assessment of the lumbar musculature. The examination\n      will take approximately 45 minutes to 1 hour in length.\n\n      Description of Subjects (include age range, selection criteria, recruitment procedures,\n      anticipated and desired sample size)-\n\n      Subjects of the ages 12-21 are eligible to participate in this study. Due to the inclusion\n      of a vulnerable subject the responsible party/parent or guardian must grant inclusion and\n      must be able to attend the initial physical therapy evaluation of the minor and sign all\n      consenting documents. The physician offices within the surrounding hospital area and doctors\n      that typically refer to this clinic will be notified of the research study (attachment\n      physician letter and flyer for the facility). Patients will be included in the study if they\n      meet the following criteria:\n\n        1. Age of subject must be between  12-21 years old\n\n        2. Ability to read and understand the English language\n\n        3. Parent/caregiver consent\n\n        4. Written medical diagnosis of spondylolysis or spondylolithesis from the physician with\n           or without imaging.\n\n      The investigators plan to target a maximum of 120 subjects for the study, allowing a 20%\n      drop out rate. This study is powered at n=100 subjects for at least a minimal effect to be\n      calculated.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize a minimal effect on the patient group who receives the\n      investigational \"motor control\" or Pilates based exercise compared to the general core\n      strengthening program patient group.\n\n      Outcome Measures:\n\n      Numeric Pain Rating Scale\n\n      The numeric pain rating scale (NPRS) was used to capture the patient's level of pain.\n      Patients were asked to indicate the intensity of current, best, and worst levels of pain\n      over the past 24 hours using an 11-point scale ranging from 0 (\"no pain\") to 10 (\"worst pain\n      imaginable\"). The average of the three ratings was used to represent the patient's level of\n      pain over the previous 24 hours. This procedure has been shown to have adequate reliability,\n      validity, and responsiveness in patients with LBP  and has a minimally clinical important\n      difference of 2-point change in patients with mechanical low back pain.\n\n      Global Rating of Change Scale\n\n      At the follow-up evaluation, each patient will complete a global rating of change (GROC).\n      Patients will rate their overall perception of improvement since beginning treatment on a\n      scale ranging from -7 (a very great deal worse) to zero (about the same) to +7 (a very great\n      deal better). It has been recommended that scores on the GROC between \u00b13 and \u00b11 represent\n      small changes; scores between \u00b14 and \u00b15 represent moderate changes, and scores of \u00b16 or \u00b17\n      large changes.\n\n      The Modified Oswestry Disability Questionnaire (ODI)\n\n      The Modified ODI is a self-administered questionnaire that requires 5 minutes to complete\n      and 1 minute to score. Scores are associated with degree of disability ranging from minimal\n      to bedbound. The ODI is a condition-specific disability scale for patients with LBP,\n      consisting of 10 items addressing different aspects of function, each scored from 0-5 with\n      higher values representing greater disability. This modified ODI has been found to have high\n      levels of reliability, validity, and responsiveness. The MCID for the ODI has been\n      identified at six points .On this scale, 0-20 equates to minimal disability, 20-40 moderate\n      disability, 40-60 severe disability, 60-80 crippled, and 80-100 bed-bound or exaggerating.\n\n      Physical Endurance Tests/Measures\n      \n      McGill has established a performance test to examine the endurance profiles of healthy young\n      men and women for the spine stabilizing musculature. Given the growing support for\n      quantification of endurance, these data of endurance times and their ratios between\n      extensor, flexor, and lateral flexor groups in healthy normal subjects are useful for\n      patient evaluation and for providing clinical training targets. To establish isometric\n      endurance holding times, as well as ratios between torso extensors, flexors, and lateral\n      flexors (stabilizers), for clinical assessment and rehabilitation targets. The tests proved\n      reliable, with reliability coefficients of >.97 for the repeated tests on 5 consecutive days\n      and again 8 weeks later."
