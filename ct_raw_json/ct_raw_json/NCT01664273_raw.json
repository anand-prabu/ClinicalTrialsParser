It is an efficient non-viral method for gene delivery to various tissues. In this\n      phase I dose-escalating study, patients will be treated with intramuscular gene\n      electrotransfer of plasmid AMEP. Plasmid AMEP encodes protein AMEP which bind to \u03b15\u03b21 og\n      \u03b1v\u03b23 integrins. Primary end point of the trial is safety and secondary end points are\n      efficacy, pharmacokinetics and evaluation of potential discomfort associated with the\n      treatment procedure using VAS (Visual Analogue Scale)."

Up to 12\n      patients will be treated.\n\n      Treatment procedure: Local anesthetic is applied to m. quadriceps femoris (thigh muscle) and\n      the skin. An incision of the skin is performed followed by dissection until the muscle is\n      exposed. The surgical procedure is performed by plastic surgeons.\n\n      Plasmid AMEP is injected intramuscularly and immediately followed by application of electric\n      pulses via a needle electrode inserted into the muscle. A combination of one high voltage\n      pulse (700V/cm, 100 \u00b5s) followed by one low voltage pulse (80 V/cm, 400 ms) will be applied.\n      The wound is sutured and a dressing is applied. Treatment procedure is estimated to 30\n      minutes.\n\n      All patients are hospitalized for 24 hours after treatment for the purpose of evaluation of\n      vital signs, physical examination, AE and SAE recording and pharmacokinetics sampling (blood\n      and urine).\n\n      Blood biochemistry including LDH and CK is taken 24 hours post treatment. ECG will be taken\n      before and after treatment. Patients score discomfort or pain from treated area using VAS."
