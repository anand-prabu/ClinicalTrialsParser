  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Africa, Europe and  Oceania. The aim of this trial is to
      investigate whether insulin detemir combined with insulin aspart compared to NPH insulin
      combined with insulin aspart could reduce the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes whilst
      maintaining the same degree of glycaemic control subjects with type 1 diabetes.
