The subsequent Dose\n      Confirmation Phase will be a cohort expansion at or below the MTD of Nerofe.  Subjects will\n      be treated with IV doses of Nerofe thrice weekly (on alternating days) in consecutive,\n      28-day cycles.  Subjects will be evaluated regularly for safety.  Subjects who tolerate the\n      drug and who do not experience progressive disease, intolerable toxicity, or meet any of the\n      other withdrawal criteria may continue to receive Nerofe for up to 6 cycles, at the\n      discretion of the Principal Investigator.  Throughout the trial, oversight will be provided\n      by the Clinical Safety Committee."
