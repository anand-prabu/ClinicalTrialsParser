  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The febrile hypothesis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) stems from the observation that
      clinical symptoms improve during fever. This fever induced amelioration of symptoms could be
      due to one of three possible causes, (1) the direct effect of temperature; (2) a resulting
      change in the immune inflammatory system function associated with the infection or fever;
      and/or (3) and increase in the functionality of a previously dysfunctional Locus
      Coeruleus-Noradrenerigic  (LC-NA) system.  Little has been done to explore the potential
      direct effect an increased body temperature may have on autism symptomology.  Parental
      reports have demonstrated that during febrile episodes children with ASD have improved
      social cognition and language skills, and decreased disruptive behaviors.  In order to
      further explore the direct temperature effect, further investigation is needed, which the
      investigators propose below. The investigators propose to complete a one year double blind
      crossover study with 15 children with ASD between the ages of 5 and 17 years old.  Five
      children with ASD will complete a control protocol prior to beginning the full protocol with
      10 additional ASD children.   This will allow for any needed amendment of protocol
      parameters prior to completion of the full protocol.
