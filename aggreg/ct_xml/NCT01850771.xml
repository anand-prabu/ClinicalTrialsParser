  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the improvement in subject-reported
      clinical outcomes for Regenexx PL-Disc vs. steroid epidural for treatment of lumbar
      radiculopathy, from baseline to 3 months, with continued evaluation of efficacy and
      durability up to 12 months.

      Secondary objectives include incidence of post-operative complications, adverse events,
      re-injections, and surgical intervention; change in pain score and use of pain medications.

      Prospective, single-blinded, randomized, controlled to include 25 subjects treated with
      Regenexx PL-Disc and 25 subjects treated with steroid epidural injection with the steroid
      epidural group crossing over to the PL-Disc injection group at 3 months.

      Subjects will have symptoms consistent with lumbar radiculopathy confirmed by physical
      examination.

      Subjects will be enrolled within 60 days prior to injection and take part in follow-up
      visits for one year following treatment.  A preoperative visit will occur at the time of
      enrollment; follow-up visits will occur at the clinical site at 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months
      and 12 months post injection. Subjects will remain blinded to the treatment allocation
      through at least the 3 month primary endpoint. Control subjects not improving after the 3
      month visit will be unblinded and given the opportunity to cross-over to the PL-Disc group.

      Subjects will complete the study following the 1 year follow-up visit.
