  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous results from the investigators' Center have shown that combination treatment with
      Chantix and Zyban is more successful in helping men quit smoking. The investigators hope to
      replicate these findings with this study.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary dependent measures will be continuous four-week abstinence from weeks 8-11 post target Quit Day.  This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide (CO) &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 8 and Week 11). An intent-to-treat criterion will be used, whereby drop-outs are considered to be non-abstinent.</description>

    <description>This will be determined by a composite of self-report of no smoking on daily diaries and expired air carbon monoxide &lt;10 ppm (measured at Week 1, Week 3, Week 8 and Week 11 post target quit date).

    <description>For the first 3 days after being switched from Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT, occurring at one week after initiation of nicotine patch treatment, one week before the target Quit Day), smokers in this group will receive treatment with Chantix at a dose of 0.5 mg once per day followed by 0.5 mg twice a day for the remaining 4 days of that week.  Subsequently, the dose will be 1 mg twice per day, and will remain at that dose for the remainder of the 12-week active treatment duration.</description>
