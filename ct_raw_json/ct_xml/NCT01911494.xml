  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is being undertaken to test the hypothesis that implementing a community based
      package of care for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will result in overall
      improvement in maternal and neonatal outcomes. This is based on the premise that there are
      three main modifiable reasons why women (and their fetuses/newborns) die due to pregnancy
      complications: 1) delays by the woman herself in recognizing the seriousness of her
      condition; 2) delays in her being assessed and then transported to a center capable of
      providing effective and life-saving interventions; and 3) delays in the health facility in
      providing those interventions. The treatments for pre-eclampsia that are poorly accessed in
      LMIC are 1) magnesium sulfate (MgSO4) for prevention and treatment of the grand mal seizures
      of eclampsia; 2) oral antihypertensive medication to lower maternal BP to reduce the risk of
      stroke.

      The CLIP pilot and definitive cRCT will investigate whether the community level intervention
      including implementation of the CLIP package (oral antihypertensive therapy when indicated,
      intramuscular (i.m.) MgSO4 when indicated; and appropriate referral to an CEmOC facility
      when indicated) of care will reduce the incidence of all-cause maternal morbidity and
      mortality.

    <description>The CLIP intervention consists of (i) community engagement including community leaders, the women of the communities themselves, and their mothers, husbands, and mothers-in-law, regarding pre-eclampsia, its origins, symptoms, signs, and potential consequences, pre-permissions for maternal transport, and fundraising activities around transport and treatment costs; (ii) provision of HDP oriented antenatal care through CLIP visits and use of CLIP &quot;PIERS on the Move&quot; mHealth tool (for risk stratification), and (iii) use of the CLIP package for women with a CLIP 'trigger' (i.e., oral antihypertensive therapy (methyldopa) when indicated, intramuscular (i.m.) magnesium sulfate when indicated; and appropriate referral to an CEmOC facility when indicated)</description>

    <description>This mHealth application is to be used by community health workers in intervention  clusters to guide collection of relevant clinical data during antenatal visits. This clinical data is used to generate a risk estimate for any women with hypertension based on the miniPIERS (Pre-eclampsia Integrated Estimate of Risk) clinical risk prediction model. This risk estimate in combination with other pre-defined treatment triggers (severe hypertension (&gt;160mmHg systolic) or proteinuria (&gt;3+ dipstick); absence of fetal movements for greater than 12 hours; signs of recent stroke of seizure) are collected in the app and based on this data recommendations for care of the woman are provided.</description>
