It is the most\n      common injury that causes physical handicapped in childhood. There are a few researches that\n      investigated the autonomic function in cerebral palsy children. Those researches found\n      hyperactivity of the sympathetic autonomic system, including high resting heart rate compare\n      to their typically developed pears. The recommended treatment for cerebral palsy is\n      activity, muscle strengthening and mobility. The impairment in the autonomic system\n      influences the everyday function and has correlation with secondary morbidity.\n\n      As far as we know there are no researches who investigated the following issues.\n\n      In this study we would like to:\n\n        1. Describe the autonomic cardiac function, Breathing function, motor function and the\n           correlation between them in children with cerebral palsy.\n\n        2. Compare the autonomic cardiac function at rest in aerobic test and in diaphragmatic\n           breathing.\n\n        3. Test the influence of breathing training on Heart rate variability parameters at rest,\n           in aerobic test right after the breathing training program and one month after, in\n           children with cerebral palsy"
