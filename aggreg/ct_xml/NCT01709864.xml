  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study serves to determine whether the treatment of patients with stable, symptomatic
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) with  the investigational drug NVA237 is
      efficient and safe. The efficacy and safety of the drug will be tested against a placebo
      treatment.

      The primary criterion to assess efficacy will be the difference between the serial lung
      function measurements of patients who have been treated for 12 weeks with NVA237 versus
      those that have received placebo treatment for 12 weeks. A serial lung function measurement
      (FEV1 testing) will be conducted and the &quot;area under the curve&quot; will be the measure for the
      ability to breathe.
