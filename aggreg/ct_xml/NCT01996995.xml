    <textblock>
      Rationale: Onychomycosis is an important problem for patients with diabetes. Nails with
      fungal infection become thick and distorted with resulting pressure increase and the
      potential for serious complications like diabetic foot ulcers. As part of the diabetic foot
      care program, nails of patients at risk for developing ulcers and suspected onychomycosis
      are frequently skived. There is no effective local therapy that cures infection; systemic
      antifungal medication are often withheld due to concerns for interactions with other drugs
      and side effects.

      Aim: To determine the efficacy of Nd:YAG laser therapy to treat onychomycosis in diabetes
      patients with risk factors for developing diabetic foot complications.

      Setting: A randomized, double blind, controlled trial. Study population: Patients with
      diabetes mellitus, with an increased risk for diabetic ulcers.

      Intervention: local laser treatment from a podiatrist and the other group receives treatment
      according to a control procedure. The later procedure will be performed as a sham procedure
      by a second podiatrist.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: The effect of 4 sessions of laser therapy on cure rate
      (clinical and microbiological) after one year.

      Setting of the study: Hospital, outpatient departments (Foot clinic, Isala, Zwolle)

      Inclusion criteria: Patients are required to meet the following criteria; known diabetes,
      over 18 years old, clinically suspicion and microbiologic confirmation of onychomycosis, at
      risk for diabetic foot ulcers defined by a simm's score of 1 or higher.

      Exclusion criteria: Patients without microbiologic confirmation of fungal nail infection,
      patients with diabetic foot ulcers, patients who used systemic or topical antifungal agents
      during the preceding 3 months and patients with insufficient knowledge of the Dutch language
      to understand the requirements of the study will be excluded.  Patients who use
      immunosuppressive medication will also be excluded. Patients suffering from psoriasis with
      nail involvement, lichen planus, or other abnormalities that could result in clinically
      abnormal toenails will be excluded.
