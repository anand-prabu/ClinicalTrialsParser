  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Influenza morbidity and mortality cause a substantial financial burden to the NHS and to the
      UK as a whole.  Influenza vaccine is safe and effective but is required annually because the
      circulating strain of virus changes each year. In the UK in 2012, the Chief Medical Officer
      (CMO) recommended that at least 75% of elderly people (aged 65+) and 75% people under 65
      with certain chronic conditions (e.g. chronic heart disease, diabetes, asthma, etc) should
      be vaccinated. While primary care practices are achieving these targets for elderly
      patients, those set for younger patients with chronic conditions are not being met, with a
      third of patients being missed in the 2011/12 flu season and with no substantial
      improvements in uptake in the past decade.  Therefore strategies to increase flu vaccine
      uptake in these patients are required.

      Previous trials have shown that patient reminders can increase vaccine uptake and in
      particular, text messaging has shown to work in some populations in the United States as a
      cheap, simple and effective reminder.  However, whether the same is true in UK general
      practice is unclear.  The use of text messaging in the NHS for appointment reminders is also
      increasing as it is cheap, quick and effective.  Text messaging is already used in roughly
      30% of practices to remind patients about their flu vaccine but there has been no trial
      addressing its effectiveness.  Therefore, we propose a trial of a text messaging flu vaccine
      reminder in patients aged under 65 who have a chronic condition.  We hypothesise that
      practices that send a text message will have increased flu vaccine uptake.
