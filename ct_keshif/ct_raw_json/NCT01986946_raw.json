The primary\n           objective is to determine the effect of epidural analgesia, as compared with standard\n           care, on post-operative analgesia.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing Lumbar Spinal Fusion surgery with\n      epidural catheter placement will have superior post-operative analgesia compared to patients\n      undergoing standard care."
