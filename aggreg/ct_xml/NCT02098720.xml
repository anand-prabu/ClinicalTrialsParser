        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients give fully informed consent and are willing and able to comply with all
             study procedures.

          2. In the study eye:

             There are primary or recurrent subfoveal or parafoveal active choroidal
             neovascularization (CNV) lesions secondary to wAMD. The criterion of active CNVshould
             meet at least one of following three conditions :

             fresh bleeding;

             neurosensory detachment showed on optical coherence tomography (OCT);

             leakage showed on fundus fluoresecine angiography (FFA).

          3. BCVA in study eye &lt; 19 letters (approximately 20/400 Snellen equivalent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Past or existing non-exudative AMD in study eye decided by investigator that have
             affected macular detection or central vision;

          2. Subretinal hemorrhage in study eye and bleeding area ≥6 disc areas;

          3. History of vitreous hemorrhage within last month;

          4. The maximum diameter of scar and fibrosis area ≥500μm at subfoveal in study eye;

          5. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) or drug treatment of CNV within last 6 months in study
             eye, or anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy in fellow eye within
             last month;

          6. History of glaucoma in study eye;

          7. Aphakia (excluding artificial lens) in the study eye.
