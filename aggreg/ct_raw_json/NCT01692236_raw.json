            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection appears to cause problems with blood vessel\n      function. These problems may add to some thinking and mood disorders found in people with\n      HIV infection. Researchers want to evaluate HIV infected patients to see if blood vessel\n      function contributes to thinking and mood disorders, such as early dementia and depression.\n      To do so, they will compare study results between people with and people without HIV\n      infection.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To compare the thickness of blood vessel walls between people with and without HIV\n           infection.\n\n        -  To study the relationship between blood vessel thickness and thinking and mood\n           disorders.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Individuals between 25 and 55 years of age who have HIV infection.\n\n        -  Healthy individuals between 25 and 55 years of age.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected.\n\n        -  Participants will have imaging studies of the brain and major blood vessels in the head\n           and neck.\n\n        -  Participants will also have neuropsychological testing. These tests will look at\n           memory, learning and thinking ability, attention, and mood.\n\n        -  Participants will have the option of coming back for repeat  blood tests every six\n           months and repeat imaging studies and neuropsychological tests   every year, over 1- 4\n           years period."

            "textblock": "HIV/AIDS has been transformed from an inevitably fatal, progressive infection to a\n      manageable chronic condition. Yet, HIV associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) and major\n      depressive disorder (MDD) continue to pose a significant clinical problem, even among\n      patients with well-controlled viremia. There is also growing evidence of accelerated\n      vascular aging and other types of vascular abnormalities in HIV-infected (HIV+) people, and\n      preliminary evidence suggests their association with unfavorable neurocognitive outcomes.\n      Thus, one possible contributing factor to the high rates of HANDs and depression could be\n      vascular dysfunction, similar to vascular depression and vascular dementia that occur in\n      elderly non-HIV+ individuals. One commonly used diagnostic marker of vasculopathy is\n      thickening of the vessel wall. Multiple studies have already established the correlation\n      between vessel wall thickening and vascular disease manifestations. This prospective\n      observational study aims to examine the relationships between neurocognitive and depression\n      outcomes and vessel wall thickness as a marker of vascular disease in HIV+ adults. We will\n      be using neuropsychological testing, brain imaging, blood biomarkers, and state-of-the-art\n      high-resolution MR imaging of the intra- and extracranial vessel walls. Forty HIV+\n      participants and 40 HIV-negative controls will be recruited. HIV+ participants who consent\n      to longitudinal follow-up will be followed for a total of 4 years starting from the initial\n      presentation, with evaluations every 6 months. HIV-negative participants will be followed\n      for 1 additional year to provide comparison data. Cross-sectional data analysis will examine\n      the vascular and neurocognitive markers in both groups of participants. The longitudinal\n      data analysis will assess the temporal progression of vascular disease (blood and imaging\n      findings) in relation to changes in neurocognitive and depression scores in both groups."
