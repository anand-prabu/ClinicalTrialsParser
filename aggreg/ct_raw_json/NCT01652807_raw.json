Specifically, yoga has been\n      associated with significant decreases in depression, anxiety, and perceived stress. These\n      findings underscore the promise of yoga practice for improving mental health in women prone\n      to stress.\n\n      This study aims to examine the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of an eight-week\n      Hatha Yoga intervention for improving stress and mental health. To this end, the\n      investigators will recruit 40 women high in stress to receive an 8-week hatha yoga\n      intervention consisting of two weekly 90-minute sessions. At baseline and at\n      post-intervention, participants will undergo several cognitive, emotional, and behavioral\n      assessments, followed by a relaxation time. Primary feasibility outcomes will be the time\n      required to recruit 40 participants, the number of screen failures, participant retention\n      and participant adherence to the study protocol. Acceptability will be evaluated with\n      questionnaires and an interview during the final visit. Primary efficacy outcomes will be\n      group differences in pre- to post-intervention change in perceived stress and various mental\n      health parameters."
