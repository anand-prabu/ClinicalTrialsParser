  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic blood disorder characterized by the presence of
      sickle-shaped red blood cells. In the U.S. and the U.K. this occurs primarily in persons of
      African origin. There is only one drug (hydroxyurea) approved to manage SCD, but it is not
      fully efficacious and can produce medically significant side effects. Aes-103 is being
      evaluated as a novel agent for the long term management of SCD. By directly reducing the
      sickling process, Aes-103 has a different mechanism of action than hydoxyurea. The active
      ingredient in Aes-103 is 5-hydroxymethyl furfural, a naturally occurring small molecule that
      is chemically related to glucose.

      This study will evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of two dosing regimens of
      Aes-103 for up to 28 days in up to 50 adult subjects with stable SCD compared with subjects
      receiving placebo.

      This study will evaluate evaluate in subjects with stable SCD the safety, pharmacokinetic
      profile, clinical pharmacology actions and clinical activities of two dosing regimens of
      Aes-103 (1000 mg four times daily in Cohort A and a higher or lower dose given once daily or
      up to four times daily in Cohort B) given for up to 28 days in adult subjects with stable
      SCD compared with subjects receiving placebo.
