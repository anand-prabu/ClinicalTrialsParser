  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish the safety and tolerability of Unbiased Biomarkers
      for the Prediction of Respiratory Disease Outcomes (U-BIOPRED) human rhinovirus 16 (RV16UB)
      in healthy and asthmatic participants, and to identify an appropriate dosage of RV16UB in
      order to study biomarkers in asthmatic participants. The study is divided into 2 parts. Part
      1 is a dose-finding study where healthy participants, and asthmatic participants, either
      concomitantly treated or not treated with a class of long-acting beta antagonists (LABA),
      undergo nasal challenge with increasing doses of RV16UB. Part 2 is a biomarker study where
      mild to moderate asthmatics undergo challenge with the most appropriate dose of RV16UB
      identified in Part 1, based on tolerability and viral effects.
