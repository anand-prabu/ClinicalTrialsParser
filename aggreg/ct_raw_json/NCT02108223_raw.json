Aim\n\n           -We aimed to evaluate patients who had In-vitro fertilization treatment and who had COH\n           (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation) cycles applying long protocol with GnRH\n           (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) analogue with suboptimal response to the rFSH.  We\n           evaluated and compared the addition of rLH, increasing the dose of rFSH and the control\n           groups regarding the results of IVF in these patients.\n\n        2. Material and Methods -Between 01.01.2009-30.04.2011, 137 patients presented with\n           infertility to the unit of Assisted Reproduction Techniques- of the Department of\n           Obstetrics and Gynecology- Meram Medical Faculty-  Selcuk University and were planned\n           for ICSI-ET (intracytoplasmic sperm injection-embryo transfer) with normal ovarian\n           function, who had  long protocol of GnRH analogue and COH (controlled ovarian\n           hyperstimulation) with rFSH  were included in the study. 52 patients were considered\n           responsive to stimulation and composed the normal control group (Group 1). On the 7th\n           day of stimulation transvaginal ultrasonography was carried out. Patients who had at\n           least 6 follicles about 6-10mm but had no follicle above 10mm and E2 (Oestradiol) level\n           of <250 pg / ml were considered to have suboptimal response to stimulation and were\n           divided into two groups. For Group 2 (n = 50), 75IU / L  rLH was added to the\n           treatment, for Group 3 (n = 35), 75IU / L of  rFSH was added to the treatment. IVF\n           results were compared between the groups."
