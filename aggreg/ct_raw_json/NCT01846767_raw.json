Diabetic patients will be recruited from\n      University College Hospital, Galway in collaboration with their hospital consultant.\n\n      Test- day\n\n      - They will undergo two separate, identical and simultaneous Oral Glucose Tolerance test and\n      13C-glucose breath tests on two separate occasions after an overnight fast of 12 hours\n      starting at 8pm. On arrival their heart rate, blood pressure, height and weight will be\n      recorded. Following a resting period of 10 minutes, samples will be obtained for fasting\n      glucose and breath enrichment values (at t = -20 and -10mins). At t = 0 min, participants\n      will consume a standard glucose solution. This glucose solution will consist of 150mg of\n      13C-glucose, 74.85g of glucose and 200ml of water and 25ml of orange flavoring.  Breath\n      samples will be obtained immediately after consumption of test solution and repeated every\n      15 min over a 4-h interval. Blood glucose concentrations will be taken every 15 min starting\n      at t = 15 min, over a 2-h interval and every 30 min for another 2-h interval. Participants\n      will remain at rest throughout the study.\n\n      Sample size assessment\n\n      - Target recruitment is 40 non-diabetics and 40 diabetic participants. This study will use a\n      Student's t-test to determine difference, or otherwise, in glucose oxidation in breath\n      13CO2, in 2 different groups of individuals. With power arbitrarily set at 0.8, effect  size\n      of 1.21 reduction in breath, and Alpha set at 0.01 a final number of 35 participants is\n      required for each group. The n=40 for each group is set to allow a 5 participant drop out in\n      each group Dillon et al (2009)."
