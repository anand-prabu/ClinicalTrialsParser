      Primary objective:

      The primary objective is to demonstrate the superiority of Monoprost® versus Lumigan® 0.01%
      and Lumigan® 0.03% Unit Dose in term of safety with respect to the assessment of
      conjunctival hyperaemia in the worse eye at Day 84.

      The conjunctival hyperaemia will be scored using the MacMonnies photographic scale (0 to 5).

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary endpoint is the change from baseline of conjunctival hyperaemia assessed on MacMonnies' 6 point ordinal scale, in the worse eye at the D84 visit.  The primary statistical hypothesis tested is that Monoprost® is superior to Lumigan® 0.03% Unit Dose with regard to this primary endpoint, i.e. that in the worse eye the decrease from baseline in the MacMonnies 6 point ordinal scale is greater in the Monoprost® treated group than in the Lumigan® 0.03% Unit Dose group at the Day 84 visit.</description>

    <description>The major secondary endpoint is response to treatment defined as a mean Intra Ocular Pressure ≤ 18 mm Hg and a decrease in MacMonnies scale from baseline of at least 1 point in the worse eye at the D84 visit.</description>

               1. Both eyes have primary open angle glaucoma or ocular hypertension already
                  treated and controlled by mono-therapy of Lumigan® 0.01% since at least 3 months
                  (according to European Glaucoma Society guidelines).

               2. Intra Ocular Pressure ≤ 18 mm Hg in both eyes.

               3. With local intolerance signs in at least one eye defined by the association of:

        3.1 Hyperaemia = Grade (2) or (3) or (4) following the photographic MacMonnies scale.

        And 3.2.1 Presence of at least 2 symptoms with a level of severity ≥ 1 (= mild or moderate
        or severe) among the following 5 symptoms: irritation/burning, itching, tearing, eye
        dryness sensation, foreign body sensation.

        And/Or 3.2.2 Presence of at least 2 signs with a level of severity ≥ 1 (= mild or moderate

             visual field examination.

        Systemic/non ophthalmic/ exclusion criteria
