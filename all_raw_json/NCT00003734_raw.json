Hormone therapy\n      using triptorelin and flutamide may fight cancer by reducing the production of androgens. It\n      is not yet known whether giving hormone therapy for 4 months is more effective than giving\n      therapy for 8 months prior to radiation therapy for prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of combination hormone\n      therapy for 4 or 8 months followed by radiation therapy in treating patients with prostate\n      cancer."

Compare the efficacy of 4 months vs 8 months of luteinizing hormone-releasing\n      hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy combined with antiandrogen therapy prior to radiotherapy, in\n      terms of disease-free survival and overall survival, in patients with stage I-IV localized\n      invasive prostate cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n      All patients receive triptorelin IM once a month and oral flutamide three times daily with\n      meals. Patients randomized to arm I receive this therapy regimen for 4 months. Patients\n      randomized to arm II receive this therapy regimen for 8 months. All patients then undergo\n      radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks within 2 months of the last injection of triptorelin\n      and within 1 month of the last oral flutamide tablet. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      after radiotherapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 276 patients (138 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
