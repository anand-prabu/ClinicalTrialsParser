            "textblock": "The feasibility and effectiveness of ERAS program for various major surgical procedures have\n      been well studies in the literature. However, ERAS program has not been widely accepted for\n      patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery because of the paucity of evidence about its\n      feasibility and efficacy. In this study, we developed ERAS program for gastric cancer\n      surgery, based on the systemic review about perioperative cares. The main elements of ERAS\n      program includes: 1preoperative patient education, 2)no preoperative bowel preparation, 3)\n      provision of normal diet until the night before surgery, 4)carbohydrate rich drink 2 hrs\n      before surgery, 5)epidural anesthesia for pain control, 6) local wound anesthetic\n      infiltration for pain control, 7)no routine abdominal drain, 8)no naso-gastric tube\n      insertion, 9)intraoperative antibiotics, 10)thromboprophylaxis using intermittent pneumatic\n      compression device, 11)intraoperative normothermia using warm air blanket, 12)low oxygen\n      supply during immediate postoperative period, 13)restrictive postoperative fluid\n      administration, 14)early postoperative oral diet, 15)early active ambulation, 16)early\n      removal of the urinary catheter, 17)patient education before discharge, and 18)hospital\n      discharge based on discharge criteria.\n\n      The aim of study is to evaluate the compliance to these main elements of ERAS program in\n      patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery.\n\n      Previously reported data about ERAS program for colon surgery reported overall compliance as\n      about 65%. Considering that this is a single center study, we expected overall compliance\n      rate of 70%. Therefore, the sample size of 173 patients was calculated based on this\n      expected compliance rate, with permitted error of 95% confidence interval of 14%."
