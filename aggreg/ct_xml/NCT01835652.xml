  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease is caused by a reduction of dopamine causing motor deficits. The
      investigators are studying how exercise can help PD patients by increasing dopamine release
      in an area of the brain that coordinates movement, the striatum. The investigators will
      enroll PD patients into two groups; one group will complete a 12-week aerobic exercise
      program and the other will complete a 12-week control program including yoga and stretching
      only. The investigators will measure changes in dopamine release before and after either
      12-week intervention. Subjects will complete motor and cognitive questionnaires in addition
      to functional magnetic resonance imaging and positron emission tomography neuroimaging.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the basis for symptomatic and disease modifying
      benefits of exercise in Parkinson's disease (PD).

      Although the benefits of exercise in PD have been purported for several decades, only
      recently have there been controlled reports of symptomatic benefits in Parkinson's disease
      in terms of bradykinesia, postural balance and quality of life. There have been
      unsubstantiated suggestions that exercise may improve cognition and mood in PD.

      The mechanisms underlying such benefits are poorly understood. Exercise may induce dopamine
      release, thereby contributing to improved motor function in the dorsal striatum, and to
      enhanced mood and reduced apathy in the ventral striatum.

      We will test the hypotheses that exercise results in altered synaptic plasticity in the form
      of altered connectivity in response to aerobic exercise and reward-induced dopamine release.
      We will assess networks of functional connectivity using functional magnetic resonance
      imaging and measure dopamine release with positron emission tomography (PET).
