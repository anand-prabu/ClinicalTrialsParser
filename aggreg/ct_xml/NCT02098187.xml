    <textblock>
      The purpose of this early feasibility study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of
      MP-3180 administered in rising doses and to evaluate the use of the Optical Renal Function
      Monitor (ORFM), an investigational noninvasive fluorescence detection device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, rising single-dose study to investigate the pharmacokinetics of the
      investigational agent, MP-3180, and to evaluate the use of the Optical Renal Function
      Monitor (ORFM), an investigational noninvasive fluorescence detection device. Single-dose
      pharmacokinetics at four dose levels will be evaluated following the administration of a
      single, intravenous dose of MP-3180. Iohexol will also be administered followed by saline.
      Prior to administration of MP-3180 and Iohexol, the ORFM sensor probes will be affixed to
      four locations on the body of each subject.  The noninvasive fluorescent signal from MP-3180
      will be measured using the ORFM investigational device continuously for approximately four
      (4) hours post MP-3180 administration. For the determination of the pharmacokinetic
      disposition of the MP-3180 and iohexol, there will be blood samples collected from each
      subject provided the individual completes all blood collections in the study. The
      pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 and iohexol will be assessed by statistical comparison of
      pharmacokinetic parameters derived from plasma concentration-time curves and urine recovery
      data.

    <description>Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for MP-3180 and iohexol will be calculated using compartmental and non-compartmental techniques. The maximum concentration and the time at which it occurred relative to the administered dose will be determined from the observed plasma concentration-time profile over the sampling time interval. The elimination rate constant will be determined by linear regression of the terminal linear phase of the log plasma concentration-time profile. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve is the sum of the linear trapezoidal estimation of the areas from the time of dosing to the time of the last quantifiable concentration. Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from zero to infinity will be calculated. The elimination half-life (HALFLIFE) will be calculated. Total plasma clearance (CLp) will be calculated. Pharmacokinetics of MP-3180 from noninvasive fluorescent measurement will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The assessment of safety will be based primarily on the frequency of adverse events and on the number of laboratory values that fall outside of pre-specified normal ranges. The clinical significance of any abnormal findings will be determined by the principal investigator and medical sub-investigator. All safety data including Adverse Events (AEs), vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and physical examinations will be listed by subject.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Observed plasma and urine concentrations will be summarized descriptively by time point and agent (MP-3180 or Iohexol) for all subjects included in the pharmacokinetic analysis.  In addition, plots of mean concentrations over time will be provided by agent, including standard error bars around the mean values. A correlation between the fluorescence intensity and tracer concentration at each time point will be done to calculate GFR from standard pharmacokinetic methods. The fluorescence intensity at the time of the blood sampling will be compared to plasma concentrations measured using the laboratory analytical techniques.</description>
