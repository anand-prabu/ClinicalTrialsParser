ECHORN will expand clinical research with racial/ethnic minority populations in\n      a transitioning part of the globe now threatened with an epidemic of noncommunicable chronic\n      diseases (NCD). ECHORN's findings will have direct implications for the health disparities\n      research and policy agenda in the mainland United States. In the long term, the links ECHORN\n      will facilitate with local health policy delegations and global strategic organizational\n      partners will promote the translation of research to improve health outcomes across the\n      region. The collection and storage of biological specimens will also contribute to national\n      biomonitoring projects and has the potential to identify unique risk and protective factors\n      in the development of NCD."
