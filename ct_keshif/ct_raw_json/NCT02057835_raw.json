Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60\n             days prior to administration of trial medication\n\n         13.

Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance,\n             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has\n             a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study."
