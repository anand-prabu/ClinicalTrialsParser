Describe the toxic\n      effects of daily oral etoposide in these patients. III. Monitor etoposide trough levels and\n      determine whether etoposide concentrations correlate with age, response, and toxicity.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral etoposide daily for 21 days. Treatment is repeated every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients in complete or\n      partial remission receive 2 courses past best response (minimum 6 courses). Patients with\n      stable disease after 3 courses may be removed from study. Patients are followed every 6\n      months for 2 years, then annually for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 97 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
