A way to treat\n      these diseases is coronary artery bypass grafting, one of the most common surgical\n      procedures in the world. The incidence of post-operative complications contributes to\n      functional decline of the patient, reduced quality of life and post-discharge mortality.\n      Also, cardiac surgery leads to changes in lung capacity and respiratory muscle strength,\n      causing a decrease in the function lung. Physical therapy proves to be an effective tool to\n      combat changes resulting from cardiac surgery, demonstrating beneficial results in the\n      pulmonary function, functional capacity, and peripheral and respiratory muscle strength. The\n      Pilates method has been studied as a therapeutic way to healthy subjects and various kinds\n      of diseases, but there are no studies in the literature evaluating the effect method in\n      patients after coronary artery bypass surgery.\n\n      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of Pilates on functional capacity , flows\n      and lung volumes, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength after coronary artery bypass\n      grafting.\n\n      Randomized clinical trial in which patients will be eligible after elective coronary artery\n      bypass surgery, randomly allocated into two groups : conventional physiotherapy group (n =\n      15) and Pilates method associated with conventional physiotherapy group (n = 15). The\n      outcomes will be assessed by blinded evaluator and data randomization will be performed\n      through by electronic randomization.The interventions will take place during the length of\n      stay in the hospital, totalizing a maximum of six days of intervention.\n\n      It is expected that the application of the Pilates method exercise method associated with\n      conventional physiotherapy in patients in postoperative coronary artery bypass grafting\n      improves functional capacity, flows and lung volumes and respiratory and peripheral muscle\n      strength."
