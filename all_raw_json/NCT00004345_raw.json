Examine the concentration of docosahexanoic acid (DHA) and other n-3 fatty\n      acids in plasma, erythrocyte, and adipose tissue in patients with various forms of retinitis\n      pigmentosa and Usher syndrome.\n\n      II.  Determine the synthesis and catabolism of DHA from linolenic acid in these patients.\n\n      III.  Determine the synthesis, absorption, and catabolism of DHA under different dietary\n      conditions in these patients."

Subjects must avoid eating fish and shellfish during the 35 days\n      of the isotope study.  Blood samples are collected at 0, 8, 24, and 48 hours, daily on days\n      3-7, and then on days 10, 18, and 35.\n\n      Arm III (flaxseed oil feeding):  Patients with all types of RP and control subjects receive\n      flaxseed oil, a form of linolenic acid, for 12 weeks. Subjects may also receive high oleic\n      safflower oil or olive oil as a control fat for 12 weeks.  Subjects complete a diet history\n      at the end of each fatty acid supplementation period.  All subjects must follow a diet free\n      of seafood and fish oil supplements."
