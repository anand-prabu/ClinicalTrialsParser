            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Vaccines made from a person's cancer cells may make the body\n      build an immune response to kill cancer cells. Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be\n      able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy\n      with vaccine therapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be effective in treating\n      multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by vaccine\n      therapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have newly\n      diagnosed multiple myeloma."

The vaccine is prepared in vitro by mixing\n      autologous tumor cells with a bystander cell expressing sargramostim (GM-CSF). Patients\n      receive induction chemotherapy followed by autologous tumor cell vaccination (ATCV) once.\n      Patients then undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. At 6 weeks\n      after transplantation, patients receive additional ATCVs every 3 weeks for a total of 8\n      vaccinations.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
