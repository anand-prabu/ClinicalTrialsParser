        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed GBM. XML File Identifier: 5eAlUsBvalzS0g2DCxqYmADXDBA= Page
             14/26

          -  GBM in recurrence/progression after surgery, standard radiotherapy and chemotherapy
             with Temozolomide.

          -  Imaging confirmation of first tumor progression or regrowth as defined by the RANO
             criteria.

          -  No more than one prior line of chemotherapy (Temozolomide).

          -  Recovery from the toxic effects of prior therapy.

          -  Patients who have undergone recent surgery for recurrent or progressive tumor are
             eligible provided that:

               1. Surgery must have confirmed the recurrence.

               2. A minimum of 14 days must have elapsed from the day of surgery to randomization.
                  For core or needle biopsy, a minimum of 7 days must have elapsed prior to
                  randomization.

               3. Craniotomy or intracranial biopsy site must be adequately healed and free of
                  drainage or cellulitis, and the underlying cranioplasty must appear intact at
                  the time of randomization.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Willingness and ability to provide written informed consent and to comply with the
             study protocol as judged by the investigator.

          -  Karnofsky-PS ≥ 60%.

          -  Stable or decreasing dose of corticosteroids within 5 days prior to randomization.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients unable to undergo brain MRI scans with gadolinium (iv).

          -  Pre-existing peripheral neuropathy, grade ≥ 2.

          -  History of intracranial abscess within 6 months prior to randomization.

          -  Anticipation of need for major surgical procedure during the course of the trial.

          -  Treatment with enzyme inducing antiepileptic agents was not allowed. However,
             patients whose anticonvulsant was changed to a nonenzymeinducing antiepileptic drug
             were eligible for entry after a 1-week ''washout'' period
