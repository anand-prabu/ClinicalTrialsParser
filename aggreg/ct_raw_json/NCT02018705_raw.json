The standard surgical treatment for achalasia is laparoscopic Heller Myotomy\n      (LHM). A recent meta-analysis of 105 studies reporting on 7855 patients demonstrated that\n      laparoscopic Heller myotomy is the most effective and long-lasting therapy for achalasia.\n      Superior  to Endoscopic balloon dilatation or Botulinumtoxin injection LHM has a one year\n      therapeutic efficacy in approximately 90% of patients. Recently an endoscopic technique\n      emulating the principles of LHM was developed. This technique of a purely endoscopic myotomy\n      has been demonstrated by Pasricha et al. in animal experiments and Inoue et al. reported the\n      first clinical study. Other pilot studies and a larger international multi-center trial have\n      replicated promising results for POEM.\n\n      Uncontrolled studies show promising short and mid term results for POEM. At present, POEM is\n      considered a promising new technique with the potential to become a standard achalasia\n      treatment. For this to happen, however, comparative data with LHM is required. Our study\n      group intends to investigate the short and long-term efficacy of POEM for the treatment of\n      achalasia as it was performed in international centers and compare outcomes with database\n      assessment of LHM."
