            "textblock": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is an extremely variable and heterogeneous syndrome that can\n      be defined as an acute cardiopulmonary dysfunction requiring emergent artificial ventilation\n      support. For patients with ARF, the mortality rate is higher than the general ICU mortality,\n      with estimates ranging from 15-40% depending on the subgroups evaluated. In the largest,\n      most recent report on ARF, the in-ICU mortality was 31% and the overall in-hospital\n      mortality rate was 37%. Muscle weakness is an independent risk factor for mortality from ARF\n      and contributes to long-term reductions in physical function in survivors. Muscle\n      ultrasounds are non-invasive, quick and reproducible. They provide the opportunity of ICU\n      staff to create a patient-specific exercise prescription based on both functional\n      assessments and importantly the degree of muscle architecture abnormality detected by\n      ultrasound. Serial examination of muscle ultrasound images obtained in mechanically\n      ventilated acute respiratory failure patients will allow for better understanding of the\n      time course of specific muscles' architectural abnormalities and the resolution of such\n      abnormalities within hospital survivors. With this study, we will be better able to\n      understand the relationships between the pattern of resolution of the muscle architectural\n      abnormalities within the context of multiple other clinical abnormalities and therapies\n      present and rendered to ICU patients. Study participants will consist of 100 patients with\n      ARF admitted to the Intensive Care Units of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center.\n      Muscle ultrasounds will occur at study enrollment and weekly thereafter, and will also\n      include one imaging session as close to at hospital discharge as possible. Handgrip strength\n      and physical performance tests will also be administered at hospital discharge and at 2 and\n      4 weeks post hospital discharge. The primary outcome will be to investigate the possibility\n      of a relationship between the ultrasound data and functional measurements (length of stay,\n      grip strength, SPPB, simultaneously accounting for severity of illness [APACHE III])."
