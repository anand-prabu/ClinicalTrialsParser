  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this 10-week study are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability
      of AVP 786 as an adjunctive therapy compared with placebo in patients with major depressive
      disorder (MDD) who have shown an inadequate response to standard antidepressant treatment. A
      secondary objective of this study is to assess the pharmacokinetics (PK) of AVP-786 and
      potential correlations with pharmacodynamic effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that up to approximately 200 patients will participate in the study at
      approximately 30 enrolling centers in the US.

      Eligible patients for this study must have MDD as defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical
      Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV-TR) criteria, and have shown an inadequate response to
      standard antidepressant treatment.

      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study of 10 weeks
      duration.

      Following screening procedures for assessment of inclusion and exclusion criteria, eligible
      patients will be randomized into the study.  Study medication will be administered orally
      BID (1 capsule in the morning and 1 capsule in the evening, approximately 12 hours apart)
      throughout the treatment period.

             between Screening and Baseline visits.

          -  Patients have been deemed to have an inadequate response (less than 50% symptom
             reduction) to at least 1 but no more than 3 adequate antidepressant trials during the
             current depressive episode.

                  &gt; 470 msec for females based on central review at the screening visit, unless
                  due to ventricular pacing.

               -  Any family history of congenital QT interval prolongation syndrome.

          -  Known hypersensitivity/intolerance to DM, Q, opiate drugs (codeine, etc.), or any

               -  The subject is rated a &quot;yes&quot; to question 4 or question 5 on the Baseline C-SSRS,
