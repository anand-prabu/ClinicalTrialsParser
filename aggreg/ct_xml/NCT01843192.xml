      This study aims to collect real world outcomes of Video-Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery
      (VATS) for lung cancer (lobectomy, wedge resection) using ECHELON FLEX™ Powered ENDOPATH®
      Staplers 45 mm and/or 60 mm (study devices).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Suspected or confirmed NSCLC (up to and including  Stage II)

          -  Scheduled for lung resection surgery (lobectomy or wedge resection) involving only
             one lobe of the lung

          -  Performance status 0-1 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group classification)

          -  ASA score &lt; 3

          -  No prior history of VATS or open lung surgery

          -  Willing to give consent and comply with study-related evaluation and treatment
             schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active bacterial infection or fungal infection;

          -  Systemic administration (intravenous or oral) of steroids (within 30 days prior to
             study procedure)

          -  Chemotherapy or radiation therapy for lung cancer may not be performed for 30 days
             prior to the procedure

          -  Scheduled concurrent surgical procedure other than wedge resection or lobectomy
             (central venous access - e.g. port placement, mediastinoscopy with lymph node
             sampling, and VATS lymphadenectomy are allowed)

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Physical or psychological condition which would impair study participation;

          -  The patient is judged unsuitable for study participation by the Investigator for any
             other reason; or

          -  Unable or unwilling to attend follow-up visits and examinations
