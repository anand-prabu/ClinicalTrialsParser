            "textblock": "Cell-free hemoglobin can be measured in the plasma of patients with sickle cell anemia,\n      hemodialysis, after red blood cell transfusion, and in patients with sepsis.  Cell-free\n      hemoglobin in these patient population has been associated with poor outcomes, including an\n      association with an increased risk of death.  Acetaminophen may have a protective effect in\n      these patient populations by inhibiting hemoprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation.  The\n      purpose of the present trial is to study the effect of acetaminophen on lipid peroxidation\n      in adults with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that systemic markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation,\n      as measured by F2-isoprostanes, will be significantly lower in patients with severe sepsis\n      and detectable cell-free hemoglobin who receive acetaminophen compared to placebo. The\n      secondary hypothesis is that patients with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin\n      treated with acetaminophen will have better clinical outcomes, including decreased incidence\n      of acute kidney injury and lower rates of hospital mortality, compared to those who receive\n      placebo."
