    <textblock>
      In this part of the Registry Program patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF) at
      risk for stroke are enrolled to characterize the target population and to collect real world
      data on important outcome events. For administrative purposes the study is divided into
      three protocol numbers: 1160.129 for all non-EU (European Union) and non-EEA (European
      Economic Area) countries, 1160.136 for EU and EEA countries and 1160.171 for India and
      Switzerland. The total number of patients enrolled in three protocols is estimated to be
      48,000 patients, and all these patients will be included in the data analysis for study
      1160.129.
