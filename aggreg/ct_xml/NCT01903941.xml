      Background: Observational studies suggest that exercise has anti-inflammatory effect,
      however this idea has not been definitively confirmed by randomized clinical trials.

      Objective: To test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise attenuates systemic inflammatory
      activity in individuals with cardiovascular risk.

      Methods: Randomized controlled trial, which included 68 sedentary individuals, with at least
      two risk factors for coronary heart disease or established cardiovascular disease. The
      volunteers were randomized to 3 months of supervised aerobic training or just advice when
      healthy lifestyles. C-reactive protein (CRP) was measured by the method of high sensitivity
      before and after 3 months of intervention.
