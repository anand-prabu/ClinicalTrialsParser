It\n      seeks to evaluate the short-term safety and efficacy of citalopram and perphenazine in the\n      treatment of 112 patients suffering from behavioral disturbances associated with dementia.\n      Findings from this research may directly lead to improved acute pharmacotherapy for\n      psychosis and behavioral problems in patients diagnosed with dementia. Improved treatment of\n      behavioral complications with reduced side effects would reduce excess disability in\n      patients diagnosed with dementia, allowing them to be maintained in the community for\n      greater periods of time."

            "textblock": "The principal investigator is conducting an inpatient study at Western Psychiatric Institute\n      and Clinic involving two medications for treatment of emotional and behavioral disturbances\n      that may accompany dementia. In this study, 112 patients will be enrolled for up to 17 days\n      in order to investigate the safety and effectiveness of both medications. Forty-two of these\n      patients will be given a recently FDA-approved antidepressant medication called citalopram\n      and 42 will receive one of our current, usual antipsychotic medications called perphenazine.\n      An additional 28 patients will be given non-active placebo capsules. Which treatment a\n      patient is given during the study will be determined by chance. Findings from this\n      investigation may directly lead to the improvement of symptoms such as: agitation,\n      hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations, and unusual thoughts. Improved treatment of\n      problematic behaviors and a decrease in medication-associated side effects would enable\n      dementia patients to be cared for in their home environments for longer periods of time."
