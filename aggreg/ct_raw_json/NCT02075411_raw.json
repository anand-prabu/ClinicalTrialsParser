After induction of\n      general anesthesia, subjects will receive either a single shot or continuous nerve block.\n      The protocol will not dictate the conduct of the general anesthetic.\n\n      In the postoperative period, in addition to the standard monitoring in the recovery room,\n      the numerical rating pain scale(NRS) scores of the patient will be recorded. The timing of\n      the first rescue pain medication and total postoperative opioid and other analgesic\n      medication administered during the hospital stay will be recorded. The patients will be\n      followed in the hospital on the day of surgery (DOS) postoperatively until they are\n      discharged home.\n\n      After discharge the patients will be contacted by phone and/or email postoperatively on a\n      daily basis for 72 hours to collect information regarding their use of pain medications\n      (timing and dose), quality of analgesia based on the NRS pain scale, and incidence of side\n      effects. If patients need to be admitted to the hospital postoperatively, their opioid use,\n      pain scores and complications will be recorded while in the hospital.\n\n      All the patients will be evaluated in the orthopedic clinic at two weeks, six weeks and six\n      months to assess long term functional outcomes, pain scores and any signs of postoperative\n      neurological deficits."
