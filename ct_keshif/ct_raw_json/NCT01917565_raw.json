The main\n      advantages of the fiberoptic bronchoscope are minimal airway trauma and minimal\n      deterioration of the hemodynamic parameters.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the hemodynamic parameters, intubation times,\n      complications during and after intubation and postoperative sore throat scores of the\n      patients having normal airway anatomy, intubated with Airtraq, Macintosh laryngoscope or\n      fiberoptic bronchoscope, by experienced anesthesiologists."
