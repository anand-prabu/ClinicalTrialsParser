  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MK-3102 in participants
      with type 2 diabetes mellitus and moderate or severe chronic renal insufficiency or end
      stage renal disease on dialysis with inadequate glycemic control.  The primary hypothesis of
      the study is that MK-3102 compared to placebo produces greater reduction in glycosylated
      hemoglobin (A1C) after 24 weeks.
