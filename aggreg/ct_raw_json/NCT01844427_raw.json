After\n      screening procedures, memantine is prescribed in randomized, double-blind fashion (equal\n      chance of medication or placebo) for 12 weeks.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that memantine hydrochloride will prove to be an effective,\n      safe, and well-tolerated agent for the treatment of EFDs in individuals with ADHD interested\n      in non-stimulant medications."
