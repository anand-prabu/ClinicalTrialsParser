The programmer is used to set up the device, including setup of stimulation and recording, as well as to retrieve data for subsequent review."

To meet entry criteria for this study, you\n      must have already tried these methods and they did not help your symptoms.  DBS is\n      considered experimental for the treatment of TS and would not be done as normal clinical\n      care.\n\n      Participation in this study will require extensive pre-surgical screening to determine\n      eligibility for DBS surgery, a DBS surgical procedure, and regular follow-ups.  Subjects\n      will be seen monthly post surgery for 6 months.  After 6 months, data will be assessed and\n      RBS may be offered as a stimulation setting.  If so, the stimulator settings will be changed\n      from chronic to responsive.  If not, the subject will continue to receive chronic DBS\n      stimulation.  Subsequent visits will be scheduled every 6 months until a total of 24 months\n      of study participation.\n\n      At the end of the initial 24-month study period, subjects will have the choice of 1)\n      continuing active stimulation at the current setting, 2) continuing stimulation but\n      searching for a new setting, 3) discontinuing stimulation (turning the device off), 4)\n      having the device removed.  If the subject continues to receive active stimulation, they\n      will be followed by the PI and seen at yearly intervals until the DBS system is commercially\n      available, FDA approved for the treatment of TS, or unavailable for patient use."
