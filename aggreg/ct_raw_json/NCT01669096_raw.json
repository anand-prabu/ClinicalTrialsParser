In, addition, blood samples\n      collected at different time points after vaccination will be analysed to see when exactly\n      genes are activated by the vaccine using an assay called mRNA expression profiling. The\n      different methods for mRNA expression profiling using whole blood samples versus Peripheral\n      Blood Mononuclear cell(s) (PBMCs), will also be compared."
