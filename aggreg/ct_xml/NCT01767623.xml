    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase I study will evaluate the impact of severe hepatic impairment on the
      pharmacokinetics and safety of vemurafenib in patients with BRAF V600 mutation positive
      cancer. Patients will receive vemurafenib 960 mg (normal hepatic function) or 720 mg (severe
      hepatic impairment) orally twice daily on Days 1 to 20 (morning dose) and from Day 27
      onwards until disease progression or inacceptable toxicity occurs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients, &gt;/= 18 years of age

          -  Histologically confirmed BRAF V600 mutation-positive advanced solid malignancy that
             is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard curative or palliative measures
             do not exist or are no longer effective

          -  Normal or impaired hepatic function (hepatic function will be classified according to
             the NCI Organ Dysfunction Working Group criteria)

          -  For patients with hepatic impairment: Stable hepatic function for at least 2 weeks
             before Day 1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of &lt;/=2

          -  Patients with a history of recent brain metastases must have completed any radiation
             therapy at least 4 weeks before Day 1, be without intervening signs of brain lesion
             progression and not require steroids before starting the protocol (Day 1). Patients
             with gliomas or known brain metastases who require anticonvulsants must be seizure
             free for 1 month prior to enrollment

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 8 weeks

          -  Adequate hematologic and renal function

             childbearing potential must agree to use two adequate methods of contraception as
             defined by protocol during the course of this study and for at least 6 months after
             completion of study treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Allergy or hypersensitivity to components of the vemurafenib formulation

          -  Requirement for immediate or urgent treatment with vemurafenib and for whom the
             intermittent schedule of vemurafenib employed during Days 1-26 in this trial is not
             clinically acceptable

          -  Chemotherapy, biologic therapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior
             to entering the study, or those who have not recovered from AEs because of agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier

          -  Gliomas or known brain metastases that require corticosteroids

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction

          -  HIV-positive patient requiring antiviral treatment including protease inhibitors

          -  Active infection or chronic infection requiring chronic suppressive antibiotics

          -  Pregnancy or breastfeeding at Day 1

          -  History of malabsorption or other clinically significant metabolic dysfunction

          -  Active autoimmune disease

          -  Current, recent (within 28 days prior to Day 1), or planned use of any
             investigational product outside this study
