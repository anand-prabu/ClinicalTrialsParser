      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      ledipasvir/sofosbuvir (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) given for 12 weeks in subjects
      with nosocomial genotype 1 HCV infection.

    <description>Virologic failure is defined as virologic breakthrough (participant achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels during treatment but subsequently had detectable HCV RNA while continuing treatment), non-response (HCV RNA â‰¥ LLOQ through 12 weeks of treatment), or relapse (participant achieved undetectable HCV RNA levels during treatment maintained undetectable HCV RNA for the duration of treatment or achieved undetectable HCV RNA within 4 weeks of the end of treatment but did not achieve SVR at 4, 12, or 24 weeks posttreatment).</description>
