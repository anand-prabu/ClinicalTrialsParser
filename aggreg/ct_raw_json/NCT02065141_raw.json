On the study day protein digestion and absorption will be measured using a mixture\n      of amino acids that are made slightly heavier than normal, called stable isotopes. Subjects\n      will receive continuous feeding by sips and 125 mg of the NSAID Indomethacin. The\n      Indomethacin is provided to induce small changes in absorption, which can be picked up by\n      stable isotope technology."
