Negative outcomes of inappropriate antibiotics\n      include increased costs of care, adverse drug reactions, and rising prevalence of\n      antibiotic-resistant bacteria. To address this public health problem, we apply the\n      principles of commitment and consistency in an effort to influence clinician decision-making\n      through the implementation of a low-cost behavioral \"nudge\" in the form of a simple public\n      commitment device.  Clinicians were asked to post in their exam room a signed letter\n      indicating their commitments to reducing inappropriate antibiotic use for ARIs. Our\n      hypothesis is that clinicians displaying the poster-sized commitment letters will decrease\n      their inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs as compared to clinicians in the control\n      condition (with no posted letter)."
