      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of
      direct-acting antivirals therapy in liver transplanted patients who experienced HCV
      recurrence.

      This cohort is multicentric with constitution of biobank (plasma, serum) and the prospective
      collect of biological and clinical data's in the liver transplanted patients with recurrent
      HCV infection and treated with direct-acting anti-HCV agents.
