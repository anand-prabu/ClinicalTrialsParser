  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, open-labelled study which will enrol 360 participants in four groups of 80
      participants including: HIV-uninfected adults without evidence of TB; HIV-infected adults
      without any evidence of TB; HIV-uninfected adults with concurrent microbiologic confirmed
      TB, HIV-infected adults with concurrent microbiologic confirmed TB.

      Participants will receive the recommended seasonal 2013 un-adjuvanted Trivalent Influenza
      Vaccine (TIV). At 3 visits, blood will be collected for determination of immune responses.

      Objective:

      • To determine the effect of HIV-infection, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV-TB co-infection on
      immune responses

    <description>•	To determine the effect of HIV-infection, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV-TB co-infection on humoral antibody responses, measured by hemagglutinin inhibition assay (HAI), to each of three strains included in the seasonal non-adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine In this study we will use the following definitions to assess the humoral immune response to TIV: HAI titers &lt;1:10 = seronegative; HAI titers ≥1:10 = seropositive; HAI titers ≥1:40 = sero-protective; sero-response rate (primary outcome measure) will be defined as a titer of ≥1:40 in an individual with baseline titers of &lt;1:10, or &gt;4-fold increase of HAI titers if baseline titers were ≥1:10. Hemagglutination inhibition assays will be performed on serum as per recommended methods. Sera will be titrated against antigens from the influenza vaccine strains included in the 2013 seasonal TIV.</description>

    <description>• To compare the effect of HIV-infection, tuberculosis (TB) and HIV-TB co-infection on vaccine-strain specific cell mediated immune responses, evaluated by Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay, following non-adjuvanted TIV vaccination.
The cell mediated Immunity (CMI) evaluations in this study will provide novel information on influenza-specific CMI in individuals with TB. Interferon gama- ELISPOT responses will be assessed on fresh Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cells (PBMCs). Spots will be visualized with a ELISPOT plate reader. Background (non-specific) spots detected in the medium-containing wells will be subtracted from the wells stimulated with influenza antigens. Results will be reported as Spot forming cell (SFC)/106 PBMCs.</description>

    <description>Trivalent Inactivated Influenza Vaccine The study vaccine will be the seasonal 2013 un-adjuvanted TIV which is provided as a 0•5 milliliter suspension of split virus mixture of 15 micrograms each of circulating H1N1- like strain, H3N2- like strain and B - like strain.
The WHO recommended vaccine formulation for Southern Hemisphere 2013 Influenza Season contains the following influenza strains:
A/California/7/2009 (H1N1)pdm-like virus
A/Victoria/361/2011 (H3N2)-like virus
