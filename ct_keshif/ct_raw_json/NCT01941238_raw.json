Insulin pump\n      offers the advantage of flexibility and precision to administering insulin and has been\n      proven to reduce severe hypoglycemia compared to multi-dose injection (MDI). However, there\n      are extremely limited studies on the difference between insulin pump compared to MDI on the\n      incidence of hypoglycemia and other acute complications during fasting Ramadan\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that insulin pump would be associated with less hypoglycemic\n      events during fasting Ramadan compared to MDI without deterioration in glycemic control.\n      Results of this study are descriptive but will fill a current gap in knowledge and may\n      contribute to development of future guidelines for the management of type1DM during Ramadan."
