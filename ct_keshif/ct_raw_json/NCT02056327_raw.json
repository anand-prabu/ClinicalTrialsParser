            "textblock": "Oral appliances are an accepted means to treat obstructive sleep apnea.   In order to\n      determine if they are effective, a polysomnogram needs to be conducted with the oral\n      appliance in place.  We propose to develop monitoring sensors that could be inserted into\n      commercially available oral appliances in order to monitor effectiveness of the oral\n      appliances in treating sleep apnea.  We propose to look at heart rate variability as a\n      marker for ongoing sleep apnea.  We will use temperature as means of detecting how long the\n      device is in the mouth as a means of assessing adherence.\n\n      The objective of the Phase I project is to validate this hypothesis by answering five\n      questions:\n\n        -  What is the optimal sensor suite?  We will determine the optimal suite of sensors that\n           provides adequate sensitivity and specificity to determine OA usage and effectiveness\n           without compromising patient comfort.\n\n        -  Can we develop designs that are compatible with the most popular OAs?  We will design\n           and develop prototype versions of the OAMS that are compatible with three of the most\n           popular commercially available OAMS products (potential candidates include EMA, TAP,\n           SomnoDent, Herbst, Suad).\n\n        -  Do experienced dental care providers who specialize in OAs approve of the designs? We\n           will collaborate with dental care clinicians to iteratively refine the OAMS design for\n           maximum performance and patient comfort.\n\n        -  Does the OAMS provide data that are consistent with PSG instrumentation?  We will\n           collaborate with the Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) Sleep Disorders\n           Laboratory to assess OAMS sensor accuracy for approximately five healthy volunteers by\n           comparing OSA-related OAMS data with data from standard PSG instrumentation.\n\n        -  Can we formulate a cogent Human Subject Testing plan for Phase II?  We will develop a\n           detailed HST study plan to be conducted in Phase II to demonstrate fully integrated and\n           functional OAMS in a broad range of OSA patients who are candidates for an OA."
