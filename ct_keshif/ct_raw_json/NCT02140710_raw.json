            "textblock": "Timing of the first and last meconium stool is critical for oral feeding tolerance and\n      proper gastrointestinal function. The time until premature infants pass their first meconium\n      ranges from 1 hour to 27 days (median: 43 hours). Obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract\n      by tenacious, sticky meconium frequently leads to gastric residuals, a distended abdomen and\n      delayed food passage Recent data support the concept that complete rapid evacuation of\n      meconium plays a key role in feeding tolerance . If duration to full enteral feedings is\n      extended, the probability to acquire infections due to intravenous access for parenteral\n      nutrition increases and hospital stay of the infant prolongates. Previously two prospective\n      trials focusing on the problem of delayed meconium evacuation in preterm with different\n      therapeutic pharmacological approaches were published by our group. None of the applied\n      therapies appeared to be effective or had a beneficial effect- quite the contrary one agent\n      (Gastrografin) was supposed to have severe negative side effects. Therefore we were looking\n      for an alternative, non-invasive, holistic solution for the problem of delayed meconium\n      excretion. Osteopathic treatment with the emphasis on the relationship of the structural and\n      functional integrity of the body and with its variety of therapeutic manual techniques\n      seemed to be remedy. Treating the abdomen of premature infants with visceral osteopathic\n      techniques might be more effective to mobilize meconium from small bowel and deep parts of\n      the colon. Therefore we hypothesized that repeated visceral osteopathic treatment\n      accelerates meconium evacuation in premature infants, and thereby enhances feeding tolerance\n      in this population."
