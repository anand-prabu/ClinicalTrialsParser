  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients show a high prevalence of fibromyalgia though
      rates vary considerably from one study to another (from 8.2% to 45%). Although fibromyalgia
      can bring out the disability in daily life, the majority of previous reports only
      ascertained no significant association between the presence of fibromyalgia and the severity
      of SLE.

      It is necessary to make unremitting effort to reduce the mortality and life-threatening
      disease flare-up due to SLE disease itself. Additionally, we think that physicians need to
      pay more attention to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the patients with
      SLE. HRQoL could be influenced by various factors such as depression, fibromyalgia, disease
      duration, disease activity and etc. To improve the HRQoL in SLE patients, it might be the
      clinically important and constructive theme to investigate that which is the most important
      factor among the fibromyalgia, depression, sleep quality, SLE activity and SLE duration.

      The objective of this study is to evaluate the degree of contribution of fibromyalgia for
      reduced HRQoL and to identify the status of managing fibromyalgia in Korean patients with
      SLE.
