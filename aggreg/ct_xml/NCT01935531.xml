  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of this study is to investigate the effects of topical diclofenac on tumor
      metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses in immunocompetent and immunocompromised
      patients.

      Study hypothesis is that topical diclofenac lowers lactate level in skin biopsies of actinic
      keratoses. Planned number of patients is 38.

      This study is a monocenter study investigating the effects of 3% diclofenac in 2.5%
      hyaluronic acid gel on tumor metabolism in the treatment of actinic keratoses. Treatment
      duration is 3 months. Skin biopsies will be obtained before treatment, at the end of the
      treatment and four weeks after the treatment. Control biopsies at visit 1 and 3 are
      performed in healthy, sun damaged and untreated skin. Evaluation of efficacy will be
      performed at the end of the treatment and four weeks after the treatment.

      Duration of treatment is 3 months (±4 weeks). Approximately 0,5g Solaraze® 3% gel is applied
      on a 5cm x 5cm lesion. Solaraze® 3% gel is applied twice daily on the study lesions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoplastic cells show an increased glucose metabolism and glycolysis which is associated
      with high lactate concentrations. There is also data for several tumor entities that high
      levels of lactate in the tumor are associated with tumor progression, metastasis and poor
      clinical outcome. Kreutz et al. demonstrated that diclofenac inhibits tumor cell
      proliferation in vitro and tumor growth in vivo via COX-independent effects on glucose
      metabolism. Diclofenac is taken up by tumor cells and inhibits tumor cell proliferation
      through inhibition of the oncogene MYC and subsequently glycolysis and block of lactate
      transport. MYC regulates genes involved in glycolysis and is upregulated in neoplastic
      cells, which is in line with the metabolic switch to glycolysis, the so called &quot;Warburg
      effect&quot;, that cancer cells show. Although these results were found in vitro using human
      melanoma cells and in vivo in a mouse model, a similar mechanism of action is assumed to be
      relevant for the treatment of actinic keratoses with topical diclofenac. However tumor
      metabolism in diclofenac-treated actinic keratoses has never been investigated. To
      investigate the mechanism of action of diclofenac in the treatment of actinic keratoses, a
      clinical study analyzing particularly lactate levels, glycolysis and inflammatory infiltrate
      is needed.
