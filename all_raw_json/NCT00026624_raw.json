Research has\n      shown that the immune response to a vaccine delivered by DCs is greater than the response\n      without DC delivery. A5130 is a study that seeks to give good delivery of the vaccine to\n      important immune cells of the body."

            "textblock": "Cytotoxic T-cell lymphocyte (CTL) responses are important in viral destruction and thereby\n      in the protective immune response to viral infection. Current HIV vaccines do not\n      consistently elicit strong CTL responses. The limited immune response of current HIV\n      vaccines could be attributed, in addition to other causes, to failure of the vaccine to\n      reach the appropriate cells to initiate a robust immune response. DCs particularly are\n      effective in stimulating primary T-cell-dependent immunity. Antigen-bearing DCs are used as\n      adjuvants for active immunotherapy in humans, particularly to increase host resistance to\n      tumors and certain viral infections. A5130 is an exploratory, proof-of-concept study that\n      seeks to ensure adequate delivery of the vaccine to important antigen-presenting cells.\n\n      Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 vaccination groups at entry. Group A: Patients receive\n      an SC vaccination with DCs infected with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452. DC exposure to KLH occurs at\n      Weeks 3 and 7. Leukopheresis occurs at entry.\n\n      Group B: Patients receive an SC vaccination with ALVAC-HIV vCP1452 without DCs. KLH\n      injections are administered at Weeks 3 and 7.\n\n      Patients in both groups receive their vaccinations at Weeks 3, 7, and 15. This study\n      consists of 4 steps but not all patients necessarily qualify to enter Step II, Step III, or\n      Step IV.\n\n      Step I: vaccination phase. Step II: withdrawal of potent ART. Step III: optional\n      discontinuation of ART. Step IV: reinitiation of ART. [AS PER AMENDMENT 04/10/02: Step V:\n      follow-up period off potent ART.]"
