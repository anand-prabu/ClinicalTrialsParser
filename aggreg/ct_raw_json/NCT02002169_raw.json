            "textblock": "Background: The investigators developed a Shower Technique protocol (STP) for hemodialysis\n      (HD) patients with healed central venous catheter (CVC) exit sites, designed to permit\n      showering but not increase infection risk.\n\n      Research question: Is it feasible to conduct a randomized control trial comparing the rate\n      of CVC related bacteremia (CRB) in adult satellite HD patients using STP versus standard CVC\n      care alone with 6 month follow up? Study Design: This pilot study is a multi-centre\n      randomized control trial. Eligible participants will be randomized to STP versus standard\n      care after meeting predefined criteria to confirm healed tunneled CVC exit site.\n\n      Primary Outcome: Feasibility will be determined based on 5 outcome measures:  accuracy of\n      the CRB rate documentation in the satellite setting, percentage of patients screened,\n      recruited, educated successfully in the STP (intervention arm), and aspects of STP (% of\n      contaminated patients in the control arm).\n\n      Study Setting: In satellite units affiliated with 2 academic and 3 community centres in\n      south central Ontario, Canada.\n\n      Patient Population:  Adult satellite HD patients dialyzing via CVC with healed CVC exit\n      sites.\n\n      Intervention: STP and standard CVC care; or Control: standard CVC care; Analysis: Each\n      measure of feasibility has its statistical threshold for success. If the threshold is\n      reached in 4 of the 5 measures, the full HIPPO SAT study will be deemed feasible.\n\n      Discussion: A pilot feasibility study of the larger study is critical due to the potential\n      challenges associated with recruitment, compliance and contamination."

            "textblock": "CVC related infections are associated with increased morbidity and hospitalization rates,\n      high treatment costs, and poor survival compared to use of an arteriovenous access. To\n      prevent infection, patients should preserve the integrity and dryness of their CVC\n      dressings. Showering should be avoided, as it is difficult to attain full protective\n      coverage of the exit site using dressings and barriers.  Wet dressings place patients at\n      increased infection risk, especially if their CVC exit site is not fully healed. However, in\n      a survey of 274 CVC dependent HD patients, 64% indicated that the recommended prohibition to\n      shower was moderately to extremely inconvenient and reduced their quality of life.\n      Additionally 77% of patients admitted to showering at least once while they had a CVC.\n\n      While submersion of the CVC in water is discouraged by clinical practice guidelines, they\n      also state that if precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of bacterial CVC entry\n      then showering may be acceptable. However, this guidance is opinion based with no evidence\n      to support specific precautions. Thus, to address the patients' desire to shower safely, at\n      least 2 separate dialysis facilities in Ontario, Canada have developed a showering procedure\n      as an alternative method of CVC care. Preliminary data from a small proof-of-concept study\n      of 65 patients suggests acceptable CRB rates (0.46/1000 CVC days) using such showering\n      procedures.  The study was conducted in satellite HD units on a select population of\n      patients who were infection-free for 6 months using the same CVC. Satellite units offer\n      dialysis in an outpatient setting for those patients who are stable and require less\n      intensive care than in-centre patients. The satellite HD population is typically younger and\n      healthier, and likely more able to perform showering procedures than in-centre patients.\n      With increasing patients in satellite HD, it is crucial that a pragmatic, yet effective,\n      prophylactic CVC infection strategy be formally tested and established for this setting.\n\n      Following the proof-of-concept study, nephrologists, vascular access coordinators, and HD\n      centres from five dialysis centres across Ontario, collaborated to create a formal Shower\n      Technique Protocol (STP) which includes chlorhexidine applicators after showering to\n      minimize the risk of bacterial entry at the CVC exit site. STP is designed specifically for\n      patients with a fully endothelialized CVC tunnel and healed exit site. Participants\n      allocated to STP are able to shower and change their dressing up to 3 times per week. Prior\n      to more widespread implementation of the STP, it is critical to determine whether it is safe\n      for use in patients with healed CVC exit sites. In other words, to confirm that CRB rates in\n      patients using STP are not greater than the CRB rates in patients using the gold standard of\n      CVC care. It is unknown whether using the STP improves patient satisfaction with their CVC\n      care."
