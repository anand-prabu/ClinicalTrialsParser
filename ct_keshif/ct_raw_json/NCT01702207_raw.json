            "textblock": "Current standard prophylactic immunosuppression in renal transplantation includes\n      tacrolimus, a calcineurin inhibitor, dosed twice daily. In Canada, oral tacrolimus has been\n      available as a twice daily formulation marketed as Prograf\u00ae since 1997. It has recently\n      become available in an extended release formulation called Advagraf\u00ae, which is dosed once\n      daily. Advagraf\u00ae has been demonstrated to be therapeutically equivalent to Prograf\u00ae in the\n      renal transplant maintenance population, and as a result it has been is approved as an\n      alternative to the twice daily formulation in these patients. There is an evolving and\n      expanding positive clinical experience with Advagraf\u00ae in kidney transplantation and it has\n      shown to be preferred by many patients, due to the diminished dosing frequency. In clinical\n      trials, Advagraf\u00ae has been shown to have other potential benefits over Prograf\u00ae such as less\n      inter and intra-patient variability, improved cardiovascular profiles, and improved kidney\n      function. Compared to Prograf\u00ae, Advagraf\u00ae also has a lower Cmin or 'trough' concentration as\n      well as a lower Cmax or 'peak' concentration. The purpose of this study is to convert\n      stabilized renal transplant patients currently receiving Prograf\u00ae to Advagraf\u00ae, to\n      investigate these potential therapeutic benefits.\n\n      The Framingham Risk Score and the Reynold's Risk Score are currently recommended by the\n      Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) to predict 10-year cardiovascular risk in the general\n      population. Surrogate markers are widely used in clinical trials to shorten follow-up\n      durations. In this study, the investigators will use the Framingham Risk Score and Reynold's\n      Risk Score to quantify changes in estimated cardiovascular risk. The investigators also\n      intend to examine novel inflammatory markers to investigate cardiovascular risk.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the more consistent drug exposure and lower Cmax noted\n      with Advagraf\u00ae will decrease Framingham Risk Score, Reynolds Risk score as well as markers\n      of inflammation in kidney transplant recipients."
