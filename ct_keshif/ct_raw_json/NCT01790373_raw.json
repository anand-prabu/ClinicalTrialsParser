Multiple\n      intervention studies by our team in Rakai and Masaka Districts of southern Uganda with\n      AIDS-orphaned adolescents have revealed that if given an opportunity to participate in\n      economic empowerment interventions, youth and their caregivers take full advantage of these\n      interventions to save and invest in their future, show improvements in family financial\n      outcomes, future aspirations, health functioning, sexual-risk taking behaviors, and mental\n      health. The Suubi+Adherence study capitalizes on this prior work, positing that economic\n      empowerment may be a missing, yet critical ingredient to HIV treatment adherence\n      interventions for adolescents and young people. Suubi+Adherence incorporates an economic\n      empowerment design, with a savings-led income generating component, to promote economic\n      stability, and apply it to adherence to HIV treatment regimens for HIV-positive adolescents\n      in a region of southern Uganda with the highest HIV incidence and prevalence in the country."
