In particular, the investigators\n      aim to explore the mutual interaction of neurohumoral activation and exercise limitation\n      thereby focussing on differential effects of the peripheral muscle and the diaphragm.\n\n      Eventually the findings might influence treatment modalities. If sympathetic activation\n      contributes to exercise limitation then drugs influencing the autonomic nervous system would\n      be a reasonable therapeutic concept. If a reduction of sympathetic activity due to an\n      alteration of the ergoreflex can be achieved by non-invasive ventilation this would help to\n      improve dyspnea and exercise capacity."
