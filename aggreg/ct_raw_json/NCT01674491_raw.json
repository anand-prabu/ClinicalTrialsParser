Test group subjects received pouches containing\n      black soy peptides (4.5 g/day total soy peptides for 8 weeks). The control group received\n      pouches containing casein that had a similar appearance to the black soy peptide tablet.\n      During the intervention, we instructed study participants to continue their current food\n      intake patterns and lifestyles so that total energy intake and energy expenditure would be\n      constant during the course of trial. Participants brought back unconsumed pouches at their\n      4- and 8-week follow-up visits. The dietitian counted the number of returned pouches, and we\n      used this to assess the participants' adherence to their assigned intervention."
