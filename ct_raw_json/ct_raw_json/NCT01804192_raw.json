These include\n      transmission of infectious disease, pneumothorax and other problems associated with organ\n      punctures, cardiac tamponade, and broken needles with remnants migrating to other\n      locations.Studies have shown that when TENS is applied over acupoints (Acu-TENS), it is\n      effective in reducing dyspnoea in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary\n      disease,facilitate early haemodynamic recovery after open-heart surgery,relieve labor\n      pain,increase in blood \u03b2-endorphin level,reduce blood pressure changes in normal healthy\n      subjects and decrease airway resistance.Despite these promising results, how Acu-TENS works\n      still remain unclear.This study aimed to investigate the effects of Acu-TENS over Hegu (LI4)\n      and Quichi (LI4) on the autonomic nervous system activities and to investigate whether the\n      subject could experience distinct sensation as deqi."
