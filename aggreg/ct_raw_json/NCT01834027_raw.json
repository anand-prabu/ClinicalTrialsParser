            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of music on patients after surgery\n      in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU). For many patients, surgery creates significant\n      emotional stress and anxiety which can include discomfort or pain.  Music therapy has proven\n      to be a useful adjuvant in various inpatient and outpatient settings by providing a relaxing\n      effect that decreases heart rate, blood pressure, and hormonal measures of stress. It has\n      been shown that classical music can cause physiological and psychological differences in\n      patient outcomes, but few studies have looked specifically at effects of jazz music. Some\n      have argued that jazz may be too involved to provide the same relaxed state as classical\n      music, but this may be due in part to the type of jazz played for the patient. It is our\n      hypothesis that slow jazz music by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana\n      Krall, Dave Brubeck, etc. will reduce measures of stress and anxiety in patients in the PACU\n      following surgery for hysterectomy (laparoscopic or robotic) to a greater extent than the\n      control group. Jazz music or \"no music\" will be played through headphones to participants in\n      the study post-surgically while they are in the PACU and measures of stress, anxiety, and\n      pain will be monitored."

The second group no music will be\n           played.\n\n        -  Blood pressure will be monitored by a non-invasive blood pressure cuff at 5 minute\n           intervals throughout the patient's stay in the PACU.\n\n        -  Heart rate will be measured, using a pulse oximeter,  at the same intervals as blood\n           pressure.\n\n        -  Before the patient leaves the PACU, she will be asked to rate her perception of her\n           levels of pain and anxiety on scales that use a numeric scale of 1-10. The primary\n           variable outcomes are: heart rate and mean blood pressure. Secondary outcomes include:\n           perceived pain, anxiety, and level of relaxation.\n\n        -  headphones will be used to deliver one of the following sounds to the patients: 1) jazz\n           music (BPM<100) by artists including Miles Davis, Ella Fitzgerald, Diana Krall, Dave\n           Brubeck, etc.; or 2) no music providing."
