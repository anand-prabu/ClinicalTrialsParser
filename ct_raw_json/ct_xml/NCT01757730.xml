  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Magnetic resonance elastography is a novel non-invasive MRI technique to obtain stiffness of
      soft tissues such as liver, heart, kidneys, etc. In this imaging technique a person is laid
      in an MR scanner and a paddle (plastic drum) is put on the area of interest to send sound
      vibration via a speaker placed outside the scan room which is connecting plastic drum via a
      plastic tube. These vibrations are scanned using MRI to estimate the stiffness of soft
      tissues such as liver, heart, kidneys, breast etc.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently a new and novel noninvasive imaging-based technique known as Magnetic Resonance
      Elastography (MRE) was developed that is capable of quantifying stiffness of soft tissues
      such as liver, spleen, kidney, heart brain, breast, aorta etc. In MRE a person is laid into
      an MR scanner which is similar to all MR scans. In addition, a drum (passive driver) is
      placed on the body (area close to the region of interest), which is connected by a long
      plastic tube that runs outside the scan room. This drum is tightly strapped by a Velcro to
      the body for better contact. Then the other end of the plastic tube is connected to an
      active driver that produces vibrations of frequencies in the range of 20Hz -2kHz. These
      frequencies of vibrations are transferred to the passive driver which produces vibrations on
      the body. These vibrations are tracked using MR scanner to produce wave images. A
      post-processing of these wave images are performed to obtain spatial stiffness maps.
      Currently, MRE is a clinical tool to assess hepatic fibrosis at many institutions. MRE is
      superior to many invasive techniques (i.e. biopsies, catheter based Pressure-Volume
      measurements) and mechanical testing in that it is noninvasive and can be performed in vivo
      under physiologic conditions. MRE could make stiffness widely available and could
      revolutionize the diagnosis and treatment of numerous diseases affecting stiffness of soft
      tissues. For example in Liver: diagnosis of hepatic fibrosis, Non-alcoholic fatty liver
      disease, liver tumors etc. Heart: diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction,
      hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, contractility etc. Aorta: Aortic aneurysms, hypertension etc.
      This technology is completely noninvasive and the vibrational energy is way below the
      required standards. Previous experiences of these vibrations are like massaging the body.
      The risks of this research study are minimal, which means that we do not believe that they
      will be any different than what you would experience at a routine clinical visit or during
      your daily life. This study will not make participants' health better. It is for the benefit
      of research.The specific aim of this study is that MRE can be used as a noninvasive tool to
      diagnose different disease states in soft tissues. In this study we will be applying this
      technique in adult volunteers to test the feasibility and validation of the technique in
      different organs.
