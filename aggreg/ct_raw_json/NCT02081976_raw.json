Although\n      there are some interventional studies evaluating the systemic effects of periodontal\n      therapy, there is little information regarding the impact of periodontal treatment on the\n      prevention of cardiovascular events. To the best of our knowledge, there are no randomized\n      controlled trials published to date assessing the effect of periodontal therapy in primary\n      prevention of CVD."
