  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through the injection of Hearticellgram-AMI into acute myocardial infarction patients who
      are the primary targets of the drug, long term efficacy in the improvement of the left
      ventricle ejection fraction upon the first cell treatment is to be evaluated and compared
      with the current existing treatments (temporary drug treatment).

    <description>After implementing PCI, temporary drug treatment is conducted.
*Temporary drug treatment is a general drug treatment (Unfractionated heparin, Low Molecular Weight Heparin, Glycoprotien llb/llla inhibitor, Aspirin, clopidogrel or Ticlopidine, Nitrate, ACE inhibitor or ARB, β-blocker, CCB, Diuretics, Statin, etc.)</description>

    <description>Within four weeks after performing PCI and bone marrow puncture, infarct coronary artery catheter is used to inject approximately 1×10^6/kg (refer to usage/dosage according to mass) of human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into the infarct coronary artery. Furthermore, temporary drug treatment is conducted.</description>

Furthermore, temporary drug treatment is conducted.
However, among the human bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cell cultures obtained after bone marrow collection, the first batch of the stem cell cultures is stored, and after the first cell injection, the second cell injection is conducted within a month.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between the ages of 20-70

          2. Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) under 45%

          3. Acute myocardial infraction patients fulfilling at least one of the given qualities,
             through the use of an electrocardiogram (12-lead ECG) A. ST-segment elevation 0.1 mV
             in two or more limb leads or B. 0.2 mV elevation in two or more contiguous precordial
             leads , indicative of AMI

          4. Anterior Wall MI

          5. Patients who fulfill the above criteria and also have experienced successful
             reperfusion

          6. Patients who can consent to participate in this clinical trial personally, as well as
             through a legal attorney

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who have been diagnosed with malignant blood-related diseases (acute
             myelocyte leukemia, acute lymphatic leukemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, multiple
             myeloma),  and have not improved

          2. Patients with major aplastic anemia

          3. Patients with solid cancers in their previous medical history (within 5 years)

          4. Patients whose blood serum AST/ASL rates are more than three times the normal maximum
             rate, and whose creatinine rates are more than 1.5 times the normal maximum rate (but
             AST in myocardial infarction patients can temporarily rise, thus, as decided by the
             researchers, if there is no damage to the liver function, the rise will not be taken
             into consideration)

          5. Patients who have implemented Coronary Artery Bypass (CAB)

          6. Patients with chronic heart failure (patients with heart failure medical history at
             least three months before the occurrence of acute myocardial infarction)

          7. Patients who cannot proceed with cardiac catheterization

          8. Patients who had been continuously taking large doses of steroids or antibiotics one
             month prior to registration

          9. Patients who had major surgical operations, organ biopsy, or significant external
             injury as determined by the researcher, within three months before registration

         10. Patients who have head injuries or other external injuries after the development of
             myocardial infarction
