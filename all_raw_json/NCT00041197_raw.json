To determine whether patients with resected primary gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)\n      who are randomized to the STI571 (imatinib mesylate) Arm have longer recurrence-free\n      survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To ascertain whether patients with resected primary GIST who are randomized to the STI571\n      Arm have longer survival as compared to the patients randomized to the placebo Arm.\n\n      II. To obtain from patients with GIST: tumor tissue (before therapy with STI571 and if the\n      patient develops recurrence), blood specimens (before therapy with STI571), and serum\n      specimens (before therapy with STI571, after completing therapy with STI571, and if the\n      patient develops recurrence) for scientific correlative analyses.\n\n      III. To assess the safety/efficacy of oral STI571 therapy in the adjuvant setting.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; STI571) once daily. Treatment\n      continues for 1 year in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.
