This study is a\n      multicenter clinical trial to be conducted at the University of Tennessee, Memphis (the lead\n      center) and the West Tennessee Medical Specialty Clinic (a collaborating site).\n\n      Patients enrolled will be allowed to continue a constant dose of disease-modifying\n      anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and prednisone less than or equal to 7.5 mg/day. Patients will\n      be randomly assigned to one of two groups. The low dose group will receive 30 mcg daily for\n      10 weeks, then 50 mcg daily for 10 weeks, followed by 70 mcg daily for 10 more weeks; the\n      high dose group will receive 90 mcg daily for 10 weeks, then 100 mcg daily for 10 weeks,\n      followed by 130 mcg daily for 10 more weeks. Blood will be collected at screening and at\n      Weeks 10, 20, and 30. Blood will be analyzed for indicators of inflammation.\n\n      Note: this trial is no longer being conducted as an intervention trial.
