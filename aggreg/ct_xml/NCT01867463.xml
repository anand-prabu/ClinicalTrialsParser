      Background:

      - Malaria is a disease that is spread by mosquitoes. Researchers are looking for a vaccine
      that can prevent mosquitoes from transmitting malaria to people. They want to test a vaccine
      called Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel   that may help stop malaria parasites from developing in
      mosquitoes. When a mosquito bites a vaccinated person, the vaccine should prevent parasites
      from developing in the mosquito. As a result, the mosquito will not spread malaria to the
      next person it bites. However, the vaccine will not directly prevent people vaccinated from
      getting sick with malaria. Researchers want to test this vaccine in people who live in rural
      Mali. To do so, the study will compare the symptoms and the blood tests of the participants
      who receive either the study vaccine or a regular hepatitis B/meningococcal vaccine.

      Objectives:

      - To see if Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel   is a safe and effective malaria vaccine.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy volunteers between 18 and 45 years of age who live in Bancoumana, Mali.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have
           Pfs25-EPA/Alhydrogel   to test the study vaccine. The other group will have the regular
           Hepatitis B vaccine series, meningococcal vaccine.

        -  In the study vaccine group, participants will have either a lower dose or a higher
           dose. For the lower dose, they will have two vaccine shots over 1 year. For the higher
           dose, they will have four vaccine shots over about 14 months.

        -  In the other vaccine group, participants will have the Hepatitis B vaccine series,
           meningococcal vaccine according to the standard dose schedule.

        -  All participants will provide regular blood samples for testing during the study.

        -  Participants who develop malaria during the study will participate in evaluation of
           transmission and parasite development of malaria parasite from the person to mosquito
           via transmission assays. They will allow mosquitoes (that have no diseases) to bite
           them in a controlled clinic setting. This will let researchers see if the vaccine can
           stop the mosquitoes from carrying malaria to other people.

    <textblock>
      A vaccine to interrupt malaria transmission would be a valuable tool for local elimination
      or eradication of this disease. Pfs25, a surface antigen of ookinetes in the mosquito stage
      of P. falciparum, is a lead candidate for a malaria transmission blocking vaccine.
      Recombinant Pfs25 has been conjugated to Pseudomonas aeruginosa ExoProtein A (EPA), and
      adjuvanted with Alhydrogel  . This dose escalating, double-blind, randomized controlled
      trial will determine safety and immunogenicity of the vaccine in malaria exposed adults. One
      hundred twenty (120) subjects will be enrolled and randomized to receive the low dose (16
      g of conjugated Pfs25, n=10), the high dose (47   g of conjugated Pfs25, n=50), or the
      comparator vaccine (Euvax B for first 3 vaccinations, then Menactra   vaccine for the fourth
      vaccination, n=10 for 2 vaccinations, n=50 for 4 vaccinations). Enrollment within the high
      dose group will be staggered for additional safety. The low dose and the matching comparator
      cohort (Group 1) will receive 2 vaccine doses given at 0 and 2 months. For the rest of the
      subjects, 3 doses will be given at a 0, 2, 4 month dosing intervals, and a fourth (booster)
      dose will be given 12 months following the third dose at the start of the subsequent
      transmission season. Subjects will be followed for 12 months following the last vaccination.
      Safety outcomes will be local and systemic adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events
      (SAEs). Immunogenicity outcomes will be antibody responses as measured by ELISA against
      recombinant Pfs25 and EPA, and B cell responses. Functional activity of the induced antibody
      will be assessed by direct transmission blocking assays (direct skin feeds, direct membrane
      feeding assays) conducted at the Malaria Research and Training Center (MRTC) in Mali and in
      a standard membrane feeding assay conducted at the National Institute of Allergy and
      Infectious Diseases (NIAID) in the United States.
