  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this extension study is to further investigate the tolerability and
      efficacy in a phase I setting in order to see whether lower doses than the initial study
      dose of 0.25 mg/kg bw Amphinex in Amphinex-based PCI of bleomycin will show a comparable or
      improved safety and tolerability profile in combination with comparable signs of efficacy.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the combined tolerability and efficacy of Amphinex 0.125 mg/kg or lower in Amphinex-based PCI of bleomycin</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Maximal pain during the procedure will be recorded immediately after the procedure on a 10 centimetre visual analogue scale (VAS). Pain will also be recorded 24 hours after the illumination and on day 4. The end-points of the VAS will be &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;unbearable pain
A formal efficacy analysis is not appropriate for this trial. The response data will be documented by descriptive summary tables. No statistical comparison of dose levels will be done. Fluorescence measurements over time and lesion response evaluation according to RECIST (see Appendix E) will be presented for APT and PP stratified by dose level.</description>

    <measure>To determine the pharmacokinetics of Amphinex 0.125 mg/kg or lower in Amphinex-based PCI of bleomycin.</measure>
    <time_frame>From Baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Plasma samples for pharmacokinetic (PK) evaluation will be collected from patients and the presence of Amphinex and/or other unidentified metabolites will be assessed using a validated analytical method
Systematic skin photosensitivity tests will be carried out using a white light source with an emission spectrum that, relatively to the luminance and within +/- 50%, excites Amphinex with the same efficiency as sunlight. The luminance will be 500 lux, which is comparable to bright indoor light, and 100.000 lux, which is comparable to direct sunlight. The phototoxic reaction will be scored at specific time points following the light exposure (see the study flowchart Appendix B). This information will be used to predict the degree of photosensitivity of the skin.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â€¢ Male or female aged 18 years or above who have given written informed consent

               -  Skin type I- IV according to the Fitzpatrick skin classification (see Appendix
                  G)
