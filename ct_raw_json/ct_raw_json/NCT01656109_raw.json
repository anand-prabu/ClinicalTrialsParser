The most commonly used PI in Thailand is lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r).\n      However, the metabolic complications of lopinavir/ritonaive (LPV/r) such as hyperlipidemia\n      and lipodyrtrophy are common and a concern for HIV-infected children as it may contribute to\n      the development of cardiovascular disease in the longer term. There are data on efficacy,\n      safety and pharmacokinetics of ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected adults but none in\n      children. Furthermore, many studies in both adults and children have shown that different\n      ethnicities can result in different pharmacokinetic response to antiretroviral drugs. As a\n      result of this, this study investigated the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of\n      ATV/r-based HAART in HIV-infected Asian children."
