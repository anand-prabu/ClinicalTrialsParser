    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of tivozanib and to see how
      well it works in treating patients liver cancer that is metastatic or cannot be removed by
      surgery. Tivozanib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed
      for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Progression free survival (PFS) at 24 weeks in patients with advanced hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety of tivozanib in HCC. II. To determine the overall survival (OS)
      and clinical benefit rate (complete response [CR], partial response [PR] and stable disease
      [SD]) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST).

      III. To determine the steady state pharmacokinetics (PK) and soluble vascular endothelial
      growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2) baseline/change with tivozanib and use modeling to
      correlate exposure with biomarker change and the primary outcome measure of PFS.

      IV. To determine the change in viral load (hepatitis B virus [HBV] and hepatitis C virus
      [HCV]) during therapy in patients with HBV or HCV associated HCC.

      V. To determine the change in tumor marker (alfa fetoprotein) with tivozanib therapy is in
      the effect of tivozanib on several tumor-associated immune response markers.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.

      Patients receive tivozanib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months.
