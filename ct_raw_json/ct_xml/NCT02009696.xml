        Inclusion Criteria:

        The following initial inclusion criteria must be met for a subject to be enrolled and
        considered for the MRI-procedure:

          -  Age greater than 18 years

          -  Able and willing to complete MRI testing

          -  Able to provide written informed consent

          -  Available for follow-up visit at the study site

          -  Implanted with a pacemaker system consisting only of an Entovis pacemaker (DR-T,
             SR-T) and one or two Setrox S 53 or Setrox S 60 pacemaker lead(s). (No leads other
             than Setrox S (53 or 60 cm) leads may be implanted. This includes lead extensions or
             abandoned leads in the subject.)

          -  Pacemaker implanted pectorally

          -  All pacemaker system components implanted, repositioned, or exchanged at least 5
             weeks prior to enrollment

          -  Underling rhythm identifiable during sensing test

          -  All pacing thresholds are measureable and are less than or equal to 2.0 V @0.4 ms

          -  Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 4.8V @ 1.0 ms

          -  Pacing impedance is between 200 and 1500 ohm

          -  Able and willing to use the Cardio Messenger

        At the pre-MRI procedure, the following procedure-related criteria must be met for the
        subject to undergo the MRI scan:

          -  Absence of phrenic nerve stimulation at 4.8V @ 1.0 ms

             •/pacing threshold at Pre-MRI follow-up - pacing threshold at baseline/ ≤ 0.5 V

          -  All pacing thresholds are measureable and are ≤ 2.0 V @ 0.4 ms

          -  The pacemaker system has been implanted for at least 6 weeks.

          -  Subject did not have a pacemaker or lead explant, exchange or reposition in the
             previous 6 weeks.

          -  All lead impedances are between 200 and 1500 ohm.

          -  Battery status is at least 30% of capacity

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Enrolled in any other clinical study

          -  For pacemaker systems that include an atrial lead, subjects with either

               -  Persistent atrial arrhythmia (lasting longer than 7 days or requiring
                  cardioversion)

               -  Permanent atrial arrhythmia

          -  Life expectancy of less than three months

          -  Pregnancy

          -  Cardiac surgery expected in the next three months

        Implanted with other medical devices that may interact with MRI, such as:

          -  abandoned pacemaker/ICD leads

          -  lead extensions

          -  mechanical valves

          -  other active medical devices

          -  non-MRI compatible devices

          -  other metallic artifacts/components in body that may interact with MRI
