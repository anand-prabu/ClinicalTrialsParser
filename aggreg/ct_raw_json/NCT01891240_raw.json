The study will i) recruit 5000\n      first-time pregnant women; ii) establish a high calibre biobank, augmented by accurate\n      clinical metadata; iii) determine whether prototype predictive assays and algorithms\n      translate to the clinical environment; iv) assess potential synergy of a combined\n      metabolomic and proteomic approach and v) progress regulatory approval and development of\n      the selected test into the clinical arena."

Although the predictive\n      algorithms will produce a continuous risk score, the use of a categorical outcome fits with\n      the final binary decision process (to treat or not to treat) based on the risk score. Based\n      on the lowest estimated prevalence of pre-eclampsia of 3% and a test sensitivity of 93% and\n      a test specificity of 97%, then to be 90% certain that the true specificity of the patient\n      population is no less than 95%, a sample size of 4,800 participants is required.
