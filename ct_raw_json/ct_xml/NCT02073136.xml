  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with chronic kidney disease struggle to eliminate phosphate as the renal function
      deteriorates, which results in accumulation of phosphate in the body. This has been shown to
      increase the patients' risk of cardiovascular disease and death. Even with dialysis
      treatment the patients cannot excrete enough phosphate to reach phosphate balance. The
      patients are therefore recommended a very restrictive diet when they reach the dialysis
      stage. It is therefore important to find ways to prevent such accumulation of phosphate in
      the body as early in the disease process as possible, but without compromising the
      nutritional status. Because phosphate occurs naturally in many of our foods, such as meat,
      fish and dairy products, it is difficult to reduce the intake of phosphate, without also
      reducing the intake of energy and protein. Over the past couple of years there has been an
      increased focus on the use of phosphate containing additives in the food industry. A
      reduction in the intake of phosphorus containing additives may reduce the accumulation of
      phosphate in the body. This can be achieved by decreasing the intake of processed food
      products. Because it is also very time consuming and inconvenient for the patient to keep
      these strict diets, the patients have a reasonable claim to know which effects can be
      achieved by such diets. This will therefore seek to be further explored in the following
      study. The study is conducted as a randomised crossover trial in predialysis patients stage
      3-4.
