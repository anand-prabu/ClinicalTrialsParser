  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' mobile application-based community, termed Momba, will provide a
      bi-directional flow of information on maternal and infant mental health to traditionally
      underrepresented groups of mothers and their infants. The overall goal of this mobile
      application-based community of low-income postpartum women and infants is to increase the
      social support, social networks, and social capital of low-income mothers; thereby, leading
      to a positive change in the health behaviors, utilization of health services, and mental
      health status of both mothers and their infants.
