            "textblock": "Abatacept is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the Fc region of the Immunoglobulin\n      IgG1 fused to the extracellular domain human cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte Antigen 4 (CTLA-4)\n      modified to prevent antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement fixation.\n      Abatacept is a selective co-simulation modulator that inhibits the co-stimulation of\n      T-cells. Abatacept is currently approved for use in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and is useful\n      in symptom reduction and delaying the progression of structural damage.\n\n      RA is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease. With the introduction of biological\n      disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) (biologics), the options for the treatment of\n      RA have dramatically changed. Abatacept is currently the only biologic to be available in\n      both, a subcutaneous (SC) and intravenous (IV) formulation. The efficacy and safety profile\n      of IV-Abatacept has been well established in the last years and clinical trials comparing\n      SC-Abatacept with IV-Abatacept have clearly demonstrated an equal efficacy and safety\n      profile. Importantly, switching from IV- to SC-Abatacept appears to be associated with a\n      persisting good efficacy of Abatacept and no increase of adverse events (AE). On the other\n      hand, however, switching from SC- to IV-Abatacept has not been the subject of clinical\n      trials.\n\n      This Phase IV study is aimed at reviewing both the transition from weekly SC- to a single\n      IV-Abatacept but also the return to weekly SC treatments after a 4 week break. Holiday\n      seasons can present a major problem to RA patients treated with weekly subcutaneous\n      biologics, including SC-Abatacept. Therefore an evaluation into the use of IV-Abatacept\n      treatment to cover a 4 week break may present an acceptable treatment alternative for this\n      patient population."
