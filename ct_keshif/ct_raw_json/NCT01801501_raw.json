Informed consent is solicited to\n      patients before admission in study. If the patient cannot give it because of his/her\n      clinical condition, it will be solicited to a patient representative.\n\n      After admission in CCU and achievement of informed consent, a venous blood sample will be\n      obtained, to determinate plasmatic levels of Fibroblast Growth Factor 23 (FGF-23). New\n      samples will be obtained at 24 and 48 hours after admission. Determination of FGF-23 will be\n      performed by ELISA technique in Integrated Physiology laboratory.\n\n      Demographics, clinical and biochemical data will also be obtained. The data will be\n      collected by the Principal Investigator. Confidentially of all data will be preserved during\n      and after the completion of the study.\n\n      The study is divided in 2 parts:\n\n        1. - Evaluation of a sample of 14 patients to determinate the impact of FGF-23 to predict\n           presence and severity of Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), and to estimate sample size to\n           predict primary outcomes.\n\n        2. - Evaluation of a larger sample, to determinate the impact of FGF-23 to predict primary\n           outcomes.\n\n      Primary outcomes:\n\n        1. - Development of acute kidney injury\n\n        2. - Severity of AKI, determinate by AKIN classification\n\n        3. - In-hospital mortality\n\n      Secondary outcomes:\n\n        1. - Requirements of renal replacement therapy\n\n        2. - Requirements of mechanical ventilation\n\n        3. - Requirements of vasoactive drugs\n\n        4. - Duration of ICU stay and hospital stay\n\n      The protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of University of Chile Clinical Hospital.\n      The study is monitored by the Clinical Investigation Support Office (OAIC) of the hospital."
