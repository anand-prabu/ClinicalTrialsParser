        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Subjects and subjects' parent(s)/Legally Acceptable Representative(s) [LAR(s)] who,
             in the opinion of the investigator, can and will comply with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  A male or female between, and including, 11 and 25 years of age at the time of the
             first vaccination.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject/from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of the
             subject.

          -  Written informed assent obtained from the subjects when applicable according to local
             regulations.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy or ovariectomy.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for two months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccines

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will mean
             prednisone ≥ 10 mg/day, or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             in the period starting 30 days before the first dose of vaccine and ending 30 days

             non-investigational product.

          -  Previous vaccination with a meningococcal vaccine.

          -  History of meningococcal disease.

          -  Vaccination with a DTP-containing vaccine within the previous five years.

             vaccine.

          -  Seizures with or without fever within three days of a previous dose of DTP vaccine.

          -  Severe Arthus-type hypersensitivity reactions following a prior dose of tetanus
             toxoid (TT) within the previous ten years.

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination during the study period.

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine(s).

          -  Progressive neurologic disorder, uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures, including Guillain-Barré syndrome

          -  Bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia or thrombocytopenia, or subjects on
             anticoagulant therapy.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the first dose of study vaccine, or planned administration during the study
             period.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
             precautions.

          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrolment.

               -  Fever is defined as temperature ≥ 37.5°C /99.5°F for oral, axillary or tympanic
                  route.
