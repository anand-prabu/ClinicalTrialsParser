Exercise\n      will be verified (combination of on-site and HR monitor) and  EEEx will be measured at 3 mo.\n      intervals beginning at mo. 0 (the end of weight loss). In-person behaviorally based clinic\n      meetings will be conducted weekly during the 3 mo. weight loss period (-3 to 0 mos.) and\n      during the first 3 mos. of the weight regain prevention period. During the final 9 mos. of\n      weight regain prevention, clinics will be held bi-monthly using group conference calls.
