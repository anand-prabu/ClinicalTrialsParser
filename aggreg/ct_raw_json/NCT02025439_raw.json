            "textblock": "The R21 research objective is to examine the safety and efficacy of repetitive transcranial\n      magnetic stimulation (rTMS) combined with Amantadine (TMS + Amantadine)  relative to rTMS\n      Alone and Amantadine Alone for persons in chronic states of seriously impaired\n      consciousness.  The hypothesis is that provision of rTMS+Amantadine will provide a safe yet\n      synergistic effect that induces or accelerates functional recovery.  This hypothesis is\n      based on (a) preliminary data indicating partially improved neurobehavioral functioning\n      mechanistically related to rTMS-induced neural activity and connectivity as well as improved\n      integrity of white fiber tracts,  (b) relationship between dopamine (DA) and common\n      traumatic brain injury (TBI) impairments, (c) role of DA in mediating consciousness, (d) the\n      commonality between and DA and rTMS-targeted pathways, (e) clinical efficacy and safety of\n      Amantadine, (f) mechanisms of action of Amantadine, and (g) the association between rTMS and\n      Amantadine with up-regulating brain derived neurotrophic factor. The rationale is that\n      pairing rTMS with Amantadine will have a complementary and synergistic effect on factors\n      promoting conscious behavior. The specific aims are to: (1) Demonstrate that rTMS+Amantadine\n      is safely tolerated, (2) Determine neurobehavioral effect of rTMS+Amantadine, and (3)\n      Characterize pre-and post-treatment neural changes in neural activation. Aim 1 is based on\n      our preliminary safety data and safety data regarding Amantadine.  To address Aims 2 &  3 we\n      use a repeated measures baseline control design with randomized treatment orders yielding\n      three treatment groups; rTMS + Amantadine, rTMS Alone and Amantadine Alone.  Analyses for\n      Aims 2 and 3 involve comparing these treatment groups according to neurobehavioral growth\n      trajectories, mean amount of neural activation and connectivity within and between brain\n      regions, and indices of fiber tract directionality."
