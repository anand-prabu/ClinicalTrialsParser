  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study would like to determine if using negative pressure wound therapy with an
      instillation of .125% Dakins is more effective than using negative pressure wound therapy
      alone on biofilm removal, disruption and elimination in chronically infected lower extremity
      wounds.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is of 18 years or older.

          -  Males and females - provided they are not pregnant and if of reproductive age are
             using contraception.

          -  Patient with ulcers that:

               1. Have an ulcer area of at least 4 cm2 confirmed via counting squares on an wound
                  tracing

               2. Have been present for at least 4 weeks

               3. Are confirmed to have a colony forming unit per gram of wound tissue greater
                  than or equal to 10 to the 5th cfu

               4. Are full thicknesses through to dermal or subcutaneous tissue but not extending
                  to muscle or bone.

               5. The patient has an ABI of greater or equal to 0.8 and lower than 1.3 or has a
                  suitable Peripheral Vascular Resistance (PVR) and Doppler assessment which
                  confirms venous disease &amp; therefore treatment with Profore is deemed acceptable
                  by the clinician.

               6. The patient has one or more clinical signs of infection (edema, malodor,
                  local/periwound erythema, spontaneous pain between dressing changes, increased
                  exudate, discoloration of granulation tissue, increased temperature at wound,
                  non progression of wound, purulent exudate and friable granulation tissue)

               7. The patient is able to understand the evaluation and is willing to consent to
                  the evaluation.

               8. Patients with a suitable wound on a different limb to any other wounds
                  previously eligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients undergoing chemotherapy

          2. Patients being treated with immunosuppressive drugs or corticosteroids

          3. Patients with an autoimmune disease

          4. Patients who have participated in an experimental drug or device study within the
             last 15 days

          5. Patients that have been entered in this evaluation previously as an evaluable
             patient.
