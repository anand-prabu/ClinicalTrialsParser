A secondary aim is to examine\n      the effects on insulin sensitivity, adipokines, and RNA molecules.\n\n      The risks associated with this study are minimal compared to the potential benefits.\n      Knowledge about the effects of sleeping with dim light on inflammation in patients with OSA\n      is important and would guide future recommendations about proper sleep hygiene. This\n      research may also guide future recommendations about light conditions in other environments\n      such as hospital bedrooms."
