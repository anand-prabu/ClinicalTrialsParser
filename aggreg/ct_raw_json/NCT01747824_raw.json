We hypothesize that the serum catecholamines and markers of metabolic acidosis\n      will worsen with the duration and severity of agitation among agitated patients and will not\n      worsen among patients with severe pain who are not agitated.\n\n      Specific Aims\n\n        -  To assess the prevalence of patients undergoing treatment for agitation from any cause\n           requiring restraint or sedation.\n\n        -  To assess the prevalence of excited delirium in the emergency department.\n\n        -  To determine the difference in serum total catecholamines, serum dopamine, serum\n           epinephrine, serum norepinephrine, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, mean arterial\n           pressure, mortality, and disposition among patients with agitation requiring restraint,\n           including excited delirium and patients with severe pain from extremity fractures.\n\n        -  To describe changes in stress biomarkers among patients with changing levels of\n           agitation as determined by the Altered Mental Status scale."

This information will help clarify the levels of stress associated\n      with arrest and restraint conditions, allowing us to determine what aspects and levels of\n      stress may be associated with the fatal mechanisms of UICD, and to identify markers that\n      would inform death investigators of the mechanism of UICD. At the conclusion of this\n      project, we will be able to report details explaining the relationship of the physiologic\n      and metabolic effects of stress from restraint in excited delirium to other peri-arrest\n      conditions and our previous work in simulated law enforcement encounters."
