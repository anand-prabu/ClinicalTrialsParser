            "textblock": "Aprepitant was approved in 2003. The drug works to lessen the amount of nausea and vomiting\n      that cancer patients experience after treatment. Aprepitant has been well-studied in adults,\n      but not in children. Data from adult studies has shown aprepitant to be safe. It has also\n      been shown to be effective in lessening the amount of nausea and vomiting that adult\n      patients experience. Because aprepitant has been shown to be safe and effective, the\n      investigators have been using it in pediatric patients at this hospital as standard of care.\n      The investigators will be surveying patients already receiving aprepitant for prevention of\n      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting to determine the amount of nausea and vomiting they\n      experience. The investigators will also be surveying these patients to determine what their\n      appetite is like and if they experience any disruptions in activities of daily living. The\n      investigators are also going to be assessing any side effects these patients experience from\n      receiving aprepitant."

Information will be collected\n      from all patients who meet the study\u00b4s inclusion criteria. Patients will be given a survey\n      to complete at baseline, on all days of chemotherapy, and for five days after the conclusion\n      of chemotherapy using the BARF Scale and a 4\u2014point Likert scale. The information collected\n      from the survey will include the incidence and severity of nausea and emesis, evaluation of\n      appetite, activities of daily living, and rescue medications used for acute CINV. The\n      specific chemotherapy regimen that each patient receives will be recorded. Any data\n      identifying the patient will be de\u2014identified after all pertinent data is collected.\n      Descriptive statistics will be used to analyze data."
