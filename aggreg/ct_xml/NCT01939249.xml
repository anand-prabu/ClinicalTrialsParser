  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BIOFLOW-IV is a prospective, international, multicenter, randomised controlled trial. The
      purpose of this trial is to compare the Biotronik Orsiro drug eluting stent system with the
      Xience Prime / Xience Xpedition (Xience)drug eluting stent system in de novo coronary
      lesions. The study is powered for non-inferiority with respect to Target Vessel
      Failure(TVF)at 12 months.

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must provide written informed consent

          -  The target reference vessel diameter (RVD) is ≥ 2.50 mm and ≤ 3.75 mm assessed either
             visually or by online QCA.

          -  Target lesion length is ≤ 26 mm (assessed either visual estimate or by online QCA)
             and can be covered by one study stent

          -  Single de novo lesion with ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% stenosis in up to 2 coronary arteries

        Main Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has evidence of myocardial infarction within 72 hours prior to the index
             procedure

          -  Planned intervention of non-target vessel(s) within 30 days after the index procedure

          -  Planned intervention of target vessel(s) after the index procedure

          -  Target lesion is located in the left main

          -  Target lesion is located in or supplied by an arterial or venous bypass graft

          -  Target lesion involves a side branch &gt; 2.0 mm in diameter by visual estimate or by
             online QCA

          -  Proximal or distal to the target lesion located stenosis that might require future
             revascularization or impede run off
