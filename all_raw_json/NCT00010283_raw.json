II. Determine the frequency of adverse events related to the\n      use of this drug in these patients. III. Assess the natural history and outcome of the\n      medical problem for which high-dose immunosuppressive therapy was a contraindication.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral beclomethasone 4 times daily for 28 days. Treatment may\n      repeat for an additional 28 days as needed. Patients are interviewed weekly to assess\n      treatment success and adverse events. Patients are followed at 1 and 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
