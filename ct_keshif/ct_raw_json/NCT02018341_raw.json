The remedy used for the proving will be\n      administered in a potency of 30C.  The remedy being used is a common homeopathic remedy\n      commercially available in the US, but the exact remedy is not disclosed to participants.The\n      purpose of the proving is twofold: 1) to determine if there is a difference in symptoms\n      between those receiving an active versus placebo medicine, and 2) to see if there is a\n      difference in gene expression between those who receive the homeopathic remedy or placebo.\n      It is hypothesized that participants receiving the active medication will have more symptoms\n      characteristic of the remedy and have specific patterns of gene expression in whole blood\n      that are different from those in placebo recipients.  Participants will record symptoms in a\n      diary for 3 days prior to administration of study medications, during 3 day of its\n      administration and for 3 days following completion of the study medication.  Blood will be\n      drawn for gene expression studies on the day that the study medication is started and again\n      after taking the study medication for approximately 48 hours.  An additional, optional blood\n      draw for possible future analysis of gene expression will be done at the end of the study\n      period."
