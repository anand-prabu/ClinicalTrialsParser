These patients have no current\n      therapeutic alternatives beyond the procedure used to open, or revascularize, their\n      superficial femoral and/or popliteal arteries. Metal stents have the potential to fracture\n      when implanted in this artery segment due to continual flexion and bending of the knee. It\n      is desirable to improve the patency of this artery after percutaneous transluminal\n      angioplasty (PTA) and/or atherectomy-based revascularization."
