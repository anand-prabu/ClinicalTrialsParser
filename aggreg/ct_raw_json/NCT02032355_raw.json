Up to now, preventing hypotension has\n      continued to focus on arterial blood pressure variables, fluid, and ephedrine requirements\n      as markers of cardiovascular status, because these are more easily measured.\n\n      Investgators hypothesized that CO and PetCO2, in parturients with the degree of hypotension\n      during spinal anaesthesia, would also have a positive and significant association."
