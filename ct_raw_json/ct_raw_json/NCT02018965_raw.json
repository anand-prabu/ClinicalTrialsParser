However, some participants taking\n      anti-HIV drugs do not achieve an adequate CD4 recovery and remain at risk for developing\n      AIDS and non-AIDS-related complications.\n\n      ER niacin (PrNiaspanFCT\u00ae) is an extended-released form of niacin, also known as vitamin B3.\n      Niacin is effective in reducing cholesterol levels in the blood. This drug has been known\n      for a long-time to treat dyslipidemia and it is used to improve favourably all the\n      lipoprotein risk factors for artherosclerotic disease, particularly in HIV-infected\n      patients. Recent scientific research shows that regular consumption of niacin-rich foods may\n      also provide protection against Alzheimer's disease and age-related cognitive decline.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to find out:\n\n        1. If ER niacin combined with anti-HIV drugs, compared with anti-HIV drugs alone, could\n           reduce T cell immune activation and enhance CD4 recovery;\n\n        2. If ER niacin can improve your quality of life and your neurocognitive functions"
