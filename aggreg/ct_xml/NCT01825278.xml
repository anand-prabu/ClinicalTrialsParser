  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study proposes to evaluate the clinical applicability of the ExSpiron Respiratory
      Volume Monitor (RVM, ExSpiron™, Respiratory Motion, Inc.; Waltham, MA) in obese surgical
      patients undergoing general anesthesia. Previous work has demonstrated the ability of the
      ExSpiron monitor to provide non-invasive, real-time, continuous measurements of respiratory
      parameters such as tidal volume (TV), minute ventilation (MV) and respiratory rate (RR)
      mostly in normal weight patients but those studies did not specifically look at obese
      subjects.  Respiratory depression, in the postoperative setting due to residual anesthetics
      and/or opioid administration, continues to be a significant cause of adverse outcomes. Obese
      patients are at increased risk for respiratory complications.  Currently, there is no
      objective measure of early respiratory indicators for developing respiratory compromise.
      Current respiratory assessment in non-intubated patients relies on oximetry data and
      subjective clinical assessment. Pulse oximetry has been extremely helpful in recognizing
      oxygen desaturations but it is a late indicator of respiratory decline. There is no current
      device capable of giving real time ventilatory information such as tidal volume and minute
      ventilation of a patient that is not mechanically ventilated.  The ExSpiron system utilizes
      an impedance based technology and proprietary algorithms (Respiratory Motion Inc.) to obtain
      these measurements. The study hypotheses are that the non-invasive, impedance-based RVM
      monitor will accurately reflect TV, RR and MV in obese surgical patients before induction of
      general anesthesia, during controlled ventilation and following extubation; that ExSpiron
      will accurately reflect the post-extubation respiratory status of the patient; and that
      apnea and hypopnea episodes in the recovery room as detected by the ExSpiron monitor are
      correlated with the individual risk for obstructive sleep apnea as determined by the
      STOP-Bang risk stratification.

    <description>Patient will have a monitoring strip applied to right chest in the pre op holding area, and respiratory data will be recorded to the monitor. These will be compared with data from a manual handheld spirometer via 5 recordings over a time period of 5 minutes.</description>

    <time_frame>1 - 3 hours in the recovery room</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patient will continue to be monitored for MV, TV and RR after surgery in the recovery room, until recovery from anesthesia up to 3 hours. Respiratory data will be recorded to the monitor. These will be compared with data from a manual handheld spirometer via 3 recordings over a time period of 3 minutes. The change in the respiratory values to preoperative baseline will also be compared</description>

    <description>Monitoring sensors will be applied to patient's right chest and the monitoring device will collect breathing parameters such as breathing rate and volumes before, during and after the procedure until patient is ready to leave the recovery room. At the beginning and at the end of the study investigator will perform a one-time measurement of patient's respiratory parameters using a standard handheld spirometer. This is a non-invasive device that is commonly used in clinical care not related to research.</description>
