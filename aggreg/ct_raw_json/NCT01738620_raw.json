The analysis of the\n      quality of life at six months follow-up showed that the total score and physical function\n      were better before surgery and symptoms-based scales indicated that the fatigue, dyspnoea\n      and diarrhea were worse six months after esophagectomy. The objective of this study is\n      therefore to assess the impact of esophageal resections for cancer on the quality of life of\n      patients and to improve it through simple interventions of post operative care.\n\n      The study is divided into two steps.\n\n      This is step 1.\n\n      Patients will be randomized into four groups receiving respectively: psychological\n      counseling for support plus appropriate measures to reduce sleep-wake rhythm disorders\n      during ICU stay; psychological counseling alone; appropriate measures to reduce sleep-wake\n      rhythm disorders during ICU stay alone; or standard care. The primary end point are the\n      items SL (sleep disorder) and QL2 of the QLQ C30, and the secondary end point is the score\n      of the PSQI."
