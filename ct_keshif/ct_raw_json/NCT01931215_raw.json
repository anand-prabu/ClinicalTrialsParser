Even if pain\n      reduction is sufficient with the technique of intrathecal morphine injection, side effects\n      such as nausea and pruritus are common.\n\n      Since several years, an alternative technique has been studied, the \"transversus abdominis\n      plane (TAP)\"-block. Here a local anesthetic is injected in the abdominal wall muscles, and\n      this has been shown to give a similar analgesic effect compared to intrathecal morphine,\n      with potentially less side effects.\n\n      With this study, we want to evaluate if the TAP-block yields indeed less side effects when\n      compared with intrathecal morphine.\n\n      The study will be a prospective study with the patients randomized to either a group with\n      intrathecal morphine or a group with TAP-block."
