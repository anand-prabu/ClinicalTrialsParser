Sheps Center for Health Services Research,\n      University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill, we propose to develop and evaluate a\n      low-cost, minimally obtrusive device that delivers individualized light therapy to adults\n      with early-awakening insomnia - the most common sleep disturbance in older adults, and a\n      significant problem because of its relationship to daytime sleepiness, use of potentially\n      hazardous sleep medication, and reduced quality of life. The proposed device will measure\n      light/dark exposure data over 24 hours, estimate optimum timing for light delivery, and\n      deliver an individualized light dosage while subjects are asleep. Light applied through\n      closed eyelids in the early part of the night will delay the dim light melatonin onset, a\n      marker of the circadian clock, and help those with early sleep onset to fall asleep later"
