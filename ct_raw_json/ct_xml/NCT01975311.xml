  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a lower back treatment would change the knee
      pain intensity and the level of functional activities as well as the muscle activities in
      people with anterior knee pain. The investigators hypothesized that the lower back treatment
      may change the hip and knee muscle activities as well as reduce the knee pain intensity and
      improve the functional activities in people with anterior knee pain.
