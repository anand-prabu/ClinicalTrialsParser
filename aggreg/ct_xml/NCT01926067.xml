      Aim of the study: To validate accelerometers for continuous monitoring of global cardiac
      function during weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) in cardiac surgery.

      Hypothesis:

      The following hypothesis will be tested: Accelerometer measures are clinical relevant
      indices of global left and right myocardial performance during weaning from cardiopulmonary
      bypass.

      Model:

      The performance of the accelerometer will be tested in a peroperative setting, during
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass. Accelerometer measures of ventricular systolic and
      diastolic function will be compared to corresponding measures and indices of ventricular
      functions by echocardiography and hemodynamic monitoring during a step wise controlled
      weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass, ensuring precise control of pre- and afterload.

    <description>Measures will be assessed at baseline before cardiopulmonary by pass, at different workloads during a stepwise weaning, and after the cannulas are removed. The accelerometer measurements will be compared to echocardiography and hemodynamics (stroke volume and cardiac output). Systolic global function will be assessed by comparing peak systolic velocity and displacement by the accelerometer and the corresponding findings in echocardiography. The accelerometer systolic measures will also be correlated to ejection fraction with echocardiography. Diastolic global function early inflow (E'), atrial inflow velocity (A') and E'/A' with accelerometers and echocardiography will be compared.</description>
