Growth hormone (GH) is the main hormone\n      regulating the growth from childhood to adulthood. Despite great progress in the field, with\n      the development of recombinant GH for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency (GHD),\n      there is still no reliable method for testing GHD. Physical exertion is one of the\n      significant physiologic stimuli for GH secretion, and it is reliable test for identification\n      of GHD. It is not in use in the clinics because of its complexity. Recently GH secretion\n      following short anaerobic exercise in young adults was tested and also demonstrated\n      significant growth hormone secretion\n\n      In contrast to adult children's exercise is characterized by an anaerobic nature. There is\n      no data about secretion of growth hormone in response to anaerobic exercise in children.\n\n      Purpose of the experiment:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the secretion of growth hormone in response to\n      anaerobic exercise (Wingate test) in children."
