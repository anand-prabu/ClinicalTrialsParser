There will be a 3-week washout period between the doses.\n\n      There will be a screening visit within 3 weeks prior to the first dose. During each\n      treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinic from the afternoon on the day\n      before drug administration (i.e., on Day -1) and remain at the clinic until the 48-hour\n      post-dose blood sample has been collected in the morning of Day 3. They will then return for\n      ambulatory visit in the morning of Day 4 (72-hour sample). A follow-up visit will take place\n      7-14 days after the last dose."
