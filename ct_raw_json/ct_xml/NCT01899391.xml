  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Right now it is not possible to predict which patients are going to react more to RT. Many
      things could affect patient's response to radiation. One of the factors is whether the
      person can repair damage to the genetic material (DNA/RNA) caused by the RT. There is some
      evidence that a certain protein called Gamma H2AX is involved in DNA damage and repair and
      this can be used to predict the sensitivity of individual patients. The investigators will
      be studying this protein: Gamma H2AX) in the blood samples of prostate cancer patients
      exposed to both computed tomography (CT) scan and RT treatment.  This will help us to
      understand why different individuals show differences in side effects following RT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Intermediate-risk prostate cancer patients (T1/T2N0M0 with either GS &lt; 7 and PSA
             between 10-20 ng/ml or GS 7 and PSA less than 20 ng/ml).

          -  Planned for radical RT to the prostate with IMRT planning (79Gy/39fractions or 60
             Gy/20 fractions).

          -  No contraindications to diagnostic CT scanning.

          -  Prostate volumes will be less than 80 cc to control the planning dose volume
             histogram (DVH) as much as possible in terms of rectal and bladder volumes.

          -  No known DNA repair disorders (e.g. family history of AT, BRCA1/2 or Li      Fraumeni
             syndrome) or contraindications to radical pelvic RT.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to provide informed consent.

          -  Patient having contraindications to diagnostic CT scan.

          -  Patients who have unobtainable data regarding previous therapy and their clinical
             outcome.

          -  Patients should not have any diagnostic X-rays or CAT scans 2 weeks prior to their
             enrollment into the study.
