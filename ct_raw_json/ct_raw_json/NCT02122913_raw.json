During the\n      escalation phase, LOXO-101 will be taken once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID). During the\n      expansion phase, the LOXO-101 dose selected from Phase 1a will be explored in 23 to 33\n      additional subjects per tumor type with an NTRK alteration.\n\n      The objectives of the dose escalation phase are to determine the safety, tolerability,\n      pharmacokinetic profile, and recommended phase 1b dose of orally administered LOXO-101. The\n      objectives of the expansion phase are to describe the preliminary anti-tumor activity of\n      LOXO-101 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and other solid tumor types\n      with NTRK alterations."
