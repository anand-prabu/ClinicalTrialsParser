One hundred eighty four term infants with a diagnosis of NAS requiring\n      pharmacotherapy will be studied. Infants born to mothers receiving adequate prenatal care\n      and maintained on opioid agonist medication during pregnancy will be eligible. Infants will\n      be randomized to receive either neonatal morphine solution or methadone in a double blind,\n      double dummy design. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants will require\n      significantly fewer days in the hospital compared to methadone treated infants. While the\n      primary outcome is the total length of initial hospital stay (LOS), total LOS related to\n      NAS, total duration of medical treatment for NAS, the need for a second drug to control\n      symptoms, and infant growth will also be evaluated as important secondary outcomes by\n      medication group assignment.\n\n      2. SPECIFIC AIM II: To evaluate the effects of NAS treatment on long-term neurodevelopmental\n      outcome. Infants in both treatment groups will be evaluated at 18 months of age using the\n      Bayley III Scales of Infant Development. It is hypothesized that morphine treated infants\n      will have better neurodevelopmental outcomes at 18 months compared to methadone treated\n      infants. It is also hypothesized that neurobehavioral abnormalities (from either treatment\n      group) identified at two weeks of age using the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS)\n      will correlate with neurodevelopmental impairment detected with the Bayley III. Early\n      identification of infants at highest risk for impaired development will facilitate\n      therapeutic interventions to improve outcome and decrease resource utilization.\n\n      3: SPECIFIC AIM III: To determine if single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes\n      controlling opioid pharmacodynamics contribute to the severity of NAS. SNP genotyping from\n      cord blood or buccal swabs will be obtained from all infants and correlated with short term\n      outcomes (Aim 1) and neurodevelopment assessments (Aim 2) to confirm that genetic variation\n      plays a major role in the severity and outcome of infants with NAS."
