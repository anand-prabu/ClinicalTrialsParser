  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plantar heel pain (PHP) is one of the most common foot conditions in podiatry and physical
      therapy practice and often is associated with chronic symptoms, and disability. Persistence
      of symptoms adds to the economic burden of PHP and cost-effective solutions are needed to
      reduce this burden. Currently, there is wide variation in treatment, cost, and outcomes of
      care for PHP. Two practice guidelines are available to direct management patterns, but the
      guidelines and recent evidence of PHP interventions are unclear about the timing and
      influence of physical therapy in the multidisciplinary management of PHP. The purpose of
      this investigation is to compare the outcomes and costs associated with early physical
      therapy (ePT) following initial presentation to podiatry versus usual podiatric care (uPOD)
      in individuals with PHP. It is hypothesized that there will be greater improvement and/or
      reduced costs associated with either ePT or uPOD. In this study, 112 individuals with PHP
      will be randomized to receive uPOD or ePT after an initial visit with a podiatrist.
      Treatment provided in the uPOD group will reflect usual management patterns and intervention
      will be determined by the podiatrist. Treatment provided in the ePT group will be determined
      by the physical therapist and will focus on impairment-based manual therapy and exercise to
      the lower half of the body. In addition, evidence-based pain modulating modalities will be
      integrated into ePT treatment. Comparisons will be made between groups in the Foot and Ankle
      Ability measure, the European Quality of Life, Numeric Pain Rating Scale, Global Rating of
      Change (GROC), and cost of treatment at 6, 26, and 52, weeks. The association between
      successful outcome based on GROC score and patient expectation of physical therapy or
      podiatry, and general expectations of symptom improvement will be analyzed. The results of
      this investigation will help to determine the impact of ePT to inform practice, update
      existing guidelines to reduce practice variation, and identify the most cost effective
      treatment for patients with PHP.

    <description>Individuals in the early physical therapy group will receive physical therapy in accordance with the American Physical Therapy Association plantar heel pain practice guidelines and recent evidence in support of manual therapy intervention. Treatment provided will be based on identified impairments and may include manual therapy (joint and soft tissue mobilization/thrust manipulation to the lower half of the body), lower leg and plantar foot specific stretching/self mobilization, foot and lower leg muscle performance training, night splints, taping, over the counter orthotics/heel cup/heel cushion, and iontophoresis. Specific intervention will be selected at the discretion of the treating physical therapist.</description>

    <description>Individuals in the usual podiatric care group will receive care typical of podiatry management of plantar heel pain. According to practice guidelines, the first 6 weeks of treatment includes foot taping/padding, home stretching exercises, over the counter arch support/heel cup, shoe recommendations, oral antiinflammatories, and corticosteroid injection. The next 6 months of treatment may include corticosteroid injection, custom orthotics, night splint, immobilization, and physical therapy. If the patient is not responsive after 6 months of treatment, extracorporal shock wave therapy or a fasciotomy surgery is recommended per the guideline. In addition to treatment indicated above, the podiatrist may order radiographs or ultrasound imaging within their scope of practice. Specific intervention and treatment frequency/duration will be selected at the discretion of the treating podiatrist.</description>
