Treatment repeats\n      every 21 days for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients achieving complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 months."
