This study aims to pilot the website to find\n      out whether it is effective and to learn what the investigators can improve.\n\n      Participants in the study will be assigned to one of two conditions:\n\n        1. Standard in-person genetic counselling session to learn about inheritance of Ashkenazi\n           Jewish genetic conditions and genetic testing. Participants will fill out two short\n           questionnaires, one before and one after the genetic counselling session. They will\n           then be given a requisition form to undergo blood draw for genetic testing at the\n           Montreal General Hospital test centre.\n\n        2. Use of a web-based pre-test genetic counselling tool to learn about inheritance of\n           Ashkenazi Jewish genetic conditions and genetic testing.  They will fill out two short\n           questionnaires, one before, and one after using the web-based tool.  They will then be\n           electronically sent a requisition form to undergo blood draw for genetic testing at the\n           Montreal General Hospital test centre.\n\n      In both conditions, genetic test results will be communicated by telephone once they are\n      available. Participants' genetic test results will not be used in any way for the study."
