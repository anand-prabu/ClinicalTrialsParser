In addition, Investigators will be\n      using modeling studies to look at whether or not this kind of HIV treatment can decrease the\n      risk that a man will infect a person he has sex with and to find out how failure to take\n      medications will impact spreading the virus to other people.\n\n      In this study, one group will be randomized (like a coin toss) to start ART immediately\n      (just at the time of the enrollment visit) and the other group will wait until week 24 of\n      the study to start ART. Both groups will be followed for a total of 48 weeks and will\n      continue to receive ART from local sources after the study is over."

HIV testing will\n      be conducted for several thousand MSM and transgender women from study opening until July\n      2015.  In Step 2, high risk HIV-1 uninfected MSM and transgender women with high risk for\n      acquiring HIV will be tested at regular intervals for incident HIV-1 (using tests for HIV\n      p24 and/or HIV RNA).  (During this period, men will receive standard HIV prevention\n      interventions.) In Step 3, individuals with acute or recent HIV-1 infection will be enrolled\n      in a 48-week randomized, open-label study of the effects of immediate vs. deferred ART on\n      the decay dynamics of HIV viral load in plasma, semen and rectal secretions. (ART will be\n      provided prior to 24 weeks for any participant in the deferred ART arm who meets initiation\n      criteria.)  All participants will be followed for 48 weeks after which they will continue\n      ART from other sources."
