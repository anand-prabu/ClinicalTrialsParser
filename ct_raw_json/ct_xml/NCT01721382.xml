  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will be conducted in adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) without diabetes
      but with abnormal glucose tolerance, and will assess the effects of sitagliptin on glucose
      regulation. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT),
      will be performed at baseline and again ~4 weeks after treatment with study drug.  We will
      also look at blood sugars throughout the day using a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) before
      each time the MMTT/OGTT are performed. Several hormones that may affect the way the body
      regulates blood sugars will be measured in blood when the OGTT and MMTT are done. We will
      assess the effect this medicine has on blood sugars (using CGM) and the effect the medicine
      has on the hormones measured during the OGTT and MMTT.
