Several recent studies have\n      demonstrated these precautions may be safely abandoned with no increased risk of dislocation\n      when the surgery is carried through an anterior/lateral approach.  Previous work has failed\n      to address the issue of patient satisfaction and functional performance when patients are\n      managed with an unrestricted rehabilitation protocol post-operatively.  We propose a\n      prospective, randomized clinical trial to determine whether an unrestricted postoperative\n      rehabilitation protocol has an impact on patient satisfaction and functional performance\n      following primary total hip arthroplasty."
