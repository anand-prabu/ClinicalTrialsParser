    <textblock>
      The American Society of Plastic Surgeons (ASPS) 2011 report states that the market for
      cosmetic procedures has shown significant growth over the past two years, with 13.8 million
      cosmetic plastic surgery procedures performed in the United States in 2011, up 5% since
      2010. While surgical cosmetic procedures did increase significantly from 2010 to 2011, the
      overall growth in cosmetic procedures is being primarily driven by a substantial rise in
      minimally-invasive procedures. Cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures increased 6%, with
      nearly 12.2 million cosmetic minimally-invasive procedures having been performed in 2011.
      This highlights the growing consumer demand for non- or minimally-invasive cosmetic
      procedures that do not involve surgical procedures such as liposuction and the associated
      risks, potential complications and lengthy and painful recovery processes.

      Low level laser light therapy, such as that to be provided through application of the
      Erchonia® Obesity Laser in this clinical study protocol, offers a simple, non-invasive,
      safe, effective and side-effect free alternative to achieving body circumference reduction.

      Justification for this assertion of anticipated safety and effectiveness of the application
      of the Erchonia® Obesity Laser for the reduction of body circumference is found through
      three FDA clearances for Erchonia® Low Level Laser devices for body circumference reduction
      indications, as follows:

      K123237 (532 nm green light diodes): Erchonia® Zerona™ 2.0 Laser: is indicated for use as a
      non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals intending to
      undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of hips, waist, and
      thighs.

      K121695 &amp; K082609 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® ML Scanner (MLS) &amp; Erchonia® Zerona:
      is indicated for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for
      individuals intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference
      of hips, waist, and thighs.

      K121690 &amp; K120257 (635 nm red light diodes): Erchonia® MLS, Zerona, Zerona-AD: is indicated
      for use as a non-invasive dermatological aesthetic treatment as an adjunct for individuals
      intending to undergo liposuction procedures for the reduction of circumference of the upper
      arms.

      Therefore, Erchonia low level lasers have been determined safe and effective by the FDA for
      application for body circumference reduction indications for multiple body areas, such that
      evaluation of application of the Erchonia Obesity Laser to reducing body circumference in
      more overweight individuals is a natural extension of its proven and accepted application
      for body circumference reduction purposes.

    <description>Change in combined circumference measurement is calculated as the difference in circumference measurements from baseline to endpoint (4 weeks). A negative (-) change indicates a decrease in circumference and is positive for study success. A positive (+) change indicates an increase in circumference and is negative for study success.
Individual subject success is defined as a change of -3.0 or greater in combined circumference measurement across the evaluation period. Overall study success is defined as a difference in the proportion of subjects who demonstrate a change   of at least -3.0 inches in combined circumference between treatment groups.</description>
