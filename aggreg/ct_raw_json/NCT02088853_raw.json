When the gut mucosa is exposed to dietary changes it adjusts its functional\n      behaviour. For example, a fatty diet demands certain digestive mechanisms, whereas others\n      are needed to take care of a carbohydrate rich diet. Such dietary induced changes in\n      appearance and functionality of the small intestinal mucosa have been described in animals\n      but only little is known about it in man. The present project aims at elucidating in man if\n      a 2 weeks diet dominated by either fat or carbohydrates, but with similar energy content, is\n      associated with changes in the small intestinal mucosal appearance and metabolic signalling\n      capacity."
