    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different durations of treatment with MK-5172 in combination
      with ribavirin (RBV) in treatment-naïve non-cirrhotic interferon-eligible interleukin 28b CC
      (IL28B CC) genotype participants with genotype 1 (GT1)-positive chronic hepatitis C (CHC).
      Participants will be randomized to receive 12 or 24 weeks of combination therapy.
