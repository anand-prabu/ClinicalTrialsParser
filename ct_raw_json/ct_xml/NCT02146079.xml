    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the pharmacokinetics
      (the exposure of the trial drug in the body), pharmacodynamics (the effect of the
      investigated drug on the body), and the safety and tolerability of semaglutide in healthy
      male Japanese and Caucasian subjects.

    <description>Subjects will be randomised to receive either semaglutide 0.5 mg, semaglutide 0.5 mg placebo, semaglutide 1.0 mg or semaglutide 1.0 mg placebo within each group. Treatment with active drug or placebo blinded within each dose level. After randomisation, the subjects will follow a fixed dose escalation. The maintenance dose of 0.5 mg will be reached after 4 weeks of 0.25 mg. The maintenance dose of 1.0 mg will be reached after 8 weeks (4 weeks) of 0.25 mg and 4 weeks of 0.5 mg). Once-weekly subcutaneous (s.c., under the skin) administration. Trial duration per subject is 18 to 21 weeks depending on the individual subject's schedule</description>
