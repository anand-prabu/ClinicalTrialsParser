  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the research is to develop new methods for studying the link
      between diet, health and disease.

      A cohort of moderately overweight men and women will receive a healthy diet with a 20%
      energy restriction for a 12 week period. This intervention will improve the volunteer's body
      composition and reduce their risk of developing diabetes.

      Extensive tests will be conducted before and after the dietary intervention using emerging
      technologies with current state-of-the-art methods. These tests will monitor the numerous
      physiological adaptations that have occurred on a gene, cell, organ and organismic level.

      The study will, therefore, aim for a scientific breakthrough by developing a series of novel
      biological &quot;markers&quot; that can accurately determine an individual's health status.
