  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cell-free hemoglobin can be measured in the plasma of patients with sickle cell anemia,
      hemodialysis, after red blood cell transfusion, and in patients with sepsis.  Cell-free
      hemoglobin in these patient population has been associated with poor outcomes, including an
      association with an increased risk of death.  Acetaminophen may have a protective effect in
      these patient populations by inhibiting hemoprotein-mediated lipid peroxidation.  The
      purpose of the present trial is to study the effect of acetaminophen on lipid peroxidation
      in adults with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin.

      The primary hypothesis is that systemic markers of oxidative stress and lipid peroxidation,
      as measured by F2-isoprostanes, will be significantly lower in patients with severe sepsis
      and detectable cell-free hemoglobin who receive acetaminophen compared to placebo. The
      secondary hypothesis is that patients with severe sepsis and detectable cell-free hemoglobin
      treated with acetaminophen will have better clinical outcomes, including decreased incidence
      of acute kidney injury and lower rates of hospital mortality, compared to those who receive
      placebo.
