  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Recent observational studies have reported possible arrhythmogenic effects with
      long-acting beta-agonists (LABA), while the long-acting anticholinergic tiotropium has been
      associated with cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events. Finally, pneumonia was the object
      of a recent signal in trials of LABAs submitted for marketing approval.

      Aim: To assess the potential cardio-pulmonary risk arising from the concurrent use of two
      long-acting bronchodilators as well as from monotherapy use of each of the long-acting
      bronchodilators.

      Methods: A series of population-based cohort studies, using both cohort and nested
      case-control analyses will be conducted using data from the United Kingdom's Clinical
      Practice Research Datalink (CPRD). The base cohort will consist of new users of long-acting
      bronchodilators from Jan 2002 until Aug 2012, age &gt;= 55 with chronic obstructive pulmonary
      disease (COPD) and at least two years of baseline medical history information. The
      high-dimensional propensity score technique will be used to match new users of each
      long-acting bronchodilator and new users of two bronchodilators with comparable subjects
      from the base cohort, with one-year follow-up for outcomes of acute myocardial infarction,
      stroke, heart failure, arrhythmia and community acquired pneumonia. Data will be analysed
      using time-dependent Cox proportional hazard regression models and conditional logistic
      regression models.
