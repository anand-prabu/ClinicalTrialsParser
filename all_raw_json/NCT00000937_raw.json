            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to see how well antibiotics work in reducing chronic fatigue\n      symptoms, such as tiredness, in patients that were treated for Lyme Disease. Fatigue is a\n      common symptom of Lyme Disease.   When fatigue does not improve after treatment, patients\n      are considered to have Post Lyme Syndrome (PLS).  The chronic fatigue seen in these patients\n      appears to be related to the initial infection which causes Lyme Disease.  It is believed,\n      but not proven, that treatment with antibiotics may be effective in relieving chronic\n      fatigue in PLS patients."

A home health care nurse will visit you twice a week to check the injection site, and\n      at weeks 1 and 3 the nurse will draw blood for laboratory tests.  At months 1 and 6, you\n      will be examined to see if you have fewer chronic fatigue symptoms after the antibiotics.\n      This will include a fatigue questionnaire, a test of your mental processing speed, and a\n      test of your cerebrospinal fluid."
