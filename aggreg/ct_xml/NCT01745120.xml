    <textblock>
      This is a non randomized, open label, multi-site, single-dose, Phase 1/2 study in up to 15
      adults with beta-thalassemia major. The study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using LentiGlobin® BB305 Drug
      Product [autologous CD34+ hematopoietic stem cells transduced with LentiGlobin® BB305
      Lentiviral Vector encoding the human β-A(T87Q)-globin gene].

      Subject participation for this study will be 2 years. Subjects who enroll in this study will
      be asked to participate in a subsequent long-term follow up study that will monitor the
      safety and efficacy of the treatment they receive for up to 13 years post-transplant.

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adult subjects between 18 and 35 years of age, inclusive, at the time of consent, and
             able to provide written consent.

          -  Diagnosis of β-thalassemia major and a history of at least 100 mL/kg/year of pRBCs or
             ≥8 transfusions of pRBCs per year for the prior 2 years.

          -  Eligible for allogeneic bone marrow transplant.

          -  Treated and followed for at least the past 2 years in a specialized center that
             maintained detailed medical records, including transfusion history.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Positive for presence of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 (HIV 1 and HIV 2).

          -  A white blood cell (WBC) count &lt;3 × 109/L, and / or platelet count &lt;100 × 109/L if
             not due to hypersplenism.

          -  Uncorrected bleeding disorder.

          -  Any prior or current malignancy or myeloproliferative or immunodeficiency disorder.

          -  Immediate family member with a known or suspected Familial Cancer Syndrome (including
             but not limited to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome, hereditary
             non-polyposis colorectal cancer syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis).

          -  Receipt of an allogeneic transplant.

          -  Advanced liver disease, including persistent aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine
             transaminase (ALT), or total bilirubin value &gt;3 × the upper limit of normal, liver
             biopsy demonstrating cirrhosis, extensive bridging fibrosis, or active hepatitis.
