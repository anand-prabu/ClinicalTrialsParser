Phase I will test the safety and toxicity in a small group of patients\n      (n=6). After at least four vaccinations of three patients, the safety and toxicity data will\n      be presented to the Data safety monitoring board (DSMB). Only after the DSMB has no\n      objectives against the continuation of the trial, further patients will be included into the\n      trial. Again, after three more patients, receiving a minimum of four vaccines, clinical data\n      will be presented to the DSMB, and phase I will be terminated. The decision for continuation\n      of the trial will be done by the DSMB. If there are no objectives by the DSMB, the trial\n      will continue and evaluation will be started in a larger group of patients (n=14). During\n      the phase II trial, safety and toxicity will be evaluated in a larger co-hort of patients).\n      Besides, preliminary assessment of efficacy will be performed including induction of\n      immunological responses to leukemia associated antigens as well as to a viral antigen (CMV),\n      MRD control, time to progression of disease and ECOG performance status."
