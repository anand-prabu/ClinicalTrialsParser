            "textblock": "Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) represents the only viable cure\n      for children who suffer from a wide variety of rare, serious non-malignant diseases, such as\n      Fanconi Anemia, Hurler syndrome, and hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.  A major obstacle\n      to the success of HSCT is morbidity and mortality from graft versus host disease (GVHD),\n      driven by donor T cells recognizing and reacting against disparate host antigens. This trial\n      is being conducted as a step toward testing the long-term hypothesis that the costimulation\n      blockade agent abatacept can be added to a standard post-transplant GVHD prophylaxis\n      regimen, cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil, to improve disease-free survival after\n      unrelated hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) using low dose total body\n      irradiation based conditioning for children with non-malignant diseases. This study will\n      have the following Specific Aims.\n\n      Specific Aim #1: To conduct a randomized, open-label multicenter pilot, assessing the\n      tolerability of two dose numbers of abatacept (n=20).  Patients will be randomly assigned to\n      receive four doses (arm A;10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14 and +28), a schedule well\n      tolerated by adolescents and adults with hematologic malignancies in a previous pilot, or\n      six doses (arm B;10 mg/kg IV on days -1, +5, +14, +28, +56 and +84).  Abatacept will be\n      combined with cyclosporine and mycophenolate mofetil.\n\n      Specific Aim #2: to compare the immunological effects of four and six doses."
