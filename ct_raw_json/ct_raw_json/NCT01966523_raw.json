We hypothesize that 1. In the intervention\n      compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards a greater proportion of\n      infections for which antimicrobials were initiated appropriately, and 2. in the intervention\n      compared to the control facilities there will be a trend towards higher proxy satisfaction\n      with decision-making, fewer hospital transfers, and lower antimicrobial exposure."
