If the subject is a female of childbearing potential, have a pregnancy test evaluated\n             as negative prior to surgery, per the site's standard of care\n\n          3. Have a nicotine test evaluated as negative prior to surgery and agree not to smoke\n             for the duration of the study\n\n          4. Be willing to undergo mastectomy with healthy, well-vascularized skin flaps\n             anticipated by the surgeon\n\n          5. Be eligible to enroll in one of the following three cohorts:\n\n               1. Subject had radiation therapy (XRT) prior to direct-to-implant (DTI)\n                  reconstruction, but will not have XRT following reconstruction;\n\n               2. Subject did not have XRT prior to DTI reconstruction and will not have XRT\n                  following reconstruction;\n\n               3. Subject did not have XRT prior to DTI reconstruction, but will have XRT\n                  following reconstruction.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        To be eligible for enrollment, the subject must not:\n\n          1. Have collagen-vascular, connective tissue, or bleeding disorders\n\n          2. Have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes, which is clinically known to\n             impact wound healing ability\n\n          3. Have an autoimmune disease, an immune deficiency, or is on immune-suppression drugs\n             for reasons other than current treatment for breast cancer\n\n          4. Have a BMI that is \u2265 32\n\n          5. Have a nicotine test evaluated as positive prior to surgery or unwilling to quit\n             smoking for the duration of the study\n\n          6. Currently have an alcohol/substance abuse problem or have had a relapse within 1 year\n             prior to screening visit\n\n          7. Be pregnant, lactating, or expecting to be within the next 24 months\n\n          8. Have concomitant unrelated condition of breast/chest wall/skin (e.g. significant\n             chest wall abnormalities including pectus excavatum or pectus carinatum)\n\n          9. Require the use of any additional implant for soft tissue support of the\n             contralateral non-study breast, except in bilateral breast reconstructions, where the\n             use of SERI\u00ae Surgical Scaffold is allowed\n\n         10. Have had a prior soft tissue support implant\n\n         11. If enrolled into the Pre-Radiated cohort, have had recent radiation (< 1 year) to the\n             breast/chest wall\n\n         12. If enrolled into the Post-Radiated cohort, radiation to the breast/chest wall is\n             planned more than 1 year from the time of SERI\u00ae Surgical Scaffold placement\n\n         13. Have clinical evidence of severe radiation tissue damage (e.g. pigmentation,\n             indentation, atrophy, no elasticity to skin of radiated breast) from previous XRT to\n             the breast/chest wall\n\n         14. Have large or multiple scars on the breast(s) that may interfere with blood supply to\n             the mastectomy flaps"
