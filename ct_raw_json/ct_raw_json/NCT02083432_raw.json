The effect of cognitive behavior therapy when performed by specially trained\n      dentists will be evaluated. Patients referred to the Centre for Odontophobia, and who meet\n      the inclusion criteria, will be allocated to an immediate treatment group (test group) and a\n      waiting list group (control group) of 30 subjects in each group. After treatment they will\n      be followed up during a 1-year period.\n\n      Hypotheses are formulated based on the literature and previous population and treatment\n      studies of similar designs among adults at the Centre for Odontophobia."
