The inhalation profiles will be\n      recorded from consenting women as they inhale with maximal effort through an inhalation\n      profile recorder [Glaxosmithkline (GSK), Ware]. The recorder will simulate resistance to\n      airflow and will be representative of a dry powder inhaler of moderate resistivity. The\n      inhalation endpoints will include Peak Pressure Drop, Peak Inspiratory Flow Rate, Inhaled\n      Volume, Inhalation time, Average Inhalation Flow Rate and Acceleration rate which will be\n      compared between the two female cohorts. Inhalation profiles recorded in this way may\n      subsequently be used to study the in-vitro performance of investigational materials across\n      inhalation parameters representative of the target patient population.\n\n      An appropriate number of subjects will be consented so that approximately 40 subjects (20\n      non-pregnant females and 20 stage three labour subjects) complete assessments. The\n      inhalation profiles will be recorded on the same day of screening or at another time within\n      a span of 50 days"
