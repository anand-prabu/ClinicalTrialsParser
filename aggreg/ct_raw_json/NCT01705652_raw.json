Tissue will be obtained for ancillary studies and (2) to  determine the number\n      of patients with a PSA decline to <1.0 ng/ml at 3 months in patients receiving Nexrutine\u00ae\n      with standard radiation therapy. The Secondary Objective is to confirm the tolerability of\n      this regimen. The Third Objective (Ancillary studies) is To evaluate the molecular response\n      of Nexrutine\u00ae. Molecular response is defined as changes in the molecular pathways."
