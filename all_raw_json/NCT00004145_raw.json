Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Sometimes the transplanted cells are rejected by the body's normal\n      tissues. Antithymocyte globulin may prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus biological therapy\n      followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic\n      cancer."

Determine the effect of nonmyeloablative chemotherapy followed by allogeneic\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on hematopoietic recovery in patients with\n      hematologic malignancies. II. Determine the toxicities of this regimen in these patients.\n      III. Determine the frequency of mixed hematopoietic chimerism in these patients after this\n      therapy. IV. Determine the efficacy and toxicity of donor leukocyte infusions at relapse in\n      these patients. V. Determine the response rates and survival of these patients after this\n      therapy. VI. Determine the immune reconstitution of patients undergoing this therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes on days -9 to -5, cyclophosphamide\n      IV over 1 hour on day -5, and antithymocyte globulin IV over 10 hours on days -5 to -2.\n      Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients who achieve complete\n      remission (CR) and then relapse or patients who achieve less than a CR before day 60 receive\n      donor leukocyte infusions (DLI) over 30 minutes. DLI are repeated as necessary for\n      persistent disease. Patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months, then at 1 and 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
