        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Primary Angle Closure (PAC) or Primary Angle Closure Glaucoma (PACG)
             with indication for Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI). PAC is defined by the presence
             of a partial or complete iridotrabecular contact(ITC) in more than 2 quadrants with
             either raised intraocular pressure (IOP) (ie. more than 21 mmHg) and/or PAS; however,
             with normal optic disc and visual field. PACG is defined by the presence of ITC with
             either raised IOP and/or PAS, and evidence of glaucomatous optic disc and visual
             field

          -  No IOP-lowering drug treatment or a 4-week wash-out period prior to Study Day 0

          -  Aged ≥18 years, of either sex

          -  Not more than 6 diopters spherical equivalent on the study eye

          -  Have given written informed consent, prior to any investigational procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of acute angle closure glaucoma on the study eye

          -  Secondary angle closure glaucoma on the study eye

          -  History of ocular surgery within the last 3 months on the study eye

          -  History of ocular laser treatment, including previous LPI on the study eye

          -  Corneal or conjunctival abnormality precluding contact lens adaptation on the study
             eye

          -  Severe dry eye syndrome on the study eye

          -  Patients with allergy to corneal anesthetic

          -  Patients with contraindications for silicone contact lens wear

          -  Patients not able to understand the character and individual consequences of the
             investigation
