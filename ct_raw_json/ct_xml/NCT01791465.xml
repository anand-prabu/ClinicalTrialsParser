  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will evaluate the effects of the anti-diabetic drug Bydureon (exenatide
      extended-release formulation) on blood sugar levels and serum markers of inflammation in a
      cohort of 12 HIV-infected adults on combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) with untreated
      diabetes mellitus. Previous studies have shown that high levels of persistent systemic
      inflammation predict the development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in
      HIV-infected persons on cART (a group at very high risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial
      infarction). Bydureon has demonstrated potent anti-inflammatory effects in prior studies of
      non-HIV infected persons, which suggests that this agent may represent a unique and
      preferred medication for the treatment of insulin resistance in HIV-infected adults. The
      Investigators hypothesize that short-term (16 weeks) therapy with Bydureon will improve
      glucose tolerance and significantly reduce circulating plasma levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6)
      and highly-sensitive C-reactive protein (hsCRP), two biomarkers strongly implicated in the
      development of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases in diabetic, HIV-infected, cART-treated
      adults.
