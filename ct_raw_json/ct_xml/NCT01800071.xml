  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is looking at a vaccine called MVA-EBNA1/LMP2. This is a new vaccine
      that has already been studied in small number of cancer patients.

      The vaccine is designed to boost a patient's immunity against a common virus. The virus is
      called Epstein Barr virus or EBV. EBV is sometimes found inside cancer cells and is commonly
      found in nasopharyngeal cancer cells.

    <textblock>
      The main aims of the clinical study are to find out more about how the immune system
      responds to the vaccine, more about the potential side effects of the vaccine and the
      effects of giving an additional booster vaccination on the immune system.

      Approximately 18 patients with EBV positive nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) will be recruited to
      the trial. Patients will receive up to four vaccinations with the MVA-EBNA1/LMP2 vaccine.
      The first three vaccines will be given at 3 weekly intervals, followed by a fourth vaccine
      12 weeks later. The vaccine will be given by intradermal injection with the dose divided
      across multiple injection sites on the arm, or on the thigh.

      Patients will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from first vaccination
      and attend hospital approximately 11 times during this period. Standard safety assessments
      will be performed throughout the trial and at each clinic visit patients will be asked to
      provide research blood samples. These samples will be used to monitor the effects of the
      vaccine on the patient's immune system.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically confirmed NPC in which the presence of EBV has been confirmed in the
             tumour by immunohistochemistry for viral antigens or EBV early RNA (EBER) fluorescent
             in situ hybridisation (FISH).

          2. Patients in remission or with current disease for whom no standard therapy is
             currently appropriate or required.

          3. Patients who have received primary treatment for their malignancy (radiotherapy ±
             chemotherapy) and up to one additional second-line course of therapy.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 6 months.

          5. World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0 or 1 (Appendix 1).

          6. Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These
             measurements must be performed within one week (Day -7 to Day 1) before the patient
             receives their first vaccination with MVA-EBNA1/LMP2.

             Laboratory Test                                       Value required Haemoglobin (Hb)
                                    ≥10.0 g/dL, Lymphocyte count                        ≥0.5 x

             vaccination.

          3. Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the Sponsor

             Patients with a documented history of allergy to gentamicin should be discussed with
             the Sponsor prior to trial entry.

          8. Previous splenectomy or splenic radiation, or with known splenic dysfunction.

          9. Receiving current immunosuppressive medication including systemic use of
             corticosteroids. Prophylactic use of inhaled steroids is permitted.

         10. Ability to become pregnant (or already pregnant or lactating). However, those female
             patients who have a negative serum or urine pregnancy test before enrolment and agree

             hormonal contraception and condom, have a intra-uterine device and condom, diaphragm
             with spermicidal gel and condom) during the trial and for six months afterwards are
             considered eligible.

         11. Male patients with partners of child-bearing potential (unless they agree to take
             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             [condom plus spermicide] during the trial and for six months afterwards). Men with
             pregnant or lactating partners should be advised to use barrier method contraception
             (for example, condom plus spermicidal gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or
             neonate.

             whilst taking part in this Phase Ib study of MVA-EBNA1/LMP2. Participation in an
