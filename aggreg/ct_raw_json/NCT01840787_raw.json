In addition, not\n      everyone has the same level of sensitivity of their eyes, making it difficult for these\n      judgments to be made. The purpose of this study is to explore the idea of using a\n      pre-determined \"expert panel\" of individuals who are able to tell differences between\n      contact lenses based on their comfort."

In addition, assessing comfort in clinical trials is complicated,\n      with full-masking behind hard to achieve and the psychology of the participant having\n      unknown impact on the results. While the development of a reliable system to assess comfort\n      would be beneficial for the research and development of new products, the use of a \"sensory\n      panel\" itself may also lead to a better understanding of the drivers of discomfort at the\n      end of the day.\n\n      The objective of the study is to explore the use of a sensory panel, defined as individuals\n      who have a good correlation between subjective and objective measures of discomfort, at\n      rating the comfort of various contact lenses.\n\n      The hypothesis is that in the \"discriminative\" group, the matrix of paired comparisons\n      (between lens dissimilarity) is related to the ranked comfort of the lenses, while for the\n      \"poorly discriminative\" group, the matrix of the dissimilarities will be random. An\n      additional hypothesis is that the \"discriminative\" group will be less random than the entire\n      group."
