      Background:

      - Vaccines create resistance to disease. This study tests experimental human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccines that use an adenovirus as a transporter. Transporters
      may help vaccines stimulate an immune response against HIV. This means the body works to
      fight infection. Researchers want to see if different ways of giving the vaccines cause
      different immune responses. They also want to see if the vaccines    adenovirus is
      contagious. Adenoviruses cause cold symptoms or mild eye infections.

      Participants cannot get HIV from these vaccines. But they can get the adenovirus, so their
      entire household and intimate contacts must participate.

      Objective:

      - To test the safety of experimental HIV vaccines.

      Eligibility:

      - Healthy adults 18   49 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and urine
           tests.

        -  Participants will receive the vaccine 3 times over 6 months. Each time, they will have
           a physical exam and blood and urine tests. Samples will be taken from their nose,
           rectum, and cervix.

        -  Some participants will receive the vaccine by swallowing 11 capsules with water. Clinic
           staff will observe them for 1 hour.

        -  Some participants will receive the vaccine swabbed in their throat. They will get dose
           1 at the hospital and stay there for 1 week. They will have medical tests and nose
           swabs. Doses 2 and 3 will not require a hospital stay.

        -  Participants will have 7 follow-up visits over 6 months, with a physical exam and blood
           tests. Samples will be taken from their nose, throat, and rectum.

        -  Household and intimate contacts will have 4 clinic visits over 8 months, with a
           physical exam and blood tests.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, single center, randomized, double-blind study designed to evaluate the
      safety and immunogenicity of live, replication-competent recombinant Adenovirus type 4-HIV
      vaccine regimens. The oral route will also contain a placebo control. The vaccine candidates
      Ad4-mgag and Ad4-EnvC150 will be formulated as enteric-coated capsules to be delivered
      orally, and as an aqueous formulation for tonsillar administration. Determining the optimal
      regimen and route will greatly accelerate investigations of these vectors as HIV vaccine
      platforms.

      Participants volunteering to receive the vaccine orally will be randomized to 1 of 4
      treatment arms, and those volunteering to receive the vaccine via the tonsillar route will
      be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Participants will receive either 1 or both vaccines
      or placebo, depending on group assignment. The study vaccines will be administrered to
      participants in 3 rounds of vaccination at 0, 2, and 6 months. Tonsillar vaccine recipients
      will receive the first vaccine in the NIH Special Clinical Studies Unit or other appropriate
      unit and be followed on an inpatient basis to allow for respiratory isolation. Beginning 4
      days after vaccination, participants will be tested daily for respiratory shedding of Ad4 by
      nasopharyngeal wash. They will be discharged to home with close monitoring on Day 7 or after
      2 consecutive negative washes, whichever comes first; they may remain on the unit longer if
      medically necessary. Tonsillar vaccine recipients receiving the second and third rounds of
      vaccine and oral capsule recipients will be vaccinated and discharged to home.

      In addition to clinical and laboratory monitoring of safety, the principal assessments will
      be shedding of the viruses in rectal, cervicovaginal, throat, and nasal swabs, and
      assessment of the antibody (mucosal and systemic) response to the HIV and to the Ad4 virus.

      The candidate vaccines will also be administered to 2 groups of participants who have
      previously received an unrelated HIV vaccine in another clinical study and/or are Ad4
      seropositive. The aim for these groups is to explore the boost potential of the enteric
      coated capsule and aqueous formulations of the Ad4-mgag and Ad4-EnvC150 vaccines when given
      to subjects who have previously received another HIV vaccine and/or are Ad4 seropositive.

      All participants will be followed for 6 months beyond the final vaccination, for a total of
      12 months. Household and intimate contacts will also be enrolled and monitored for
      Adenovirus and HIV antibodies over 8 months.
