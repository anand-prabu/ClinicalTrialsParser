            "textblock": "The treatment of retinal detachment complicated by PVR remains controversial.  Although some\n      cases are managed successfully by pars plana vitrectomy and with temporary tamponade\n      provided by intraocular gas, others eventually redetach with this technique.  Preliminary\n      reports indicate that prolonged tamponade with liquid silicone results in improved\n      anatomical success, but the eventual visual outcome may be prejudiced by silicone-related\n      complications, particularly glaucoma and keratopathy.  The addition of hydraulic\n      reattachment by simultaneous fluid/gas exchange to vitrectomy surgery has proved to be an\n      important development.  Although complications are few with these procedures, subsequent\n      redetachment is frequent.\n\n      The Silicone Study was a randomized trial to investigate the relative merits of silicone oil\n      or gas as tamponade modalities.  All study patients underwent vitrectomy and were randomized\n      intraoperatively either to silicone oil or to gas.  Two groups of eyes were entered into the\n      study:  eyes that had not had a prior vitrectomy (Group 1) and those that had undergone\n      previous vitrectomy outside the study  (Group 2).\n\n      A critical element in the study was a standardized surgical procedure for PVR.  This\n      surgical procedure, intended to relieve retinal traction with vitrectomy techniques, was\n      followed by assessment of the relief provided by an intraocular air tamponade.  The eye was\n      randomized to silicone oil or gas only after completion of the entire surgical procedure to\n      eliminate investigator bias that might develop through knowledge of the treatment modality.\n      Patients were examined 5 to 14 days following the randomization and again at 1, 3, 6, 12,\n      18, 24, and 36 months after that date.  Repeated surgery was permitted for either treatment\n      modality.  The Fundus Photograph Reading Center staff processed and analyzed photographs\n      taken at all the clinics, graded the preoperative severity of PVR on the basis of baseline\n      visit photographs, and confirmed the macular status at followup visits.\n\n      End points of the study were visual acuity of 5/200 or greater and macular reattachment for\n      6 months following the final surgical procedure.  The successful outcomes and complication\n      rates of the two modalities were compared."
