  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, sequential dose-escalation, and expansion study to
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of GS-5745 alone
      and in combination with chemotherapy.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of 2 parts (Parts A and B).  Participants can only qualify for and
      participate in 1 part.

      Part A is a sequential dose escalation to determine the maximum tolerated dose of GS-5745 in
      participants with advanced solid tumors that are refractory to or intolerant to standard
      therapy or for which no standard therapy exists.  In Part A, participants will receive
      GS-5745 only.  Part A will consist of 12-54 participants.

      Part B is a dose expansion to obtain additional safety and tolerability data with GS-5745 in
      participants with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, or esophagogastric
      carcinoma.  In Part B, participants will receive GS-5745 in combination with
      standard-of-care chemotherapy.  Part B will consist of approximately 50 participants.

               2. Absence of known epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation

               3. Absence of known translocation or inversion events involving the ALK gene locus
                  (resulting in EML4-ALK fusion)

          5. Part B Esophagogastric Adenocarcinoma:

               1. Histologically confirmed inoperable advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (including
                  adenocarcinoma of the gastrooesophageal junction) or relapsed gastric
                  adenocarcinoma

               2. Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative tumor (primary tumor or
                  metastatic lesion)

          6. All acute toxic effects of any prior antitumor therapy resolved to Grade ≤ 1 before
             the start of study drug dosing (with the exception of alopecia [Grade 1 or 2
             permitted] and neurotoxicity [Grade 1 or 2 permitted])

          7. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of ≤ 1

          8. Life expectancy of &gt; 3 months in the opinion of the Investigator

             A female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she has had a
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy; has medically
             documented ovarian failure (with serum estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone
             [FSH] levels within the institutional postmenopausal range and a negative serum or
             urine Beta-HCG), or is menopausal (age &gt; 55 years with amenorrhea for &gt; 6 months).

         12. For male subjects of childbearing potential having intercourse with females of
             childbearing potential, willingness to use a protocol-recommended method of
             contraception from the start of study drug, throughout the study treatment period,
             and for 90 days following the last dose of study drugs, and to refrain from sperm
             donation from the start of study drug, throughout the study treatment period, and for
             90 days following the last dose of study drugs. Note: A male subject is considered
             able to father a child unless he has had a bilateral vasectomy with documented
             aspermia or a bilateral orchiectomy, or has ongoing testicular suppression with a
             depot luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LH RH) agonist (eg, goserelin acetate

          2. Pregnant or lactating

          3. Subject with known central nervous system (CNS) metastases, unless metastases are

             Association Classification &gt; Class II), unstable angina, or serious uncontrolled
             cardiac arrhythmia within the last 6 months of study Day 1

          8. History of major surgery within 28 days prior to enrollment

          9. Serious systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection that is not controlled
             or requires IV antibiotics

             of hormone therapy for breast or prostate cancer is permitted
