Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known if mitoxantrone and prednisone are more effective with or without leflunomide\n      for treating prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II/III trial to compare the effectiveness of mitoxantrone and\n      prednisone with or without leflunomide in treating patients who have stage IV prostate\n      cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the percentage one year survival rate in hormone refractory prostate\n      cancer patients treated with leflunomide (SU101), mitoxantrone, and prednisone versus\n      mitoxantrone and prednisone alone. II. Compare the palliative pain response, time to\n      treatment failure, time to progression, median survival, investigator global response\n      assessment, objective response, time to palliative pain response, duration of palliation,\n      and effect on PSA between these two regimens. III. Assess the safety and tolerability of\n      mitoxantrone in combination with SU101 in these patients. IV. Assess the health related\n      quality of life of these patients on these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified by\n      performance status (70-80% vs 90-100%), baseline present pain intensity score (2.0 vs\n      greater than 2.0), and hemoglobin level (less than 12.0 g/dL vs at least 12.0 g/dL).\n      Patients enter one of two treatment arms: Arm I: Patients are premedicated with an IV 5-HT3\n      reuptake inhibitor (i.e., odansetron) then receive mitoxantrone IV on day 1. Twice daily\n      oral prednisone therapy begins on day 1 and continues throughout study treatment. Treatment\n      repeats every 21 days for 4 courses. Arm II: Patients are premedicated with an IV 5-HT3\n      reuptake inhibitor as in arm I. Patients receive mitoxantrone and prednisone therapy as in\n      arm I. Additionally, beginning on day 1 patients receive leflunomide (SU101) IV over 4-5\n      hours weekly for 12 weeks. The SU101 infusions shall precede mitoxantrone infusions.\n      Patients receive a maximum of one year therapy with SU101; mitoxantrone therapy may be\n      administered up to a maximum dose of 140/m2. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, day 8,\n      day 21, and then every 3 weeks thereafter until study completion. Patients are followed at\n      least every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 370 patients will be accrued for this study."
