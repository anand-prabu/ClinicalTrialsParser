Based on the surgical\n      simulation, the preliminary surgery plans were validated and optimized. Then, the titanium\n      plates and mesh were preshaped on the models. Finally, according to the final surgery plans\n      the operations were performed. The operation time, therapeutic effects and complications\n      were observed. The follow-up periods were 1-12 months."
