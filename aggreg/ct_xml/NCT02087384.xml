      This study evaluates vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil) versus placebo
      vaccination on prevention of high grade AIN recurrence in HIV-positive MSM (men who have sex
      with men) who were successfully treated for high grade AIN.

      Rationale:

      Since the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART), human immunodeficiency
      virus (HIV)-related morbidity and mortality have considerably decreased. However, as a
      result of the significantly prolonged life span, new causes of morbidity and mortality have
      become evident. In particular, anal cancer incidence has increased dramatically in
      HIV-positive men. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is causally linked to infections with
      high-risk papillomaviruses, and is preceded by precursor lesions: anal intraepithelial
      neoplasia (AIN). Over 90% of HIV-positive MSM have persisting anal HPV (human papilloma
      virus) infection, and high-grade (HG) AIN is present in 30% of all HIV+ MSM.

      As in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, early diagnosis and treatment of AIN have been
      advocated to prevent malignancy. Electrocoagulation/ cauterization is standard of care for
      intra-anal AIN, but after treatment, recurrence of lesions occurs in approximately 50% of
      cases. This is a major problem in an effective screening program for AIN.

      In a nonconcurrent, non-blinded cohort study qHPV (quadrivalent human papilloma virus)
      vaccination significantly (HR 0.50) reduced HG AIN recurrence among MSM successfully treated
      for AIN. This is in accordance with findings in women treated for cervical intraepithelial
      neoplasia. Previous vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine among women who had surgical
      treatment for HPV related disease significantly reduced the incidence of subsequent HPV
      related disease, including high grade disease.

      Therefore, a strategy that is worth investigating is vaccination with the qHPV vaccine to
      prevent recurrences in HIV+ MSM who were successfully treated for HG AIN.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of the current study is to assess the efficacy of qHPV vaccination in
      preventing recurrence of high-grade AIN in HIV+ MSM with CD4 counts &gt;350 x 10E6/l who were
      successfully treated for high-grade intra-anal AIN in the past year.

      Study population:

      HIV-positive MSM with a CD4 count &gt; 350 cells/ul and intra-anal high-grade AIN (grade 2-3)
      that was successfully treated in the past year with conventional cauterization, cryotherapy,
      or other forms of local treatment.

      Study design:

      A multicentre, randomised, double-blind clinical trial in four hospitals in the Netherlands.

      Intervention:

      Patients are randomised for vaccination with the quadrivalent HPV vaccine (Gardasil ®) or
      vaccination with a matching placebo at months 0, 2 and 6.

      Randomisation will be stratified for complete response versus partial response (from HG AIN
      to low-grade (LG) AIN) of the initial HG AIN lesion, for treatment less than 6 months ago
      versus treatment more than 6 months ago, and for AMC (Academic medical Center) versus other
      hospitals.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Screening for AIN will be performed by high-resolution anoscopy (HRA), at inclusion (first
      vaccination) and at last vaccination (6 months), and repeated at 6 and 12 months after the
      last vaccination. Safety Monitoring for spontaneous adverse events and injection-site
      reactions will be performed one week after each vaccination and thereafter every 6 months
      for a total of 12 months of follow-up.

      Primary end point will be the cumulative recurrence of HG AIN at 12 months after the last
      vaccination, as assessed by HRA (High-Resolution Anoscopy), with biopsies taken of suspect
      lesions.

      Secondary outcome measures are toxicity/ safety, recurrence of HG AIN at last vaccination
      and 6 months afterwards, cumulative occurrence of LG AIN at  12 months after the last
      vaccination, cumulative occurrence of anogenital warts at 12 months after the last
      vaccination, causative HPV type in recurrent AIN lesions, as assessed by LCM (Laser Capture
      Microdissection)/ PCR (Polymerase Chain Reaction), and HPV type-specific antibody response.
