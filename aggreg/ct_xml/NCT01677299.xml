      This study will evaluate how EFB0027 and EFB0026 behave in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

      In addition, this study will compare the effects of EFB0027 and EFB0026 on circulating
      concentrations of glucose and gastrointestinal hormones in subjects with type 2 diabetes
      mellitus.

                  Visit 1) of metformin alone, or iii. A stable regimen (minimum of 2 months at
                  Visit 1) of DPP-4 inhibitor alone, OR

               -  HbA1c between 6.0 to 8.5% (inclusive) for subjects managing their diabetes with
                  a stable (minimum of 2 months at Visit 1) combination regimen of metformin and
                  DPP-4 inhibitors.

          3. Has serum creatinine below the upper limit of normal at Visit 1 and an estimated
             creatinine clearance above 80 using the Crockroft and Gault equation  (CrCl = [(140 -
             age) x body weight in kg] / (serum creatinine x 72) x (0.85 for females) [ref. 3].

          4. Has a body mass index (BMI) of 25.0 to 40.0 kg/m2 (inclusive) at Screening.

          5. Is male, or is female and meets all of the following criteria:

               -  Not breastfeeding

               -  Negative pregnancy test result (human chorionic gonadotropin, beta subunit) at
                  Visit 1 (Screening) (not applicable to hysterectomized females)

               -  Surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or if of childbearing potential, must
                  practice and be willing to continue to practice appropriate birth control during
                  the entire duration of the study

          6. Has a physical examination with no clinically significant abnormalities as judged by
             the investigator.

          7. Ability to understand and willingness to adhere to protocol requirements.

          8. If on chronic thyroid pharmacologic therapy, the dose must be stable for at least 3
             months prior to Visit 1 (Screening), and must have thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)
             test result in normal range at Visit 1 (Screening).

             participation and/or personal well-being, as judged by the investigator, including

          4. Has had major surgery of any kind within 6 months of Visit 1 (Screening).

          5. Has received a blood transfusion within 6 months of Visit 1 (Screening).

          6. Has a history of &gt;5 kg weight change within 3 months of Visit 1 (Screening).

             abnormalities other than those expected in subjects with diabetes and judged by the
             investigator to be clinically significant at Visit 1 (Screening).

          8. Has physical, psychological, or historical finding that, in the investigator's
             opinion, would make the subject unsuitable for the study.

          9. Currently abuses drugs or alcohol or has a history of abuse that in the
             investigator's opinion would cause the individual to be noncompliant with study
             procedures.

             months of Visit 1 (Screening).

         13. Has known intolerance to metformin.

         14. Has received any investigational drug within 1 month (or five half-lives of the
             investigational drug, whichever is greater) of Visit 1 (Screening).

         15. Has known allergies or hypersensitivity to any component of study treatment.

         16. Is employed by Elcelyx Therapeutics, Inc (that is an employee, temporary contract
