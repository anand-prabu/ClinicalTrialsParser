  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth (PTB) is a major health problem and contributes to more than 50% of the
      overall perinatal mortality. Twins are at increased risk for PTB. The number of twins births
      has risen substantially due to the increased use of assisted reproductive technology. The
      rate of twin births in the United States rose from 18.9 to 32.2 per 100 live births between
      1980 and 2004. The increased rate of PTB in twins is associated with increased morbidity and
      mortality rates. Almost one in four very low birth-weight infants (below 1500 g) born in the
      United States are twins, as are one in six infants who die in the first month of life.
      Cervical shortening is a risk factor for PTB. Transvaginal ultrasound measurement of
      cervical length is a reliable screening test for prediction of PTB. There is currently no
      effective treatment to decrease the incidence of PTB in women with twin gestations, but
      there is some evidence that the use of a cervical pessary in women with a short cervix has
      promise.  If effective this approach would be particularly appealing because of the wide
      availability of pessaries, ease of use, and low cost. Unfortunately, existing studies are
      inadequate to confirm effectiveness; a well designed, properly powered, prospective
      randomized trial is warranted prior to widespread implementation in clinical practice. We
      propose such a trial to study the effectiveness of the pessary in decreasing the incidence
      of PTB in an inner city Philadelphia population.
