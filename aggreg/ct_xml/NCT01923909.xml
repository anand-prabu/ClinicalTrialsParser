      Aim: To study and compare the clinical effects of Platelet rich plasma (PrP) injections and
      Intra-Articular steroid injections in a group of patients with primary OA of the knee. This
      study will aim to illustrate this by using the Oxford Knee Score and Western Ontario and
      McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) to illustrate quantifiable difference between
      the two treatment modalities. Patient satisfaction will be compared by utilizing the
      Short-Form Survey-12 (SF-12) Score. Our null hypothesis states IA PrP is more beneficial in
      the long-term treatment of primary OA of the knee.

      This is a single blinded, randomized clinical trial. Subjects will be male or female with
      Grade 1,2 or 3 OA of the knee classified based on the radiologic Kellgren -Lawrence grading
      system.

      100 patients will be recruited for this study and 50 patients each will be randomized to one
      of the treatment groups using block randomization i.e. receiving either treatment IA
      steroids or IA Prp injections. The patients will be aware and will be consenting to the
      treatment they will be receiving. An investigator from the research team, blinded to group
      assignment, will assist patients in completing the Oxford Knee score, WOMAC and SF-12 scores
      prior to receiving the treatment and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after receiving the
      treatment. In addition, they will be followed by regularly (at 3 weeks, 9 weeks, 4 months
      and 5 months) via telephone to inquire about any side effects of the treatment and to
      document patient satisfaction. Subjects in both groups will continue to receive concomitant
      treatments both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. All subjects will receive
      physiotherapy sessions with their respective intervention.

      The duration of this single blinded, prospective randomized trial will therefore be 6
      months. Subjects will continue to receive treatment even if they wish to withdraw from the
      study at any point.

    <description>Intra-articular steroid injections Patients receiving the IA steroid will be injected 3mL of 0.5% Bupivacaine and 2mL of 80mg Depo Medrol in a 10cc syringe, using an aseptic technique into the suprapatellar pouch. After an IA steroid injection, patients are always advised to rest for 24 hours, and weigh bear as little as possible for the following 3 days. The procedure maybe performed by senior residents with several years of experience or a consultant Orthopedic surgeon.</description>
