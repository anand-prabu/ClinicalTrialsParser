            "textblock": "This study is being done because women have arm swelling for more than 6 months despite\n      wrapping and other treatments. This swelling is called lymphedema. It is the back up of\n      lymph system fluid that causes swelling in the arm. The swelling can just happen, but more\n      commonly it is caused when lymph nodes are removed during cancer surgery. It can develop\n      right after breast cancer treatment or weeks, months or even years later. In our preliminary\n      research, the investigators found that more than 1/3 of the 33 patients showed at least a\n      30% reduction in lymphedema following acupuncture treatment and there were no serious\n      adverse events during the treatment or 6 month followup.\n\n      This study will include a larger group of patients. Patients will be assigned to one of two\n      groups, and results of the groups will be compared to see if acupuncture can reduce\n      lymphedema and whether the effect lasts after acupuncture treatment is completed."
