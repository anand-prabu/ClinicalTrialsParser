    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile and safety of KTN3379 over several
      doses with the objective of defining a Phase 2 dose in patients with advanced malignancies.
      Additional patients may be enrolled at the defined recommended Phase 2 dose to obtain
      additional safety, pharmacokinetic and biomarker information. Patients will continue
      receiving KTN3379 until disease progression or toxicity that necessitates discontinuation
      (whichever comes first).

        Major Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically- or cytologically-confirmed advanced solid tumors that are refractory
             to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy exist.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) status of 0 or 1

          -  Adequate organ function as defined below:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100,000/mm3

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ≤ 5 ×
                  institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) for cases involving liver metastasis
                  and ≤ 2.5 ×ULN for all other cases

               -  Bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × ULN except for cases of documented or suspected Gilbert's
                  disease, in which bilirubin must be ≤ 5 × ULN

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 g/dL

          -  Measurable disease by RECIST

          -  Females must be surgically sterile, one year post menopausal or negative results for
             a pregnancy test performed at Screening and agree to use two methods of
             contraception; Males who have not had a vasectomy must agree to two methods of
             contraception

        Major Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receipt of anticancer therapy:

               -  within 3 weeks prior to the first dose of KTN3379, or

               -  within 6 weeks or 7 half lives prior to the first dose of KTN3379 in the case of
                  anticancer therapy involving MAbs, or

               -  within 2 weeks prior to the first dose of KTN3379 in the case of palliative
                  radiation therapy.

          -  Symptomatic or untreated central nervous system metastases requiring concurrent
             treatment, including but not limited to surgery, radiation, and/or corticosteroids;
             if treated, subject must be asymptomatic for 3 months prior to study entry

          -  Subjects who are known to have a history of or active human immunodeficiency virus
             (HIV) or active hepatitis B and/or C

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including but not limited to ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,
             uncontrolled or idiopathic hypotension, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia
             including atrial fibrillation, active peptic ulcer disease or gastritis, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements or compromise the ability of the subject to give written informed
             consent

          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with
             evaluation of the investigational product or interpretation of subject safety or
             study results

          -  Subjects with a left ventricular cardiac ejection fraction &lt; 50% as assessed by an
             echocardiogram or MUGA scan
