            "description": "BA is a manualized psychotherapy which has demonstrated comparable efficacy to cognitive behavioral treatment and antidepressant medication for the acute treatment of depression.  BA has two primary foci: 1) functional analyses of cognitive and behavioral processes that involve avoidance and 2) using avoided activities to guide activity scheduling. In the current study, BA's focus but not its principles was shifted to target work dysfunction by activating the patient into employment-related goals.  BA-W consisted of 12 50-minute weekly sessions. Conceptualizing work dysfunction as a product of avoidance patterns and low levels of positive reinforcement, the treatment rationale viewed maladaptive coping strategies such as avoidance as maintaining work dysfunction beyond remission of symptoms. Rather than broadly activating patients, activity scheduling focused on tasks such as sending out resumes, calling for job interviews, and networking to meet potential employers."
