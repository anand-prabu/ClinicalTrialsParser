Especially, HCCs with\n      portal vein invasion are unresectable and they are not suitable for other curative\n      therapies. For these patients, the optimal treatment remains largely controversial. As a\n      palliative treatment, the benefit of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) had been shown\n      in patients with unresectable HCC and without portal vein invasion by several trials. In\n      patients with main portal vein invasion, TACE is theoretically contraindicated because of\n      the potential risk of hepatic failure resulting from ischemia after TACE. However, recent\n      studies have revealed that TACE could safely be performed in these patients.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of transarterial chemoembolization (TACE)\n      with adriamycin to transarterial chemoembolization with adriamycin/transarterial\n      chemoinfusion (TACI) with cisplatin combination in advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with\n      portal vein invasion."
