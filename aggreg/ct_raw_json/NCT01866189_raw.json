While MRI has become the gold standard acute stroke\n      imaging, no published study has compared FMISO PET and MRI.\n\n      The aim of this prospective study is to identify hypoxic tissues in 40 patients with acute\n      ischemic stroke with F-MISO PET and to compare the location and the outcome of these hypoxic\n      cells with MRI datas (weighted diffusion and FLAIR) and to clinical outcome."
