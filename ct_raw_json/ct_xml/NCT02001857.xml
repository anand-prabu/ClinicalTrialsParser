  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic lymph node dissection (PLND) is the most accurate staging tool to determine lymph
      node involvement in prostate and bladder cancer. The main complication of PLND is
      development of a lymphocele, which can cause symptoms including lower abdominal pain, leg or
      penile/scrotal edema, bladder outlet obstruction, deep venous thrombosis or
      infection/sepsis. The incidence of radiographic (asymptomatic) and symptomatic lymphoceles
      following PLND varies between 12,6-63% and 1,6-33% respectively. Medicated sponges such as
      Tachosil® are indicated in surgery for improvement of haemostasis and to promote tissue
      sealing. They could reduce lymphocele development by increased tissue sealing, due to a
      mechanical effect of the sponge itself and a lymphostatic effect of the included thrombin
      and fibrinogen. Our goal is to prospectively assess the lymphostatic effect of Tachosil(r)
      in patients undergoing transperitoneal PLND with or without radical prostatectomy or PLND
      with bladder cancer surgery.
