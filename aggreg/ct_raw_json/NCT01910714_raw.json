The control condition program will be delivered according to the same structure as the Focus on Youth intervention; daily for 60-90 minutes over the course of 8 days. Due to local staffing availability and the pilot nature of this research, youth in the control condition will not receive the control program in small-group peer format. Rather, youth will receive the control condition program in groups of approximately 30-50."

Focus on Youth uses fun, interactive activities such as games, role plays and discussions to convey prevention knowledge and skills pertaining to Protection Motivation Theoretical concepts.  The intervention consists of 8 group sessions delivered daily over 8 days by two Apache facilitators to same-sex peer groups of 8-12 Apache youth.  Each lesson lasts approximately 60-90 minutes.  The goal of the sessions will be to teach youth about sexual and reproductive health with a specific focus on safe sex practices and sexual decision making."

To perform formative research through focus groups and individual interviews on\n           attitudes, practices and intervention preferences among Apache adolescents and\n           community stakeholders.\n\n        2. To adapt the Focus on Youth (FOY) evidence-based intervention using findings from the\n           formative research, components of Protection Motivation Theory, and input from a\n           community advisory board.\n\n        3. To enroll 304 White Mountain Apache youth ages 13-19 to participate in a randomized\n           intervention trial measuring behavior change at 6- and 12- months follow-up.\n\n        4. To determine the feasibility of gathering biological specimens via self-administered\n           swabs to track sexually transmitted diseases among 18-19 year olds enrolled in this and\n           future studies."
