            "textblock": "\"Omeprazole is a proton pump inhibitor increasingly prescribed in the neonatal population\n      for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) complicated or not by the presence of\n      esophagitis. Although extensively evaluated in adults, optimal dosing schemas, efficacy and\n      safety have not been determined in the neonatal population where its prescription remains\n      off-label.                     The study is a double blind trial that was designed using a\n      Bayesian sequential analysis approach. The principle of this approach is to identify the\n      adequate drug dosage to obtain a level of efficacy as close as possible to a predetermined\n      target level of efficacy in the population. In this study, five different dosages of\n      omeprazole are tested (1, 1,5, 2, 2,5, 3 mg/kg/day) and a target probability of successful\n      treatment of 95% has been chosen. To assess the influence of gestational age on omeprazole's\n      efficacy, analysis was stratified on 3 groups: (1) neonates of less than 32 weeks\n      gestational age (GA), (2) neonates born between 32 and 35 weeks of GA, (3) neonates of more\n      than 36 weeks of GA.\n\n      A total maximum number of 90 neonates is expected to be included (30 neonates per group).\n\n      Patients' participation in the study ends after completion of the pHmetry of control that is\n      72 \u00b124 hours after omeprazole initiation.\n\n      Patients in the study will all benefit for the management of their GERD from\n      non-pharmacological therapies such as adequate positioning and use of available thickening\n      agents for formula The only pharmacologic agent authorised during study for treating GERD is\n      omeprazole. All other available GERD treatments will not be prescribed.\""
