It is not yet known if interleukin-2 is more effective with or\n      without histamine dihydrochloride in treating stage IV melanoma that is metastatic to the\n      liver.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with or\n      without histamine dihydrochloride in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma that is\n      metastatic to the liver."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center location (North America vs Europe), lactate dehydrogenase (less than\n      ULN vs ULN or greater), and metastatic sites (liver only vs liver and other sites). Patients\n      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) subcutaneously (SC) twice daily on days 1\n           and 2 of weeks 1 and 3 and days 1-5 of weeks 2 and 4. Patients also receive histamine\n           dihydrochloride SC over 10-30 minutes on days 1-5 of weeks 1-4.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive IL-2 as in arm I. In both arms, treatment repeats every 6\n           weeks for at least 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 224 patients (112 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
