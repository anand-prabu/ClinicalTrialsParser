Approximately 80 participants will be enrolled in this study.\n      These participants are divided into two groups by age (1-6 and 7-15 years old).\n      Pharmacokinetic (what the body does to the drug,)  blood samples will be collected from at\n      least 3 participants between the ages of 1 and 6 years and at least 3 participants between\n      the ages of 7 and 15 years from 15 minutes after the start of infusion to the end of\n      infusion of the study drug . The study consists of 4 phases: screening phase, treatment\n      phase, recovery phase and follow-up phase. Screening for eligible participants will be\n      performed within 14 days before administration of the study drug. The safety and\n      tolerability of study drug will be evaluated by physical examinations, electrocardiogram\n      (ECG), clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and adverse events (AEs) according to the\n      Time and Events Schedule. Participants safety will be monitored throughout the study."
