      Background:

      - Ghrelin is a hormone in the human body that is mostly produced by the stomach. It makes
      people feel hungry, and also is connected with the desire to drink alcohol. Researchers want
      to test ghrelin to see if it can be used to control alcohol cravings and use. They will
      compare doses of ghrelin with a placebo in people who drink heavily.

      Objectives:

      - To study the effects of ghrelin on alcohol craving and use.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals between 21 and 60 years of age who are heavy drinkers but are not seeking
           treatment for alcohol use.

        -  Participants must on average have more than 20 drinks per week for men, and more than
           15 drinks per week for women.

      Design:

        -  Participants will have a screening visit, four 2-night study visits, and a follow-up
           visit.

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will
           provide urine and breath samples for drug testing. They will also answer questions
           about mood and physical symptoms, and about alcohol and other cravings.

        -  At the study visits, participants will stay overnight at the National Institutes of
           Health clinical center. They will spend the night at the center, have tests on the next
           day, and go home on the following morning. At each visit, participants will receive a
           ghrelin or placebo infusion, and will complete a series of tasks.

        -  For the first and second study visits, participants will have tests of alcohol craving
           and use. They will be able to receive alcohol infusions through a computer program that
           tests response time and craving reactions. At the same time, they will have a ghrelin
           or a placebo infusion. Blood alcohol levels, reaction time, and craving will be
           studied.

        -  For the third and fourth study visits, participants will have a magnetic resonance
           imaging (MRI) study. They will have an initial MRI to provide a picture of the brain.
           They will then have a functional MRI during which they will respond to a computer test.
           The test will allow them to win points for snack food or alcohol. This test will look
           at the brain's response time and craving reactions.

        -  There will be a follow-up visit 1 week after the fourth study visit. Some of the tests
           from the screening visit will be repeated.

      Objective:

      Ghrelin is a 28-amino acid peptide acting as the endogenous ligand for the growth hormone
      secretagogue receptor (GHS-R). Ghrelin stimulates appetite by acting on the hypothalamic
      arcuate nucleus (ARC), a region that controls the intake of food and other substances,
      including alcohol. In addition to the ARC, GHS receptors (GHS-Rs) are also highly expressed
      in the caudal brain stem, the ventral tegmental area (VTA), hippocampus, substantia nigra,
      and dorsal and medial raphe nuclei. The expression of the GHS-R in the mesolimbic dopamine
      (DA) pathway suggests that ghrelin could play a role in the reward processing. The role of
      ghrelin in the DA reward processing and the role of the DA reward system in alcoholism
      suggest a role of ghrelin in alcoholism. Consistent with this hypothesis, preclinical
      studies demonstrate that both ghrelin and ethanol activate the cholinergic-dopaminergic
      reward link, implying neurochemical analogies between ghrelin and ethanol. This supports the
      hypothesis that ghrelin is involved in mediating the rewarding properties of ethanol.
      Additional animal experiments demonstrate that the central ghrelin action not only
      stimulates the reward processing but is also required for stimulation of that system by
      alcohol. Human studies show reduced ghrelin levels in actively drinking alcoholics;
      increased ghrelin levels during alcohol abstinence; and a positive correlation between
      ghrelin level and alcohol craving scores. More recently, a study conducted at Brown
      University by the PI demonstrated the safety of the administration IV of human ghrelin to
      non-treatment seeking alcohol-dependent heavy drinking individuals. Furthermore, a
      preliminary interim analysis shows that IV ghrelin administration may lead to a temporary
      significant increase in alcohol craving. The primary objective of this protocol is to
      investigate whether IV ghrelin, as compared to placebo, will increase motivation for alcohol
      reward, as measured by a progressive ratio (PR) schedule paradigm with IV alcohol
      self-infusion (primary aim). We will also assess a number of secondary aims. Specifically,
      we will also assess whether IV ghrelin, as compared to placebo, will also alter urges to
      drink and the subjective response to IV alcohol. Adverse events will also be assessed to
      ensure the safety of the IV coadministration of ghrelin and alcohol. During an  fMRI/alcohol
      clamp  session, fMRI will be used to see whether ghrelin affects the activation of the
      ventral striatum induced by acute IV alcohol administration and the incentive salience of
      cues associated with alcohol administration.

      Study Population:

      Male and female participants will be non-treatment seeking heavy drinking volunteers.

      Design:

      The study is designed as a within-subject, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of
      ghrelin. The first visit will be the initial screening visit. The second and third visits
      will be PR sessions with IV ethanol, during which each participant will also receive IV
      ghrelin (or matched placebo). The fourth and fifth visits will combine an fMRI session with
      an  alcohol clamp' session (i.e. a fixed dose of alcohol will be administered) and subjects
      will participate in a modified version of the monetary incentive delay (MID) task in which
      they will respond to cues that indicate the opportunity to press a button to gain a reward.
      On some trials the reward will be points that can be exchanged for snack foods while on
      other trials the reward will be points that will determine how much intravenous alcohol a
      subject will be given during the  alcohol clamp  procedure which will immediately follow the
      modified MID task. After the modified MID task is complete subjects will have a short break
      and then begin the alcohol IV infusion.

      Outcome measures:

      The primary measure of this study will be the breakpoint, which is the schedule (number of
      button presses) at which the individual stops to work for more alcohol. Also, the BrAC
      exposure measures will be determined. Alcohol craving in response to ghrelin will be
      measured using the Alcohol Visual Analogue Scale (A-VAS) and the Alcohol Urge Questionnaire
      (AUQ) during the PR sessions. Sensitivity to alcohol will be measured using the Drug Effects
      Questionnaire (DEQ), Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES), and the Profile of Mood States
      (POMS), repeatedly during the PR sessions. fMRI BOLD signal in brain areas associated with
      incentive salience and areas associated with reward circuitry (including the ventral
      striatum) will be measured during the  fMRI/alcohol clamp  session. This study may
      facilitate the identification of a novel neuropharmacological target, thus facilitating the
      development of novel pharmacological treatments for alcoholism.
