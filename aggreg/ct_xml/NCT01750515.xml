      Objective: to study the effect of Acupuncture on liver cirrhosis, SVR and health related
      quality of life in HCV patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin).

      Methods: 60 HCV patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin) will
      undergo Serologic screening for hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant
      immunoblot assay) plus Transient Ultrasound Elastography (FibroScan) to achieve baseline
      characteristics(17,18,19). Patients will be randomized into intervention and control groups,
      30 patients each.In the Intervention group each patient will receive an acupuncture
      treatment once a week for 12 consecutive weeks(Max 12, Min 8 treatments). Treatment protocol
      will be individualized for each patient according to TCM diagnosis. This treatment protocol
      is acceptable and has been published(20,21,22).In the control group patients will receive
      standard treatment alone, with no other intervention.

      Data collection: after 12 weeks patients will again undergo Serologic screening for
      hepatitis C virus (Anti-HCV EIAs and/or recombinant immunoblot assay) plus Transient
      Ultrasound Elastography (FibroScan) in order to detect changes from baseline and group
      differences.

      Inclusion criteria: adult patients with a confirmed HCV infection

      Exclusion criteria:

      Under 18 years Can not receive standard Peg interferon+ ribavirin treatment for any reason
      Psychiatric diagnosis Anaemia of hematologic origin Diabetic patient with uncontrolled
      diabetes Congestive heart failure, arrhythmia Hepatocellular carcinoma HIV infection
      Hepatitis B infection Auto immune liver disease or alcoholic liver disease Study duration: 1
      year Study Location: &quot;Ziv&quot; medical center, division of liver disease, Israel

      Background:

      Hepatitis C is an infectious disease affecting primarily the liver, caused by the hepatitis
      C virus (HCV). HCV is a worldwide problem, An estimated 130-170 million people worldwide are
      infected with HCV, in Israel there are an estimated 80,000 patients. Most patients infected
      with HCV have chronic liver disease, which can progress to cirrhosis and Hepatocellular
      carcinoma (HCC). Chronic infection with HCV is one of the most important causes of chronic
      liver disease and the most common indication for orthotropic liver transplantation (OLT) in
      the United States. Medical care costs associated with the treatment of HCV infection in the
      United States are estimated to be more than $600 million a year.

      Chronic hepatitis C infection and chronic active hepatitis are slowly progressive diseases
      and result in severe morbidity in 20-30% of infected persons. Although acute HCV infection
      is usually mild, chronic hepatitis results in at least 75% of patients. Cirrhosis develops
      in 20-50% of patients with chronic hepatitis C infection. Liver failure and Hepatocellular
      carcinoma can eventually result. Hepatocellular carcinoma occurs in 11-19% of patients . The
      diagnosis of acute or chronic HCV infection generally requires testing of serum for both
      antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) and for HCV RNA. The recombinant immunoblot assay is used to
      confirm HCV infection. A sensitive quantitative HCV RNA assay is recommended for diagnosis
      because it also provides information on the level of virus which is helpful in management of
      the disease.

      Combination therapy with pegylated interferon Alfa (PEG-IFN Alfa) and the nucleoside
      analogue ribavirin is the current standard of care in patients infected with HCV. Treatment
      of chronic HCV infection has 2 goals. The first is to achieve sustained eradication of HCV
      (ie, sustained virologic response [SVR]), which is defined as the persistent absence of HCV
      RNA in serum 6 months or more after completing antiviral treatment. The second goal is to
      prevent progression to cirrhosis, Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and decompensated liver
      disease requiring liver transplantation.

      Adverse effects are common with IFN and ribavirin combination therapy. Approximately 75% of
      patients experience one or more of adverse effects. Common adverse effects are :

        1. Flulike symptoms

        2. Hematologic complications (ie, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia)

        3. Depression

        4. Low grade fever,

        5. Nausea, loss of weight

        6. Neuropsychiatric complications (ie, memory and concentration disturbances, visual
           disturbances, headaches, irritability)

        7. Metabolic complications (gout). Adverse events are a major reason that patients decline
           or stop therapy altogether. Currently there are limited options of managing these side
           effects, while being especially problematic are the flu like symptoms and depression .
           Traditional Chinese medicine(TCM) has been found as an effective treatment for
           improving quality of life in various medical conditions including hepatitis. TCM also
           positively affects chronic inflammation and improves inflammation markers in chronic
           inflammatory diseases such as asthma, crohn's disease, sinusitis and chronic pelvic
           inflammation .

      Acupuncture's effect on liver cirrhosis, SVR(sustained Viral Response) and health related
      quality of life in chronic HCV patients has yet to be studied.

      Study Aim: to study the effect of acupuncture as an adjunctive treatment for chronic HCV
      patients receiving standard treatment (Peg Interferon+ Ribavirin).
