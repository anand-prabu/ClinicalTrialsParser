  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is testing drugs not previously used topically for the treatment of vulvodynia, a
      common genital pain syndrome. It is hoped that one of these drugs will improve vaginal
      entryway pain with touch, daily pain scores and sexual functioning.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vulvodynia is defined as burning pain, occurring in the absence of any visible finding or a
      clinically identifiable nervous disorder.  Current treatments include vulvar care measure,
      topical medications, oral medications, biofeedback, physical therapy and surgery.  The usual
      treatment is to have the patient take either tricyclic antidepressants or anti convulsants
      orally, however these methods seldom bring total relief.  These drugs do have significant
      side effects limiting the patient's tolerance of the higher does sometimes needed. An
      effective topical medication would greatly benefit these women with fewer side effects and
      better tolerance.  Topical amitriptyline and baclofen are often prescribed, but no studies
      have been done to support their use. Topical gabapentin has also been shown to have good
      effect, but no prospective clinical study as been done.

      This study will test topical application of Cetaphil, Loperamide, Gabapentin, Ketoprofen,
      Ketamine and Amitriptyline over a 13 week period in the first phase of the study. The drugs
      are compounded by the University of Rochester research pharmacy and dispensed in 13 vials,
      one vial to be used each week. Patients and study personnel are blinded as to which drug is
      being used.  Each study compound, which contains both the drug and the base (Cetaphil) will
      be used twice a day for two weeks in a row, followed by a one week washout of base alone.
      If a patient finds that one of the drugs is effective she may stop participation after the
      first 13 weeks and request that the most effective drug be prescribed for her.  The
      unblinding officer would then work with the research pharmacy to identify the effective drug
      and provide the patient with a prescription for that drug.  If the patient desires, she may
      enroll in the second phase of the study when she will test the last two drugs over a six
      week period with  the washout as in the first segment of the study.  The drugs would be
      administered in vials as in the first section of the study.

      Every week on Sunday the patient will complete an electronic diary, recording her daily
      pain, any drug side effects, pain with the tampon test and overall health.  Every three
      weeks she will complete the Female Sexual Function Index on the same electronic system. She
      would start her new drug on Monday each week. Additionally the coordinator of the study will
      call each patient on Wednesday to see if they are having any problems with the drug started
      on Monday.

      All patients who could become pregnant are required to maintain effective contraception
      throughout the study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women between ages of 18 and 65 who complain of localized provoked vulvar pain and
             meet the criteria for the diagnosis of localized provoked vulvodynia.  Patients who
             have failed or have been unable to tolerate previous attempts at systematic therapy
             or surgery will be specifically recruited.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          3. Concurrent use of the following medications. .  The patient may enroll in the study
             after a two week washout from these medications.  Patients may need to receive
             approval from the prescribing physician before stopping these medications.  Failure
             to obtain approval for medication cessation would be cause for exclusion.
