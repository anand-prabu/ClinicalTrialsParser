Endometriosis pain, dysmenorrhea,\n      non-menstrual pelvic pain and dyspareunia (BBSS) as well as use of pain medications, and\n      vaginal bleeding intensity will be recorded using an electronic diary and Visual Analog\n      Scale (VAS) pain assessment will be utilized.  All subjects will have completed an Off-Drug\n      Interval (ODI) prior to starting treatment.  Visit 1 will be scheduled within a week before\n      the next expected menses (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval.  Subjects will\n      receive 2 cycles of treatment separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will\n      be followed until menses has returned.  During the follow-up period subjects will continue\n      to record study information in the electronic diary.  The final follow-up visit will be\n      scheduled after blood flow has stopped."
