All eligible\n      eyes should have a diagnosis of either ocular hypertension or mild to moderate POAG with at\n      least 21 mm Hg at baseline (Eligibility Visit), under treatment with either Ganforti\u00ae QD or\n      Krytantek\u00ae BID.  Patients identified to have the selection criteria at the Screening Visit\n      will be scheduled for an Eligibility Visit prior to be prescribed with either of the two\n      study medications (Ganforti\u00ae QD for patients under Krytantek\u00ae, and Krytantek\u00ae BID for\n      patients under Ganforti\u00ae). Enrolled patients will be visiting their clinical site at month 2\n      and month 3, after starting the study medication; at the end of the third month of\n      treatment, a cross-over maneuver will be indicated; all patients will undergo a follow-up\n      scheme similar to the first period of the study (at month 5 and month 6).  A battery of\n      tests will be applied in a pre-established regime (table 1).  Visual acuity, refraction,\n      biomicroscopy, gonioscopy, dilated fundus examination, Humphrey 24-2 visual field\n      (SITA-Standard), ocular surface fluorescein staining, tear breakup time, OSDI\u00a9 (Ocular\n      Surface Index) and central ultrasound pachymetry will be administered at baseline and month\n      6 (at the conclusion of the study).  IOP from applanation Goldmann tonometry (8:00 AM \u00b1 1\n      hour and 10:00 AM \u00b1 1 hour), blood pressure, pulse and a comprehensive ophthalmological\n      examination will be performed at each visit.\n\n      Candidate patients will have an initial screening visit where entry criteria must be met\n      (see section 1.7.).  Study medication will remain masked to the examiner during the entire\n      trial. For patients assigned to the Ganforti's group, instructions for applying one drop QD\n      (8:00 PM \u00b1 30 minutes); for patients assigned to the Krytantek's group, application schedule\n      will be BID (8:00 AM \u00b1 30 minutes and 8:00 PM \u00b1 30 minutes). Bottles will be given to the\n      patient in a closed labeled box (with the randomization number on it), dispensed by the\n      office assistant, and have to be returned in the same box to the assigned office personnel\n      but never to the principal investigator or sub-investigator, in order to preserve the\n      single-masked nature of the study. New study medication bottles will be dispensed at\n      baseline visit, and monthly after such visit.\n\n      Patients will receive verbal instructions, written reminders and periodic phone calls in\n      order to adhere to medication application, as well to scheduled visits (table 1).  Outcome\n      variables will also include adverse events (serious, and non-serious, according to the\n      principal investigator's clinical opinion) derived from all examination items. Patient\u00b4s and\n      treating ophthalmologist\u00b4s subjective satisfaction to the study medication performance will\n      also will be assessed through the closed-end questions (CRF form)."
