We hypothesize that parents who complete the ASPIRE curriculum with an Early\n      Intervention therapist will demonstrate enhanced understanding of their child's listening\n      and language needs. This deeper understanding will support behavior changes that improve the\n      language-learning environment through increased parental engagement and linguistic input.\n      Knowledge increase and changes to the language environment will be apparent in comparative\n      pre- vs. post-intervention assessment scores.  In addition, child outcomes will demonstrate\n      improved listening and spoken language trajectories.\n\n      To encourage behavior change and help parents track their progress, the curriculum will be\n      coupled with \"linguistic feedback\" gathered by the Language Environment Analysis (LENA)\n      recorders and software. With linguistic feedback, EI therapists and parents will be able to\n      track the family's progress through skill building and set goals for behavior change. This\n      feedback and goal setting will allow parents to translate their knowledge into behavior\n      changes that enrich their child's early language environment."
