Although research on the\n      feasibility and efficacy of EMDR on addiction is limited and often lacks methodological\n      rigor, the results are promising and suggest that further research on this subject is\n      warranted.\n\n      This proposal consists of two studies to test and determine the acceptability, feasibility\n      and efficacy of EMDR as an intervention to reduce craving and alcohol use in alcohol\n      dependent outpatients as well as to gain further understanding in underlying working\n      mechanisms."
