Because the function of thyroid hormone is closely linked with lipid and glucose\n           metabolism, overt hypothyroidism after thyroid hormone withdrawal during RAI therapy\n           may induce the changes of metabolic parameters.\n\n        3. We investigate the effects of thyroid hormone withdrawal on metabolic and\n           cardiovascular parameters during radioactive iodine therapy in differentiated thyroid\n           cancer."
