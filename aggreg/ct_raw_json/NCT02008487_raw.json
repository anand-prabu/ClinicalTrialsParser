The cover dressing will be removed and the wound cleansed according to agency protocol (usual care) or as needed. The RGN107 powder, contained in a small squirt bottle, will be squeezed/sprinkled on the wound at each dressing change after cleansing or until a crust is formed. Once formed, the powder will be applied only minimally to reinforce crust integrity. The peri-wound skin will receive care and the cover dressing will be applied. Minimal manipulation of the crusted area will ensue once it has formed. Frequency of dressing changes depends on wound characteristics such as exudate."

The powder will be\n      applied to these ulcers to see if it helps with pain, odor and drainage (leakage). People\n      who are being cared for by hospice or palliative care organizations will be invited to be in\n      the study. The study will also find out if the powder is easy to use by caregivers as well\n      as improving the comfort and quality of life of the person who has the ulcer."
