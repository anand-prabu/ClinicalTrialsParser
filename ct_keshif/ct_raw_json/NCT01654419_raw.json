These include intermaxillary class II elastics,\n      which retract the upper and protract the lower arch, generating extrusive forces at the\n      anchorage sites. Its upper distalizing action is exerted to the canine bracket and\n      transmitted through the posterior teeth where the upper molar does not receive a direct\n      force. The sliding jig is an auxiliary addition that exerts force to the molar by an elastic\n      hanged in a jig between the lateral and the canine in class II; such mechanism decreases the\n      vertical adverse effects of the elastics wearing while directing the distalizing force to\n      the molar.\n\n      A randomized, unblinded, clinical trial comparing 30 units of analysis (hemi arches) in\n      which were placed sliding jig or stand alone elastics were perform."
