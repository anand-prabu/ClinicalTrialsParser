Additionally,\n      recent concerns have emerged of overuse of PCI among patients with little or no angina. Thus\n      there is a compelling need to share with patients the risks and benefits of PCI prior to\n      treatment to reach an informed decision.\n\n      This study is designed to answer the question of whether a decision aid can improve patient\n      knowledge, decisional conflict and patient satisfaction with decision-making compared to\n      usual care for the treatment of stable angina."
