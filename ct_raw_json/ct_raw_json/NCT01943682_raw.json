This study tests\n      different doses of the drug to see which dose is safer in children and adolescents.\n\n      Patients who have blood cancer are being asked to take part in this study . Blood cancers\n      may include leukemia and lymphoma. Patients able to be in this study have already been\n      treated with standard chemotherapy for their disease and the disease is still growing or has\n      come back.\n\n      CPX-351 is a drug that is not yet approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration\n      (FDA) and is only used in research studies like this one. CPX-351 is made up of two\n      chemotherapy drugs that patients may have already received called cytarabine and\n      daunorubicin that are now packaged together.\n\n      Another purpose of this study is to collect blood samples for special research studies.\n      Researchers want to study how much of the CPX-351 is in the body over time. These studies\n      are call pharmacokinetic studies or PK studies for short. PK studies require the collection\n      of several blood samples before and after participants are given the study drug."

Synergistic antitumor activity has been demonstrated between\n      cytarabine and daunorubicin that is dependent upon the ratio of the drugs with the best\n      therapeutic effect observed with a cytarabine to daunorubicin ratio of 5:1 in in vitro and\n      in vivo models.  CPX-351 is a liposomal preparation of cytarabine and daunorubicin that\n      maintains this therapeutic drug ratio 24 hours post infusion. The altered biodistribution\n      from encapsulation may result in a greater therapeutic effect in patients with relapsed\n      hematologic malignancies and demonstrate greater tolerability than non-liposomal cytarabine\n      and daunorubicin.\n\n      This is a single institution phase-I pilot study that aims to assess the pharmacokinetics,\n      toxicity and tolerability of CPX-351 in pediatric and young adults with relapsed/refractory\n      hematologic malignancies.  Subjects will receive a single course of CPX-351 administered on\n      Days 1, 3, and 5.  The study will first open to children in a dose exploration phase, and\n      then be available to an expanded cohort, which will be open to children and young adults\n      once a tolerable dose has been determined."
