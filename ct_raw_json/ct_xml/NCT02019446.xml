  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fungal infections of the toe affect one in three people with diabetes. Current treatments
      for fungal toe infections include oral medications, but these drugs often interact with
      other common medications. The investigators are studying a new treatment for fungal toe
      infections involving the use of a laser device. The investigators will compare to the
      standard treatment which is a type of antifungal cream. This laser has been tested in small
      numbers of patients with minimal side effects. There will be 80 participants selected for
      our study, of which 40 will receive standard treatment and the rest will receive laser
      treatment.

    <description>Other primary outcomes include safety outcomes. Specifically, safety outcomes of interest will include the side effects listed below:
Usual side effect:
o Feeling of warmth, heat, or tingling at the laser target site (only during treatment)
Rare side effects:
Discoloration/burn marks on surface of the nail
Slight or mild pain (only during treatment)
Redness of the treated skin around the nail (lasting 24-72 hours)
Rare laser effect:
o Sometimes the laser creates 'sparks' on the surface of the nail - this does not cause any problems
Extremely rare laser effects:
Blistering of the treated skin around the nail
Scarring of the treated skin around the nail</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to laser group will undergo laser treatment at baseline and be asked to return for 2 subsequent visits six weeks apart (at weeks 6 and 12) to undergo further laser treatment of the hallux.  Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes. Laser energy (1064 nm Nd:YAG) will be delivered via an optical fibre (300 μm core/320 μm clad) secured in a hand piece. Laser energy will be delivered by maintaining the tip of the optical fibre 3 mm from the treatment area to achieve around 1-1.5 mm diameter spot size (25.5 J/cm2 fluence per pulse; 10-pulse pulse-train to each spot in 0.5 seconds). Multiple treatment spots will be delivered to cover the entire area of involvement.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to control group will undergo topical antifungal treatment at baseline and be asked to return for 2 subsequent visits six weeks apart (at weeks 6 and 12) to undergo further topical antifungal treatment of the hallux. Each visit will last approximately 45 minutes. Topical antifungal treatment consists of conventionally applying terbinafine HCl external ointment to the infected hallux.</description>

             according to Canadian Diabetes Association (CDA) criteria;
