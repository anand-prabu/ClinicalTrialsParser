  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite good vaccination coverage, included in national immunization programs in developed
      countries, the number of reported pertussis cases is rising, also in very young infants.
      Current immunization strategies fail to protect infants too young to be immunized with the
      licensed vaccine. Different strategies are possible to close the gap of susceptibility
      between the loss of maternal antibodies and protection by vaccination. The main aim of the
      present study is to measure the influence of an adult pertussis booster in pregnant women,
      on the titer and duration of maternal antibodies in their infants. Early humoral immunity
      will be assessed and the influence on vaccine response of the infant measured. The present
      study offers the  opportunity to have new insights in neonatal immunological mechanisms
      against pertussis and a better understanding in strategies to protect infants against
      pertussis.

             hospital.

          -  Availability for follow-up visits and phone call access through 16 months following
             delivery

          -  Willing to have infant immunized with hexavalent vaccine at 8.12 and 16 weeks and 15
             months of age (= normal Belgian schedule) with pediatrician, the general practitioner
             or at the Centre for the Evaluation of Vaccination.

          -  In the 18th-32nd week of a pregnancy at low risk for complications as determined by

        Exclusion Criteria:Women:
