The stage of the disease\n      is an important prognostic factor as an advanced stage reduces the opportunity for surgical\n      intervention and other curative treatment. In denmark, as in many other countries, a fast\n      track evaluation for lung cancer has been introduced in 2008.\n\n      When the general practitioners refer patients through the fast track, the majority of\n      patients make their first visit to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine. After this visit,\n      further investigation is initiated, which is often a CT scan of the chest and the upper\n      abdomen. We dont know Whether this is the most appropriate organisation.\n\n      The aim of this project is to evaluate the way lung cancer patients are examined through the\n      fast track and the impact of chest CT before an evaluation by a chest physician.\n\n      Investigators want to randomise all patients referred for the existing fast track to either\n      direct CT scan of chest and upper abdomen or to evaluation by the chest physician, in order\n      to test:\n\n      A) Fast track performance measured by number of CT scans and chest physician specialist time\n      per diagnosis, and whether there is a difference between the intervention and the control\n      group."
