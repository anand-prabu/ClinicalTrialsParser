  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) has a growing incidence and in spite of early
      diagnostic, their outcome remains dismal. The evolution of MPM is often local with rare
      distant metastases. There is now a sizable body of evidence that metastases could develop
      from circulating tumor cells (CTC) spread in blood before or during surgery. Thus, sensitive
      and specific detection of CTC in blood is considered as a potentially relevant predictive
      biomarker for patients with carcinomas. In exchange, the prognostic value of CTC in MPM has
      not yet been evaluated.

      Indeed, the main goal for preoperative detection of CTC is to identify patients with high
      risk of recurrence after surgery, in order to perform more adapted therapeutic strategy.
      Despite several studies reported about CTC detection, methodological aspects concerning
      sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility have prevented a clear appraisal of their
      clinical impact. Thus, the aim of our study is to evaluate the presence and the prognostic
      value of CTC in MPM by a double approach. In our setting, cytopathological analysis of
      circulating non hematological cells (CNHC), of epithelial origin, isolated according to
      their size (ISET, Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumor cells) along with immunomagnetic
      selection, identification and enumeration of circulating epithelial cells in peripheral
      blood (CellSearch method) is considered a promising approach.
