            "textblock": "Unintended adolescent pregnancy continues to be a significant public health problem in the\n      United States. While the use of highly effective forms of birth control, such as the\n      long-acting, reversible contraceptives (LARC) have been found to be more effective in\n      decreasing pregnancy rates than non-LARC methods of birth control, knowledge and use of LARC\n      has been shown to be low in this vulnerable population. We are interested in better\n      understanding the influence peers may have on contraceptive decision making among\n      adolescents. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of a peer mentoring\n      intervention on adolescent contraceptive decision making, specifically with regard to\n      increasing long-acting, reversible contraceptive uptake. The main study intervention will\n      consist of randomization to usual contraceptive counseling versus peer-mentoring plus usual\n      contraceptive counseling. Pre- and post-intervention questionnaires will be used to better\n      understand peer influence on contraceptive decision making, and to assess the peer\n      mentor-teen intervention interaction."
