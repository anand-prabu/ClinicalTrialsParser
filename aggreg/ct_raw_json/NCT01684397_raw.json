Pazopanib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Pazopanib hydrochloride may also stop\n      the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Monoclonal antibodies, such\n      as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumor\n      cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Giving pazopanib hydrochloride together with bevacizumab may kill more\n      tumor cells"
