Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity until a complete remission (CR) is achieved or the patient fails to respond after 3\n      courses.\n\n      Patients who achieve a CR during induction therapy receive maintenance therapy comprising HH\n      IV continuously on days 1-7. Maintenance treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a total of 12\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
