    <textblock>
      A new test for breast cancer screening, molecular breast imaging (MBI) may be more sensitive
      than mammography for detecting breast cancer in women with dense breasts. The purpose of
      this study is to see if MBI using a low dose of gamma radiation can find cancers not seen on
      mammography.

      Hypotheses: 1. Low-Dose MBI has a significantly higher sensitivity and specificity and equal
      or higher positive predictive value than SM in women age 40 and older with mammographically
      dense breasts. 2. Low-dose MBI has comparable sensitivity and specificity to that previously
      achieved with MBI using a higher dose of radiation.  3. MBI produces a low false positive
      rate (specificity &gt;90%) that permits its use as a screening tool in this patient population.

      A previous study demonstrated that the addition of MBI using 20 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi to
      screening mammography (SM) increased diagnostic yield for breast cancer in dense breasts
      (supplemental yield of 7.5/1000 screened). After implementing radiation dose reduction
      techniques, the performance of incident SM and prevalent screen MBI in women with dense
      breasts will be compared.

      Methods:

      Women presenting for SM with heterogeneously or extremely dense breast on past prior SM were
      enrolled and underwent digital SM and MBI.  MBI was performed with 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi
      and dual-head cadmium zinc telluride detectors. SMs were read independently; MBIs were read
      in comparison with SM.  MBIs were assigned an assessment score of 1-5 which parallels
      BI-RADS; scores of 3-5 on MBI were considered positive.
