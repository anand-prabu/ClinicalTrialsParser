Patients will be hospitalised as part of their normal  investigation of the epilepsy and patients will be consented  1 week before hospitalisation.  Epidetect will be used in conjunction with the normal EEG monotoring and video telemetry.  The patient will be fitted with the topical sensors at the start of monotoring and then depending on the seizure activity will wear the sensors until enough data is gathered. Hospitalisation under these circumstances typically lasts no more than five days, so monitoring with the topical sensor will be no longer than this."

Hypertonia\n      can often occur before full expression of the seizure and so detection of hypertonia could\n      act as an alarm to epilepsy patients and carers in order to prepare for a seizure event.\n      Secondly, a recording device for seizure frequency and duration is a valuable clinical tool\n      for collecting data for clinicians who manage the disorder in primary and tertiary care.\n      The investigators have developed a portable prototype for hypertonia detection using a\n      non-invasive, muscle activated, sensor that records seizure activity. The investigators now\n      want to test this sensor system in patients identified by Consultant Clinician Custodians\n      within the Wales Epilepsy Research Network (WERN).  The Epidetect\u00ae prototype has been\n      developed by VIKEL LTD\u2122 in collaboration with WERN - a Welsh Assembly funded network."
