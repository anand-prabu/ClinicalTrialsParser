            "textblock": "Study Groups and Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned\n      (like the flip of a coin) to 1 of 2 groups.  You will have an equal chance of being assigned\n      to each group.\n\n      If you are in Group 1, you will receive standard of care hormonal therapy. The study doctor\n      will decide what hormone therapy you will receive and will explain when and how you should\n      take the hormone therapy and any risks.\n\n      If you are in Group 2, you will also receive standard of car hormone therapy.  In addition,\n      you will take 4 abiraterone acetate tablets by mouth each day at least 1 hour before a meal\n      and 2 hours after a meal. You will also take prednisone every day.\n\n      About every 28-days is considered a \"cycle.\"  You should return all unused study drug and/or\n      empty pill bottles at the end of each cycle.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Every 2 weeks (for the first 12 weeks), if you are in Group 2, blood (about 1-2 tablespoons)\n      will be drawn to test your liver function. These tests may be done at a local facility and\n      results faxed to MD Anderson.\n\n      On Day 1 of Even Cycles (2, 4, 6, and so on):\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments\n           you may be receiving.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver\n           function, and for PSA testing.\n\n      On Day 1 of Odd Cycles (1, 3, 5, and so on):\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments\n           you may be receiving.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver\n           function, and for PSA and testosterone testing.\n\n        -  You will have a bone scan to check the status of the disease\n\n        -  You will have a chest x-ray and CT scans to check the status of the disease. If you are\n           unable to return to MD Anderson, follow-up scans may be done at a local facility. The\n           scans should be sent to MD Anderson for review.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive the study drugs for up to 8 cycles.  You will no longer be able to take the\n      study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are\n      unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.\n\n      End of Treatment Visit:\n\n      When you are no longer taking the study drugs:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments\n           you may be receiving.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver\n           function, and to check your PSA and your testosterone level.\n\n        -  You will have a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy performed to check the status of your\n           disease.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up:\n\n      Every 3 months, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn to test your PSA level. This may be\n      done at your local physician's office and the results faxed to MD Anderson.\n\n      Every 6 months:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.\n\n        -  Your performance status will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will be asked about any side effects you may have had and any drugs or treatments\n           you may be receiving.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your liver\n           function, your PSA level and your testosterone level.\n\n      The follow-up visits will continue as long as the disease is stable.\n\n      Extension Crossover Study Phase:\n\n      If the disease gets worse while you are on study, you will be eligible for the extension\n      phase. If you received hormone therapy alone, you will be treated with the combination of\n      hormones and abiraterone acetate plus prednisone for 8 months. If you received the\n      combination therapy, you will receive hormone therapy alone.\n\n      If you crossover to the other treatment group on this study, you will have a bone marrow\n      aspirate and biopsy collected to check the status of your disease.  The schedule for visits\n      in the extension study will be identical to the schedule described above.  When you have\n      completed the additional 8 months of treatment, and an additional follow-up period (lasting\n      as long as the disease is stable), you will have another bone marrow aspirate and biopsy\n      performed.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Abiraterone acetate is FDA approved in combination with\n      prednisone for the treatment of patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate\n      cancer who have received prior chemotherapy containing docetaxel.   Prednisone is FDA\n      approved and commercially available as a corticosteroid. The use of hormone therapy in\n      combination with abiraterone and prednisone in patients with prostate cancer is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 200 patients will be take part in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
