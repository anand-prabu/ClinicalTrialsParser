      The purpose of this study is get to know what and how Shuxuening injection in hospital
      results in adverse events or adverse drug reactions from a cohort event monitoring.

    <textblock>
      Ginkgo leaf is major component of Shuxuening injection. Although some western countries
      product similar injections and use them, Shuxuening injection also regarded as Chinese
      medicine injection. As a TCM injection, the most important thing is how to safety use it in
      practice.

      In order to improving monitoring adverse events or adverse drug reaction of Chinese medicine
      injection in hospital, registry study is suitable method in this area. Otherwise, nested
      case control study is used to find out the mechanism of allergic reaction.

      Calculate the incidence of adverse events or adverse drug reaction is one of the main aims
      for this study. Safety surveillance on Chinese Medicine injection is an important problem
      that needs to be sorted out through large sample observational study.

      According to the 'rule of three', 30,000 cases need to be registered at least. The aim
      population is who using Shuxuening injection's during inpatient time from December 2012 to
      December 2014.

      Data will be collected for three departments as following:

      Form A (green): demographic information ；Form B (pink): adverse drug events/reaction； Form C
      (white): extracted information from hospital information system and laboratory information
      system.

    <time_frame>to assess Shuxuening's &quot;adverse event&quot; and &quot;drug adverse reaction&quot; during patients' hospital stay, administration information of Shuxuening will be registered every day. The registry procedure will last 2 years only for patients using Shuxuening.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>All participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 2 weeks. Patients using Shuxuening will be registered on a registration form including disease background, Shuxuening's administration, and extraction information from hospital information system. When the patients occurs allergic reaction during using Shuxuening injection, it also need to collect patient's biological samples. An adverse event or drug adverse reaction form also will be used to describe any doubted symptoms or signs from patients. A judgment will be made by doctors directly and a further analysis will be conducted by researchers to decide those potential side-effects of Shuxuening injection.</description>
