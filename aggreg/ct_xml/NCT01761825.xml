                  six months.

               2. An increase in the heart rate of at least 30 beats per minute (without
                  concomitant significant decrease in blood pressure of more than 20/10 mmHg)
                  within 10 minutes after assuming a standing position (or during tilt test) on at
                  least 3 separate occasions.

               3. No other concomitant diseases that could explain the symptoms of POTS.
