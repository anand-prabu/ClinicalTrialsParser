The hypothesis of this study is that probenecid can be used\n      to improve the function of the heart and therefore the symptoms in patients with heart\n      failure."

The subjects will have\n      stable HF, an ejection fraction of less than or equal to 40% and NYHA II to IV symptoms.\n      Each subject will undergo 1 week of investigational product (IP), consisting of oral\n      probenecid therapy 1 gram twice a day or placebo with weekly follow.\n\n      The subjects will undergo EKGs, laboratory analysis, physical exams; dyspnea and quality of\n      life questionnaires and a 6 minute walk test (MWT) at baseline. There will be 2 optional\n      sub-studies one for echocardiographic data and the other biomarkers.\n\n      Cohort 2 will enroll up to 50 subjects in a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-control\n      study and will include patients admitted to the hospital with acute decompensated HF.  Each\n      subject will also receive Investigational product consisting of either 1 gram orally twice\n      daily of probenecid or placebo during their hospitalization. They will have daily follow-up\n      with EKG and appropriate laboratory work. In addition to the EKG, laboratory analysis,\n      physical exams, dyspnea and quality of life questionnaires and 6 MWT data will be collected;\n      additional data such as length of hospital stay, biomarkers, use of inotropic therapy and\n      diuretics, and rate of diuresis will also be collected.\n\n      Cohort 3 will enroll up to 50 healthy subjects in a double-blinded, randomized,\n      placebo-control study. Each subject will also receive Investigational product consisting of\n      either 2 grams orally of probenecid or placebo. During a 6 hour course subjects will have\n      laboratory analysis, physical exam, telemetry, EKG and echocardiographic studies performed\n      as measures of both safety and effect of the compound."
