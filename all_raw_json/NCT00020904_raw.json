Treatment continues every 3 weeks for\n      4-18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      achieving complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses beyond CR. Responding patients\n      may receive additional courses at the investigator's discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
