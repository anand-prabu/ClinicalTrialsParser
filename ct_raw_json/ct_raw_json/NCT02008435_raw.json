One-on-one DPP sessions,\n      however, are costly and the group-delivered DPP version, the Group Lifestyle Balance program\n      (GLB), is less effective (4% average loss of body weight). The aim of this two-arm parallel\n      randomized controlled trial is to increase the effectiveness of the GLB by integrating habit\n      formation techniques, namely if-then plans and their mental practice, into the program. The\n      study will provide evidence-based data on the effectiveness of an enhanced GLB intervention\n      in promoting weight loss and in reducing weight-related risk factors for chronic health\n      problems."
