  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The 2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that individuals consume 4.5 to 5 cups
      fruits and vegetables daily.  However, at current intake levels, fruit consumption will have
      to improve by more than 100% and vegetable intake by 50% to meet this recommendation.
      Importantly, intake of brightly colored fruits and vegetables is even lower when potatoes
      are not considered.  It is possible that improved fruit and vegetable intake will have
      beneficial health effects.  For example, higher intakes of fruits and vegetables, and
      particularly cruciferous vegetables (e.g., broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower, etc.),
      are associated with lower rates of many degenerative diseases, including some cancers, yet
      this group of vegetables may continue to be under-consumed due to their strong flavors. A
      supplement made from these vegetables (Cruciferous CompleteTM made by Standard Process Inc.
      Palmyra, WI) contains a group of phytochemicals called glucosinolates that can shift
      estrogen metabolism in a favorable way. One proposed biomarker of chemoprotection from
      breast cancer is the urinary estrogen metabolite ratio of 2- to 16α-hydroxyestrogens (2:16).
      In the main study, the effects of cruciferous vegetables (broccoli or Brussels sprouts),
      Cruciferous CompleteTM whole food supplements, or placebos on this ratio of urinary estrogen
      metabolites in healthy perimenopausal women will be compared over an 8 week period.  The
      investigators hypothesize that treatment with daily supplements will increase the 2:16 ratio
      as compared to a combination of Brussels sprouts and broccoli or a placebo, suggesting
      reduced breast cancer risk.

      In a sub-study the relationships between serum α-carotene, β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin,
      lutein and lycopene, dietary carotenoid intake as measured by a food frequency
      questionnaire, and body composition will be evaluated in healthy perimenopausal women.
      Carotenoids are a family of lipophilic compounds found primarily in colorful plant tissues
      and their concentration in human blood reflects dietary intake of carotenoid-rich foods.
      Carotenoid levels in the blood of healthy women do not appear to be influenced by menstrual
      status, but are inversely associated with body fatness. Thus, serum carotenoid
      concentrations may serve as a functional marker for chronic disease risk associated with
      excess body fat.
