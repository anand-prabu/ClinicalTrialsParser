  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cervical neoplasia is increased in women with SLE most likely due to cervical infection with
      human papilloma virus (HPV). 70% of cervical cancer is caused by HPV types 16 and 18.
      Gardasil vaccine prevents cervical infection with HPV types 16 and 18. Thus lupus patients
      (who are susceptible to cervical cancer) may benefit from getting Gardasil vaccine which can
      prevent cervical cancer. Vaccines are generally safe and efficacious in SLE but no studies
      have been done on the use of this vaccine in SLE. The investigators hypothesize that
      Gardasil vaccine is safe and effective in SLE. This study will look at vaccine safety in
      patients with mild to moderate and minimally active or inactive SLE and measure how well
      they make protective antibodies after receiving the vaccine. In other words this will check
      how well the vaccine works in SLE.
