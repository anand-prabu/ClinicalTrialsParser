Feasibility will be determined\n      based on the rate of participation in the WWE program. As secondary objectives, we will also\n      establish the rate of completion of a number of instruments, including a Geriatric\n      Assessment tool, and other instruments that measure self-reported quality of life (e.g.,\n      fatigue, depression, and pain), and self-reported physical activity (PA).  Data from these\n      instruments, as well as from serial measurements of a biomarker of aging (p16INK4a) will be\n      explored and used to inform future studies designed to evaluate any relationship between\n      these variables and participation in the WWE program.\n\n      We propose a sample (n=30) of cancer patients \u226560 years of age with potentially curable\n      cancer and a diagnosis of Stage I-III breast cancer, Stage I-III lung cancer, or Stage\n      II-III colon cancer, who are about to begin chemotherapy. Participation will be defined as\n      completing the 6-week WWE program. Results from this study will be used in an RO1\n      application to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) pertaining to PA interventions among\n      cancer patients and the effects of biomarkers on prognosis and survival."
