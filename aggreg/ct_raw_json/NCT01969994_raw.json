            "textblock": "Flavanols and their oligomeric derivatives, the procyanidins, are plant-derived compounds\n      commonly present in the human diet. Accumulating data demonstrate a causal role for dietary\n      flavanols in mediating the cardiovascular benefits associated with the consumption of\n      flavanol-/procyanidin-containing foods. In this context, there exists a great interest in\n      understanding the absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) of flavanols in\n      humans. While significant advances in understanding the ADME of flavanols were made, the\n      data obtained thus far remain fairly preliminary and with significant shortfalls and seeming\n      contradictions. Aimed at addressing the challenges and gaps of previous investigations, this\n      study will investigate the ADME of (-)-epicatechin, one of the most abundant dietary\n      flavanols, following the intake of radiolabeled (\u2212)-[2-14C]epicatechin by healthy humans\n      observing a flavanol-/procyanidin-controlled background diet."
