The study will also measure\n      how much of the study drug gets into the blood stream, how long it takes the body to get rid\n      of the study drug and what effects the study drug has on the body.\n\n      This is the first time that this study drug is being given to participants. This study is\n      for research purposes only and is not intended to treat any medical condition. For each\n      participant, the study will last about 85 days, not including screening. Screening is\n      required within 28 days prior to the start of the study."
