  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project, the investigators aim to compare the safety, efficacy, and predictability
      outcomes of conventional CEIOL surgery to Femtosecond-laser-assisted CEIOL (FLACS) in an
      effort to improve cataract surgery outcomes. The investigators hypothesis is that FLACS may
      lead to preservation of endothelial cells compared to conventional CE IOL.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will only include patients who are eligible to undergo cataract surgery. All
      patients will receive treatment that is FDA approved for cataract surgery. Because all study
      participants will have been scheduled for elective cataract extraction regardless of their
      participation in this study, there will be little or no additional surgical risk associated
      with participation. A total of 720 patients are expected to be enrolled in the study during
      a period of 2 years. The investigators will recruit patients with bilateral operable
      cataracts. One eye will undergo cataract surgery using conventional cataract extraction
      technique including phacoemulsification whereas the second eye will undergo FLACS. No
      significant increased risk to the patient is expected in either arm of the study compared to
      routine cataract surgery. The patients will be examined as per previous post-operative
      cataract surgery guidelines on POD1, POW1, POM1, POM3, POM6, POY1 and POY2. The only
      treatment difference will take place at the time of the cataract surgery. Post-operatively,
      endothelial cell count will be obtained by the no-touch technology of specular microscopy at
      baseline as well as three months after surgery. If the study ends prematurely, the
      investigators do not anticipate any significant change in the care of the patient.
