There will be approximately 52 (at least 25% women) participants (11 in each\n      sequence in the 4-way crossover and 8 in an optional cohort). A screening phase will be\n      followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4 single-dose treatment periods of\n      420 mg PCI-32765 administered with or without food. Doses in successive open-label treatment\n      periods will be separated by a washout period of 7 days. Participants will be confined to\n      the study center from Day -1 of each treatment period (at least 10 hours before each study\n      drug administration) until completion of the 72 hour pharmacokinetic blood sample collection\n      on Day 4 of Period 4. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis of PCI-32765 and metabolite\n      PCI-45227 will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing in each treatment\n      period. A follow-up visit approximately 10 days after the last dose will be made to measure\n      lymphocyte count and to capture any additional adverse events. After completion of the 4-way\n      crossover portion of the study, and in absence of significant safety observations at the 420\n      mg PCI-32765 dose, an additional separate cohort of 8 participants may be enrolled to\n      participate in one treatment period and receive a dose of 560 mg in combination with a\n      high-fat breakfast. Safety will be assessed throughout the study. The total study duration\n      is a maximum of 85 days."
