  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perinatal depression is a major public health problem, affecting 15% of women during
      pregnancy through the postpartum period, with adverse consequences for the mother, the
      fetus, the infant, and the family. Despite increasing evidence of the importance of this
      critical risk interval, little research has investigated the effects of depression treatment
      during pregnancy on infant outcomes. The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility,
      acceptability, and effectiveness of a new intervention, Interpersonal psychotherapy for the
      mother-infant dyad (IPT-Dyad). This intervention begins during pregnancy and continues with
      the mother and infant until one year postpartum. The investigators hypothesize that IPT-Dyad
      will be better than treatment as usual in reducing depressive symptoms, improving
      psychosocial functioning,increasing parenting self-efficacy, improving infant emotional
      development, and enhancing mother-infant relationship quality.
