  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a clinical research study of an investigational (FDA IND-BB 10091) treatment for
      patients with  advanced colorectal cancer that no longer responds to standard therapies.

      The treatment is being evaluated for its effect on tumor growth. It consists of small beads
      that contain mouse cancer cells from a mouse kidney cancer cell line. The cells in the beads
      produce substances that have been shown to slow or stop the growth of tumors in experimental
      animals, veterinary patients, and 37 humans with colorectal cancers in a Phase 1 and 2
      safety trials.

      This is a Phase IIb, multicenter, nonrandomized, open-label study with RENCA macrobeads in
      patients with treatment-resistant, metastatic colorectal carcinoma to determine the effect
      of RENCA macrobead implantation on overall survival compared with best supportive care.

      Two treatment groups will be enrolled in this study, as follows:

        -  Group A (n=40) - patients who will undergo up to 4 implantations of RENCA macrobeads,
           at an amount of 8 RENCA macrobeads /kg body weight

        -  Group B (n=80) - patients who will receive or are receiving best supportive care,
           defined as management of symptoms aimed at maintaining or improving quality of life,
           but not including approved therapies targeting the patient's malignancy

             an increased risk of an allergic reaction to the RENCA macrobeads, particularly any
             known allergy to murine antigens or body tissues.

          -  Ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina
             pectoris, serious cardiac arrhythmias (with the exception of well controlled atrial
