    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test an experimental medical device designed to
      automatically control blood sugar.  This device was designed for use by patients with
      diabetes while they are in the hospital, and others who may develop high blood sugar as a
      result of their medical problems.

      The goal of this first-in-man trial is to test the safety and efficacy of the automated,
      closed-loop control system in insulin sensitive subjects with type 1 diabetes, insulin
      sensitive subjects with type 2 diabetes (TTD &gt; 1u/kg/day), and subjects with type 2 diabetes
      and substantial insulin resistance (&lt;2 u/kg/day). The results of this study will help to
      design future studies, exploring the use of the closed-loop system for BG control in
      hospitalized patients, including those with diabetes or hyperglycemia of critical illness.

    <description>The InPatient Closed Loop Device is made up of the three components; the Abbott FreeStyle Navigator subcutaneous continuous glucose monitor, the Symbiq insulin-dextrose infusion system, and the control algorithm.  In this feasibility trial we will study 6 insulin-sensitive subjects with type 1 diabetes and 6 subjects with type 2 diabetes and a high insulin requirement (3 with total daily dose from 1-1.9 u/kg and 3 with total daily dose &gt; 2 u/kg).</description>
