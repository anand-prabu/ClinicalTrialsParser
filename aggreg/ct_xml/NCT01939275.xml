      This pilot clinical trial studies copper Cu 64 tetraazacyclododecane-tetraacetic acid
      (DOTA)-trastuzumab positron emission tomography (PET) in studying patients with gastric
      cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab PET, may help doctors
      plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare tumor uptake of 64Cu-DOTA-trastuzumab (copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab) in
      gastric cancer patients with pathologic evaluation of tumor human epidermal growth factor
      receptor 2 (HER2)/neu expression.

      II. To compare copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab-PET scan with standard radiographic imaging for
      staging patients with gastric cancer.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo copper Cu 64-DOTA-trastuzumab PET scan.

    <description>Parameterized in terms of single-voxel maximum values peak standardized uptake value (SUVmax) and whole-tumor volumes of interest (SUVwhtum). Ratios of tumor to non-tumor activity concentration will be calculated. Receiver-operator curve (ROC) analysis will be performed to estimate optimal cutoff values of SUVmax, SUVwhtum, tumor:background, and tumor:organ ratios for classifying tumors as  &quot;HER2 positive&quot; or &quot;HER2 negative&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Pathologic confirmation of Cu-PET SUV positive or negative cases</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Correlative of Cu-PET SUV (measured as peak SUV) and pathology will be explored. As correlation requires a continuous measure from pathology, and some pathology will use FISH and/or IHC, this will be exploratory. Comparing Cu-PET in positive cases versus negative by pathology will depend on the percent of patients deemed positive.</description>
