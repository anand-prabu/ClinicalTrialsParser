      This study will help determine whether the occurrence of adverse events can be decreased by
      moving to a bi-weekly, opposed to a weekly dosing schedule of gemcitabine plus nab-Pacitaxel
      for the treatment of unresectable/metastatic pancreatic cancer.

             adenocarcinoma.

          2. Patient has one or more radiographically measurable tumor.

          3. Patients may have received prior therapy with gemcitabine alone or with
             fluoropyrimidines, erlotinib or radiation therapy (RT) in the past.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. Patient or legal representative must have read, understood and provided written

          2. Patient has known brain metastases, unless previously treated and well-controlled for
             at least 3 months (defined as clinically stable, no edema, no steroids and stable in
             2 scans at least 4 weeks apart).

          3. Other significant active or chronic infection.

          4. History of active other malignancy excluding basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the
             skin or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia.

          5. Pregnant or nursing females.

          6. Patient has serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or
             serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the patient's safety or the
