Especially, periods rich in slow-wave sleep (SWS) have  shown a\n      memory enhancing effect on hippocampus-dependent declarative memory. Slow oscillatory\n      activity typically occuring during SWS has been implicated in the consolidation effect.\n      Recent evidence in young healthy subjects suggest that the sleep-associated consolidation\n      effect can be amplified by the application of a weak transcranial oscillatory electric\n      current within the frequency range of SWS in humans (0,7-0,8 Hz) during SWS. If patients\n      with amnestic mild cognitive impairments (MCI)- usually characterized by initial\n      difficulties in hippocampus dependent memory functions - benefit from transcranial slow\n      oscillatory stimulation (tSOS) during nocturnal sleep as well has not been studied so far.\n      The primary aim of the present study is to investigate the influence of a weak slow\n      oscillating brain stimulation (tSOS) on declarative memory consolidation applied during\n      periods of nocturnal SWS in MCI patients."
