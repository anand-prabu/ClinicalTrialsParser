The prognosis and treatment of these tumors depend on their correct diagnostics and\n      mitotic activity in case of Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GIST). A standard forceps\n      biopsy of mucosa is usually not helpful. Therefore, biopsy techniques capable of reaching\n      deeper layer of Upper GUT are needed.
