These changes may show that vilazodone affects the brain\n      differently than most other kinds of standard antidepressant medications."

Functional connectivity as measured by\n      Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) MRI will be assessed to determine the relationship\n      between the change in connectivity and the change in Glu levels with treatment.
