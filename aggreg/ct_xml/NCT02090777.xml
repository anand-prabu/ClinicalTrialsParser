    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to examine the feasibility of using a Health Coach for improving
      the ophthalmic care of glaucoma patients. Patients taking glaucoma medications will have a
      coaching intervention and adherence to glaucoma drops will be monitored using a
      dose-recording device. The dosing data will be analyzed to examine the effect on adherence
      and qualitative interviews at the conclusion of the study will be used to examine which
      elements of the coaching experience were most helpful in the glaucoma patient population.
