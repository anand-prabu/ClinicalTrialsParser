One hundred fifty\n      pregnant women at risk of premature delivery, in the framework of Hyaline Membrane Disease\n      of the neonate, will receive 2 intramuscular injections of Celesten (betamethasone) at 24\n      hours interval. Plasma samples will be collected: 2 in the mother before delivery, one\n      maternal and one cord samples at delivery. Concentrations will be measured and analyzed\n      using a population approach. A ratio between neonatal and maternal exposure will be\n      calculated to represent placental transfer. The effect of covariates (genetic polymorphism\n      for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, P-glycoprotein\u2026, and others variables as gestational age, bodyweight at\n      birth, apgar score, co-medication, maternal disease) will be tested to explain the\n      variability of placental transfer. The relationship between placental transfer and the\n      occurrence and severity of the Hyaline Membrane Disease will then be study, in order to\n      target betamethasone maternal concentration and thus to optimize the antenatal dose to\n      administer to the mother in the framework of  Hyaline Membrane Disease."
