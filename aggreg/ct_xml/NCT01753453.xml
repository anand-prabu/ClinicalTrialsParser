  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate tumor cell mobilization (TCM) with
      non-pegylated G-CSF alone compared with non-pegylated G-CSF plus plerixafor in patients with
      multiple myeloma (MM) who are potentially poor mobilizers of hematopoietic stem cells (HSC).

      Second objectives are to evaluate survival and disease status of G-CSF alone compared with
      GCSF plus plerixafor, and the efficacy and safety of G-CSF plus plerixafor when used to
      mobilize stem cells for autologous transplantation.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a diagnosis of MM in partial response or complete response, who are
             undergo an autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and could be considered
             potentially poor mobilizers.

        Exclusion Criteria:
