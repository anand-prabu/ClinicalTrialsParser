  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients are asked to be in this study if have oropharyngeal cancer and will be treated with
      chemotherapy and radiation.

      This research is being done to find out if acupuncture can reduce the mouth inflammation and
      pain caused by chemotherapy and radiation.  Chemoradiation may cause mouth inflammation and
      pain.

      Acupuncture is a medical technique of inserting very thin needles into the &quot;energy points&quot;
      on the body with the aim to restore health and well-being.  It has been used widely to treat
      pain, such as lower back pain and joint pain. In this study we will assess the potential
      usefulness of acupuncture to decrease the severity of mucositis and mucositis-related mouth
      and throat pain in patients receiving chemoradiation for oropharyngeal cancer.

      Mouth cancer patients receiving chemoradiation who have not had acupuncture within the last
      one month and who do not have a history of head and neck cancer may join this pilot study.

      This is a single-center, randomized controlled pilot clinical trial (n=20) assessing the
      efficacy, feasibility and safety of acupuncture in reducing the severity of
      chemoradiation-induced oral mucositis (CRIOM) in patients with oropharyngeal cancer.
      Participants will be randomized to receive either usual medical care or acupuncture
      treatment plus usual medical care once a week for 8 weeks coinciding with their
      chemoradiation treatments. The length of the study will be 16 weeks: 8 weeks of treatment
      and two follow up visits at 4 weeks and 8 weeks after radiation (weeks 12 and 16).  All
      subjects will receive usual medical care in addition to the study intervention.  The Oral
      Mucositis Daily Questionnaire for Head and Neck Cancer patients (OMDQ) will be used to
      assess patients' self-reported chemoradiation-induced mucositis severity at baseline (before
      1st acupuncture session), and daily throughout the course of radiation, as well as at the 12
      and 16 week follow up visits. At baseline, weekly during radiation therapy, and at the 12
      and 16 week follow up appointments, patients will complete the Functional Assessment of
      Cancer Therapy (FACT-G), Esophagus Cancer subscale (ESC) QOL, and the Functional Assessment
      of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT)-Fatigue subscale questionnaires. Oral mucositis will also
      be assessed objectively by a trained member of the research team using both the Oral
      Mucositis Assessment Scale (OMAS) and the National Cancer Institute- Common Toxicity
      Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-CTCAE) v3.0 measurement scale once a week for the first two
      weeks of chemoradiation treatment, then twice a week during weeks three through seven, and
      additionally once during week 8 and once at the 12 and 16 week follow up visits.  Twice
      weekly measurements correspond to peak severity of mucositis during weeks three to seven,
      based on previous reports in the literature.   Patients will be given a weekly diary to
      record oral analgesic intake.  Lastly, 8 milliliters of blood and a saliva sample will be
      taken from the subjects at baseline (before 1st acupuncture session), weekly through
      radiation treatment, and at the week 12 and 16 follow up visits to measure changes in
      proinflammatory cytokines concentrations.
