To estimate the overall response rate and the complete response rate of patients with\n      platinum-refractory ovarian cancer who are treated with infusional Bryostatin-1 given in\n      combination with intravenous cisplatin.\n\n      II. To estimate the duration of response in these patients. III. To obtain tissue in order\n      to evaluate the molecular determinants of apoptosis including: p53 status, WAF1/CIP1 gene\n      expression prior to and directly after chemotherapy, bcl-2 gene expression in vivo,\n      bcl-2/bax ratio, p21, and the extent of apoptosis determined by the TdT assay; and the\n      molecular determinants of DNA damage and repair including: expression levels of ERCC1.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV continuously over 72 hours immediately followed by\n      cisplatin IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
