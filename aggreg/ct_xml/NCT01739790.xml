  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      N-acetylcysteine (NAC) is described as having mucolytic and antioxidant properties. It is
      widely prescribed for patients with chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), particularly
      for those who have accompanying symptoms of chronic cough and sputum production. Compared to
      placebo, high-dose NAC will improve Saint George Respiratory Questionnaire scores in
      patients with COPD and chronic bronchitis.

          -  INR &gt; 1.5 unless on warfarin therapy

          -  Any concomitant condition that might endanger the patient through participation in
             the study or interfere with study procedures, as assessed by the investigator
