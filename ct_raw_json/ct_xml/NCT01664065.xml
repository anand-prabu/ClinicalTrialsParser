             interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of drugs

          -  Any clinically significant abnormalities in clinical chemistry, haematology, or
             urinalysis results, as judged by the investigator

          -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction, or morphology of
             resting ECG that may interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes

          -  History of any clinically significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of
             the investigator, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the
             study, or influence the results or the subject's ability to participate in the study
