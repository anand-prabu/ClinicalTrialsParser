Indeed, they have reduced the incidence of acute\n      rejection episodes of cadaveric allograft recipients. Although marked progression has been\n      made in initial survival rates, long-term kidney graft survival has yet to show such\n      encouraging results. Because CNIs are associated with adverse effects, particularly\n      nephrotoxicity, which contribute to declining organ function and eventual graft loss. In\n      kidney transplants, progressive allograft dysfunction has been shown to develop in as many\n      as 94% of patients by 1 year.\n\n      Therefore, reducing or eliminating the dose of CNIs to minimize nephrotoxicity must be\n      balanced against the maintenance of adequate immunosuppression.\n\n      Certican allows CNI dose reduction then provides renal function improvement and current PSI\n      strategy point out that early intervention is important in managing the risk of CAN before\n      it develops in both de novo and maintenance renal transplant recipients.\n\n      To demonstrate Certican early introduction after 1 month provides better renal function with\n      no change of efficacy compared to standard regimen, and also prevent delayed wound healing."
