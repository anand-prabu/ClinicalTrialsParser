    <description>The primary endpoint of this study is the clinical and microbiological response of patients with cUTI or pyelonephritis to treatment with finafloxacin for 5 days versus finafloxacin for 10 days versus ciprofloxacin for 10 days as a reference comparator at the Test of Cure (ToC) visit (Day 17) in the microbiological intent-to-treat population (micro-ITT population).
Clinical response is defined as resolution of the symptoms of cUTI present at trial entry and no new symptoms developed. Microbiological response is defined as Elimination or reduction of study entry pathogens to â‰¤ 10e3 CFU/mL on urine culture. The clinical and microbiological response will be assessed for each group on Day 17 and will be compared between the three groups to assess the efficacy in each group.
The micro-ITT population is composed of all randomized patients who have a baseline bacterial pathogen on culture of urine or blood that causes UTI against which the investigational drug has antibacterial activity.</description>

    <measure>The safety and tolerability of multiple doses of finafloxacin of both 5 days and 10 days of treatment with finafloxacin (i.v. and oral) in subjects with cUTI, compared to 10 days of ciprofloxacin (i.v. and oral).</measure>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This study will evaluate the safety of the different regimens of finafloxacin. The safety outcome measures assessed are the following: vital signs, physical examinations, ECGs, haematology, biochemistry, urinalysis, adverse events and serious adverse events. Adverse events and serious adverse events will be documented throughout the study for each group (including comparator group and the incidence and severity of their occurrence will be compared between all groups. The results of all other safety outcome measures will be compared with the baseline values of each group to determine if significant changes occurred during the course of the study within one group. The results at the different visits will also be compared between the groups to identify significant differences between the 3 treatment groups.</description>

    <time_frame>Day 5 and 10</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Blood samples will be collected from all patients enrolled in the study and urine samples will be collected in a subset of 25 patients per treatment arm at visit 2 (Day 3). Pharmacokinetic parameters to be evaluated include: AUC, Cmax, Tmax and others. The pharmacokinetic parameters determined on Day 3 of the study will be compared with the clinical signs observed on Day 3 in order to evaluate any correlations between these two data sets and therefore, to evaluate, if the PK/PD data demonstrate a predictive capacity with regard to the clinical signs assessed.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Be male or female subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age.

          2. If a female and

               1. subject is of childbearing potential, must have documented use of using an
                  effective contraceptive method (such as IUD, hormonal birth control, condom and
                  spermicidal jelly, etc.) during the study, Contraception must have been used for
                  at least 2 months before starting the study. A documented negative urine
                  pregnancy test must be provided and the subject must be non-lactating.

               2. subject is of non-childbearing potential, must be post-menopausal (i.e. has had
                  amenorrhea for a minimum of 12 consecutive months) or surgically sterile due to
                  bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or hysterectomy.

               3. subject is truly abstinent. This is accepted as a method of contraception, but
                  only when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject.
                  Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation
                  methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception.

          3. If a male, should agree to use reliable birth control methods (contraception or other
             barrier device) during study participation.

          4. Must have complicated lower urinary tract infection or acute complicated or
             uncomplicated pyelonephritis (cPN or uPN; see section 5.3) and must have at least two
             of the following acute signs and symptoms

               1. Chills or rigors or warmth associated with fever (e.g. oral temperature greater
                  than 38.0 degrees Celsius ).

               2. Flank pain (pyelonephritis) or pelvic pain (cUTI).

               3. Nausea or vomiting.

               4. Dysuria, urinary frequency, or urinary urgency.

               5. Costo-vertebral angle tenderness (pyelonephritis) on physical examination.

          5. Provide one pre-treatment adequate urine sample (the urine sample must return a
             positive culture in order for the subject to remain eligible for the study) For
             males: midstream clean catch, for females: in-out catheterisation or midstream clean
             catch. The urine sample must be provided within 24 hours before the start of
             administration of the first dose of study drug.

             A positive urine culture is defined as:

               -  â‰¥ 105 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in the case of cUTI

               -  â‰¥ 104 CFU/mL of one causative pathogen in case of Pyelonephritis

             A negative urine culture is defined as:

               -  &lt; 105 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number
                  of CFUs in the case of cUTI

               -  &lt; 104 CFU/mL of causative pathogen/s and/or non-target pathogens at any number
                  of CFUs in the case of Pyelonephritis Patients may be admitted to the study
                  pending baseline urine culture results. Treatment should NOT be delayed pending
                  urine culture results.

             NOTE: Because biofilms on indwelling catheters (e.g. Foley catheters) are more likely
             to be present after the catheter has been in place for a period of time, samples
             should be collected following the placement of a new catheter. If the placement of a
             new catheter is contraindicated or is not feasible, specimens should be collected
             using aseptic techniques with the urine obtained through a properly disinfected
             collection port. Urine samples should never be obtained from the collection bag.

             If the subject's pre-treatment culture shows the presence of a ciprofloxacin
             resistant pathogen the Investigator has to decide according to clinical signs and
             symptoms whether the subject can stay in the study.

             In the event of a negative urine culture, the subject must be withdrawn from the
             study and switched to standard care, because the inclusion criterion is not
             fulfilled.

             A urine culture is defined as contaminated if:

               -  at least one causative pathogen with  â‰¥ 105 CFU/mL is present AND at least one
                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s at any number of CFU/mL are
                  present in the case of cUTI

               -  at least one causative pathogen with â‰¥ 104 CFU/mL is present AND at least one
                  non-pathogen or additional causative pathogen/s with any number of CFU/mL in the
                  case of pyelonephritis Subjects with contaminated urine cultures will be
                  permitted to continue in the study, although this will impact on the subject's
                  eligibility for analysis (see section 9.3).

          6. Have pyuria (i.e. a dipstick analysis positive for leukocyte esterase or at least 10
             white blood cells per cubic millimetre [1 Âµl]).

          7. Be considered ill enough to be hospitalized for at least 3 days and require initial
             parenteral therapy to manage cUTI and/or acute pyelonephritis by the standard of
             care.

          8. Provide written informed consent to participate in the study.

          9. Be willing and able to comply with all study procedures and activities.

        Exclusion Criteria:
