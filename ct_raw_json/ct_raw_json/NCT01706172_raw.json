            "textblock": "Longitudinal studies of subjects with temporomandibular dysfunction show a general pattern\n      of symptom diminishment, especially in the elderly. However studies out to 2-8 years show\n      residual symptoms in many and nearly 25% with unabated symptoms. Dextrose injection has been\n      utilized empirically for many years and a marked reduction in pain and luxation after\n      intra-articular and pericapsular dextrose injection has been reported in a recent RCT.\n      However, small study size and lack of a non injection control have prevented any definitive\n      conclusions as the additional efficacy of including dextrose in the injectate. The mechanism\n      of action of dextrose injection was originally thought to be via a brief stimulation of the\n      inflammatory cascade with resultant production of growth factors. However, non-inflammatory\n      dextrose effects on growth factor production have been demonstrated, and, more recently,\n      dextrose has been found to treat neurogenic inflammation (pain from upregulation of the\n      TRPV1 receptor on peptidergic nerves). This has the theoretical benefit of reducing pain,\n      regardless of the status and position of the intraarticular cartilage or degree of\n      degenerative change of the TMD. The primary goal of this study is to evaluate the ability of\n      dextrose injection versus saline injection to reduce pain and improve functional complaints\n      referable to the temporomandibular joint."
