  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in our understanding of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and its diagnosis,
      the prognosis for patients with HCC remains disheartening, due to a high recurrence rate and
      frequent intrahepatic metastasis. Various therapies for use after hepatic resection have
      been reported, but they are associated with adverse side effects or they fail to improve
      overall survival. Nowadays, adjuvant transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is recommended
      as the most effective therapy for postoperative HCC. And the indication is patients with
      risk factors of recurrence. While more and more prospective studies revealed that
      radiotherapy is effective for advanced HCC. And the side effects of radiotherapy are
      controlled. Until now, no prospective or retrospective study compared the efficacy of
      adjuvant TACE and radiotherapy for postoperative HCC.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-75 years

          -  Diagnosis of HCC was confirmed by histopathological examination of surgical samples
             in all patients

          -  Patients have Child-Pugh A liver function and undergo potentially curative hepatic
             resection

          -  Patients with risk factors for recurrence (tumor size &gt;5 cm, multiple nodules,
             vascular invasion, absence of tumor capsule, poorly differentiated tumor, and narrow
             resection margin)

          -  No previous treatment of HCC except liver resection

          -  No evidence of metastasis to the lymph nodes and/or distant metastases on the basis
             of preoperative imaging results and perioperative findings

          -  No malignancy other than HCC for 5 years prior to the initial HCC treatment

          -  No imaging evidence of invasion into the major portal/hepatic vein branches

          -  No history of encephalopathy, ascites refractory to diuretics or variceal bleeding

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of cardiac disease:

               -  congestive heart failure &gt; New York Heart Association (NYHA) class 2;
