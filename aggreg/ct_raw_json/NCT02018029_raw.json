Unfortunately 20 to 40\n      % of implanted patients according to the guidelines do not have an improvement in their\n      condition. The detection of  \"non responders\" is imperfect. The selection of eligible\n      patients to cardiac resynchronization is defined by symptomatic patients (NYHA class II to\n      IV), a reduced Left Ventricle ejection fraction and by the duration of the left bundle\n      branch block. No other parameter (clinical, electrical, echocardiographical) have been\n      identified as positive predictive factor to cardiac resynchronization therapy.\n\n      The aim of the investigators study is to identify positive predictive parameters to CRT.\n\n      The investigators study included all patients eligible to CRT according to the guidelines of\n      the European Society of Cardiology in four French centers (Clermont-Ferrand, Bordeaux,\n      Nancy, Pasteur Toulouse).\n\n        1. At baseline a preimplantation evaluation is performed: clinical examination, laboratory\n           assay (biological collection), echocardiography-2D Strain at rest and stress,\n           myocardial perfusion scintigraphy and MIBG.\n\n        2. At 6 months, response to CRT is the primary endpoint. It is a composite primary\n           endpoint, including modification of: Quality of Life Score (MINNESOTA scale) , NYHA\n           functional status , 6-minute walk test and volume of the left ventricle. Three hundred\n           patients are expected over a period of 24 months."
