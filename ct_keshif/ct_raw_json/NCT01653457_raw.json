            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic rheumatic disease of high prevalence and great clinical\n      impact. However, the treatment for FM has limited efficacy, with an effect size of about\n      0.5. Recent studies have found raised levels of glutamate in the insula, hippocampus and\n      posterior cingulate cortex regions of the brain. This has led a number of authors to suggest\n      the usefulness of glutamate blocking drugs in the treatment of FM.\n\n      Aims: To evaluate the efficacy of memantine in the treatment of pain and other symptoms of\n      FM and to assess its efficacy in reducing brain glutamate levels in patients with FM.\n      Material and methods: Randomized controlled trial, of six months duration (including a dose\n      adjustment period of one month). 60 patients with FM will be recruited for inclusion in the\n      study upon fulfillment of selection criteria, and they will be randomized in two groups: A)\n      Treatment group (n=30), will receive 20 mg of memantine o.d ; B) Control group (n=30) will\n      receive placebo. The main objective is to assess the efficacy of memantine in the treatment\n      of pain (pain threshold, pain perception) and other symptoms in fibromyalgia (cognitive\n      state, health status, state of anxiety and depression, quality of life and perceived\n      improvement. Discussion: There is a need for the development of innovative and more\n      effective alternatives for the treatment of FM. This clinical trial will determine whether\n      memantine can be considered as an option in the treatment of FM patients."
