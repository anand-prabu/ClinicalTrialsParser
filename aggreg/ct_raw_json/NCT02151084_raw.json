Selumetinib has also been shown to shrink tumours when given\n      in combination with cisplatin and gemcitabine in research studies done in animals and in\n      some patients with biliary tract cancer. Cisplatin and gemcitabine are intravenous drugs\n      that work by damaging DNA in tumor cells so that they are unable to grow and divide."
