Subject, or their legal guardian, is willing to allow a Care Partner to receive and\n             view information transmitted by their Paradigm\u00ae Veo\u2122 Medtronic insulin pump to a\n             Mobile phone/Smartphone/tablet/PC via the CareLink Connect/CareLink Personal System.\n\n          9. Subject is willing to keep CareLink Connect device in the same room as themselves or\n             regularly carry the study device with them and maintain its operational status (at\n             approximately 16h per 24h).\n\n         10. Subject is willing to keep a short diary during the device use reporting time periods\n             away(for more than one hour) from the CareLink Connect device.\n\n         11. Subject is in good general health as judged by the PI.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Female subject is pregnant, per urine pregnancy test performed at screening in women\n             of child-bearing potential\n\n          2. Female subject plans to become pregnant during the course of the study\n\n          3. Subject is unable to tolerate tape adhesives of the infusion set and CGM sensor\n\n          4. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of the pump infusion\n             set or the CGM sensor placement (e.g. psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)\n\n          5. The subject has known cellular connectivity problem at their home\n\n          6. The subject is by the PI judged ineligible or unable to perform the study procedures\n             jeopardizing the study results."
