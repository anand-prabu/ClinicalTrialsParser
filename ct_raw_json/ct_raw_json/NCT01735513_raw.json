The EMBOL-X system features a small, expandable, polyester-mesh filtration system that is placed inside the aorta above the aortic clamp during open-heart surgery or transaortic TAVI procedures, where it captures particles in the bloodstream that otherwise might have remained in the patient's circulatory system. A recent presentation characterized the removal of aortic cross-clamps as creating in some patients \"embolic showers\" which have the potential to cause neurocognitive complications, stroke and other organ damage. In documented procedures, 97% of EMBOL-X system filters showed detectable captured embolic matter, visible proof that the system is removing potentially dangerous emboli from the bloodstream.",
