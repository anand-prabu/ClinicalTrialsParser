Prospective randomized trials has found continuous wound\n      catheter analgesia as an accepted alternative to IV morphine PCA.\n\n      The researchers will investigate whether ropivacaine, administered through a wound catheter\n      placed by the surgeon, will reduce morbidity and provide a better recovery."

In addition, all patients will receive\n      patient-controlled intravenous morphine analgesia. The primary endpoint : the opioid-related\n      symptom distress scale (SDS) will be performed at 48 hours after surgery. Secondary\n      endpoints will be pain intensity on a visual analog scale at rest, and on coughing, morphine\n      consumption, respiratory dysfunction, transit recovery and side effects at 48 hours, 5 days\n      after surgery."
