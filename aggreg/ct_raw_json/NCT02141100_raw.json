After dose reduction in 6MP to 2/3 of the current dose 6TG therapy is initiated with a starting dose of 2.5 mg/m2/day. The 6TG dose will hereafter be increased at 2.5 mg/m2/day every 14 days until a max. of 12.5 mg/m2/day is reached or until the thiopurine metabolite profile (Ery-TGN/Ery-MeMP) has been increased by at least a factor 5."

Patients with low activity of thiopurine\n      methyltransferase (TPMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of 6MP, have lower levels of\n      liver toxic metabolites (MeMPs), higher levels of the major active metabolites (TGNs), and\n      reduced relapse rates. Most patients (90%) have high TPMT activity. Nearly all patients with\n      high TPMT activity and high MeMP levels experience elevated liver enzymes. Increasing the\n      6MP dose in patients with high TPMT activity, to intensify therapy, will mainly lead to\n      further increase in the MeMP level. A novel approach compensating the adverse thiopurine\n      metabolism of the majority of patients is warranted."
