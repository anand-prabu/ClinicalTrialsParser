  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The early detection of BVZ or Sunitinib mediated cardiotoxicity using cardiac biomarkers and
      novel Transthoracic Echocardiogram (TTE) techniques may allow one to adjust treatment and/or
      administer prophylactic cardioprotective agents, prior to the development of irreversible
      cardiac dysfunction. We hypothesize that cardiac biomarkers, TVI/strain-derived indices will
      be able to accurately detect subtle cardiac injury at a time when conventional Left
      Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) remains normal in BVZ or Sunitinib mediated
      cardiotoxicity. Additionally, we hypothesize that Endothelial Function Test (EndoPAT)
      testing can detect early BVZ or Sunitinib mediated endothelial dysfunction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 100 individuals (50 receiving BVZ and 50 receiving Sunitinib)  will be
      prospectively enrolled . (80 at Mayo Clinic [40 receiving BVZ and 40 receiving Sunitinib]
      and 20 at St. Boniface General Hospital (SBGH)). Patients receiving either BVZ 5mg/kg iv
      every 2-3 weeks for colorectal cancer or Sunitinib 50 mg po daily for advanced Metastatic
      renal cell carcinoma will be screened for potential eligibility in the study. For metastatic
      renal cancer treatments, Sunitinib doses are (oral) 50 mg once a day for 4 weeks followed by
      a two week off period. The six week cycle is then repeated. In case of toxicities observed
      with the dose, a 25% reduction in the daily dose during the &quot;on&quot; period is performed (37.5
      mg).   Patients will be studied at 7 time points: i) Baseline; ii) Day 1; iii) Day 5; iv)
      4-6 weeks ; v) 3 months; vi) 6 months after the initiation of both drugs (BVZ and Sunitinib)
      ; and vii) 12 months after the initiation of BVZ drug only (Figure 1).  Three visits
      (baseline, 4-6 weeks , and 3 months) are considered part of standard clinical care, and four
      visits are for research. At each visit, in addition to standard of care provided by the
      Oncologist, blood will be drawn to measure high sensitivity troponin-T (hsTnT) and
      Natriuretic-proBNP. The patients will also undergo a TTE with tissue velocity imaging (TVI),
      strain and left ventricular opacification (LVO) and myocardial perfusion at each time point.
      EndoPAT test will also be performed at baseline,  and  3 months. The baseline, 4-6 weeks,
      and 3 month visits will be part of your standard clinical care and followup.
