In addition, 'bowel\n      lavage' before endoscopy might result in a disturbance of the microbiota in the bowel. For\n      this proof of concept study a novel device capable of taking 'protected' biopsies has been\n      designed.\n\n      We hypothesize that the distribution of mucosal and luminal microbiota changes from proximal\n      to distal in the colon, and by taking 'protected biopsies' there will be the opportunity to\n      show the real distribution of microbiota according to the localisation in the colon.\n\n      Furthermore, we hypothesize that microbial diversity will differ after bowel lavage."
