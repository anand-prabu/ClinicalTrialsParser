  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to test the use of simulation training to improve 9-1-1 telecommunicators'
      call processing and response. Training sessions will expose 9-1-1 telecommunicators to
      several realistic emergency situations through mock 9-1-1 calls with a trained actor playing
      the part of a reporting party, followed immediately by feedback on call handling provided by
      a trained call observer.  Investigators hypothesize that simulation followed by trained
      observer-directed feedback will increase correct triage of medical emergency and delivery of
      pre-arrival instructions during simulated calls and in actual 9-1-1 calls.

    <description>The intervention consists of four 20-minute telephone simulation training sessions over a 4 month period (one session each month).  Each 20-minute training session will include 3 simulated 9-1-1 calls, performed by a standardized caller (trained actor) and feedback will be provided right away by a trained observer who takes notes during the simulation calls and discusses the teaching points after the session. In total, the 9-1-1 dispatchers will receive 12 different simulated calls.</description>
