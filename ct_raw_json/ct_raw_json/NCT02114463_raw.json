Phantom limb pain may appear\n      in up to 85% of patients and is usually resistant to a wide variety of treatments.It is\n      believed that regional anesthesia, by preventing the establishment of central sensitization,\n      may play a role in reducing the incidence of acute and chronic pain. Therefore the\n      investigators will compare two methods of postoperative analgesic after after amputation by\n      their efficiency and complication."

Consequently, our study was\n      designed to arrive at clear conclusions about treatment efficacy and to give stronger\n      recommendations for clinical practice."
