            "textblock": "This research study is evaluating a therapy called proton beam radiation therapy (PBRT) as a\n      possible treatment for neuroblastoma.\n\n      Neuroblastoma most commonly occurs in and around the adrenal glands, which are located at\n      the top of the kidneys. However, it can also occur in other areas where groups of nerve\n      cells exist, such as other areas of the abdomen, neck and near the spine.\n\n      Conventional radiation therapy with photons is used as standard treatment for many patients\n      with neuroblastic tumors. In this research study, the investigators are looking at another\n      type of radiation called proton radiation which is known to spare surrounding tissues and\n      organs from unnecessary radiation. Proton radiation delivers radiation to the area requiring\n      radiation. This may reduce side effects that patients would normally experience with\n      standard radiation therapy or other means of delivering proton radiation therapy.\n\n      In this research study, the investigators are evaluating the effectiveness of using proton\n      radiation delivered to reduce side effects associated with radiation treatment. The\n      investigators will also be assessing the late side effects experienced by participants in\n      each treatment group."
