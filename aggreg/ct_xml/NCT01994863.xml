    <description>Excretion of faeces (output) which seeps between the skin and the adhesive side of the base plate (the side which is in contact with the skin).
To identify the leakage under the base plate the following must be fulfilled:
The output appears on the base plate minimum 5 mm from the hole in the base plate.
The adhesive side of the base plate is discolored.</description>

    <description>The subjects are randomised to test Coloplast Test product first and thereafter test Standard Care.
Standard Care is a collection of three different already marketed 1-piece flat ostomy appliances. These are Coloplast Sensura 1-piece; Hollister: Moderma 1-piece and B.Braun Flexima 1-piece.
The three Standard Care products were tested in a 1:1:1 randomisation.</description>
