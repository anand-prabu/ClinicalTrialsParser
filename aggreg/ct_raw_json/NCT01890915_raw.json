Impaired\n      thermoregulation leaves persons with tetraplegia more susceptible to hyperthermia than\n      able-bodied persons (AB). There has been a paucity of work addressing the thermoregulatory\n      responses of persons with SCI to hot ambient temperatures, and even less study addressing\n      the effect of these temperatures on cognitive performance. The goals of this pilot study\n      are: to improve our understanding of the thermoregulatory mechanisms of individuals with\n      tetraplegia when exposed to heat and to determine the effect of impaired thermoregulatory\n      mechanisms on cognitive performance during exposure to 35\u00b0C for up to 2 hours. In order to\n      address our goals we have designed a study methodology which consists of comparing the\n      physiological and psychological responses of the two study groups (tetraplegia versus AB\n      controls) from thermoneutral (27\u00b0C) to hot (35\u00b0C) environments."
