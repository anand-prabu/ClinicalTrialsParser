Secondary endpoints are the\n      evaluation of secondary caries, plaque accumulation and gingival reactions and the\n      comparison of the primary score at week 1, month 6, month 12 and month 24 after restoration.\n      Beside this, the single components of the three categories of the primary endpoints will be\n      compared. The study will be executed as a multi-center (Oregon Health & Science University,\n      Portland, OR, USA and Medical School Hannover, Hannover, Germany), single-blinded and\n      randomized clinical investigation. 90 comparable cavities per study site will be treated (45\n      cavities for each material at each site)."
