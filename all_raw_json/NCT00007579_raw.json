To determine whether screening behavior differs in men diagnosed with early stage\n      prostate cancer versus those with later stage disease as well as to determine if screening\n      behavior differences exist between blacks and whites.\n\n      Primary Outcomes: The primary outcomes are pesticide, occupational and chemical exposure,\n      and dietary history. Other major endpoints include: 1) familial aggregation of prostate\n      cancer; 2) weight, weight history, and weight cycling; 3) subject's knowledge, attitudes,\n      and behaviors about prostate cancer; and 4) treatment choices.\n\n      Intervention: N/A\n\n      Study Abstract: Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in American men. Among\n      African Americans the incidence and mortality from prostate cancer is even greater. Although\n      incidence rates in the Southern United States tend to be only slightly higher than that of\n      the nation, a clear discrepancy exists between national mortality rates and those in the\n      Southeastern United States. Notably high rates, particularly among African Americans are\n      observed and in North Carolina the prostate cancer mortality rate among African Americans is\n      the highest of any state in the nation. In spite of these statistics, very little is known\n      about racially based differences in the etiology of this disease.\n\n      This study hypothesizes that racial differences in the incidence and mortality of prostate\n      cancer may be a result of multiple factors including those that are socioeconomic,\n      environmental, dietary and genetic. This research will provide insight into\n      gene-environmental interactions that initiate and promote prostatic neoplasia as well as\n      address whether there are differences in patterns of care which impact morbidity and\n      survival. The results of this study will also be compared to findings in non-veterans that\n      are being generated through an NCI-funded sister study of these issues under the direction\n      of co-investigator, Dr. JoEllen Schildkraut of Duke University.\n\n      Subjects were identified from pathology reports extracted from VISTA. Additionally, subjects\n      were identified by reviewing radiation/oncology clinic records for those subjects referred\n      for radiation treatment. Subject enrollment concluded with 100 cases and 98 controls\n      enrolled in the study"

It has been determined\n      that pathology reports alone are not a sufficient source of identifying cases because not\n      all patients coming to VA for treatment have diagnostic pathology completed at the Durham\n      VA. Therefore, we have added additional protocols for subject identification such as\n      reviewing radiation/oncology clinic records for those subjects referred for radiation\n      treatment. To-date, 78 cases and 66 controls have been enrolled in the study. To increase\n      accrual rates, in-home visits have been used when necessary, and the Richmond, VA and\n      Asheville, NC VAMCs have been added as participating study sites. Due to patient accrual\n      problems and project staffing changes, the Durham ERIC has granted this study a six-month,\n      no-cost extension through 7/31/2001."
