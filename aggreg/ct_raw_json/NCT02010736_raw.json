The kinematic\n      parameters were assessed in three phases: before training (PRE); immediately after training\n      (POST); and 5 minutes after the end of training (FOLLOW UP).\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that the treadmill gait training with additional lower limb\n      loading would be a disturbance capable of modifying the locomotor strategy of children with\n      SHCP, by the increase in kinematic parameters in the swing phase of gait."

With respect to angular variables, the following parameters was analysed: angular displacement (maximum flexion, maximum  extension and range of motion) of the hip and knee were investigated (\u00ba).",
