    <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) is measured using an Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale (ETDRS scale) at 4m. The BCVA score at 6 and 24 months visits will be used.

    <description>All patients enrolled in the study (155 patients) will start in this main group. They will receive 6 ranibizumab injections (one per month from baseline to month 5, 0.5 mg of ranibizumab per injection). After this intensive follow up phase, injection will be done every 3 months until month 24. If a patient does not meet the criteria to stay in the main group, he/she will be directed to the rescue group, where monitoring and treatment is recommended to be performed according to the SmPC of Lucentis® (ranibizumab) (PRN with monthly follow up)</description>

    <intervention_name>Main group</intervention_name>
    <description>Patient will start in the main group with 6 monthly ranimizumab IVTs until month 5. Additional mandatory IVTs will be done at months 8 and 11. At months 14, 17, 20 and 23, IVTs will be done if BCVA loss is comprised between 9 and 5 letters (included). If patient did not loose more than 4 letters, no injection has to be performed at the visit. Criteria to stay in the main group are : 1°) at Month 3, 4 letters (included) improvement compared to baseline (Day 0) OR an improvement in CSF ≥ 0.1 log OCT compared to baseline (Day 0); 2°) at Month 6, a stable VA is obtained based on the months 4, 5 and 6 BCVA score; 3°) at Months 8, 11, 14, 17, 20 and 23, no BCVA decrease by more than 10 letters (excluded) compared with the highest BCVA score since the beginning of the study.</description>
