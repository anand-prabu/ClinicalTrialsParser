  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will determine the effectiveness of nitrite, a naturally occurring
      compound in the body, for improving the health and function of arteries in middle-aged and
      older adults. The study also will provide insight into how sodium nitrite therapy improves
      artery health by determining the physiological mechanisms (biological reasons) involved.
      Overall, the proposed research will provide important new scientific evidence on the
      effectiveness of sodium nitrite for decreasing the risk of developing cardiovascular
      diseases with aging.

      The improvement in blood vessel function and stiffness will be determined over a 10 week
      period. Subjects will be randomly assigned to either placebo (0 mg/day), low dose (80
      mg/day) or high dose (160 mg/day) sodium nitrite. Main outcome measures will be performed at
      baseline, week 4, and week 10.
