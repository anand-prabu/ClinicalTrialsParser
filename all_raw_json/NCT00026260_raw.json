Treatment repeats weekly in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 19-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 8-23\n      months."
