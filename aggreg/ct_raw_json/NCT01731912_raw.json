To determine the effect of degarelix acetate on androgen-regulated gene expression and\n      apoptosis as assessed by immunohistochemistry, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA)\n      microarray analysis and reverse transcriptase (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR).\n      (Exploratory)\n\n      II.
