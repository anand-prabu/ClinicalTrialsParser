So it is critical to develop a method to identify the\n      response subgroup. In this study, it is assumed that nasal physiological responsiveness to\n      leukotriene nasal provocation test (NPT) is able to gain evidence on the effect of\n      leukotriene on the development of allergic rhinitis and asthma, and is helpful to the use of\n      anti-leukotriene agent. The purpose of the study is to establish the methodology and\n      diagnostic value of leukotriene D4 (LTD4) nasal provocation."
