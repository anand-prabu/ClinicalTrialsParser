            "textblock": "CCTA is a very important clinical method for the clinical evaluation of patients with chest\n      pain of potential cardiac ischemic origin. However Coronary calcification and/or previously\n      implanted coronary stents may limit the diagnostic accuracy of CCTA. A novel approach -\n      coronary calcium subtraction - has been developed to potentially overcome this limitation.\n\n        -  Study Objective: To assess diagnostic accuracy using coronary calcium subtraction\n           coronary CT angiography (CCTA) as compared to conventional CCTA.\n\n        -  Material and Methods: A total of 200 patients with suspected or known coronary artery\n           disease (CAD) who have been referred for invasive coronary angiography (ICA) will prior\n           to ICA undergo additional research CCTA with the newly developed coronary calcium\n           subtraction protocol. Based on the coronary calcium scan (CS), coronary calcium score\n           will be calculated according to the Agatston score. Conventional contrast enhanced CCTA\n           studies will be analyzed for image quality and the presence and extent of coronary\n           stenosis. Using a dedicated algorithm, subtraction will be performed on all datasets to\n           obtain CCTA subtraction images. Subtracted images will be analyzed similar to the\n           conventional CCTA images. ICA will serve as the gold standard. Image quality will be\n           compared between conventional and subtracted CCTA. In addition, diagnostic accuracy in\n           the evaluation of coronary stenosis as determined on ICA will be compared. Finally,\n           factors influencing the performance of coronary calcium subtraction will be evaluated."
