  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OPC-41061 will be administered to patients with volume overload associated with cancer,
      first by dose-escalation and subsequently for 6 consecutive days at the fixed dose at which
      urine volume is increased to investigate efficacy, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamic
      effects, and safety and to determine the effective initial and maintenance doses of
      OPC-41061.

             ongoing chemotherapy or other therapies for cancer (eg, improvement of carcinomatous
             ascites or development of edema due to adverse events related to therapeutic
             interventions other than OPC-41061)
