Obesity is considered a low-grade\n      systemic inflammatory condition through 1) production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by\n      adipose tissue and 2) alterations in intestinal microbiota composition and associated\n      increase in intestinal permeability. Healthcare costs related to these diseases are rising;\n      prevention or delay of onset of disorders associated with overweight is needed.\n      Administration of wheat arabinoxylans (NAXUS), a non-digestible carbohydrate, may change the\n      intestinal microbiota composition and have beneficial effects on gut epithelial barrier,\n      especially on permeability and innate immune function.\n\n      Objective: To assess the effects of NAXUS on intestinal barrier function, immune system\n      performance and metabolic control. Prebiotic properties of NAXUS will be studied. Tolerance\n      of the product in different doses will also be investigated."
