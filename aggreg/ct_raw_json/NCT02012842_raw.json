The clinical trial will consist of an arm\n      where it will be immediately periodontal treatment (test group) and another arm which will\n      be held later periodontal treatment (control group). The study will last six months , and\n      after this period, the control group will receive the same treatment to the test group . A\n      socio-demographic questionnaire will be applied by a trained interviewer , so that data on\n      income, education , behavioral habits , medical and dental history . Complete periodontal\n      examination will be conducted at 6 sites per tooth for all teeth present at baseline and 3\n      and 6 months after periodontal treatment . In addition to the tests required for the\n      diagnosis of metabolic syndrome , will be asked the same blood tests at 3 and 6 months after\n      periodontal treatment (total cholesterol , LDL and HDL , fasting glucose , triglycerides ,\n      C-reactive protein). Aliquots of plasma from blood collected in each experimental point are\n      stored at -80 \u00b0 C for analysis of interleukin- 6, Tumor Necrosis Factor- \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) ,\n      Glucagon Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) and adiponectin. At each clinical examination will be\n      collected gingival crevicular fluid , supra and subgingival biofilm . Versions of the\n      questionnaires validated in Brazil (OHIP-14)and WHOQoL Bref will be applied to assess\n      quality of life at baseline and after 6 months of the study . The primary outcome will be\n      change in glycated hemoglobin and secondary outcomes will be changes in serum fibrinogen and\n      C-reactive protein.The hypothesis of this study considers that periodontal treatment can\n      alter the serum levels of C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and glycosylated hemoglobin in\n      patients with metabolic syndrome and thereby contribute to improved quality of life. The\n      objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of periodontal treatment on systemic\n      inflammation and quality of life of individuals with metabolic syndrome."

A questionnaire with\n      some key questions will be repeated in 10 % of the sample within seven days after the first\n      application in order to check the reproducibility of the instrument.\n\n      Complete periodontal examination will be conducted at 6 sites per tooth for all teeth\n      present at baseline and 3 and 6 months after periodontal treatment. The examination will be\n      conducted by two examiners trained and calibrated.
