    <textblock>
      Patients are being asked to take place in this research study because they have advanced
      prostate cancer that has gotten worse after other treatments.  If they join this study they
      will receive a new combination of drugs that are used to treat prostate cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Abiraterone acetate and cabazitaxel have been approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to treat prostate cancer that has spread to other parts of the body
      such as the lymph nodes or bone.  These drugs are approved individually for use when the
      cancer has become resistant to other treatments, including chemotherapy with docetaxel.  The
      combination of these two drugs has not been approved, so the research team will study the
      safety and effectiveness of the combination.

      Patients are being asked to participate in this study because their tumor has grown or
      spread during therapy.  Patients may benefit from a new combination of drugs to treat it.
      Abiraterone acetate and prednisone have been shown to prevent the growth of prostate cancer
      cells by lowering the level of testosterone in the blood.  It works in different areas of
      the body to block the production of this hormone that signals the cancer cells to grow.
      Cabazitaxel and prednisone prevent cancer cells from growing by blocking certain structures
      from functioning properly in the cell.  These structures help cells divide and therefore
      grow.  By blocking their function, the cell will not be able to divide and will die.
