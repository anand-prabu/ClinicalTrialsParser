Significant heart, liver, kidney, blood or respiratory disease.\n\n          2. Active coronary disease.\n\n          3. Pregnancy.\n\n          4. Alcohol or drug abuse.\n\n          5.

Systolic blood pressure <100 or >150, diastolic blood pressure <60 or >90.  This\n             range is smaller than the acceptable range stated in the prescribing information for\n             sildenafil (>90/50 and <170/110).\n\n          4. Peripheral vascular disease.\n\n          5. Use of a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor.\n\n        Exclusion criteria (growth hormone/placebo group)\n\n          1. Coumadin because of the risk of bleeding with daily injections of   Recombinant Human\n             Growth Hormone (rhGH) in the growth hormone (GH) arm of the study.\n\n          2. Subjects who are deficient in cortisol or thyroid at screening will be excluded until\n             hormone abnormalities have been corrected.\n\n          3. Subjects with chronic pain who are being managed with narcotics will be excluded as\n             the effects of central nervous system depressants may interfere with study test\n             results."
