To assess the safety of EDR DLI for high-risk hematologic malignancies as measured by\n      cumulative incidence of severe grade III-IV acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).\n\n      III. To measure outcomes of grade II-IV acute GVHD, non-relapse mortality, overall survival\n      and chronic GVHD of EDR DLI.\n\n      IV. To assess the full donor chimerism rate in the CD3 compartment and immune reconstitution\n      after EDR DLI.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive DLI intravenously (IV). Treatment repeats every 4-8 weeks for 5 doses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 2 years."
