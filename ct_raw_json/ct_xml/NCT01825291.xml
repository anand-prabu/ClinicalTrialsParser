      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of CPAP treatment to
      co-morbidities of sleep apnea by looking the change of the consumption of medication of the
      co-morbidities before and after starting the CPAP treatment.

    <textblock>
      Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is frequently linked with cardiovascular diseases including
      stroke and type 2 diabetes, which increase the indirect costs of sleep apnea. Also
      non-cardiovascular co-morbidities are possible but seldom studied. CPAP treatment reverses
      the increased healthcare utilization seen before the sleep apnea diagnosis.

      Previous studies addressing the cardiovascular co-morbidities in SDB have focused on
      obstructive sleep apnea and in male populations, but not on partial upper airway
      obstruction. Partial upper airway obstruction is common in both genders but especially in
      women. According to investigators' clinical experience, women with partial upper airway
      obstruction are especially likely to have severe symptoms from their SDB. There are scarce
      data on cardiovascular co-morbidities associated with partial upper airway obstruction and
      the female gender.

      To study the prevalence of co-morbidities adding to the burden of SDB (periodic obstructive
      breathing and partial upper airway obstruction), investigators applied a conservative but
      robust strategy using the governmental database of medication reimbursed by the public
      health insurance system. Investigators analyzed both the cardiovascular and
      non-cardiovascular co-morbidities in our clinical population of SDB, separately in patients
      with periodic obstructive breathing or with partial upper airway obstruction during
      sleep.Investigators found that concomitant diseases ware common in SDB. Asthma and/or COPD
      were surprisingly frequent, and also chronic hypertension had an increased prevalence. In
      addition, males had diabetes mellitus and females hypothyroidism more than general
      population. The results emphasize the importance of diagnosis and treatment of the
      co-morbidities such as asthma, COPD, hypertension, diabetes and thyroid insufficiency
      regardless if the patient has partial upper airway obstruction or obstructive sleep apnea.

      Now, investigators hypothesize that CPAP treatment reduces the consumption of medication of
      the co-morbidities of sleep apnea. Therefore, a retrospective analyze of 5 year before and 5
      year after starting the CPAP treatment the medication consumption of the same population
      previously used will be conducted. To do this, the governmental database of medication
      reimbursed by the public health insurance system will be used.
