The other type of anesthesia is\n      called \"regional anesthesia\" (RA), or \"nerve blocks\" which numb up the nerves that supply\n      the breast area. By doing this type of anesthesia, subjects often don't go \"to sleep\" with a\n      breathing tube, instead, they get heavy IV sedation and take a \"deep nap\" during the\n      surgery."
