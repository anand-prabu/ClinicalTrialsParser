Different needling techniques, including the use of Botulinum Toxin A are\n      proposed for the management of spasticity. The presence of spasticity in the lower extremity\n      implies several impairments for standing and walking inducing high disability. No study has\n      investigated the effects of deep dry needling inserted into the targeted spastic musculature\n      in patients with stroke. The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial\n      investigating the effects of a single session of deep dry needling over the musculature of\n      the leg on spasticity, widespread pressure pain sensitivity and plantar pressures\n      (baropodometry) in individuals with chronic stroke. The investigators hypothesize that\n      patients receiving a single session of dry needling would exhibit a greater reduction in\n      spasticity and pressure sensitivity than those who will not receive the intervention."
