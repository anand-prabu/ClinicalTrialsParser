            "textblock": "Background:  Patients hospitalized with complex chronic conditions frequently experience\n      preventable short-term readmissions due to inadequate transition support.  Although\n      structured discharge planning with telephone follow-up improves transition outcomes, these\n      services often are unavailable, and proactive outreach is often inadequate once the patient\n      returns home.  Informal caregivers are invaluable for ensuring successful transitions, but\n      many patients live alone, have an in-home caregiver who is struggling with competing\n      demands, or live at a distance from adult children or other potential sources of support.\n      New models are needed for transition support that include low-cost technologies and more\n      structured assistance for patients' informal caregiving network, while providing patients'\n      clinical teams with the information they need to avert health crises.\n\n      Objectives: Consistent with Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality goals to improve\n      transitions using accessible health IT, we will evaluate a novel intervention designed to\n      improve the effectiveness of transition support for common chronic conditions via three\n      mechanisms of action: (a) direct tailored communication to patients via automated calls post\n      discharge, (b) support for informal caregivers via structured feedback about the patient's\n      status and advice about how they can help, and (c) support for proactive care management\n      including a web-based disease management tool, automated alerts about potential problems,\n      and the capacity for asynchronous communication with patients and their caregivers.\n      Specifically, the trial will determine: 1) whether the CarePartner intervention improves\n      patients' readmission risk and functional status; 2) the impact of the intervention on\n      patients' self-care behaviors and the quality of the transition process; and 3) whether the\n      intervention improves caregiver burden and stress levels."

            "textblock": "Methods: 422 adults with complex chronic conditions will be identified upon admission to a\n      university-based acute care general medical service.  Patients will be asked to identify a\n      CarePartner (CP) living outside their household; CPs will be spouses, adult children, and\n      others in their social network willing to play an active role in their transition support.\n      Patients will be randomized to the intervention or usual care. Intervention patients will\n      receive automated assessment and behavior change calls, and their CPs will receive\n      structured feedback and advice following each assessment.  Patients' clinical team will have\n      access to patients' assessment results via the web, will receive automated reports about\n      urgent health problems, and will be able to communicate asynchronously with patients and CPs\n      using a secure web page and a specially designed voicemail service.  Patients will complete\n      surveys at baseline, 30- and 90- days post discharge; utilization data will be obtained from\n      hospital records.  CPs and clinicians will be interviewed to evaluate intervention effects\n      on processes of self-care support, caregiver stress and communication, and the\n      intervention's potential for broader implementation.  The primary outcome will be 30 day\n      readmission rates; 2ndary outcomes include functional status, self-care behaviors, and\n      mortality risk."
