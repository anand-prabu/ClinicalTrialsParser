Determine which cognitive test\n      variable will be most strongly associated with self and informant reports of cognition.  3.\n      Determine which MRI metric will be most strongly related to neuropsychological test\n      performance 4. Determine the degree to which allocentric visual memory is related to\n      functional connectivity on fMRI."
