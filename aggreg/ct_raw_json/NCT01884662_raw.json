It is usually described as burning or stabbing, and is\n      located at or below the level at which their sensation changes from normal to impaired;\n      persons with no feeling at all in their legs for example can experience pain in the legs.\n      The purpose of this project is to further investigate the use of a novel visual stimulation\n      treatment; a technique that has shown benefit in other populations with chronic pain\n      secondary to deafferentation. To accomplish this, a novel treatment -  virtual reality (VR)\n      walking - will be examined.  Should this treatment show benefit, a portable, accessible\n      means of treatment will be available for persons with SCI and for whom transportation to\n      health care providers is often difficult."

These approaches involve\n      the person viewing a mirror image of their intact limb to produce the visual illusion of a\n      return of the missing limb, often with a marked reduction in pain following.  Investigations\n      have demonstrated that such approaches reduce pain in some individuals and that this change\n      is associated with reversal of the functional reorganization in the somatosensory cortex.\n      There has been one study of neuropathic pain in SCI that demonstrated good neuropathic pain\n      relief with a mirror image of the upper half of the individual with SCI with the lower half\n      of their body represented by a rear projection screen generated image of walking legs.  We\n      have collaborated with this author, and developed and pilot tested a virtual walking DVD\n      that is presented via virtual reality goggles to enhance the first person sense of\n      immersion.  Results were sufficiently encouraging to cause us to seek funding for current,\n      broader project"
