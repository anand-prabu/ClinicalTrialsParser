The duration of the study is supposed to start from Jan 5th 2012 and last to Dec 2014,\n      until 100 or more cases are accessible. Patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer,\n      peri-ampullar carcinoma or other benign or malignant diseases which need to operate\n      pancreaticoduodenectomy will be included. Main outcomes are pancreatic fistula rate,\n      mortality, morbidity, reoperation and hospital stay. The investigators assumption that\n      duct-to-mucosa is better than invagination."
