            "textblock": "Children receiving chemotherapy for cancer at the Jimmy Everest Center for Cancer and Blood\n      Disorders in Children also often receive an IV dose of an antiemetic for prophylaxis.  The\n      most common antiemetics used are in the family of 5HT3 antagonists, specifically granisetron\n      and ondansetron.  Prior to a recent recommendation by the FDA, we have used ondansetron 0.45\n      mg/kg IV.  Based on adult ECG data, the recommended dose of ondansetron has been changed to\n      no greater than 0.15 mg/kg.  We have prior studies showing that the bigger dose is better at\n      preventing nausea and vomiting.  Therefore we are studying ECG data in patients receiving\n      ondansetron and chemotherapy.  Each subject will have two identical cycles of chemotherapy.\n      Prior to the first of the two cycles they will be randomized to receive one of two doses of\n      ondansetron with the first cycle and the other dose with the second cycle.  The two doses\n      are the recommended dose of 0.15 mg/kg and a higher dose of 0.3 mg/kg.  The dose level the\n      patient receives each cycle will be blinded to the investigator and the subject.\n\n      Prior to the first dose of investigational ondansetron, the patient will have an ECG.  This\n      ECG will be repeated 30 minutes after the ondansetron is administered and just before\n      chemotherapy administration, and repeated again 30 minutes later.  The change in the QTc\n      intervals will be calculated by two independent pediatric cardiologists who are also blinded\n      to the ondansetron dose level received.  This process will be repeated with the next course\n      of chemotherapy, with the second dose of ondansetron.  Our goal is to see if there is an\n      appreciable difference between the two doses in the QTc interval changes they induce."
