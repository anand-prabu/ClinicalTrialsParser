            "textblock": "Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, invades the central nervous system\n      in about 40% of patients with syphilis. This happens early after infection. Patients with\n      neuroinvasion are at risk of developing serious neurological complications, including vision\n      or hearing loss, stroke and dementia. Because neuroinvasion can happen without symptoms, the\n      only way to identify it is by performing a lumbar puncture (LP) to examine cerebrospinal\n      fluid (CSF).The overall hypothesis to be tested in this study is that a strategy of\n      immediate LP, followed by therapy based on CSF evaluation, results in better serological and\n      functional outcomes in HIV-infected patients with syphilis who are at high risk for\n      neuroinvasion."
