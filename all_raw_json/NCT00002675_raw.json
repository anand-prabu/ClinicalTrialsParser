            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the response rate to adjuvant carboplatin (CBDCA) alone in children\n      with intraocular retinoblastoma. II. Assess the overall survival, disease-free survival, and\n      time to treatment failure in these patients. III. Attempt to maintain a 90% disease-free\n      survival rate with this treatment. IV. Estimate the percentage of disease-free survivors who\n      do not require the use of radiotherapy after adjuvant CBDCA. V. Assess the toxicity of this\n      treatment. VI. Estimate the percentage of functional eyes salvaged using this\n      radiation-sparing protocol and compare these results, in a nonrandomized manner, with\n      historical treatment results in this population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to vitreous disease (yes vs no). Patients receive\n      carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 0. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for 2 courses.\n      Patients achieving complete response (CR) proceed to local control measures consisting of\n      cryotherapy, laser photocoagulation, etc. (except brachytherapy). Patients not achieving CR\n      continue with carboplatin until local control measures feasible. Patients with vitreous\n      disease achieving CR receive 2 additional courses and then receive local control measures.\n      Patients with vitreous disease not achieving CR receive intensive chemotherapy. Patients\n      receive intensive chemotherapy consisting of vincristine IV on days 0, 7, and 14, cisplatin\n      IV over 6 hours on day 0, etoposide IV on days 1 and 2, followed by cyclophosphamide IV over\n      60 minutes on days 1 and 2. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on\n      day 3 and until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-4 weeks for 2 courses beyond\n      CR. Patients are followed for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study over 5-6 years."
