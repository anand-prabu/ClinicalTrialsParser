      The purpose of this signal seeking study is to determine whether treatment with dovitinib
      (TKI258) demonstrates sufficient efficacy in select pathway-activated solid tumors and/or
      hematologic malignancies to warrant further study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II, open label study to determine the efficacy and safety of treatment with
      dovitinib (TKI258) in patients with a diagnosis of select solid tumors or hematological
      malignancies that have been pre-identified (prior to study consent) to have mutations,
      translocations or pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib and whose disease has
      progressed on or after standard treatment.

      Genomic profiling is becoming more accessible to patients and their physicians. As such,
      more patients have been identified with potentially-actionable mutations, translocations or
      pathway-activations but do not have access to targeted drug treatment. This is a
      signal-seeking study to match patients with tumor pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib
      to the RTK inhibitor dovitinib. Pre-identification of mutations, translocations, or tumor
      pathway activations inhibited by dovitinib will be performed locally at a CLIA certified
      laboratory prior to participation on the trial.

      Once the patient has been identified, treating physicians who are qualified investigators
      may contact Novartis to consider enrollment in this study. For the purpose of this study,
      genomic profiling is not considered part of screening. Informed consent must be signed
      before any screening activities take place. Once eligibility (screening criteria met) has
      been confirmed by Novartis, the patient will initiate therapy with dovitinib single-agent.
      The patient may not receive any additional anti-cancer therapy during treatment with
      dovitinib.

      Patients will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression (assessed by
      RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematologic response criteria), unacceptable toxicity, death or
      discontinuation from study treatment for any other reason (e.g., withdrawal of consent,
      start of a new anti-neoplastic therapy or at the discretion of the investigator), otherwise
      known as End of Treatment. All patients who discontinue from study treatment due to disease
      progression must have their progression clearly documented.

      Disease assessment (by RECIST 1.1 or appropriate hematological response assessment criteria)
      will be performed every 8 weeks (±4 days) after first dose of study drug (Day 1 of every odd
      cycle), until disease progression or end of treatment, whichever occurs first.  The
      frequency of disease assessment may be reduced to every 12 weeks for patients who have at
      least 4 post-baseline disease assessments and are clinically stable (except AML patients).
      Scans will be assessed locally by the investigator.  After discontinuation of treatment,
      patients, regardless of reason for treatment discontinuation, will be followed for safety
      for 30 days after the last dose.

      All patients will be followed for survival status every 3 months for 2 years after the last
      patient has enrolled in the study,regardless of treatment discontinuation reason (except if
      consent is withdrawn or patient is lost to follow-up)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a confirmed diagnosis of a select solid tumor (except primary diagnosis
             of urothelial tumors, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), endometrial carcinoma,
             metastatic breast cancer (mBC), squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and
             renal cell carcinoma (RCC)) or hematologic malignancies (except primary diagnosis of
             FLT3 AML or multiple myeloma) and is in need of treatment because of progression or
             relapse. Additional tumor types may be excluded during the course of the study in the
             case of early futility or success based upon an interim analysis.

             activation inhibited by dovitinib at a CLIA certified laboratory

          -  Patient must have received at least one prior treatment for recurrent, metastatic and
             /or locally advanced disease and for whom no standard therapy options are anticipated
             to result in a durable remission.

          -  Patient must have progressive and measurable disease as per RECIST 1.1. or other
             appropriate hematological guidelines.

          -  Patient has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status ≤ 1

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has received prior treatment with dovitinib (TKI258)

          -  Patients with brain metastasis or history of brain metastasis or leptomeningeal
             carcinomatosis

          -  Patient has received chemotherapy or targeted anticancer therapy ≤ 4 weeks (6 weeks
             for nitrosourea, antibodies or mitomycin-C) prior to starting study drug.

          -  Patient is currently receiving prasugrel, clopidogrel, or full dose anticoagulation
             treatment with therapeutic doses of warfarin. However, treatment with low doses of
             warfarin (e.g., ≤2 mg/day) or locally accepted low doses of acetylsalicylic acid (up
             to 100 mg daily) to prevent cardiovascular events or strokes is allowed.
