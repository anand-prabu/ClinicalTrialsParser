In this\n      context, \"integrative\" refers to a combined approach of complementary and conventional\n      medical therapies in an evidence-based fashion.\n\n      Design: cluster trial; 2-arm controlled evaluation study in pediatric oncology. Intervention\n      will be offered during a 6-month PIM period following a 6 month control period.\n\n      Population: Inclusion criteria: (i) In-patients in pediatric oncology and (ii) informed\n      consent/assent. Exclusion criteria: (i) lack of parent participation, fluency in English, or\n      informed consent\n\n      Intervention: Recommendations for specific CAM therapies will be determined by a staff PIM\n      pediatrician. Any combination of the following CAM therapies (dose, duration, amount to be\n      based on patient need as assessed by CAM provider, patient, and parent):\n      acupuncture/acupressure, massage, Reiki; all are to be offered in addition to usual care.\n\n      Control: Usual care.\n\n      Outcomes: Primary outcome: feasibility (i.e enrollment); Secondary outcomes: (i) PNVA\n      symptom management, (ii) need for conventional pharmacotherapy, (iii) adverse events; (iv)\n      parent and health care provider satisfaction with care provided, v) length of stay; and vi)\n      cost-effectiveness (analysis of this outcome to be limited to patients admitted for at least\n      2 days and for not more than 30 days).\n\n      Significance: To our knowledge, this study will be the first comparative effectiveness trial\n      to assess the impact of PIM for hospitalized children with cancer."
