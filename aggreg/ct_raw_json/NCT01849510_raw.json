Local tumor control after\n      palliative radiotherapy of spinal metastases (10x3 Gy, 1x8Gy) is between 61 to 81%. In 30%\n      of patients, therapy fails locally within two years associated with further symptoms that\n      are difficult to treat, because a further radiation of already radiated vertebra leads to a\n      higher rate of myelitis. This trial aims to improve local tumor control and control of pain\n      by radiotherapy with increase in total and single dose. Dose elevation is realized by\n      simultaneous, integrated boost mediated by image-guided stereotactic radiotherapy (IGRT &\n      hfSRT) and by elevation of elective dose in vertebral body with 12x3 Gy (standard: 10x3 Gy).\n      Primary endpoint is local tumor control after 24 months. Secondary endpoints are pain\n      control associated with quality of live, severity of acute and chronic adverse effects and\n      overall survival. It is planned to recruit a total number of 130 patients."
