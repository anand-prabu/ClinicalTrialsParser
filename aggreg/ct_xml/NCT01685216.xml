    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase (GCB).  Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes
      based on the presence or absence of neurological symptoms and the severity of these
      neurological symptoms.  Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological
      deterioration, and those with type 3 disease typically display a more sub acute neurological
      course. Type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all
      Gaucher disease cases, does not involve the central nervous system.

      The purpose of this clinical research study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness
      of velaglucerase alfa in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.

    <textblock>
      Gaucher disease is a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by the deficiency of the enzyme
      glucocerebrosidase (GCB).  Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside
      accumulates within the macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ
      system dysfunction. Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on
      the presence or absence of neurological symptoms and severity of neurological symptoms.
      Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, and
      those with type 3 Gaucher disease typically display a more sub acute neurological course;
      type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases, does
      not involve the central nervous system.

      Velaglucerase alfa is an approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for pediatric and adult
      patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.  ERTs have been proven to reduce organomegaly, improve
      hematological parameters and positively impact health-related quality of life; ERTs have not
      been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and as a result have shown limited ability to
      improve the neurological (Central Nervous System; CNS) manifestations associated with
      Gaucher disease.

      This study will provide a basis for exploring the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa
      in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease.

        Inclusion Criteria: Each patient must meet the following criteria to be enrolled in this
        study.

          1. The patient has a confirmed diagnosis of type 3 Gaucher disease.

          2. The patient is ≥ 2 and &lt; 18 years of age at the time of enrollment.

          3. The patient is either näive to treatment or has not received treatment
             (investigational or approved) for Gaucher disease within 12 months prior to study
             entry.

          4. The patient has Gaucher disease-related anemia, defined as hemoglobin concentration
             below the lower limit of normal for age and sex.

             AND ONE OR MORE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE CRITERIA

               -  The patient has at least moderate splenomegaly (2 to 3 cm below the left costal
                  margin) by palpation.

               -  The patient has Gaucher disease-related thrombocytopenia, defined as platelet
