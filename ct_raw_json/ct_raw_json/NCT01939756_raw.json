The patients supply written informed consent to a document\n      describing the investigational nature of the protocol.\n\n      Induction treatment consists of an initial 6 intravesical BCG treatments at weekly interval\n      commencing approximately 3 weeks after transurethral resection procedures. The BCG\n      instillation consisted of 81 mg wet weight (10\u20222\u00b19\u20220 x 108 colony-forming units) BCG\n      Connaught substrain. Lyophilised (ie, freeze-dried) BCG is suspended in 50 mL\n      bacteriostatic-free solution of 0\u20229% sodium chloride. After draining of the bladder, the\n      suspension is infused intravesically through a Foley catheter. The solution is retained in\n      the bladder for 120 min, followed by emptying of the bladder and removal of the catheter.\n\n      During BCG treatment patients with persistent lower urinary tract symptoms unresponsive to\n      standard therapies (anticholinergics, alpha-blockers, antibiotics,  analgesics and\n      anti-inflammatory drugs) are treated with an intravesical instillation of 50 ml sterile\n      Baobab natural oil (Baotrophic, Physion Srl, Mirandola, Italy). After draining of the\n      bladder, the suspension is infused intravesically through a Foley catheter. The solution is\n      retained in the bladder for 60 min, followed by emptying of the bladder and removal of the\n      catheter.\n\n      Lower urinary tract symptoms are self-recorded by the patients before and after each baobab\n      oil  instillation and classified by the investigator according to a classification grid\n      considering account duration and intensity. The classification of symptoms is class 0= none,\n      class I = mild, class II = moderate, and class III = severe, according to severity. Local\n      adverse events are cystitis, nocturia, pollakiuria, micturition urgency, micturition\n      burning, stress urinary incontinence, dysuria, hematuria, pelvic pain, and perineal pain.\n      The outcome measures are analyzed before and every day for one week after treatment. All\n      patients are assessed for safety."
