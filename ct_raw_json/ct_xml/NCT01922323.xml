  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Samples of blood and urine will be collected from study participants at defined timepoints.
      The samples will be evaluated to study the metabolism of the regenerating liver after a
      portion of the liver has been donated from a living donor.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Potential donor must be in excellent medical and psychological health.

          2. Potential donor must be between the ages of 18 and 60.

          3. Must have a compatible blood type to the recipient.

          4. Must have health care coverage for non-donor related health issues that arise post
             donation

          5. Recipient and donor must have compatible body size.

          6. Donors Body Mass Index (BMI) must be less than 30.

          7. All previous donor abdominal surgeries will be reviewed on a case by case basis by
             the surgeon.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Positive blood test for Human Immunodeficiency Virus, Hepatitis C virus, Hepatitis B
             virus

          2. The size of the donor liver is not large enough to safely resection and still retain
             enough volume to function normally after the surgery.

          3. Liver biopsy show liver cirrhosis or early stages of HCC.
