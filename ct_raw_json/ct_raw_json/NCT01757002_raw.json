Vulnerable ethnic communities are disproportionately affected by asthma as\n      demonstrated by higher morbidity and mortality for these groups. We have completed two\n      school-based, randomized trials of a web-based, computer-tailored asthma management\n      intervention that targets urban teens (Puff City).\n\n      The current study, Puff City in the Clinic, will be evaluated as a clinical tool by\n      initiating the web-based behavioral intervention of asthma management in a clinical setting.\n      However, the current paradigm for conducting such a trial is costly with respect to patient\n      recruitment, intervention delivery, and data collection and management. To address these\n      high costs, the study utilizes comparative effectiveness research (CER) pragmatic approaches\n      to design a randomized controlled trial for patient recruitment and determination of\n      eligibility, study monitoring (compliance with study regimen, participant retention and\n      follow-up), and collection of clinical endpoints."
