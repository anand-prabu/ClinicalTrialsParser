On the Study Day, all\n      children will be given 3 different flavoured samples of Eslicarbazepine acetate (ESL) oral\n      suspension for tasting, in the sequence to which they were randomised, in a double-blind,\n      standardized setting. Each sample will consist of 2.5 mL and is to be given with a spoon in\n      a double-blind manner, and is not to be swallowed. After tasting and spitting out each\n      sample the child will be asked to rate the taste on a 10 cm visual analogue scale\n      incorporating a facial hedonic scale. At the end of the session, the child will also be\n      asked which flavour they thought tasted the best and which tasted the worst, to assess\n      overall taste. A follow-up telephone contact interview will be performed between 1 and 4\n      days after the Study Day to collect adverse event (AE) data."
