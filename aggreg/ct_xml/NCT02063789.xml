  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human immunoglobulin (Ig) is the most commonly used blood product. It has been well-defined
      the efficacy in patients with immunodeficiencies, Kawasaki disease, asthma and other immune
      diseases. It is expected that Ig 10% will improve the usefulness and safety profile compared
      to Ig 5% because it is expected the reduced hospitalization/treatment duration and less
      adverse events related to volume overload.

      GC5107A (IV-Globulin SN Inj. 10%) is a polyvalent intravenous human immunoglobulin G
      preparation. It is prepared from plasma collected from more than 1000 healthy blood donors
      and it expresses the large spectrum of antibody specificity.
