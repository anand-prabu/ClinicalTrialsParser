A diagnosis of PH (as determined by standard diagnostic methods).\n\n          3. Patient should be on a stable dialysis regimen for at least two weeks before\n             baseline.\n\n          4. Pre-dialysis plasma oxalate \u226540 micromole/L.\n\n          5. Subjects receiving vitamin B6 must be receiving a stable dose for at least 3 months\n             prior to entry into the study and must remain on the stable dose during the study.\n             Subjects not receiving vitamin B6 at study entry must be willing to refrain from\n             initiating vitamin B6 during study participation.\n\n             Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          6. Ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive medication.\n\n          7. The existence of secondary hyperoxaluria, e.g. hyperoxaluria due to bariatric surgery\n             or chronic gastrointestinal diseases such as cystic fibrosis, chronic inflammatory\n             bowel disease and short-bowel syndrome.\n\n          8. Use of antibiotics to which O. formigenes is sensitive (see section 7.2.2), including\n             current antibiotic use, or antibiotics use within 14 days of initiating study\n             medication.\n\n          9. Current treatment with a separate ascorbic acid preparation.\n\n         10. Pregnancy.\n\n         11.

Presence of a medical condition that the Principal Investigator considers likely to\n             make the subject susceptible to adverse effect of study treatment or unable to follow\n             study procedures.\n\n         13. Participation in any study of an investigational product, biologic, device, or other\n             agent within 30 days prior to the first dose of OC5 or not willing to forego other\n             forms of investigational treatment during this study."
