Blood samples, and complete collections of\n      dialysate, dialysis membrane (as necessary), urine (as available), and feces will be\n      analyzed for radioactivity content by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Following the\n      confinement period, subjects will return to the site on an outpatient basis in accordance to\n      their routine dialysis sessions up to day 39. Blood and dialysate samples and dialysis\n      membranes will be collected at specified times during the outpatient visit period."
