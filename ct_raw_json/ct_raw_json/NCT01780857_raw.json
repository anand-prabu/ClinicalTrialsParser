            "textblock": "This study is being done to learn more about a less common \"type\" of psoriasis, called\n      palmoplantar pustulosis (PPP). The majority of the current treatments used for this type of\n      psoriasis have only a moderate effect on PPP. Thus, the investigators believe that PPP may\n      be a different disease entity altogether, requiring different therapies. As such, the\n      investigators hope to discover an immune signature for this condition.\n\n      An immune \"signature\" is the unique way in which the combination of genes, cells, and\n      proteins of the immune system work for each person. Because both psoriasis and the type of\n      psoriasis patients have been diagnosed with, PPP, are conditions of abnormal immune system\n      function, it is important to understand the overall function of the immune system in this\n      condition (that is, find the immune \"signature\"). This study should help identify an immune\n      system \"signature\" in people with PPP.\n\n      The investigators have a laboratory technology which allows them to read the genetic\n      \"signatures\" of a person's blood cells. Genes contain the instructions for making living\n      things. Genes are contained in the cells' DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid). Most DNA is the same\n      among humans, but the small differences people have in their DNA may explain why people\n      develop different diseases. DNA and the genes it contains help produce RNA (ribonucleic\n      acid), which in turn helps make proteins in people's cells. Differences in the types of\n      proteins and the amount of those different proteins people's cells produce can affect a\n      person's immune system.\n\n      To help the investigators determine the immune \"signature\" in PPP, they will be examining\n      the different genes, cells, and proteins that are active in patients with PPP versus\n      patients who do not have the condition. The investigators will examine these genes, cells,\n      and proteins in skin (through a skin sample) and in blood (through a blood draw).  The goal\n      is to develop new treatments for this skin condition. To do this, the investigators need to\n      compare the skin and blood of patients with this particular type of psoriasis to the samples\n      of healthy patients."

BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE\n\n      Despite major advances in elucidating the molecular pathways of chronic plaque psoriasis\n      (CPP), the immunopathogenesis of PPP, a less common \"variant\" of psoriasis, remains elusive.\n      It is characterized by the development of inflammatory sterile pustules on the palms and\n      soles of affected individuals, which can be exceptionally painful, interfering with walking\n      and manual activities and impinging significantly on quality of life. Current systemic and\n      biologic treatments used to treat CPP have only a moderate effect in patients with PPP,\n      supporting the suggestion that PPP is a separate disease entity with a distinct\n      immunopathogenic basis. Moreover, the spontaneous paradoxical development of PPP is\n      frequently observed in patients treated with anti-tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 therapies, agents\n      typically used in the treatment of CPP. Genetic analysis also distinguishes patients with\n      PPP from those with CPP.\n\n      At the investigators' institution, microarray analyses of blood transcriptional patterns\n      have permitted crucial advances in characterizing the immunopathogenesis of immune-mediated\n      conditions such as systemic lupus erythematosis and systemic-onset juvenile idiopathic\n      arthritis. The investigators now wish to examine transcriptional profiles in the skin and\n      blood of patients with PPP to identify the immunopathogenesis of this condition and identify\n      potential therapeutic targets. The investigators will validate the findings at a cellular\n      and protein level using flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry and measuring serum levels of\n      proteins in the blood with Luminex or ELISA."
