  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease (CD) is an autoimmune disease of the small intestine caused by the
      consumption of gluten proteins from widely used food sources such as wheat, rye, and barley.
      Exposure of the small intestine to gluten causes an inflammatory response, leading to the
      destruction of intestine lining, often with severe symptoms including diarrhea, abdominal
      distention, fatigue, weight loss, anemia, and neurological symptoms. CD is a lifelong
      disease and the only treatment currently available is strict adherence to a life-time gluten
      free diet (GFD). However, adhering to this diet is difficult as gluten proteins are found in
      many food products. Therefore, the gluten-free diet has both lifestyle and financial
      implications for the individual and thus has been potential for impacting adversely on their
      quality of life.

      Various approaches are being studied to reduce the need for careful control of the diet for
      those with CD, including the use of antibodies such as IgY. IgY is produced from the egg
      yolks of super immunized laying hens. Egg yolk antibodies are natural products with minimal
      toxicity, for those without egg allergy, and offer low-cost, hygienic production of study
      product. Once the IgY antibody is put into capsule form, it is called AGY.

      Individuals with CD will be recruited only if they have a history of biopsy proven CD within
      5 years of study entry, currently follow a GFD but continue to have mild to moderate
      symptoms related to gluten exposure, and do not have an egg allergy. Blood will be tested
      for ATG antibody levels at screening, and an elevation will be required (confirming gluten
      exposure despite a presumed gluten free diet) to enter the study.  Those enrolled will have
      a 2 week run-in period where diet and symptoms are recorded, and will then receive AGY
      capsules to take with meals over a 4 week period. Outcomes will be measured by examining lab
      test results including antibody levels, symptoms, and quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will last approximately 6 weeks. Individuals will be screened to ensure they are
      following a gluten free diet, continue to have mild to moderate symptoms of gluten exposure
      despite the diet, have a history of biopsy proven celiac disease, and have an elevated ATG
      antibody level.  Those meeting this criteria will then have a baseline visit which will
      include a short physical exam and additional lab work for safety measures, and quality of
      life questionnaires.  They will record their diet and symptoms for 2 weeks, and then return
      to receive the study medication, which will be taken with all meals.  The first dose will be
      taken in clinic to facilitate observation of any adverse effects. The next visit will be 2
      weeks later for blood work and clinic visit, and then again 2 weeks later for the final
      visit.  Participants will be prompted to report any adverse events that occur during the
      trial period and at the completion of the trial. During the trial period, the study
      coordinator will phone participants  to remind them to complete their questionnaires and to
      inquire about adverse events. All participants will receive  AGY capsules (500 mg per
      capsule), and will take 2 capsules with each meal.

      Outcome measures The primary outcome variable will be the safety (adverse events, lab
      results, symptoms), which will be measured throughout the study.

      The secondary outcome will be ATG antibody levels, which will be measured at each visit.
