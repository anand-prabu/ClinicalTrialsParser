The participants will be hospitalized for 6 nights and 7 days. All the eligible\n      participants will receive Darunavir oral tablet on Day 3 and ritonavir capsule orally twice\n      daily from Day 1-5. Participants will keep upright position until 4 hours after study drug\n      administration. Both the drugs will be administered within 15 minutes after completion of\n      meal. Blood samples will be collected for evaluation of pharmacokinetics at pre-dose and\n      post-dose of study treatment. Participants' safety will be monitored throughout the study."
