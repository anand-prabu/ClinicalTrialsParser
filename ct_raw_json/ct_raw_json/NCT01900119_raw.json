People with SAA who receive these treatments are\n      more likely to get infections. Studies show that there might be a link between the bacteria\n      in your mouth and those bacteria that can cause infections. The bacteria found in the mouths\n      of patients with SAA will be described.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To understand the changes in mouth bacteria that are related to treatment and to describe\n      the oral bacterial environment.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Adults at least 18 years of age who are going to be treated for SAA.\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers at least 18 years of age.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will answer questions about their medical history and dental care. Their\n           mouths will be examined.\n\n        -  Participants with SAA will be tested during treatment for their disease, over the\n           course of 1 year. All participants with SAA will be tested at 3 scheduled appointments.\n           Any participants who require a breathing tube will receive additional  tests.\n\n        -  Healthy volunteers will be tested during  1 visit.\n\n        -  Participants will give two samples each time. A saliva sample will be taken with a\n           disposable padded tool. Skin cells will be collected from the tongue with a small\n           plastic brush."

            "textblock": "The mouth is a complex biological ecosystem normally containing over 700 different species\n      of bacteria. Some of these bacteria live in an exopolysacchride matrix biofilm and occupy\n      specific niches in this complex oral environment. Understanding the oral environment and the\n      microbiota that inhabit it will assist in determining their impact on health and disease.\n      There are several studies in critically ill patients demonstrating changes in oral bacteria\n      related to acute illness. Identification of respiratory pathogens in the mouth has led\n      researchers to hypothesize that a relationship exists between the oral cavity and pulmonary\n      infections. Identification of potential pathogens in the oral cavity of patients with severe\n      aplastic anemia could indicate a similar association between oral pathogens and infection in\n      patient who develop respiratory infections that are severe enough to require intubation.\n      This descriptive case-control study will characterize the oral microbiota of patients who\n      have severe aplastic anemia (SAA). Patients will be followed for 1 year after treatment for\n      development of respiratory symptoms that require intubation (cases). The cases will be\n      compared to two groups of controls, namely those SAA patients who did not require intubation\n      that received treatment for SAA and normal healthy volunteers who are age and gender\n      matched. A difference in the oral microbiome will be identified in specimens collected\n      before and after treatment and in those patients who require intubation."
