Determine whether arginine butyrate with or without epoetin alfa can\n      stimulate gamma-globin chain production to a degree that decreases anemia and results in\n      hematologic improvement in patients with thalassemia intermedia.\n\n      II.  Determine whether a proportional increase in gamma-globin synthesis and mRNA and an\n      improvement in nonalfa and alfaglobin chain imbalance by at least 10% over baseline\n      correlate with improved hematologic response in these patients when treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      III.  Determine whether a decrease in hemolysis, as assayed by a decrease in LDH, compared\n      to baseline levels correlates with improved hematologic response in these patients when\n      treated with this regimen.\n\n      IV.  Determine whether any particular genotypes are more responsive than others to this\n      therapy in these patients.\n\n      V.  Determine whether baseline epoetin alfa levels, gender, and/or baseline reticulocyte\n      counts (or percent circulating nucleated erythroblasts) correlate with improved hematologic\n      response in these patients when treated with this regimen."

Patients then receive maintenance arginine\n      butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, and 25.\n\n      Patients who have no medical contraindications (e.g., paraspinal extramedullary\n      hematopoiesis, hypertension, or poorly controlled congestive heart failure) may continue\n      therapy.  Patients receive arginine butyrate IV over 6-14 hours on days 1-4 of weeks 27, 29,\n      31, 33, 35, 37, and 39 and epoetin alfa intramuscularly (IM) or subcutaneously (SC) three\n      times weekly on weeks 27-40.\n\n      Patients may continue to receive epoetin alfa IM or SC alone three times weekly on weeks\n      41-52.  Patients with severe anemia (hemoglobin less than 7 g/dL) may receive epoetin alfa\n      alone on weeks 1-12 before arginine butyrate induction therapy.\n\n      Patients who complete therapy at week 26 are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months.  Patients\n      who complete therapy at week 40 are followed monthly for 2 months."
