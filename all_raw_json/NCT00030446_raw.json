Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining erlotinib with\n      carboplatin may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining erlotinib and carboplatin in\n      treating patients who have recurrent ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer."

Patients are stratified according to response to prior\n      platinum-containing therapy (platinum-sensitive, defined as 6 months or more since prior\n      therapy with platinum agent [closed to accrual as of 2/13/2004], vs platinum-resistant,\n      defined as less than 6 months since prior therapy with platinum agent).\n\n      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and oral erlotinib once daily on\n      days 1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses. After the completion of 6\n      courses of therapy, patients with responsive or stable disease may continue to receive\n      erlotinib and carboplatin in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-60 patients (8-30 for platinum-sensitive stratum [closed to\n      accrual as of 2/13/2004] and 15-30 for platinum-resistant stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 15-23 months."
