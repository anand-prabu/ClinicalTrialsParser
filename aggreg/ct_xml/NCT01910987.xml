      The objective of this study is to explore the effect of optimized retreatment with
      bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone followed by prolonged therapy with bortezomib,
      versus standard retreatment with bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone on progression
      free survival (PFS).

      This is an interventional, randomized (assignment to a group is happening by chance, like
      flipping a coin), open-label, parallel-group, event-driven, international, multicenter,
      Phase 3 study. This study has different phases: a pre-treatment phase, a treatment phase
      (which consists of an optimized retreatment period followed by a prolonged therapy period,
      or a standard retreatment period followed by a posttreatment period) and a long-term
      follow-up phase for survival. The end of the study is event-driven and is defined as 1 year
      after 186 events (disease progression or death) occur. After providing written informed
      consent, patients will be evaluated for eligibility during a 14-day pre-treatment period.
      The study doctor will carry out tests to see if the patient is suitable for this study,
      within the two weeks before receipt of the first dose of the study drugs. Once it has been
      determined that the patient is able to participate, he/she will be randomly assigned to 1 of
      2 different bortezomib retreatment schedules. In this first randomization, patients will
      receive optimized retreatment or standard retreatment in a 2:1 ratio. Group A: optimized
      retreatment followed by prolonged therapy. Patients will start therapy with retreatment with
      6 cycles of bortezomib and dexamethasone (two 21-day cycles followed by four 35-day cycles)
      followed by a second randomization in a 1:1 ratio to 1 of 2 prolonged therapy schedules with
      bortezomib alone (Group A1: once weekly for the first 4 weeks in 35-day cycles; or Group A2:
      once every other week). Group B: standard retreatment with eight 21-day bortezomib and
      dexamethasone cycles, followed by posttreatment follow-up every 6 weeks. During the
      retreatment phase, a series of tests will be done at the first day of each cycle. For
      patients in Group A the doctor will assess if the patient has responded to the treatment or
      not. Only if the patient responded, will he/she be able to continue in the prolonged therapy
      part of the study. At this time the patient will be randomized to one of the two groups
      (Group A1 or Group A2) in the prolonged therapy phase. During the prolonged therapy phase
      the disease status and the response to therapy will be evaluated every 6 weeks. This phase
      will continue until the disease progresses, in case there are unacceptable toxicities
      despite dose modifications. During the posttreatment period patients in group B will
      continue to be evaluated for disease status every 6 weeks until confirmed disease
      progression, when they start alternative multiple myeloma treatment, are withdrawn from the
      study, death or at the end of the study, whichever occurs first. In case the patient
      discontinues bortezomib before disease progression during the treatment phase, he/she will
      be asked to complete the End of Study Visit procedures and will be evaluated every 6 weeks
      until confirmed disease progression, when they start alternative multiple myeloma treatment,
      are withdrawn from the study, death or at the end of the study, whichever occurs first. All
      patients will have an End of Trial Visit performed 30 to 35 days after the last
      administration of bortezomib, or as soon as possible after bortezomib treatment is
      discontinued for patients receiving alternative multiple myeloma therapy. After confirmed
      disease progression or start of the first alternative multiple myeloma therapy, patients
      will enter the long-term follow-up phase. During this phase, the patients will be contacted
      by at least a telephone call every other month to be followed up for the first alternative
      multiple myeloma therapy and survival. Once the required 186 events (disease progression or
      death) have occurred, all patients will continue in the study and will be followed as per
      protocol for 1 year. After this 1 year period (end of study), all patients will be
      followed-up for survival by telephone contacts every 6 months for an additional 2 years. At
      the end of the study in countries where bortezomib is not commercially available for
      prolonged therapy or is not accessible (via a national program or access program) at that
      time, patients who in the opinion of the investigator would continue to benefit from
      prolonged therapy with bortezomib, will continue to be supplied with bortezomib until it is
      accessible in that particular country or for a period of 2 years, whichever occurs first.
      About 240 patients will take part in the study.
