(Phase I closed\n           to accrual as of 7/9/03.)\n\n        -  Determine the safety and tolerability of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n        -  Determine the complete, major, and minor cytogenetic response rates and complete\n           hematologic response rate in patients after 6 and 12 months of treatment with this\n           regimen.\n\n        -  Determine the molecular response (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for\n           bcr-abl) rate in patients who have a complete cytogenetic response after 6 and 12\n           months of treatment with this regimen.\n\n        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study.\n\n        -  Phase I (closed to accrual as of 7/9/03): Patients receive oral imatinib mesylate once\n           daily beginning on day 1 and interferon alfa (IFN-A) subcutaneously once daily or 3\n           times weekly beginning on day 14. Courses repeat every 35 days for up to 1 year in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After completion of 1 year of\n           therapy, patients may receive additional therapy, provided that the patient is\n           benefiting from imatinib mesylate. IFN-A is discontinued in patients who achieve a\n           molecular remission that is confirmed on 2 successive bone marrow samples. Imatinib\n           mesylate is discontinued in patients who achieve and maintain a molecular remission for\n           2 years.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of IFN-A is followed by sequential dose escalation of imatinib\n      mesylate. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of IFN-A and then imatinib\n      mesylate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n        -  Phase II: Patients receive imatinib mesylate and IFN-A as in phase I at the established\n           MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed for 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-15 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of\n      this study. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 7/9/03.) A total of 40 patients will be accrued\n      for the phase II portion of the study within 3-4 months."
