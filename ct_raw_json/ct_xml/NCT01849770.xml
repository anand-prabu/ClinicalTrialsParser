  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to find out if mexiletine is safe and effective in people
      with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). In this trial, participants will be taking either
      300 milligrams per day of mexiletine, 900 milligrams per day of  mexiletine or placebo
      (non-active study drug). The safety and efficacy of these doses will be compared to see if
      one dose is better than the other.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder affecting primarily
      motor neurons, for which treatment designed to slow or arrest progression remains lacking.
      Mexiletine is a use-dependent sodium channel blocker that has been FDA-approved for decades
      for the treatment of cardiac arrhythmias and more recently to treat neuropathic pain in
      diabetic polyneuropathy. Mexiletine has been shown also to be protective of neurons
      following spinal cord, head injury, and cerebral ischemia, largely by blocking
      excitotoxicity. Based on previous studies, mexiletine appears to penetrate into the central
      nervous system at concentrations sufficient to confer significant protection. Recent
      unpublished studies in the laboratory of Dr. Robert Brown at the University of Massachusetts
      have also demonstrated that mexiletine ingestion in mice genetically engineered to express
      high levels of mutant cytosolic copper-zinc superoxide dismutase-1 (SOD1) transgene prolongs
      survival in these animals. As mexiletine already has FDA-approval as an anti-arrhythmic
      agent, much is known about the pharmacology and safety of this drug in non-ALS patients. We
      anticipate that by excluding subjects with a known history of cardiac disease and with the
      known neuroprotectant properties of this medication, mexiletine is a good choice for further
      study in an ALS clinical trial.

    <time_frame>Baseline Visit Pre-Dose and Post-Dose, Weeks 2, 6, and 12, and at the Final Safety Visit, if a subject discontinues study drug early. Muscle cramps will be assessed via telephone Weeks 1 and 10</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>At the Baseline Visit, subjects will be asked to recount the number of muscle cramps experienced in the previous 24 hours and the total number of cramp experienced in the previous 30 days.

    <measure>Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R) Score</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine subjects' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities. All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established by documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS-R scores correlated with change in strength over time, was closely associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival.</description>

    <measure>Change in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening Visit, Baseline Visit Pre-Dose, Week 6 and 12, and at the Final Safety Visit for subject's who discontinue early.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be determined, using the slow VC method. The SVC can be measured using conventional spirometers that have had a calibration check prior to subject testing. A printout from the spirometer of all SVC trials will be retained.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the intensity (pain) of muscle cramps experienced over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit Pre-Dose and Post-Dose, Weeks 2, 6, and 12, and at the Final Safety Visit, if a subject discontinues study drug early. Muscle cramps will be assessed via telephone Weeks 1 and 10</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>At the Baseline Visit, subjects will be asked to recount the maximum intensity experienced with a muscle cramp in the previous 24 hours and the maximum intensity experienced with a muscle cramp in the previous 30 days.
The visual analog scale (VAS) will be used to measures pain associated with muscle cramping. It will be used to measure muscle cramp intensity in this study. The scale rating is from 0-10; 0 equals no symptoms, 10 equals most severe symptoms.
Subject will be provided with a muscle cramp diary to record muscle cramp intensity at home, daily.</description>
