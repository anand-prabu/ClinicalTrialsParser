  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the Connect® MDS/AML Disease Registry is to provide unique insights into
      treatment regimens and sequencing of these regimens as they relate to clinical outcomes of
      patients with newly diagnosed MDS or AML in routine clinical practice and evaluate molecular
      and cellular markers that may provide further prognostic classification and/or might be
      predictive of therapy outcomes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This Disease Registry will collect data on patient characteristics, treatment patterns and
      clinical outcomes.  The objective is to describe how newly diagnosed MDS or AML patients are
      treated; and to build a knowledge base regarding the effectiveness and safety of front-line
      and subsequent treatment regimens in both community and academic settings.  Enrolled
      patients will receive treatment and evaluations for MDS or AML according to the standard of
      care and routine clinical practice at each study site.  All treatments that patients receive
      for MDS or AML will be recorded, including initial treatment and any subsequent therapy.
      Data on treatment outcomes, including response rates as measured by the treating physician,
      evidence of progression, survival, and patient-reported outcomes will be collected quarterly
      on the electronic CRF.

        Approximately 1,500 patients across approximately 200 sites throughout the US will be
        enrolled in the Connect® MDS and AML Registry.  Sites will include both community-based
        and academic centers that are representative of where patients with MDS and AML are
        diagnosed and treated.  To best capture the distribution of sites with regard to the
        settings of where MDS and AML patients are typically treated in routine practice,
        approximately 70-80% of the sites will be community hematology/oncology clinics and
        approximately 20-30% will be academic-based institutions.
