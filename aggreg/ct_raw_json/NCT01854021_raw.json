However, surgery-induced\n      immunosuppression has been implicated in the development of post-operative septic\n      complications and neoplasm metastasis. General anesthesia is considered to not only suppress\n      surgical stress, but also affect the immune function directly\uff0csuch as altering the number\n      and activity of immune cells. It is reported that some anesthetics increase susceptibility\n      to tumor metastasis, apparently by suppressing natural killer cell activity. Different\n      anesthetic techniques and anesthetics used in anesthesia have shown different effects on\n      immunity. Many of the studies were animal trials or performed in vitro; in addition, most\n      are focused on a single drug. To date, there is little published prospective clinical\n      research designed specifically to investigate the effects of different general anesthetic\n      technique on immune function in patients with oral malignant tumors. The aim of this study\n      is going to characterize the immune response of patients undergoing surgery for tongue\n      cancer under 3 types of general anesthesia."
