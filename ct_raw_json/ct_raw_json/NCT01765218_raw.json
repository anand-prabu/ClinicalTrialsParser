Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy has a mortality\n      rate of up to 30% and survivors are at significant risk for adverse long-term outcomes,\n      including seizures, cerebral palsy, and developmental delay. The investigators propose a\n      randomized controlled study comparing therapeutic hypothermia alone, or therapeutic\n      hypothermia combined with topiramate. The investigators hypothesize that adjuvant therapy\n      with topiramate will reduce short term severity of HIE including seizures (the primary\n      outcome), a composite HIE severity score, and reduce the time of normalization of the\n      amplitude integrated aEEG. The investigators further hypothesize, that it will improve\n      longer term outcomes such as developmental outcome. The primary hypothesis is that seizures\n      before hospital discharge (or before 4w post-natal age (which ever is earlier) will be\n      significantly reduced in the topiramate group compared to the control group"
