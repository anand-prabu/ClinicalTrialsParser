This protocol represents the first two parts of a planned\n      three part study including both pediatric and adult subjects. Part 1 will consist of\n      studying the penetration and uptake of the PS in neurofibromas that are scheduled for\n      excision. These tumors will be excised for therapeutic reasons unrelated to this study, and\n      so this study will place no further burden on the subject other than a 3-24 hr incubation of\n      the Levulan on the tumor prior to excision. The primary hypothesis to be tested is whether\n      Levulan will accumulate, and be converted to PpIX, by the tumor tissue more than by the\n      surrounding normal tissue. Secondary hypotheses are that tumors incubated with Levulan will\n      show greater fluorescence than untreated tumors and tumors incubated with vehicle only\n      (placebo application).\n\n      As the Institutional Review Boards involved generally desire pilot data on adult populations\n      first, we will with then proceed with the adult clinical trial portion of this protocol as\n      part 2. Part 2 will use the optimum incubation time, if one has been identified in part 1,\n      and add a dose escalation study of the amount of red light used to activate the Levulan.\n      Part 3, with pediatric subjects, will commence at a future date, pending review of the\n      initial adult study results."
