            "textblock": "Biliary-tract cancer (BTC) is invasive carcinoma that originates from the epithelial lining\n      of the gallbladder and bile ducts. BTC include cholangiocarcinoma (intrahepatic, perihilar,\n      and distal biliary-tree tumor) and carcinoma arising from the gallbladder.\n\n      Surgical resection of the primary tumor is potentially curative for BTC, but less than a\n      quarter of patients are eligible for resection at presentation. Systemic chemotherapy is the\n      principal treatment method for patients with unresectable or metastatic BTC.\n\n      Gemcitabine is a promising agent, which has shown efficacy in biliary tract cancer. As a\n      single-agent therapy, gemcitabine shows response rates of 8-36% in BTC[4]. In phase II\n      trials with patients in advanced BTC, gemcitabine in combination with capecitabine or\n      platinum analogues produced objective response rates of 26-50%.\n\n      The ABC-02 study reported a significant survival advantage for gemcitabine and cisplatin\n      over gemcitabine alone in patients with advanced BTC (median overall survival 11.7 vs. 8.1\n      months; P < 0.001).\n\n      Oral anticancer drug S-1 consists of the 5-FU prodrug tegafur with two biochemical\n      modulators, 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP) and potassium oxonate (Oxo). S-1\n      monotherapy is active against advanced BTC with objective response rates of 21-35%, and\n      phase II trials of S-1 in combination with gemcitabine reported objective response rates of\n      20-36%. Differences between trials in the doses and administration schedules of gemcitabine\n      and S-1 may be reflected in the ranges of efficacy, dose-intensity, and rates of toxicity\n      observed.\n\n      Even though the efficacy of gemcitabine and S-1 combination is evident for patients with\n      advanced BTC in previous phase II trials, there was no clinical study investigating the\n      efficacy of gemcitabine and S-1 combination for patients with advanced BTC when this study\n      was started. Therefore, we conducted a phase II study to evaluate gemcitabine and S-1\n      combination as first-line chemotherapy for patients with advanced BTC."
