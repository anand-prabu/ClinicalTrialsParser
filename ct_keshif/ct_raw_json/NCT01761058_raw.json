            "textblock": "Through innovative metabolomics and redox biochemistry, methodologies that are a strength\n      and unique to our collaborative efforts, the investigators identified clinically relevant\n      phenotypes of asthma. The phenotypes are defined by biomarkers specific to underlying\n      biochemical mechanistic abnormalities, including eosinophil-mediated oxidation, depletion of\n      antioxidants and protective airway S-nitrosothiols, and airway acidification. Here,the\n      investigators propose to study a new component that is informative for longitudinal\n      assessment of severe asthma phenotypes: gender effects. The investigators reason that\n      identification of the metabolic mechanism(s) underlying onset of severe asthma in young\n      women during adolescence, and resolution of severe asthma in boys, will reveal fundamental\n      pathophysiology of severe asthma. Importantly, we aim to develop clinical testing procedures\n      to accurately assign metabolic asthma phenotypes; and to follow patients in each phenotype\n      to uncover clinical longitudinal outcomes. At the conclusion of the project, we anticipate\n      that we will have 1) developed clinically relevant tests to identify severe asthma\n      phenotypes; 2) determined the longitudinal outcome of the phenotypes; and 3) identified the\n      mechanisms underlying the preponderance of women in the severe asthma population. This\n      application will focus on the development or clinically relevant metabolic tests to identify\n      subphenotypes of adults and children with severe asthma and will lead to new targeted\n      innovative treatments."
