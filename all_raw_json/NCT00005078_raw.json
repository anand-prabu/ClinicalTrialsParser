Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining tirapazamine, carboplatin,\n      and paclitaxel in treating patients who have advanced malignant solid tumors."

Patients are stratified according\n      to prior chemotherapy status (previously untreated vs previously treated).\n\n      Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours, paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, and carboplatin\n      IV over 30 minutes. Treatment continues every 21 days for a maximum of 8 courses in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Some patients may continue therapy\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tirapazamine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 12 patients in the previously\n      untreated stratum are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed indefinitely.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-68 patients (18-34 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 12-18 months."
