            "textblock": "Unintentional poisonings of children continues to be a major issue in the US. According to a\n      study conducted by Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Centers, during the period from\n      2001-2008, emergency room visits for children less than 5 rose 28% as the result of\n      pharmaceutical products. The authors note, \"the problem of pediatric medication poisoning is\n      getting worse, not better.\"\n\n      Child resistant closures have been required on most medications sold in the US since the\n      early 1970s. However, most designs attempt to thwart children through purely physical means\n      (e.g. simultaneous dissimilar motion or opening using sequential tasks). Few, if any\n      designs, have utilized perception and cognition as a way to enhance child resistance.\n\n      The investigators propose utilizing visual illusions in spaces distinct from the opening\n      mechanism of prescription packages as a means of enhancing child resistance. In this\n      project, visual illusion images are applied to both vials and wallet blisters in order to\n      attract children's interest and prolong the time before opening.\n\n      During Stage I, the investigators will determine if the visual distractor attracts attention\n      when samples are displayed in a storage rack. During Stage II, the investigators will test\n      the effect of visual distractors on child resistance as measured by successful openings and\n      time to open."
