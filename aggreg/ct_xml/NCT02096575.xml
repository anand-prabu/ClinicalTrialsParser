  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to study the effect of nitrous oxide on pain felt by women
      having a surgical termination at less than 11 weeks compared to pain felt by women receiving
      oral pain medications.

    <description>All participants will receive 800 mg of oral ibuprofen 30 minutes pre-operatively. All patients will receive local anesthesia via a standardized paracervical block with 18 cc of 1% lidocaine buffered with 2 ml of 8.4% sodium bicarbonate and 0.2 ml of 4 units of vasopressin.
In addition, the Nitrous oxide group will receive two placebo pills.  Nitrous oxide will be administered via a disposable scented nasal mask to blind patients to the intervention. Nitrous oxide will be administered at a fixed ratio of 60% nitrous oxide and 40% oxygen. The nasal mask will be placed on the patient's nose and the nitrous oxide will be administered continuously.</description>

The standard care group will receive one 5/325 mg Percocet, and 1 mg of lorazepam, 30 minutes before the procedure. The standard care group will receive oxygen by mask intraoperatively.</description>
