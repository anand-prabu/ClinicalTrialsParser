To evaluate radiographic local response, local control and time to local progression\n      (TTLP) of treated lesions in HCC patients after liver SBRT.\n\n      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) in HCC patients\n      treated with liver SBRT.\n\n      III. To evaluate explanted irradiated liver tissue (for patients who proceed to liver\n      transplantation) to determine extent of residual tumor and extent of radiation effects\n      within and around the irradiated field.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo SBRT every other day over 2 weeks (5 fractions total) in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months\n      and then every 6 months for up to 2 years."
