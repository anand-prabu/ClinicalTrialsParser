  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very-low calorie diets are relatively safe and effective in inducing significant weight
      loss, when used in selective individuals and under clinical supervision. However, weight
      loss maintenance in the long-term remains the main challenge, with many experiencing a
      significant weight regain. Several compensatory mechanisms are activated under weight
      reduction, both at the level of energy intake (such as increased appetite) and energy
      expenditure (such as reduced energy expenditure), and increase the risk of relapse.

      The main aim of this study is to compare the effect of two multidisciplinary lifestyle
      interventions on weight loss maintenance at one year, after initial weight loss during 8
      weeks very-low calorie diet. Participants will be allocated (non-randomly) to either an
      outpatient program in the obesity unit of the local hospital, or to an inpatient program
      consisting of a &quot;continuous care&quot; intervention, with three intermittent stays (each with
      three-week duration) in a rehabilitation center over a one year period. Moreover, the
      investigators aim to assess the impact of weight loss (achieved with a very low calorie
      diet) and weight loss maintenance on compensatory mechanisms activated during weight
      reduction.

    <description>Multidisciplinary outpatient program including both individual and group-based therapy. During the first visit, there will be offered an individual consultation with the dietician, physiotherapist and psychiatric nurse. Follow-up will be in groups meeting every month for the first four months and every two months afterwards up to one year. The intervention will focus on nutritional education, healthy eating, increased physical activity levels (aiming initially at 10 minutes/day, then increasing to 30 minutes/day) and cognitive therapy.</description>
