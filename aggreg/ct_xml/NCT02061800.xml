  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a research study involving subjects who are diagnosed with a malignant
      disease, that has either failed standard therapy or is unlikely to be cured with standard
      non-transplant therapy, who will receive a peripheral blood stem cell transplant. A
      malignant disease includes the following: Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) in chronic phase,
      accelerated phase or blast crisis; Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML); Myelodysplastic
      Syndrome (MDS); Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML); Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL);
      or Lymphoma (Hodgkin's and Non-Hodgkin's)  The purpose of this study is to learn more about
      the effects of CD34+ stem cell selection on graft versus host disease (GVHD) in children,
      adolescents and young adults. CD34+ stem cells are the cells that make all the types of
      blood cells in the body. GVHD is a condition that results from a reaction of transplanted
      donor T-lymphocytes (a kind of white blood cell) against the recipient's body and organs.
      Study subjects will be offered treatment involving the use of a Miltenyi CliniMacs CD34+
      selection device to remove T-cells from a peripheral blood stem cell transplant in order to
      decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CD34+ stem cells (the cells that make all the types of blood cells in the body) are selected
      (removed) from the donor's peripheral blood stem cells. In doing this, T-cells (a type of
      blood cell) are also removed. T-cells are the cells which are responsible for severe acute
      and chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD). GVHD is a condition that results from a
      reaction of the transplanted donor T-lymphocytes (a kind of white blood cell) against the
      body and organs. There are two forms: acute (early) and chronic (late). Acute GVHD may
      produce skin rashes, liver disease, diarrhea, and an increased risk of infection. Chronic
      GVHD can also appear in subjects without prior acute GVHD. Chronic GVHD may also produce
      skin rashes, liver disease, diarrhea and an increased risk of infection. Chronic GVHD may be
      mild and respond to agents which suppress the immune system, or it could be very severe. It
      may also last for over a year.

      Once this CD34 selection process is complete, the CD34+ stem cell AlloSCT is given to the
      recipient without most of the T-cells to see if this therapy will lessen the incidence and
      seriousness of graft versus host disease (GVHD). CD34+ stem cell selection AlloSCT has been
      studied in adults with malignant and non-malignant disease with successful engraftment and
      has shown some improvement in GVHD. We do not know if CD34+ stem cell selection will work to
      prevent severe GVHD in children, adolescents and young adults.

      Subjects are being offered this experimental treatment involving the use of a Miltenyi
      CliniMacs CD34+ selection device to remove T-cells from the peripheral blood stem cell
      transplant in order to decrease the risk of acute and chronic GVHD. There will be about 25
      subjects participating in this study at Columbia University Medical Center. The purpose of
      this study is to learn more about the effects of CD34+ stem cell selection on GVHD in
      children, adolescents and young adults.

      The goals of this study are:

        -  To determine how often acute GVHD occurs and how severe the acute GVHD is in the
           children, adolescents and young adults receiving CD34+ selection of their peripheral
           blood stem cell transplant from a family member or adult unrelated donor.

        -  To determine how often primary graft failure and secondary graft failure occurs in the
           children, adolescents and young adults receiving a peripheral blood stem cell
           transplant from a family member or adult unrelated donor.

        -  To see how quickly neutrophils (infection fighting white blood cells) will recover
           following CD34+ selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a family
           member or adult unrelated donor.

        -  To see if the time for the immune system (the body's defense system) to recover will
           benefit from receiving CD34+ selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant
           from a family member or adult unrelated donor.

        -  To see how often bacterial, viral, fungal and atypical mycobacteria (TB-like)
           infections will occur in the children, adolescents and young adults receiving CD34+
           selection of their peripheral blood stem cell transplant from a family member or adult
           unrelated donor.

      No tests will be performed for research purposes only. All required testing in this protocol
      is for the purpose of standard of care clinical assessment specific to the subject's
      disease. The only procedure specific to research will be the selection of CD34+ cells from
      the donor's peripheral blood stem cells using the Miltenyi Clinimacs CD34+ selection device.

      Study specific requirements occur up to 2 years post-transplant, although the study team
      will collect data on the progress of subjects yearly until termination of the study to
      observe if subjects are responding to therapy and have no worsening GVHD.
