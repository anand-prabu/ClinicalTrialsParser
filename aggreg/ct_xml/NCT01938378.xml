        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients in whom therapeutic plasma exchange is required.

          2. Patient is male or female ≥4 years to ≤ 20 years of age.

          3. Patient must be a minimum of 15 kg and not require RBC priming for his/her plasma
             exchange machine.

          4. Patient or patient's legal representative(s)/guardian(s) have given     voluntarily
             written and signed informed consent before any study-related procedure is to be
             performed. If children are old enough (age usually deemed by each institution) to
             understand the risks and benefits of the study, they should also be informed and
             provide their written assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient with known homozygous congenital deficiency of Protein S.

          2. Patient has a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to plasma-derived products
             or to any excipient of the investigational product.

          3. Patient has an already known IgA deficiency with documented antibodies against IgA.

          4. Patient is currently participating in another interventional clinical study or has
             participated during the past 1 month prior to study inclusion.

          5. Patient is pregnant.

          6. Patient is currently undergoing therapeutic plasma exchange (TPE) with regular plasma
             (no exclusion for patients treated with albumin).
