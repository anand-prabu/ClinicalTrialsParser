  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this retrospective clinical evaluation is to compare VEO single or multilevel
      results to XLIF single or multilevel results relative to the safety endpoints.  This study
      will collect retrospective data on subjects who were treated with VEO and XLIF at least 3
      months prior to the initiation of this study. Given that fusion generally takes at least 6
      months to determine, the aim of this study is not to determine fusion but to consider the
      short-term (out to 6 months) reported adverse events between the two cohorts.

      Devices used in both systems are cleared for use and conform to US regulatory requirements.
      The study employs these procedures and devices for uses that are consistent with their
      510(k), legally cleared, labeling.

        Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled across the participating sites; 20 subjects who
        have been treated with the VEO lateral system and 20 who have been treated with the XLIF
        system.  Consecutive subjects at the participating sites that meet all of the inclusion
        criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be eligible for study participation until
        the enrollment target is reached.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult 18 years of age or older;

          -  Male or female VEO® subjects that had previously received the single or  two level
             LLIF procedure using the VEO or XLIF systems as an adjunct to fusion at L2-S1 to
             treat degenerative disc disease (DDD) at the treated level;

          -  Subject that was treated no less than 3 months prior to this evaluation with the LLIF
             procedure using the VEO or XLIF system by the participating surgeons.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject who did not receive LLIF procedure using the VEO or XLIF system for fusion of
             L2-S1;

          -  Subjects with less than 3 months of follow-up data.
