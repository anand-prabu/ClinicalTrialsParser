  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      DelAgua Health and Development, Manna Energy and the Rwanda Ministry of Health are
      collaborating on a project financed by carbon credits that will distribute household-based
      water filters and high-efficiency cook stoves to approximately 700,000 households in Rwanda.
      Prior to the full roll out of the campaign, the implementers are conducting a pilot project
      among 2000 households in western Rwanda. The objectives of this pilot evaluation are to
      document the delivery of the intervention to the intervention population, assess coverage
      and uptake of the intervention target households and conduct a 5-month randomised controlled
      trial among 500 households to assess the impact of the intervention on drinking water
      quality and indoor air quality.

    <description>The intervention consists of providing households with a household-based drinking water filter (LifestrawÂ® Family version 2.0) and high efficiency cook stoves (Eco Zoom) as well as instructions on how to use them. The intervention is delivered at community level through community health workers (CHWs). Following initial distribution of the products, CHWs visit households fortnightly to reinforce messages about correct and consistent use.</description>
