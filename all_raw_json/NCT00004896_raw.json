Combining chemotherapy with donor bone marrow transplantation\n      may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed\n      by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have acute myelogenous leukemia or\n      myelodysplastic syndrome."

Allogeneic\n      bone marrow is infused on day 0.\n\n      Patients who have already had 1 transplant receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV on days -6\n      and -5, total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 to -1, and allogeneic bone marrow\n      infusion on day 0.\n\n      All patients receive prophylaxis for graft versus host disease.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for at least 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
