  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate whether participation in an Internet-based intervention helps improve short-term
      and long-term psoriasis treatment outcomes, in particular, adherence.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An investigator-blinded, prospective study of subjects with mild to moderate psoriasis will
      be conducted. Forty subjects ages 18 years and older will be enrolled.The Internet-based
      survey will be piloted to evaluate its effect on adherence to topical psoriasis medication.
      Subjects randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the Internet-survey group will log their impression of
      the state of their psoriasis on a weekly basis. Subjects in both the intervention and
      control groups will receive standard-of-care topical fluocinonide 0.05% ointment to be
      applied to affected areas on the skin twice daily. Adherence to fluocinonide will be
      assessed using Medication Event Monitoring System (MEMS®) caps, electronic monitors affixed
      to the medication containers. Investigators and subjects will be blinded to the adherence
      data until the final (Month 12) treatment visit.

    <description>The measured adherence (MEMS®) of the Internet survey group compared to the standard-of-care control group after one month (short-term assessment) and twelve months (long-term assessment) of commencing the study
The MEMS® cap incorporates a microprocessor into the bottle cap of a standard medication bottle. Each time the bottle is opened for at least 3 seconds, the time and date of the opening are recorded. Subjects will be asked to bring the unused portion of the medication jar to each visit so that the medication can be &quot;weighed and refilled&quot;. At each visit the information will be downloaded via the MEMS® communicator onto a computer database.</description>

    <description>The change (dynamic assessment) from baseline visit to each return visit (or end of treatment) in the Psoriasis Area Severity Index and Investigator's Global Assessment.
Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA): Similar to assessment performed in clinical practice, based on a 6-point scale from 0 (completely clear) to 5 (very severe). Treatment success is defined as score of 0 or 1 (clear or almost clear).
Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI): The Psoriasis Area and Severity Index is commonly used in clinical trials as a granular measure of disease severity.  It is weighted for area in each of the four body regions and scores erythema, induration and desquamation on an overall scale from 0-72. Treatment success is defined as a 75% reduction in PASI score from baseline value.</description>

    <description>Treatment phase is 12 months. During the intervention, each subject will receive fluocinonide 0.05% ointment, a standard treatment for psoriasis. If their psoriasis could be suitably treated with fluocinonide, then they will be asked to participate in the study. At the initial study visit, fluocinonide will be dispensed in a small jar with a MEMS® electronic monitoring cap attached. Subjects will be asked to apply the medication twice daily. They will be asked to the entire affected area, excluding face and genitals. Subjects will be instructed to apply the smallest amount of study medication sufficient to cover the affected areas. At the end of the treatment phase, subjects will have a feedback session with specific results of adherence behavior revealed. They will receive weekly surveys via internet to complete.</description>
