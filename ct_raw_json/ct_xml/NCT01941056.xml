    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vaccine therapy in healthy
      volunteers with or without previous exposure to cytomegalovirus. Vaccines made from a
      gene-modified virus may help the body build an immune response and may help prevent
      cytomegalovirus infection.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish a biological optimal dose of the cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified vaccinia
      Ankara (MVA) Triplex vaccine (multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine).

      II. To determine if the vaccine is safe and well tolerated in healthy volunteers at these
      doses.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To provide preliminary evidence of CMV-MVA Triplex vaccine driven expansion of
      CMV-specific immune responses that would support further evaluation of this vaccine in
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) recipients.

      II. To confer CMV-specific immunity to CMV-negative volunteers and to determine the duration
      of immune enhancement of CMV-specific cell mediated immunity (CMI) function up to 12 months
      following immunization of healthy volunteers.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Participants receive multi-CMV epitope modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly (IM)
      followed by a booster injection 28 days later in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 12 months.

        SECONDARY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA:

          -  It is anticipated that there could be a delay of 1-3 months between screening and
             actual vaccination; alternatively, there could be a delay due to availability of the
             vaccine; therefore, prior to registration for vaccination, the following secondary
             eligibility criteria must be met:

          -  If not tested in past 4 months, serum chemistries and blood counts are within normal
             limits; hepatitis B virus (HBV) surface antigen negative and hepatitis C virus (HCV)
             seronegative; HIV-1 antibody negative

          -  Women of childbearing age must have a urine pregnancy test performed within 48 hours
             of each vaccine administration with a negative result

          -  Laboratory values prior to booster injection may include grade 1 laboratory
             abnormalities, but any grade &gt;= grade 2 will exclude the subject from a booster
             injection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous condition, or one that becomes known during the screening period, that
             would suggest that the individual could be immunologically impaired, or for which
             this study would pose a danger to him/herself or about which the P.I., in evaluating
             the subject for eligibility, determines that this exclusion is appropriate

          -  Subjects are excluded who have a history of cancer than basal cell skin cancer, of
             depression, of allergic diatheses as define by a history of asthma, anaphylaxis, or
             generalized urticaria, or by daily use of antihistamines, episodic (more than once in
             past 3 months) inhalational medications including steroidal agents, non-steroidal
             agents, or cromolyn sodium

          -  Subjects with severe migraine headaches (more than one per month on average in the
             past 6 months or requiring preventive medications) are excluded

          -  Any of the following cardiac findings of ECG abnormality;

               -  Conduction disturbance (complete left or right bundle branch block,

               -  Evidence of past myocardial infarction

          -  Any previous condition, or one that becomes known during the screening period, that
             would suggest that the technicians and health professionals involved in the study
             would be exposed to specific infectious risk

          -  Treatment with whole or subunit CMV or poxvirus vaccine in the last 12 months

          -  Men with partners of child-bearing potential and women of child-bearing potential who
