  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial of a limited restriction diet compared
      to a regular diet among patients with Crohn's disease (CD) in remission. At baseline,
      patients will complete a semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire assessing usual
      dietary patterns over the preceding month. Disease activity will be assessed with the
      abbreviated Crohn's Disease Activity Index (aCDAI)59. Self-reported disease status will be
      assessed during follow-up using an internet-based questionnaire. Repeat assessment of
      adherence to the study diets will be assessed with food frequency questionnaires (FFQs)
      administered after 20 weeks. Follow-up duration will be for 48 weeks. Statistical analysis
      will compare the time to relapse using Cox regression for patients in the two study arms. In
      the exploratory aim, we will compare outcomes among patients in the highest tertile for
      other food items and nutrients to those in the lowest tertile based on self-reported usual
      dietary patterns at baseline. Thus, the study population will be analyzed both as a
      randomized controlled trial and as a prospective cohort study.

    <description>Relapse of CD is defined as an increase in the aCDAI by &gt;=60 points and to &gt;150. Additionally, undergoing CD surgery or starting any new CD medication (steroids, mesalamine, azathioprine, methotrexate, anti-Tumor Necrosis Factor α (anti-TNF), anti-α4) for the treatment of CD symptoms during the interval between two visits will be considered to have identified a clinical relapse.</description>
