Second, the purpose of the second and third\n      year study will investigate the long-term effect of 12-week joint mobilization, 12-week\n      joint mobilization plus soft tissue mobilization/massage, and 12-week joint mobilization\n      plus soft tissue mobilization/massage with appropriate shoulder physical activity guide on\n      subjects with Stiff shoulders. Subjects: First year: thirty subjects with Stiff shoulders\n      will be recruited. Second and third years: forty-five subjects with Stiff shoulders for one\n      year follow-up. Methods: For the measurement outcomes; functional disability, rotation range\n      of motion, joint mobility, muscle stiffness, and shoulder physical activity will be measured\n      by self-reported Flexi-level Scale of Shoulder Function or performance-based motion\n      analysis, goniometer, uni-axis load cell and electromagnetic tracking sensor, myotonometer,\n      and accelerometers, respectively."
