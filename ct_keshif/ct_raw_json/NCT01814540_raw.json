Hilmar Ingredients employs the same membrane filtration, and centrifugation processes used to purify whey protein in their commercial practice to extract and purify BMO from whey permeate.  Furthermore, the same sterilization processes used on the equipment to purify whey products will be used to purify BMO. This method uses a novel high-throughput food-grade isolation protocol that leads to purification of specific BMOs with bifidogenic activity as prebiotic oligosaccharides that mimic the activities observed for Human Milk Oligosaccharides (HMO). This strategy of developing methods for their large scale fractionation allows us to obtain a final product that mimics the naturally beneficial oligosaccharides present in human milk.",
