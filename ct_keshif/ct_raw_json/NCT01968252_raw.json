This study intends to validate the use of speckle-tracking echocardiography to measure\n           the distance the tricuspid annulus moves during the systolic phase. The guideline\n           articles regarding right ventricular function suggest m-mode measurements from the\n           transthoracic approach and the same measurements may underestimate the actual distance\n           on transesophageal echocardiography. This speckle-tracking technology will allow this\n           distance to be measured despite its often non-parallel motion to the ultrasound beam,\n           which otherwise limits the reliability of the valve recorded.\n\n        3. All subjects undergoing a planned surgical procedure in which the use of\n           transesophageal echocardiography would be used regardless for their management.\n\n        4.
