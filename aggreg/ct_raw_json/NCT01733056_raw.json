Problem of Interest We are proposing to study the effectiveness of vaccines in people\n           who are taking drugs that affect the immune system.  There are many populations of\n           people who have chronic medical conditions that require them to have long-term\n           treatment with immunosuppressive medications (drugs that decrease the function of the\n           immune system).  Examples of these patients include organ transplant recipients,\n           patients with immune cell cancers such as leukemia and lymphoma, patients with\n           connective tissue disorders such as lupus, sarcoidosis, or scleroderma, and patients\n           with skin conditions requiring steroid-based creams, ointments, pills, or injections.\n           Patients who are taking these medications must receive appropriate vaccinations such as\n           tetanus boosters, influenza vaccines, and pneumonia vaccines.  The effectiveness of\n           vaccinations depends in large part on a strong response to the vaccine by the immune\n           system.  Drugs that decrease immune system function therefore, may also decrease the\n           effectiveness of vaccines.  To our knowledge, there is no data in the scientific\n           literature regarding the effectiveness of vaccines in patients who are taking only one\n           immunosuppressive medication.\n\n        2. How the Problem of Interest will be studied\n\n      We plan to give three different groups of participants influenza vaccinations and measure\n      each participant's immune system response through blood tests.  The three groups will be:\n\n        1. healthy people taking no immunosuppressive medications\n\n        2. patients with skin conditions requiring treatment with azathioprine and currently\n           taking no other immunosuppressive agents\n\n        3. patients with psoriasis requiring treatment with TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis\n           factor-alpha) and currently taking no other immunosuppressive medications.\n\n      All participants will be between 40 - 60 years old and will not have had influenza\n      vaccination within the previous six months.  We will administer the vaccination on day 0. We\n      will take blood samples on days 0, 7, and 30 following vaccination.  We will use these blood\n      samples to measure the amount of antibodies produced to the vaccine and the response of\n      specific immune system cells known as B-lymphocytes.  Using statistical methods, we will\n      compare these findings between the three groups of participants to determine if differences\n      in response to the vaccination exist.\n\n      3. How the research will advance scientific knowledge and/or human health To our knowledge\n      there is no scientific data available regarding the effectiveness of vaccinations in\n      patients receiving only one specific immunosuppressive medication.  We will also be using\n      new techniques developed at Emory to measure the B-lymphocyte response to the vaccine.  This\n      research could potentially help guide vaccination strategies for people requiring\n      immunosuppressive medications and prevent infectious disease in these populations as well as\n      the general population.\n\n      4. Standard of Care This research study does not propose to treat any of the participants\n      conditions.  Therefore, there is no \"standard of care.\"  This research study does propose to\n      give influenza vaccinations to all participants."
