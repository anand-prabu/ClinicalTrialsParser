        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males 30 to 75 years of age

          -  Type 1 or 2 diabetes and has been treated with at least one anti-hyperglycemic
             medication and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi)/angiotensin receptor
             blockers (ARB) (renin-angiotensin system [RAS] inhibitor) for at least 2 months prior
             to Screening

          -  Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) equal to or greater than 50 mL/min with
             the Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) Formula and Urine
             Albumin-to-Creatinine Ratio (UACR) equal to or greater than 30 and  less than 5,000
             mg/g creatinine.

          -  Able to provide a semen specimen at the required intervals.

          -  Baseline sperm concentration â‰¥ 30 million per mL.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Treatment with hormone suppressive agents or cancer chemotherapy within the past 6
             months or planned during the study.

          -  History of moderate or severe peripheral edema, pulmonary edema or facial edema
             unrelated to trauma or  history of myxedema in the prior 6 months to Screening.

          -  History of pulmonary hypertension requiring either oxygen therapy and/or endothelin
             receptor antagonist or phosphodiesterase therapy or any lung disease requiring oxygen
             therapy.

          -  Documented diagnosis of heart failure, previous hospitalization for heart failure or
             current or constellation of symptoms (dyspnea on exertion, pedal edema, orthopnea,
             paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea) felt to be compatible with heart failure, that was not
             explained by other causes, and for which there was a change in medication or other
             management directed at heart failure.

          -  History of hormone replacement therapy.

          -  Evidence of hypogonadism by clinical exam.
