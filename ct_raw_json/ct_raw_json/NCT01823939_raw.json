While female participants will be\n      included in Part A, only male patients will be enrolled in Part B. The rationale for\n      excluding women in Part B is the difficulty in separating urine from stool in severely\n      dehydrated females with rapid rates of purging. Moreover, it has been difficult to retain\n      adult females in the hospital after improvement of their diarrhoea because of their\n      household responsibilities, which might impact compliance in this small study. Further, no\n      sex differences in the pharmacokinetics of iOWH032 were found in the study conducted in\n      healthy subjects in the US, which included 42 males and females, nor have sex differnces\n      been observed in preclinical studies."

Female participants of\n             childbearing potential (including perimenopausal women who had menstrual bleeding\n             within the past two years) must use appropriate birth control (abstinence and/or\n             double barrier methods) for 30 days after dosing. Acceptable double barrier methods\n             are the following forms of contraception: condom, contraceptive sponge, hormonal\n             contraceptives, intrauterine devices, and diaphragm or cervical ring with spermicidal\n             gel or foam. Women are considered to be not of childbearing potential if they have\n             been surgically sterilized (physician-documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy\n             or bilateral tubal ligation).
