No placebo or reference product is involved. No randomization is\n      required as the indication will define the patient selection.\n\n      The six indications studied are:\n\n        -  Direct pulp capping following carious pulp exposure\n\n        -  Direct pulp capping following dental trauma injury to healthy pulp (partial pulpotomy)\n\n        -  Repairing perforated root canals and/or the pulp chamber floor\n\n        -  Retrograde endodontic surgery\n\n        -  Pulpotomy in primary molars\n\n        -  Apexification\n\n      Study start: October 2009\n\n      Inclusion period: 1/10/2009 to  30/06/2011\n\n      Study duration: 2 years\n\n      OBJECTIVES:\n\n      The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical efficacy and tolerance of RD94 in the\n      indications described.\n\n      Primary objective:\n\n      The primary objective is to show that RD94 can be easily applied in the claimed indications\n      and to evaluate its efficacy. This can be defined after a 6  month follow-up.\n\n      Secondary objective:\n\n      The secondary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of RD94 after a two year follow-up which\n      is important for safety and the longevity of the product.\n\n      TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS:\n\n      60 patients in three French study centers, 10 per indication studied. Depending on the\n      indication, children (from 3 years onwards), and/or adults will be included.\n\n      DURATION OF TREATMENT:\n\n      The product is applied on D0 (Inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years\n      with six visits: Visit1 - Week 1, Visit 2 - Month 1, Visit 3 - Month 3, Visit 4 - Month 6,\n      Visit 5 - Year 1, Visit 6 - Year 2."
