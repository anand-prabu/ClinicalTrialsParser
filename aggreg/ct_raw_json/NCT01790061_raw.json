Evidence from animal and human studies\n      strongly supports the link between intestinal bacteria and inflammatory bowel diseases\n      (IBD). Dozens of studies reported its efficacy in treatment of severe Clostridium difficile\n      colitis. Preliminary studies using FMT for Ulcerative Colitis (UC), Crohn's diseases,\n      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) and constipation have also met with some success. This is an\n      initial step into investigating the potential efficacy of standardized fecal bacteriotherapy\n      through mid-gut (at least below duodenal papilla) for UC, the investigators propose to\n      determine the efficiency and safety of FMT in a series of 60 patients with moderate to\n      severe UC (Montreal classification)."
