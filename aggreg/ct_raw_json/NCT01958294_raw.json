Dose may be returned to a therapeutic\n             level after the procedure).\n\n          -  The subject must sign a written informed consent prior to the procedure, using a form\n             that is approved by the local medical Ethics Committee (EC).\n\n          -  The life expectancy of the subject is at least one year.\n\n          -  The subject has a lesion located in the internal carotid artery (ICA); the carotid\n             bifurcation may be involved.\n\n          -  The subject must have a minimum distance of 5 cm between the clavicle and\n             bifurcation, as assessed by duplex Doppler ultrasound, computed axial tomographic\n             (CT) angiography or magnetic resonance (MR) angiography.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The subject is participating in another investigational study that would interfere\n             with the conduct or result of this study.\n\n          -  The subject has dementia or a neurological illness that may confound the neurological\n             evaluation.\n\n          -  Presence of any one of the following anatomic risk factors:\n\n               -  Previous radiation treatment to the neck or radical neck dissection\n\n               -  Tracheostomy or tracheal stoma\n\n               -  Laryngectomy\n\n               -  Contralateral laryngeal nerve palsy\n\n               -  Severe tandem lesions\n\n               -  Inability to extend the head due to cervical arthritis or other cervical\n                  disorders\n\n          -  Total occlusion of the target vessel.\n\n          -  There is an existing, previously placed stent in the target artery.\n\n          -  The subject has a known life-threatening allergy to the contrast media that cannot be\n             treated.\n\n          -  Subject has history of intolerance or allergic reaction to any of the study\n             medications including aspirin, clopidogrel bisulfate (Plavix\u00ae) or ticlopidine\n             (Ticlid\u00ae), prasugrel heparin or bivalirudin (Angiomax\u2122).
