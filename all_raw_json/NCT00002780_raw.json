Evaluate the toxicities of the combination of low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2)\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF), and multiple doses of activated T cells (ATC) following peripheral\n      blood stem cell transplantation in women with stage IIIB or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the\n      breast. II. Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 5 days prior to\n      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection or for 2 days prior to bone marrow harvest.\n      Following PBSC collection or bone marrow harvest, patients receive high dose chemotherapy\n      consisting of cyclophosphamide IV, carboplatin IV, and thiotepa IV over days -6 through -3.\n      Patients undergo PBSC transplantation on day 0. Following PBSC transplantation, patients\n      receive multiple doses of monoclonal antibody OKT3 activated T lymphocytes IV over 1 hour\n      between days 1 and 65, continuous low dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) IV over days 1-65, and\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously on days 5-21. Patients are followed at day 100, as\n      clinically indicated, and then annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
