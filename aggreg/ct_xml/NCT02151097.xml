  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, single-centre feasibility study to evaluate the use of
      intra-operative Cerenkov Luminescence Imaging (CLI) of prostatectomy specimens to determine
      margin status.

      Subjects will receive an intravenous injection of 370 megabecquerels (MBq) of 18F-choline
      prior to routine, elective radical prostatectomy. The surgery will be performed according to
      standard-of-care. The resected prostatectomy specimens will be imaged using a CLI specimen
      analyser, consisting of a light-tight box on which an ultra-sensitive lens and Electron
      Multiplying Charged-Coupled Device (EMCCD) camera are mounted.

      This study will measure the agreement between margin status of the prostatectomy specimen as
      determined by CLI and by histopathology (reference method). This study will assess
      feasibility before proceeding to pivotal studies to determine diagnostic performance.
