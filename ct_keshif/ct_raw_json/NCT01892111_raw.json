Body weight\n      loss improves not only spontaneous pregnancy rates but also those of assisted reproductive\n      techniques (ARTs). Almost all studies refer to body weight loss due to lifestyle\n      intervention programs consisting in hypocaloric diet and increased physical activity,\n      whereas very little is known about the specific effects of physical activity alone on human\n      reproduction.\n\n      In a previous retrospective study, we demonstrated that physical activity enhances the\n      reproductive performance of obese infertile patients who receive in vitro fertilization\n      (IVF) and intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles, regardless of body weight loss.\n\n      The aim of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be to evaluate if a structured\n      exercise program improve the effectiveness of ARTs."
