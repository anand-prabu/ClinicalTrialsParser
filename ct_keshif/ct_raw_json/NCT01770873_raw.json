            "textblock": "Violent injury is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among adolescents. The presence\n      of a positive adult role model is a well-established protective factor against violence and\n      other maladaptive outcomes among youth. Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) is the largest U.S.\n      mentoring organization with proven effectiveness in improving youth outcomes.  However,\n      these programs may be less effective with youth who already are exhibiting involvement in\n      problem behavior at the time of program referral.  Take Charge!, a mentor- and\n      professional-implemented intervention with 10-15 year old assault-injured youth, showed\n      promise for improving perceived self efficacy for avoiding violence and for decreasing\n      aggression and problem behavior.\n\n      The overall goal of the proposed project is to develop, implement, and evaluate a\n      research-informed youth development program that adapts the BBBS model to work for\n      assault-injured youth. The aims are:\n\n        -  To expand and refine Take Charge! and integrate it with BBBS practices;\n\n        -  To conduct a randomized, controlled trial in which assault-injured 10-15 year old youth\n           recruited from emergency departments in Baltimore and D.C. receive either standard\n           emergency department follow-up care or the Take Charge! 2 intervention with assessment\n           of violence-related, mental health, and educational outcomes;\n\n        -  To conduct a comprehensive process evaluation of Take Charge! 2;\n\n        -  And to accurately measure the costs of the intervention and assess cost-effectiveness.\n\n      Youth violence is a major cause of morbidity and mortality with marked disparities by\n      race/ethnicity and socioeconomic status.  This study is a critical next step in translating\n      evidence-based research to real-world settings and practice."
