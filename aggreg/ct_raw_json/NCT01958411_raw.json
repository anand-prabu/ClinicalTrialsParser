NAFLD can be detected by measuring liver fat accumulation\n           using computed tomography (CT).\n\n        -  Also epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) volume as determined by computed tomography (CT)\n           is an independent marker of cardiovascular events in the general population.\n\n        -  Therefore, the purpose of this investigators study is to compare the NAFLD severity and\n           EAT volume with FDG uptake measured by PET/CT."
