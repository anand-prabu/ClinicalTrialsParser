        Inclusion Criteria:

        For entry in this study, subjects must have been enrolled in the 410 CA Clinical Study or
        410 CARE Clinical Study under the inclusion criteria listed below and received NATRELLE®
        410 Highly Cohesive Anatomically Shaped Silicone-Filled Breast Implants Styles 410 FM, FF,
        MM, or MF in 1 (for unilateral breast reconstruction or revision) or both breasts.

          -  Female, age 18 or older

          -  Present with one or more of the following conditions:

               -  Primary breast augmentation (i.e., no previous breast implant surgery) indicated
                  for subject dissatisfaction, with size or shape of breast (e.g., mammary
                  hypoplasia), asymmetry, ptosis, or aplasia

               -  Primary breast reconstruction (i.e., no previous breast implant surgery other
                  than implantation of tissue expanders or contralateral augmentation for
                  asymmetry) indicated, in the affected breast, for mastectomy for cancer,
                  prophylactic mastectomy, or breast trauma (resulting in mastectomy) and for the
                  unaffected breast, contralateral asymmetry (may be performed on the date of the
                  mastectomy or the date when permanent implants are placed in the reconstructed
                  breast)

               -  Breast implant revision surgery (i.e., removal and replacement of breast
                  implants) indicated for previous augmentation or reconstruction with
                  silicone-filled or saline-filled breast implants

          -  Has adequate tissue available to cover implants

          -  Willing to undergo MRI at the specified follow-up visit for subjects at MRI
             designated sites and be eligible for MRI (e.g., no implanted metal or metal devices,
             no history of severe claustrophobia)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        For entry in this study, subjects must have been enrolled in the 410 CA Clinical Study or
        410 CARE Clinical Study and met the exclusion criteria listed below but not received any
        NATRELLE® 410 Highly Cohesive Anatomically Shaped Silicone-Filled 410 X- or L-Style Breast
        Implants

          -  Does not have advanced fibrocystic disease considered to be premalignant without
             accompanying subcutaneous mastectomy

          -  Does not have existing carcinoma of the breast, without mastectomy

          -  Does not have abscess or infection in the body at the time of enrollment

          -  Is not pregnant or nursing

          -  Does not have any disease, including uncontrolled diabetes (e.g., HbA1c &gt; 8%), that
             is clinically known to impact wound healing ability

          -  Does not show tissue characteristics that are clinically incompatible with
             mammaplasty, such as tissue damage resulting from radiation, inadequate tissue,
             compromised vascularity, or ulceration

          -  Does not have or is under treatment for any condition that may constitute an
             unwarranted surgical risk (e.g., unstable cardiac or pulmonary problems)

          -  Does not show psychological characteristics that may be incompatible with the
             surgical procedure and the prosthesis, such as inappropriate attitude or motivation
             (e.g., body dysmorphic disorder)

          -  Is not willing to undergo further surgery for revision, if medically required
