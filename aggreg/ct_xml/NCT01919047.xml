      This survey aims to determine the following information and the need for conducting
      specified drug use-results surveys and post-marketing clinical studies in patients using
      Betanis (generic name: mirabegron):

        1. The occurrence of adverse drug reactions in clinical settings.

        2. Factors potentially impacting safety, effectiveness, and other aspects.

      Items of Particular Interest:

        -  Safety and effectiveness in patients with hepatic impairment and patients with renal
           impairment.

        -  Safety and effectiveness when mirabegron is used concomitantly with other drugs (α1
           blockers, anticholinergic agents, 5α reductase inhibitors, drugs with a potent
           CYP3A4-inhibiting effect, drugs with a CYP3A4-inducing effect, drugs metabolized
           primarily by CYP2D6, and other frequently used drugs).

        -  The occurrence of cardiovascular adverse events.

        -  The occurrence of adverse events related to increased intraocular pressure.

        -  The occurrence of urinary retention
