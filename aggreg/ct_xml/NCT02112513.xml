  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this project is to evaluate clinical significance of measuring maternal
      blood estriol levels, after the administration of antenatal corticosteroids to enhance lung
      maturity. The investigators will test for associations of the change in maternal estriol
      with the development of respiratory distress syndrome. The investigators are also interested
      in determining whether salivary estriol is a valid surrogate to estriol blood assays. In
      addition the investigators will correlate these changes to pharmacokinetic (PK),
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and pharmacogenetic measures of betamethasone administration and
      fetal respiratory outcome

    <description>Serum Estriol measurement via different assays is complex, expensive, labor intensive, time consuming, and generally performed at specific reference labs. Salivary Estriol level is an ideal potential surrogate for serum Estriol. It is convenient, non-invasive, and expedient. It may not, however, be as sensitive as serum estriol concentrations at detecting the association with glucocorticoid response. This study will collect both samples to determine which one is better suited for clinical use in this condition.</description>

      We will obtain serum for estriol measurement before or within 2 hours of antenatal
      corticosteroid administration  and about 24 hours after each dose is given We will obtain a
      saliva sample for measurement of estriol at the same times.

      Women will be offered optional participation on a PK portion of the study. Women who consent
      to this part of the study will have plasma samples obtained pre-dose and then at a schedule
      of sampling of approximately 0.5-2 hours, 4-8 hours, 10-15 hours, 22-24 hours after the
      first does and then 6-8 hours, 24, and 48 hours after the 2nd dose. One sample will be
      collected in each of these times.

      A sample of whole blood will be obtained for DNA isolation. At the time of delivery,
      umbilical cord blood will be collected before being discarded for DNA and plasma. If we are
      unable to obtain umbilical cord blood, a buccal swab will be collected from the baby for DNA
      extraction.
