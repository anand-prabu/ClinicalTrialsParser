            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia Syndrome (FS) is one condition that most affects functional performance,\n      especially in women, due to alterations in the entire musculoskeletal system. Given that,\n      Physical Therapy (PT) studies the human movement and its dysfunctions, and that FS, because\n      of its complex chronic characteristic, impairs the affected individual's activities causing\n      movement disorders, a PT professional must be part of the multidisciplinary team involved in\n      the FS treatment. Nonetheless, as explained in the present proposal, several aspects still\n      need clarification related to the PT role in this syndrome. Particularly, studies that\n      analyze the biomechanical, sensorial and cardiorespiratory adaptations in individuals who\n      undergo PT intervention still lack; those studies would contribute with scientific evidence\n      to the clinical practice. According to recent systematic reviews, one of the most used\n      therapies with positive effects on FS subjects is the hydrotherapy, which combines exercises\n      and the water relaxing effects. Other alternative treatments have also been searched, in an\n      attempt to decrease the painful picture presented, as the FS etiology and pathophysiology\n      are not well known. The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of different physical\n      therapy resources in the FS, in two subprojects. The first will verify if hydrotherapy is\n      effective in modifying movement variables (scapular kinematics and electromyography) and\n      autonomic modulation. Other variables, such as pain level and quality of life in women with\n      FS, will also be analyzed. The second study will evaluate the efficacy of the Shiatsu\n      massage on pain, sleep quality, balance and quality of life of subjects with FS."
