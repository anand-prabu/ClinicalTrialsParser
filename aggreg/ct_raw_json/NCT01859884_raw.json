            "textblock": "The shortage of kidneys for kidney transplantation results in almost 10,000 deaths per year\n      in the United States. One strategy to increase the number of available kidneys is to offer\n      kidney transplant candidates kidneys that come from donors who have an increased risk of\n      transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Hepatitis B and Hepatitis C.  Increased\n      risk kidney donors are defined as those who have engaged in behaviors associated with an\n      increased risk of HIV, Hepatitis B, and Hepatitis C, and comprise approximately 9% of all US\n      deceased organ donors. The Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network policy mandated\n      informed consent from recipients who accept increased risk kidneys. The objective of this\n      study is to increase study participants' comprehension about increased risk donor kidneys\n      necessary for informed consent. To accomplish this objective, we will develop a web-based\n      tool that educates and assesses participants' comprehension (Inform Me), as a supplement to\n      current informed consent processes. We will then compare the effectiveness of the current\n      informed consent processes supplemented by Inform Me, with the current consent processes\n      alone. The tool will utilize health information technology to deliver information about the\n      definition of, risks, benefits, and alternatives to using increased risk donor kidneys via a\n      web-based application. Computer adaptive learning will personalize information presented to\n      each candidate according to his/her comprehension levels in interactive chapters to increase\n      comprehension. Inform Me will facilitate nurses' primary role as patient educators."
