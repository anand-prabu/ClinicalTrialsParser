  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and activity of the investigational
      drug known as carfilzomib in the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM) when it is given at
      doses above the usual dose after the standard dosing has become ineffective. The other
      purpose of this study is to understand what causes the multiple myeloma to become resistant
      to carfilzomib and whether this can be overcome in the laboratory.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single center, phase II study of high dose carfilzomib. Patients with
      relapsed or relapsed/refractory myeloma and with progression of disease on standard dosing
      (20/27 mg/m2) and schedule of carfilzomib will be initially treated at dose level 1,
      carfilzomib 20/56 mg/m2. During Cycle 1, patients will receive either 20 mg/m2 on days 1,2
      (if the subject has not received carfilzomib as part another clinical trial within the last
      4 weeks) or 56 mg/m2 (if the subject is enrolling in the present study after progression of
      disease on carfilzomib within the last month - for example subjects enrolled in CMAP
      compassionate use carfilzomib).   Thereafter, all subjects will receive 56 mg/m2 for the
      remaining doses given Cycle 1 Day 8 onwards. If a minimal response or better is achieved
      (and therefore disease response is recaptured) a bone marrow biopsy will be repeated.

      If 56 mg/m2 is not tolerated, the dose of carfilzomib will be reduced to dose level -1 i.e.
      45 mg/m2. If a subject does not tolerate 45 mg/m2 then the dose would be further reduced to
      dose level -2 i.e. 36 mg/m2. If the subject does not tolerate 36 mg/m2, then this subject
      would have to come off study.

      Dexamethasone 8 mg po/IV will be administered prior to all carfilzomib doses.

      Once a patient develops disease progression on this study, the patient may return to
      receiving the maximum tolerated dose of carfilzomib by that patient with the addition of a
      therapeutic dosing of dexamethasone (a total of 20-40 mg weekly). An IMId  (e.g. thalidomide
      or lenalidomide) and/or an alkylator can also be added to carfilzomib 27 or 36 mg/m2 per
      investigator discretion either concurrent with the addition of dexamethasone or subsequent
      to disease progression on carfilzomib with concurrent therapeutic dexamethasone.
