            "textblock": "The Physical Functioning Inventory (PFI) is a standardized patient reported outcome measure\n      that assesses preclinical disability. Preclinical disability is a functional state in which\n      people are still able to complete daily living tasks (e.g., walking, bathing) but are\n      changing the frequency or modifying the way that they complete the tasks.  The investigators\n      have done some preliminary research using the PFI as an online monitoring tool (Richardson\n      2012), but further study is required to examine its psychometric properties and its\n      suitability for use as a primary outcome measure.  This measurement study has been designed\n      to identify the optimal number of items on the PFI and to determine the reliability,\n      validity, and responsiveness of the PFI when administered to a sample of adults and older\n      adults both with and without chronic conditions.  This project will also allow us to\n      evaluate the use of self-monitoring of physical function and the added value of\n      rehabilitation professionals to support self-monitoring.  Using the results of the PFI, the\n      investigators aim to develop a \"tailored\" population-based rehabilitation self-management\n      intervention delivered through a secure messaging system in the patient's electronic\n      personal health record (myOSCAR) that focuses on the early detection and prevention of\n      preclinical disability."

To identify persons at an early stage of mobility limitation (preclinical mobility limitation), additional questions were posed to participants who reported no task difficulty. The questions concerned the modification of task performance and the alternatives given were resting in the middle of the performance, using an aid, taking support from handrails, having reduced the frequency of performing the task, having slowed down performance of the task, experiencing tiredness when performing the task, or some other change in carrying out the task.",
