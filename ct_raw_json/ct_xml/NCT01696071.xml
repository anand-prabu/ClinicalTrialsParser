      Determine the 24-hour FEV1-profile of tiotropium solution for inhalation after 4 weeks
      treatment periods of 5 mcg tiotropium administered once daily in the evening and 2.5 mcg
      tiotropium administered twice daily (morning and evening). In addition compare the 24 hours
      pharmacokinetic profile of 5 mcg tiotropium administered once daily and 2.5mcg tiotropium
      administered twice daily in pharmacokinetic sub-investigation.

        Inclusion criteria:

             at Visit 0.

          3. All patients must have at least a 3 months history of asthma at the time of enrolment
             (signing ICF) into the trial. The initial diagnosis of asthma must have been made
             before the patient's age of 40.

          4. All patients must have a pre-bronchodilator FEV1 = 60% predicted and = 90% of
             predicted normal at Visit 1.Variation of absolute pre-bronchodilator FEV1 values at
             Visit 1 and Visit 2 must be within ± 30%.

          5. Patient's diagnosis of asthma has to be confirmed at Visit 1 with bronchodilator
             reversibility (ie 10 minutes prior to and 15-30 minutes after inhalation of 400 µg
             salbutamol) defined as an FEV1 increase of = 12% and = 200 mL.

          6. All patients must have a diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma and must be
             symptomatic despite their current maintenance treatment with medium doses of ICS.

          7. All patients must be symptomatic at Visit 1and Visit 2 as defined by an ACQ mean
             score of = 1.5.

          8. All patients must have maintenance treatment with stable medium daily dose of ICS for
             at least 4 weeks prior to Visit 1.

         10. Patients must be able to use the Respimat inhaler correctly.

         11. Patients must be able to perform all trial related procedures including technically
             acceptable pulmonary function tests and use of the AM3 (e-diary) compliance of at

         12. Patients taking a chronic pulmonary medication allowed by the study protocol must be
             willing to continue this therapy for the entire duration of the study (exception:
             times of acute disease deterioration).

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with a significant disease other than asthma. A significant disease is
             defined as a disease which, in the opinion of the investigator, may (i) put the
             patient at risk because of participation in the trial, or (ii) influence the results
             of the trial, or (iii) cause concern regarding the patient's ability to participate
             in the trial.

          2. Patients with a clinically relevant abnormal screening hematology or blood chemistry
             at Visit 1 if the abnormality defines a significant disease as defined in exclusion
             criterion no. 1.

          3. Patients requiring more than 12 puffs of rescue medication (salbutamol MDI) per 24
             hours for more than 2 consecutive days between Visit 1 and Visit 2 (screening
             period).

          4. Patients with a recent history (ie six months or less) of Acute Coronary Syndrome
             (STEMI, non-STEMI, Unstable Angina Pectoris) prior to Visit 1 (screening).

          5. Patients who have been hospitalised for cardiac failure during the past year prior to
             Visit 1 (screening).

          6. Patients with any unstable or life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia or cardiac
             arrhythmia requiring intervention or a change in drug therapy within the past year
             prior to Visit 1 (screening).

          7. Patients with lung diseases other than asthma (eg COPD).

          8. Patients with known active tuberculosis.

          9. Patients with malignancy for which the patient has undergone resection, radiation
             therapy or chemotherapy within the last five years prior to Visit 1 (screening).
             Patients with treated basal cell carcinoma are allowed.

         10. Patients who have undergone thoracotomy with pulmonary resection. Patients with a
             history of thoracotomy for other reasons should be evaluated as per exclusion
             criterion no. 1.

         11. Patients with significant alcohol or drug abuse on Investigator's assessment within
             the past two years prior to Visit 1 (screening).

         12. Patients who are currently in a pulmonary rehabilitation program or have completed a
             pulmonary rehabilitation program in the 6 weeks prior to Visit 1 (screening).

         13. Patients with known hypersensitivity to anticholinergic drugs, BAC, EDTA or any other
             components of the study medication delivery systems.

             Visit 1.

         15. Female patients of child-bearing potential not using highly effective method of birth
             control. As defined in ICH (M3) [R09-1400], note 3, highly effective methods of birth
             control are defined as those, alone or in combination, that result in a low failure
             rate (ie less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly, such as
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, some intrauterine devices
             (IUDs), sexual abstinence or vasectomised partner. Barrier contraceptives (eg male
             condom or diaphragm) are acceptable if used in combination with spermicides (eg foam,
             gel).

             Female patients will be considered to be of childbearing potential unless surgically
             sterilised by hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation/salpingectomy, or
             post-menopausal for at least two years.

         16. Patients who have been treated with restricted medication prior to Visit 1 and/or
             during the screening period.

         17. Patients with any asthma exacerbation or any respiratory tract infection in the four
             weeks prior to Visit 1 or during the screening period.

             Visit 1 and/or Visit 2 should be postponed in case of an asthma exacerbation or
             respiratory tract infection. Refer to Section 6.1 for information on re-scheduling of
             visits.

         18. Patients who are currently participating in another trial or who have been
             participating in another trial within one month prior to Visit 0, and  patients who
             have previously been randomised in this trial.
