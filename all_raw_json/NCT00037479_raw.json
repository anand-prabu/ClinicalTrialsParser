            "textblock": "Some people with a history of Lyme disease continue to have problems despite having received\n      \u201ctextbook duration\u201d antibiotic therapy.  When memory, attention, or thinking problems\n      persist, the syndrome is called persistent Lyme disease (PLD).  This study seeks to answer\n      critical scientific questions about the treatment and cause of PLD symptoms.\n\n      This 24-week treatment study will evaluate each patient\u2019s response to treatment using\n      neuropsychological testing and state-of-the-art brain imaging.  The brain tests include\n      neuropsychological testing of memory and attention, brain imaging (MRI and PET scans) to\n      look at blood flow in the brain and nerve cell structure and metabolism, a neurological\n      exam, and studies of the fluid that surrounds the brain (cerebrospinal fluid).  The\n      treatment involves 10 weeks of either intravenous antibiotic called ceftriaxone (also known\n      as Rocephin) or intravenous placebo (inactive substance).  After the first visit to Columbia\n      Presbyterian Medical Center, the remaining treatments will be done in the patient\u2019s home.\n      Patients will be screened over the phone and in person to confirm study eligibility."
