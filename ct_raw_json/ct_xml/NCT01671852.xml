    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) in children is a disorder of breathing during sleep
      characterized by prolonged partial upper airway obstruction and/or intermittent complete
      obstruction (obstructive apnea) that disrupts normal breathing during sleep1.  The condition
      occurs in 2-5% of children and can occur at any age, but it is most common in children
      between the ages of 2 to 62,3.  Untreated OSA is associated with lung disease, heart
      disease, growth delay, poor learning and behavioral problems such as inattention and
      hyperactivity.  The most common underlying risk factor for the development of OSA is
      enlargement of tonsils and adenoids.  Given the potential risk of complications associated
      with surgery of the tonsils and adenoids, medications to shrink the adenoids without
      requiring surgery have been considered, in particular intranasal corticosteroids (INCSs)
      which is a nose spray.  A recent Cochrane systematic review suggested a short-term benefit
      of INCSs in children with mild to moderate OSA4.  The authors recommended that further
      randomised controlled studies were required to evaluate the efficacy of INCSs in children
      with OSA.  In particular they recommended that future studies should employ sleep studies to
      look for any improvement with INCSs, and should include children with more severe OSA, as
      these are the patients at the greatest risk of complications of surgery and would benefit
      most from a non-surgical treatment. The purpose of this study is therefore to explore the
      efficacy of INCSs in children with the full spectrum of OSA severity, including sleep study
      analysis., and longer term follow-up.

For patients that are between age 3 to 11 years and if they are randomized to the medicated group, they will use pediatric dosing of Mometasone nasal sprays, 1 spray (50 mcg) in each nostril once daily for 8 weeks.  For patients that are older than age 12 and if they are randomized to the medicated group, they will use adult dosing of Mometasone nasal sprays, 2 sprays (100mcg) in each nostril twice daily for 8 weeks.</description>
