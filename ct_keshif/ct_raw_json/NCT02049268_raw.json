Using a new multi-modal MRI approach combined\n      with data fusion, the investigators propose to study how nicotine modulates alcohol-induced\n      changes in the function of brain circuits. The investigators hypotheses are:\n\n        -  functional connectivity (FC) in the reward network, containing components of the\n           mesolimbic dopamine system, will be altered by alcohol, and additional increases in FC\n           will be observed if nicotine is also present (e.g., additive effects).\n\n        -  co-administration of nicotine will counteract the effects of alcohol on FC in multiple\n           brain networks, including visual, sensorimotor and motor brain circuits, that may be\n           associated with the impairing effects of alcohol"
