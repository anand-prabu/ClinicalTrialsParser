  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent evidence has shown that kidney volume predicts the likelihood of developing renal
      insufficiency over a finite length of time in ADPKD, suggesting a linkage between the growth
      of cysts and the harm they do to kidney function. Recent studies indicate that the rate of
      kidney volume increase is hastened by excess dietary protein, salt, and potential net acid
      precursors, and slowed by increased water intake sufficient to lower plasma vasopressin
      levels.

      Diets are commonly prescribed to treat ADPKD and other renal patients with disease near the
      end-stage, but there is currently no specific diet prescription that takes potentially
      harmful dietary elements into account for ADPKD patients in the earliest stages of the
      disease. This study will examine a novel diet for ADPKD created by the researcher termed the
      ADPKD diet.
