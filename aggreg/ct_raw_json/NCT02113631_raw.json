Eligible patients will have already been cleared for Hepatitis C\n      treatment through their screening period which is including blood work, liver biopsy, urine\n      collection/analysis, pregnancy screening and behavioral/mental health screening. On one of\n      their standard visits to the Hepatitis C clinic, the health care provider(who is also\n      research staff) or research staff will provide a consent form that the patient may take home\n      and read more about the study.\n\n      On the day of enrollment, which will also be the first day of treatment, health care\n      providers within the Hepatitis C clinic will describe the study to the patient or refer them\n      to one of the research for completion of these tasks. The consent form will be explained in\n      detail at this meeting, and the patient will have the opportunity to ask questions and make\n      comments about the study.\n\n      Study subjects will initially be stratified into 6 groups (1a. treatment naives without\n      cirrhosis and b. with compensated cirrhosis ; 2a. prior treatment experienced non-responders\n      without cirrhosis and b. with cirrhosis; 3a. prior treatment experienced relapsers without\n      cirrhosis and b. with cirrhosis). Patients in each of these groups will be randomized using\n      random number table and allocation concealment will be achieved by using serially numbered,\n      opaque, sealed envelopes into one of two study groups. The first group will receive\n      boceprevir with Peg-IFN and ribavirin as indicated by package insert, and the second group\n      will receive telaprevir with Peg-IFN and ribavirin as indicated by its package insert.  All\n      other stratified groups will receive protease inhibitor therapy as indicated by the FDA\n      product labeling.\n\n      Safety and effectiveness assessments will be conducted at study entry, PI therapy week 0, 2,\n      4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 42 and 48, if applicable. Those are SOC visits during the\n      treatment period and they will include blood tests, complete review of systems, and physical\n      exams.  Patients in all groups will be assessed for sustained viral response (SVR) at 12 and\n      24 weeks after the last dose of the medication is administered.\n\n      Identical to SOC, safety and effectiveness assessments will be determine by health care\n      providers and the adjudication committee, the latter of which will be unaware of the\n      treatment arm of the patients. Members of the adjudication committee will be independent of\n      the treating clinicians, and will be responsible for adjudicating the following outcomes:\n\n        -  Viral response\n\n        -  Adverse effects\n\n        -  Decision regarding treatment discontinuation, based on adverse effect or virological\n           failure"
