The VR system includes a camera based motion capture and a computer generated simulation. The camera is used to capture the movement of the participant's feet. These images are then transferred to the computer simulation and projected to the patient on a screen. The speed, orientation, size, frequency of appearance and shape of the targets are manipulated to increase task difficulty. The Virtual environment imposes a cognitive load requiring attention and response selection as well as processing of rich visual stimuli involving several perceptual processes. The system provides visual and auditory feedback of  task performance to enhance motor learning."

            "textblock": "Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is the most common neurobehavioral disorder\n      affecting children. ADHD is currently treated with a combination of medication and\n      behavioral therapy aimed at reducing the negative symptoms. Pharmacologic treatment methods,\n      such as the use of Methylphenidate (MPH) have many drawbacks including high cost and side\n      effects.\n\n      Non-pharmacological treatment approaches teach strategies aimed at improving behavior and\n      environmental management. Evidence on efficacy of these treatments is lacking and the\n      literature only supports the 'parental education' approach.\n\n      Motor aspects of the disorder tend to be undertreated. Studies have shown that persistent\n      use of MPH has a positive effect on motor output timing and coordination in children with\n      ADHD. Thus non-pharmacological interventions aimed at improving attention are likely to also\n      improve other aspects of the disorder such as motor problems and thus should be further\n      explored.\n\n      Various computerized remediation programs have been developed as a non-pharmacological\n      alternative for children with ADHD. The programs present exercises that require sustained\n      attention and a response to set rules and are often graded in task complexity according to\n      the user's abilities.\n\n      Virtual Reality (VR) is a simulation of the real world using computer graphics that requires\n      interaction, immersion and active participation by the user. VR applications have shown to\n      be effective in improving attention in children and adolescents with behavioral problems,\n      teaching them to focus on some tasks more than existing cognitive training programs. VR\n      while walking has demonstrated improvements in both motor and cognitive function in older\n      adults and patients with neurodegenerative diseases suggesting a beneficial effect on motor\n      and cognitive function. However this treatment has not been tested yet in ADHD.\n\n      The study will investigate the following aims:\n\n        1. To compare the effect of computerized cognitive remediation and VR on attention and\n           gait in children with ADHD.\n\n        2. To examine the long term effects of computerized cognitive remediation and VR on\n           attention and gait in children with ADHD.\n\n        3. To compare, in an exploratory analysis, the effects of the non-pharmacological training\n           paradigms to standard of care treatment on attention and gait in children with ADHD."
