      The progress of the study is described below:

      Session 1: intravenous administration of midazolam. Establishment of the individual dose.

      Randomisation.

      Session 2 :

      Group A : oral administration of midazolam : the dose administered is twice the individual
      dose determined in session 1.

      Group B : intravenous administration of midazolam at the individual dose determined in
      session 1.

      Session 3 :  reversal of the procedures :

      Group A : intravenous administration of midazolam at the individual dose determined in
      session 1.

      Group B : oral administration of midazolam : the dose administered is twice the individual
      dose determined in session 1.

             under inhalation sedation (50% N2O/O2), or following poor cooperation during
             treatment under inhalation sedation (poor cooperation is defined as a score of 3 or
             more on the French modified version of the Venham scale), or following good
             cooperation during short and simple treatment under inhalation sedation but in need
             of more complex rehabilitation.

          -  Written consent signed by the patient or his legal guardian

          -  Patient accompanied by an accountable person

        Exclusion Criteria:

             without declaring dental anxiety, during the month prior to the appointment

          -  Patient having received an anxiolytic premedication in the 24 hours preceding the
             dental care session

          -  Patient already treated under midazolam sedation less than a week ago
