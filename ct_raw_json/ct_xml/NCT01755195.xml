      Background:

      - Cabozantinib is a cancer treatment drug that blocks the growth of new blood vessels in
      tumors. It can also block a chemical on tumor cells that allows the cells to grow. A similar
      drug, pazopanib, is used to treat types of cancer known as sarcomas. Researchers want to see
      if cabozantinib can be an effective treatment for types of soft tissue sarcoma that have not
      responded to earlier treatments.

      Objectives:

      - To test the effectiveness of cabozantinib for soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded
      to standard treatments.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have soft tissue sarcomas that have not responded
      to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood samples
           will be collected. Imaging studies and other tests will be used to study the tumor
           before the start of treatment.

        -  Participants will take cabozantinib tablets daily for 28-day cycles of treatment. The
           tablets should be taken whole on an empty stomach.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. -
           Participants will continue to take cabozantinib for as long as the tumor does not
           become worse and the side effects are not too severe.

      Background:

        -  Soft tissue sarcomas (STS) are a relatively rare heterogeneous group of tumors that
           constitute about 1% of adult cancers.

        -  The mainstay of treatment for advanced disease has been palliative chemotherapy with a
           median overall survival of approximately 12 months. This has not changed considerably
           in the past years and there is an unmet need for newer targeted therapies.

        -  VEGF levels are elevated in patients with STS and various sarcoma cell lines express
           high levels of activated c-Met receptor.

        -  We hypothesize that dual targeting of the VEGF and c-MET pathways with cabozantinib
           would result in clinical benefit in patients with soft tissue sarcoma.

      Objectives:

      Primary:

        -  Assess the response rate (CR+PR) of cabozantinib in patients with soft tissue sarcomas.

        -  Assess the 6 month progression free survival (PFS) of cabozantinib in soft tissue
           sarcomas.

      Secondary:

      -Determine and compare circulating levels of HGF, soluble MET (sMET), VEGF-A, and soluble
      VEGFR2 (sVEGFR2) prior to and following administration of cabozantinib.

      Eligibility:

        -  Patients must have had disease progression following one line of standard therapy

        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.

        -  Adequate organ function.

        -  Patients will be stratified based on prior VEGFR TKI therapy.

      Design:

        -  All patients will receive cabozantinib at 60 mg PO daily in 4 week cycles.

        -  Tumor response evaluations by imaging will be done every 2 cycles.

        -  The study will be conducted as a dual-endpoint two-stage Phase II trial to target
           objective tumor response rate (CR+PR) of 30% against an unacceptably low rate of 10%,
           and 6-month PFS rate of 65% against an unacceptably low rate of 45% (corresponding to
           median PFS of 9.6 vs. 5.2 months).

        -  The trial will accrue up to 50 patients.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma that
             is metastatic or unresectable and for which standard treatment that prolongs survival
             does not exist or is no longer effective.

          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt; 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.

          -  Patients are allowed prior VEGFR-TKI therapy, which should have been completed at
             least 3 months prior to enrollment. Patients will be stratified based on prior
             VEGFR-TKI therapy.

          -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are
             currently available on the use of cabozantinib in patients &lt; 18 years of age,
             children are excluded from this study.

          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1 (Karnofsky &gt; 70%).

          -  Life expectancy &gt;  3 months.

          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:

               -  leukocytes greater than or equal to 3,000/mcL

               -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500/mcL

          -  (PT)/ International Normalized Ratio (INR) or partial thromboplastin time

          -  (PTT) test &lt; 1.3 times the laboratory ULN

               -  Subjects must have blood pressure (BP) no greater than 140 mmHg (systolic) and
                  90 mmHg (diastolic) for eligibility. Initiation or adjustment of BP medication
                  is permitted prior to study entry provided that the average of three BP readings
                  at the time of enrollment is less than or equal to 140/90 mmHg

               -  Patients must be able to swallow whole tablets. Tablets must not be crushed or
                  chewed.

               -  The effects of cabozantinib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this
                  reason and because receptor tyrosine kinases are known to be teratogenic, women
                  of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception. All
                  subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier method and a
                  second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4 months
                  after the last dose of study drug(s).

        Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier
        methods of contraception (e.g., male or female condom) during the course of the study and
        for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives are also
        used.

        -Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients who have had anticancer therapy, including kinase inhibitors, within 4 weeks
             (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who
             have not recovered to baseline from adverse events (except alopecia and other
             non-clinically significant AEs) due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.
             Prior VEGFR therapy should have been completed at least 3 months prior to enrollment.
             Patients who have received prior cabozantinib or inhibitors of c-MET or HGF are
             ineligible.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days before the
             first dose of the study treatment.

          -  The subject has received radionuclide treatment within 6 weeks of the first dose of
             study treatment

          -  The subject has received radiation therapy:

               -  to the thoracic cavity, abdomen, or pelvis within 3 months before the first dose
                  of study treatment, or has ongoing complications, or is without complete
                  recovery and healing from prior radiation therapy.

               -  to bone or brain metastasis within 14 days before the first dose of study
                  treatment

               -  to any other site(s) within 28 days before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Patients with active brain metastases or carcinomatous meningitis or epidural disease
             are excluded from this clinical trial. Subjects with brain metastases previously
             treated with whole brain radiation or radiosurgery or subjects with epidural disease
             previously treated with radiation who are asymptomatic and have remained stable for 4
             weeks and do not require steroid treatment for at least 2 weeks before starting study
             treatment are eligible. Neurosurgical resection of brain metastases or brain biopsy
             is permitted if completed at least 3 months before starting study treatment. Baseline
             brain imaging with contrast-enhanced CT or MRI scans for subjects with known brain
             metastases is required to confirm eligibility.

          -  Eligibility of subjects receiving any medications or substances known to affect or
             with the potential to affect the activity of cabozantinib will be determined
             following review of their cases by the Principal Investigator. Patients who are
             taking enzyme-inducing anticonvulsant agents are not eligible.

          -  Patients with refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases
             (e.g., inflammatory bowel disease), or significant bowel resection that could
             interfere with absorption.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to symptomatic
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or
             psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because cabozantinib has the potential
             for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential
             risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with
             cabozantinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with
             cabozantinib.

          -  Strong inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can affect levels of cabozantinib and should
             be avoided whenever possible or switched to alternatives. Subjects requiring chronic
             concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g., dexamethasone, phenytoin,
             carbamazepine, rifampin, rifabutin, rifapentin, phenobarbital, and St. John   s Wort)
             are not eligible for this study. Because the lists of these agents are constantly
             changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated list such as
             http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/; medical reference texts such as the
             Physicians    Desk Reference may also provide this information. As part of the
             enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be counseled on the risk of
             interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications need to be
             prescribed or if the patient is considering a new overthe-counter medicine or herbal
             product.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with cabozantinib. Appropriate studies
             will be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

          -  The subject has PT/INR or PTT test greater than or equal to 1.3 times the laboratory
             ULN within 7 days before the first dose of study treatment.

          -  The subject requires concomitant treatment, in therapeutic doses, with anticoagulants
             such as warfarin or warfarin-related agents, heparin, thrombin or Factor Xa
             inhibitors, or antiplatelet agents (e.g., clopidogrel). Low dose aspirin (less than
             or equal to 81 mg/day), low-dose warfarin (less than or equal to 1 mg/day), and
             prophylactic low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are permitted.

          -  The subject has experienced any of the following

               -  clinically-significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 6 months before the
                  first dose of study treatment

               -  hemoptysis of greater than or equal to 0.5 teaspoon (2.5 mL) of red blood within
                  3 months before the first dose of study treatment

               -  any other signs indicative of pulmonary hemorrhage within 3 months before the
                  first dose of study treatment

          -  The subject has radiographic evidence of cavitating pulmonary lesion(s).

          -  The subject has tumor in contact with, invading, or encasing any major blood vessels

          -  The subject has evidence of tumor invading the GI tract (esophagus, stomach, small or
             large bowel, rectum or anus), or any evidence of endotracheal or endobronchial tumor
             within 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib

          -  The subject has uncontrolled, significant intercurrent or recent illness including,

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;
             500 ms within 28 days before enrollment. Note: if initial QTcF is found to be &gt;  500
             ms, two additional EKGs separated by at least 3 minutes should be performed. If the
             average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is less than or equal to 500 ms,
             the subject meets eligibility in this regard.

          -  The subject is unable or unwilling to abide by the study protocol or cooperate fully
             with the investigator or designee.

          -  The subject has had evidence within 2 years of the start of study treatment of
             another malignancy which required systemic treatment.

          -  Patients should not have any clinical evidence of an active infection at the time of
             enrollment. Patients with a history of infection within 28 days prior to enrollment
             should have completed their course of systemic therapy.
