Part A of this study involved creating surveys\n      about biospecimen donation and research.  Now, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) will\n      begin to evaluate education materials about biospecimen donation and research.\n\n      Phase II consists of two independent randomized controlled trials. Each trial is being\n      conducted independently to test English and Spanish language materials (75 subjects each)."

Once developed,\n      the instruments will be used to evaluate biobanking educational priming tools by conducting\n      two independent RCTs. Wherein English educational materials will be tested with 75\n      participants recruited from an urban clinic, and Spanish educational materials will be\n      tested with 75 participant recruited form a rural community health center network. For each\n      RCT following baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to either: 1) educational\n      priming tools (DVD and booklet) developed by the Tampa Bay Community Cancer Network (TBCCN);\n      or 2) an NCI-developed brochure entitled \"Providing Your Tissue for Research: What You Need\n      to Know.\" Seven to 28 days later participants will be given a telephone follow up interview."
