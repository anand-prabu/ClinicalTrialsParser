            "textblock": "In uveitis, white blood and inflammatory cells can enter the anterior chamber of the eye and\n      adhere to the back surface of the cornea or enter the space between the lens and the retina\n      in various types of uveitis.  Transparency of the clear fluid that fills the space between\n      the cornea and the lens (or between the lens and the retina) can be reduced due to the\n      inflammation reaction of the eye. The amounts of these cells and reduced transparency that\n      are present indicate the level of severity of inflammation.\n\n      The primary goal of this study is to use OCT to standardize anterior chamber (AC) cell\n      grading. Another goal is to discover whether the size of cells and particles in the AC\n      measured by OCT differs between uveitis diagnostic categories. OCT will also be used to\n      detect protein concentration increases within the clear fluid inside the eye and determine\n      if the concentration increase correlates with findings from the usual slit lamp grading\n      method.\n\n      Background data including age, sex, medical history, and eye history will be gathered prior\n      to the study/OCT testing visit. Other standard-of-care testing, like visual acuity and slit\n      lamp (biomicroscope) exam will be performed to see if there is evidence of uveitis that\n      meets the inclusion criteria for this study. If so, grading of the eye inflammation will be\n      performed as defined by the Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature (SUN). Once enrolled in\n      the study, subjects will then undergo OCT testing with the study device to assess AC cells,\n      AC flare (increased protein), keratic precipitates (cells adhered to back surface of\n      cornea), and vitreous cells & haze (increased opacities in vitreous gel).\n\n      OCT Procedure: The subject will be seated and have their head positioned on a chin rest.\n      They will be asked to look at a target (a lighted spot) while a beam of light scans the\n      front part of the eye. The light is infrared and will not be visible or cause any sensation.\n      A cotton tip swab may be used to help hold the eyelid open temporarily if necessary."
