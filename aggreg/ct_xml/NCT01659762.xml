    <textblock>
      In this Phase I trial the investigators intend to show safety and tolerability of autologous
      MSC, expanded using a non-xenogeneic, human component platelet lysate expansion media.
      Fresh, non cryopreserved, autologous MSCs will delivered intravenously as a single bolus
      dose in a dose escalation phase I study. The investigators intend to test whether the
      product is clinically safe in adults (18-65 years old) with CD and to determine maximal
      deliverable dose. Secondary endpoint will monitor effectiveness using CDAI as an endpoint.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      EPIC MSC/IBD is made up of autologous marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells ex vivo
      expanded numerically for approximately 14 days using pooled human Platelet Lysate (phPL),
      harvested on the day of infusion, washed and suspended at a concentration of 4 million
      cells/ml in Plasmalyte A with 0.5% human serum albumin.  This is a phase I dose-escalation,
      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of EPIC MSC2011-001.
      EPIC EPIC MSC/IBD will be infused intravenously and will be administered at one of three
      dose levels: (Tier 1) 2 million cells/kg patient body weight; (Tier 2) 5 million cells/kg,
      and (Tier 3) 10 million cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll 16-20 subjects
      with moderate to severe Crohn's. The duration of this study for each patient is 12 weeks.
      The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of
      commencement.

      Primary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of a single infusion
      of fresh autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells infused to patients with
      moderate to severe Crohn's disease.

      Secondary objective: Efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells
      infusion to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease as assessed through disease
      activity index, and quality of life index.

      Safety variables:Adverse events (AEs),Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry,
      urinalysis), Vital signs.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Men and women 18-65 years of age.

          -  Patient must have had CD for at least 3 months from the time of initial diagnosis.
             The diagnosis of CD must have been confirmed by endoscopic and histological evidence.

          -  Patients must have active Crohn's disease as defined by a Crohns Disease Activity
             Index (CDAI) score between &gt;220 at screening and baseline.

          -  Patients should have no need for immediate surgery (i.e. due to obstruction,
             strictures,  active abscess or perforations ).

          -  Subjects must be refractory (defined as lack of response for at least 3 months) to
             immunomodulators (including 6-mercaptopurine and azathioprine and methotrexate) or
             anti-TNF therapy at present or some point in the course of their disease. Lack of
             response is defined by failure to reduce the CDAI score by at least 70 points.

          -  The following medications will be allowed: mesalamine and prednisone (stable dose for
             at least 2 weeks prior to enrollment).

          -  Subjects on anti TNF therapy will require a minimum of 4 weeks washout period prior
             to screening.

          -  Subjects on non-steroidal analgesics require a minimum of 2 weeks washout period
             prior to screening

          -  If female and of child-bearing age, patient must be non-pregnant, non-breastfeeding,
             and use adequate contraception;

          -  Patient is willing to participate in the study and has signed the informed consent.
