  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study proposes to evaluate the combination of maraviroc with raltegravir in
      antiretroviral-experienced patients to document the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of
      this combination in order to provide clinicians with a treatment regimen that minimizes the
      risk of metabolic complications by avoidance of NRTI/NNRTIs and PIs. The development of an
      alternative ART regimen which lessens the risk of metabolic complications could improve
      long-term adherence and reduce the risk of certain co-morbidities associated with long-term
      ART use. If this new combination is found to be as efficacious as the standard regimen with
      enhanced tolerability and improved metabolic effects, there is great potential for altering
      the current practice of HIV medicine.
