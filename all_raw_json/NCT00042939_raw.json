Monoclonal antibodies such as cetuximab can locate tumor cells\n      and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with cetuximab may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying giving irinotecan and docetaxel together\n      with cetuximab to see how well it works compared to irinotecan and docetaxel alone in\n      treating patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer ."
