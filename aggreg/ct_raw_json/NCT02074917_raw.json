There\n      is evidence that graft placement aligned with native insertion sites results in superior\n      clinical outcomes. Current anatomic ACL reconstruction concepts highlight the importance of\n      the native anatomy to restore physiological knee kinematics more accurately.\n\n      This study aims to investigate clinical outcomes and dynamic knee stability  with force\n      platform and other functional tests after ACL reconstruction in two different groups of\n      tunnel position: anteromedial ACL footprint (AM) or central ACL footprint.\n\n      It was hypothesized that there would be clinical or dynamic stability differences between AM\n      or Central tunnel groups in ACL reconstruction."
