            "textblock": "Following the decline of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, clinicians face febrile patients in\n      whom an alternative diagnosis has to be made. This situation has led to an overuse of\n      antibiotics by clinicians.  It is crucial to increase knowledge on etiologies and risk\n      factors of outpatient febrile illness in order to improve their management.\n\n      This present proposal aims to investigate the etiologies of fever among adult patients\n      attending an outpatient department in urban Tanzania. It also aims to assess the clinical\n      significance of nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viruses and bacteria documentation in this\n      setting. Third, it aims to compare the spectrum of infections in this population with that\n      of children included in the same setting in a previous study. The last objective is to\n      assess diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for infection and exposure to indoor air\n      pollution (IAP) as a risk factor for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in adults in\n      Tanzania.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that acute respiratory infections are the main cause of adult\n      febrile illness in a urban low-income setting and that use of quantitative molecular assays\n      on naso-oropharyngeal samples can improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. The investigators also\n      think that the spectrum of infections is different between children and adults, mainly due\n      to a high HIV prevalence in adults. The investigators also hypothesize that experiencing IAP\n      and/ or DM is a risk factor for infections in adults."
