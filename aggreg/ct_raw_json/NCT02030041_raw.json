Statins are widely prescribed in combination with exercise to lower risk of\n      cardiovascular disease morbidity and mortality. Every 1 millimole per liter reduction in LDL\n      is associated with a 10-20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause\n      mortality , while every 1 MET (3.5 milliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per\n      minute) increase in fitness is associated with an 18% reduction in cardiovascular disease\n      mortality  and an 11-50% reduction in all-cause mortality. Although the mechanisms are\n      poorly understood, some statins have been shown to reduce skeletal muscle mitochondrial\n      content and oxidative capacity in humans .\n\n      The muscle is a special potential target for the vitamin D endocrine system. Myopathy is\n      well recognized in patients with severe vitamin D deficiency. This myopathy can be rapidly\n      and impressively corrected by the appropriate vitamin D therapy. The beneficial effect of\n      vitamin D supplementation of severely deficient but otherwise healthy adults on muscle\n      weakness, has been reported by improved mitochondrial function.\n\n      Despite the potential public health implications, studies examining the benefits and risks\n      of combining statins and exercise in humans are limited. Moreover, Vitamin D may play a role\n      in statin mediated changes in exercise adaptations.This study is being done to look for\n      effect of simvastatin on exercise mediated cardiorespiratory fitness and the effect of\n      vitamin D supplementation in these settings."

            "textblock": "Metabolic syndrome is common in adult Asian Indians and was present in 41.1% of the study\n      subjects in a study by Ramachandran et al in 2003. Among the total, only 8.6% were without\n      any abnormality of the various components of metabolic syndrome. Therapeutic lifestyle\n      changes, including exercise, are the first line of treatment for patients with the metabolic\n      syndrome. The health benefits of exercise have been widely described, including an increase\n      in cardiorespiratory fitness.Cardiorespiratory fitness has been identified as the strongest\n      independent predictor of both all cause and cardiovascular disease mortality in nearly every\n      population in which it has been examined Statins, a class of hydroxyl methyl\n      glutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors  that lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\n      are commonly prescribed to patients with the metabolic syndrome or those with multiple\n      cardiovascular disease risk factors when lifestyle changes fail to achieve LDL targets to\n      reduce the risk of coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality.\n\n      Statins are widely prescribed in combination with exercise to lower risk of cardiovascular\n      disease morbidity and mortality. Every 1millimole per liter reduction in LDL is associated\n      with a 10-20% reduction in risk of cardiovascular events and all-cause mortality3,4 , while\n      every 1 MET (3.5 milliters of oxygen per kilogram of body weight per minute) increase in\n      fitness is associated with an 18% reduction in cardiovascular disease mortality5 and an\n      11-50% reduction in all-cause mortality. Some statins (simvastatin, atorvastatin,\n      fluvastatin) have been shown to reduce skeletal muscle mitochondrial content and oxidative\n      capacity in humans.\n\n      Catherine et al examined the effects of simvastatin on changes in cardiorespiratory fitness\n      and skeletal muscle mitochondrial content in response to aerobic exercise training.\n      Sedentary overweight or obese adults with at least 2 metabolic syndrome risk factors\n      (defined according to National Cholesterol Education Panel Adult Treatment Panel III\n      criteria) were randomized to 12 weeks of aerobic exercise training or to exercise in\n      combination with simvastatin (40 mg per day). The primary outcomes were cardiorespiratory\n      fitness and skeletal muscle (vastus lateralis) mitochondrial content (citrate synthase\n      enzyme activity). Thirty-seven participants (exercise plus statins; n=18; exercise only;\n      n=19) completed the study. Cardiorespiratory fitness increased by 10% (P<0.05) in response\n      to exercise training alone, but was blunted by the addition of simvastatin resulting in only\n      a 1.5% increase (P<0.005 for group by time interaction). Similarly, skeletal muscle citrate\n      synthase activity increased by 13% in the exercise only group (P <0.05), but decreased by\n      4.5% in the simvastatin plus exercise group (P<0.05 for group by time interaction).\n\n      Since vitamin D deficiency is common in the general population, and can be associated with\n      reversible myalgias, Duell et al hypothesized that vitamin D deficiency may contribute to\n      myopathic symptoms in some patients on statins.\n\n      Sinha et al examined the effects of cholecalciferol therapy on skeletal mitochondrial\n      oxidative function in vitamin D deficient subjects using 31P magnetic resonance\n      spectroscopy. This longitudinal study assessed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation in\n      the gastrosoleus compartment using phosphorus-31 magnetic resonance spectroscopy\n      measurements of phosphocreatine recovery kinetics in 12 symptomatic, severely vitamin\n      D-deficient subjects before and after treatment with cholecalciferol therapy to document\n      serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) and bone profiles. Fifteen healthy controls also underwent\n      31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and serum 25OHD assessment. The phosphocreatine recovery\n      half-time (t1/2PCr) was significantly reduced after cholecalciferol therapy in the subjects\n      indicating an improvement in maximal oxidative phosphorylation(34.44 \u00b18.18 sec to 27.84\n      \u00b19.54 sec, P <.001). This was associated with an improvement in mean serum 25OHD levels (8.8\n      \u00b14.2 nmol/L to 113.8 \u00b1 51.5 nmol/L, P < .001). There was no difference in phosphate\n      metabolites at rest. All patients reported an improvement in fatigue after cholecalciferol\n      therapy.\n\n      In recent years, there has been a growing movement to begin prescribing statins to low-risk\n      patients and to all patients over the age of 50 for the primary prevention of cardiovascular\n      disease making the case for statins to be used in primary prevention.Despite the potential\n      public health implications, studies examining the benefits and risks of combining statins\n      and exercise in humans are limited"
