After cardioversion, the recurrence rate and\n      duration of atrial fibrillation free time will be evaluated.\n\n      This trial consists of  2 weeks of observation and medical therapy, 2 weeks of acupuncture\n      intervention before EC, EC and acupuncture intervention, 7 weeks of additional intervention,\n      and 5 weeks of follow-up. After randomization, participants receive 10 sessions of\n      acupuncture treatments over 10 weeks. The outcome is assessed at 2, 4, 6, 8, and 16 week\n      after randomization."
