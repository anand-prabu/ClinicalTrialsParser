Experimental group will undergo with\n      real acupuncture treatment(manual acupuncture + electroacupuncture) twice a week, for 6\n      weeks. The effect on serum metabolic parameters will be assessed at 0 and 6 weeks.\n\n      Second is qualitative research to make a basis through the evaluation of economic efficacy\n      and patients' satisfaction with acupuncture treatment for obesity."
