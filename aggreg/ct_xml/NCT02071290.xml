  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether remote ischemic conditioning is a safe and
      effective intervention to prevent the development of inflammation and coagulopathy in trauma
      patients with hemorrhagic shock.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dysfunction of vital organs is one of the major reasons why trauma victims die after
      sustaining a major injury, even though the organs themselves may not have been directly
      injured. The inability to clot blood as a result of inflammation further contributes to
      complications in a majority of these patients. One intervention proposed to protect against
      impaired organ function is called &quot;Remote Ischemic Conditioning&quot;, wherein application of
      intermittent occlusion and release of blood flow to the arm by sequentially inflating and
      deflating a blood pressure cuff can protect against the development of distant organ injury
      and inflammation following a severe traumatic event. In a pilot study, we will investigate
      the effects of remote ischemic conditioning in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, with
      a view to evaluate its effects on the immune system and coagulation profiles, both of which
      are known to be deranged in these patients. These studies will potentially benefit patients
      and will serve as a proof of principle for the use of remote ischemic conditioning in the
      trauma setting.
