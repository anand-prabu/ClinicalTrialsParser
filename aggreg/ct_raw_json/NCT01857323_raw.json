The run-in period will commence\n      the day following the completion of all screening procedures and will continue through to\n      and include the day prior to the first treatment visit (TV1) such that a minimum of 7 full\n      days of diary data will be collected prior to TV1. The purpose of the run-in period is to\n      assess compliance with a BID dosing regimen and with the completion of the diary entries\n      over a minimum period of 7 days. Patients who demonstrate adequate inhaler technique and who\n      are at least 90% compliant with dosing and completion of the diary on the last 7 consecutive\n      days of run-in will qualify for enrollment into the open-label study. The study treatment\n      period will comprise 6 treatment visits (TV1-TV6) for all enrolled patients except those in\n      the 5-week treatment cohort who will have only 5 treatment visits (TV1-TV5). Patients may\n      continue taking their current asthma or COPD medications throughout the Treatment Period.\n      The patient will return to the clinic on Days 8 (\u00b11), 15 (\u00b11), 22 (\u00b11), and 36 (\u00b11), and\n      then on Day 50 (-2) after approximately all 200 doses have been delivered, or until early\n      withdrawal. The patient will be deemed to have completed the study if at least 90% of the\n      recommended doses contained in Albuterol Spiromax with dose-counter were used. A\n      representative sample (approximately 15%) of patients will participate in the trial for\n      approximately 5 weeks with Day 36 (\u00b11) being the final study visit."

Females of childbearing potential (as judged by the investigator) currently using and\n             will continue to use a medically reliable method of contraception for the entire\n             study duration (e.g. oral, injectable, trans-cutaneous or implantable contraceptives\n             or intrauterine devices or double-barrier protection). Females who are not sexually\n             active must agree to use a medically reliable method of contraception should they\n             become active during the course of the study. Women of childbearing potential, or\n             less than 1 year postmenopausal, will require a negative urine pregnancy test at the\n             SV. Female patients will be considered to be of non-child-bearing potential and will\n             not require a urine pregnancy test if at least one of the following apply:a. before\n             menarche; b. more than one year post-menopausal; c. had a hysterectomy, bilateral\n             oophorectomy, salpingectomy, or tubal ligation; d. has congenital sterility\n\n          4. General good health, defined as free of any concomitant conditions or treatment that\n             could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of study\n             observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the study\n\n          5. Has a physician diagnosis of asthma or COPD with symptoms of bronchoconstriction\n             requiring the use of short-acting \u03b22-agonists\n\n          6.

Able to demonstrate satisfactory Spiromax inhaler use and technique.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. History of life-threatening asthma or COPD that is defined for this protocol as an\n             asthma or COPD episode that required intubation and/or was associated with\n             hypercapnea, respiratory arrest, or hypoxic seizures\n\n          2. Culture-documented or suspected bacterial or viral infection of the upper or lower\n             respiratory tract, sinus, or middle ear that is not resolved within 2 weeks of the\n             SV; or that occurs between the SV and TV1\n\n          3.

Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 2 months of SV and any\n             COPD exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 1 month of the SV. A patient\n             must not have been hospitalized for asthma or COPD within 4 months prior to the SV.\n\n          5. Historical or current evidence of a clinically significant disease including, but not\n             limited to: cardiovascular (e.g., congestive heart failure, known aortic aneurysm,\n             clinically significant cardiac arrhythmia or coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular\n             accident), hepatic, renal, hematological, neuropsychological, endocrine (e.g.,\n             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, uncontrolled thyroid disorder, Addison's disease,\n             Cushing's syndrome), and/or gastrointestinal (e.g., poorly-controlled peptic ulcer or\n             gastroesophageal reflux disease [GERD]). Significant is defined as any disease that,\n             in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the patient at risk\n             through participation, or which could affect the endpoint analysis if the\n             disease/condition exacerbated during the study.\n\n          6.

History of any adverse reaction, including immediate or delayed hypersensitivity to\n             any \u03b22-agonist, sympathomimetic drug, or any component of the Albuterol Spiromax DPI\n             or rescue ProAir Hydrofluoroalkane (HFA) Metered-dose inhaler (MDI) formulation.\n\n          8.
