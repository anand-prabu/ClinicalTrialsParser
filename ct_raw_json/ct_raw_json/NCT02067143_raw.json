Pretreatment with low-dose corticosteroids in\n             patients presenting with hyperleukocytosis is allowed. All diagnostic procedures need\n             to be performed on freshly obtained bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB)\n             samples.

A\n             pregnancy test is performed at diagnosis but does not preclude the enrolment into\n             study.
