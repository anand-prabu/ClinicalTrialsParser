Morphine is a narcotic medicine, with is included in most pain killers.\n      Clonidine is another drug, but is different from morphine.  It is also used for babies, and\n      even adults for withdrawal symptoms.  Both drugs are effective, but the purpose of this\n      study is to see if one may be better than the other."

Medicines the mother takes\n      while pregnant, the baby also takes. Babies may experience withdrawal after delivery, and\n      may need treatment.  There are different ways to treat babies with withdrawal - about 50% of\n      doctors use morphine, an opiate, to treat these babies, the rest uses other drugs, like\n      clonidine and phenobarbitol."
