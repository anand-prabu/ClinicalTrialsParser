We will\n      study the relation between sarcopenia, comprehensive geriatric assessment en\n      pharmacokinetics with treatment related toxicity as well. We hypothesize that a standardized\n      flow cytometry test to determine bone marrow capacity, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment\n      and/or measurement of human body composition with computerized tomography will provide an\n      accurate tool to optimize treatment strategies in elderly patients with advanced\n      malignancies."
