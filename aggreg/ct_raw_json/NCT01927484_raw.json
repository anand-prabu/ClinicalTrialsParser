            "textblock": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a common disabling condition, for which no effective therapy\n      currently exists. Synovitis is commonly demonstrated in knee OA imaging. Synovial\n      inflammation due to the release of cytokines is an important cause of pain. Methotrexate\n      (MTX) helps to decrease synovitis in many inflammatory joint diseases, particularly\n      rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to assess the efficacy of MTX in decreasing pain and\n      inflammation in symptomatic knee OA.\n\n      Methods: One hundred and forty-four patients with American College of Rheumatology (ACR)\n      clinical and radiographic criteria of primary knee OA with knee pain, [>4 on the 24-hour\n      average pain severity scale (0-10) using mean of daily ratings from week preceding\n      randomization] for > 14 days/month during 3 consecutive months preceding enrollment will be\n      included in this randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. Patients meeting the\n      eligibility criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either 25mg/week oral MTX\n      (n=72) or placebo (n=72) together with their usual therapy provided the dosages were kept\n      constant for 28 weeks. Pain will be assessed using the Visual Analogue pain Scale, (VAS,\n      0-100 mm). Functional assessment will be performed using the Western Ontario and McMaster\n      Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) and Activities of daily living (ADL) scores.\n      Alterations in dosage of analgesic/NSAID drugs used will be recorded. Safety and\n      tolerability will also be assessed. Synovitis will be detected by ultrasound imaging."
