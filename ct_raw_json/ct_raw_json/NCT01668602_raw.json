            "textblock": "Stroke is the number one cause of disability. Difficulty with walking affects most stroke\n      survivors. The focus of this project is to understand the effects of different methods (such\n      as treadmill walking and electrical stimulation) that can be used to improve walking in\n      people with stroke. In this study, patients with stroke and healthy people who have not had\n      a stroke will be tested. Study participants will take part in 12 sessions of walking\n      training. Walking patterns will be measured using automatic cameras and standard clinical\n      tests. Also, magnetic brain stimulation maybe used to measure brain-muscle connections\n      during the training. This research will provide information on how different factors that\n      affect walking in stroke change with walking training. The investigators hypothesize that\n      improvements in brain excitability of the muscles targeted by walking training will occur\n      after training, and these changes in brain excitability will be related to improvements in\n      walking patterns. By improving our understanding of walking rehabilitation, this study can\n      help improve walking function and disability in people with stroke."
