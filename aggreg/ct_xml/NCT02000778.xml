    <textblock>
      The overall prevalence of Ovarian Cancer in the United States according to the US SEER
      Registry is 182,710 women. Ovarian cancer also has the highest mortality rate of the
      gynecological cancers. The overall five-year survival rate is 45% and for Stages III and IV
      it is only 20-25%.iii. The majority of these are aged 50 years or older, but a few girls
      less than 10 years of age have been diagnosed with ovarian cancer. This risk increases with
      age and decreases with numbers of pregnancies.

      The prognosis for many carcinomas is dependent on the extent of surgical resection. At
      present, the ability to perform a complete resection with negative margins is limited by the
      investigator's ability to palpate and visualize the tumor and its borders. In many cases, a
      more radical resection than necessary is performed in order to provide assurance that
      negative margins are achieved. This approach may also increase complication rates, as well
      as short- and long-term morbidity. It is desirable to improve visualization of primary
      tumors and occult metastases in real time, during surgery. The use of fluorescent probes
      that recognize cancer-specific antigens, in conjunction with a clinical imaging system, is
      under investigation.

      Ovarian cancer is a prototypic disease for this type of clinical imaging system called
      intra-operative imaging. Except in Stage IV, the tumors are confined to the pelvis or
      abdomen and typically involve extensions or implants onto pelvic or abdominal organs or
      membranes. Tumor debulking surgery is common early in the disease process as many of the
      tumors can be identified by appearance or feel in the skilled surgeon's hands. The major
      problems are that tumors can be diffuse and numerous, of various sizes, and often not
      readily visible in the surgical field.

      Over 90-95% of serous ovarian cancers express folate receptor (FR)-alpha, making this
      receptor an ideal target for marking most ovarian cancers.iv Folate is the prototypic
      agonist at the FR-alpha with potential uses for imaging and targeted therapeutic
      strategies.v Chemotherapy does not affect FR-alpha expression in ovarian cancer specimens
      examined by immunohistochemistry,vi so prior treatment is unlikely to affect utility of
      FR-alpha agonists as imaging or therapeutic agents. A fluorescent probe targeting FR-alpha,
      Folate-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate), is readily available

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects 18 years of age and older

          2. Female subjects of childbearing potential or less than 2 years postmenopausal agree
             to receive a urinary or serum beta HCG test prior to subject enrollment.
             Documentation must be acquired for women of menopausal or post-menopausal status
             prior to subject enrollment if they are below the age of sixty (60).

          3. Primary diagnosis, or at high clinical suspicion, of primary ovarian cancer:

               1. Patient is scheduled to undergo laparotomy OR

               2. Patient is scheduled to undergo laparoscopy then pre-authorized laparotomy if
                  cancer is found.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        1. Known sarcomatous histologies

          1. Recurrent ovarian cancer

          2. Known FR-alpha negative cancer

          3. Planned surgical approach via laparoscopy or robotic (no intention to perform
             laparotomy)

          4. History of anaphylactic reactions to Folate-FITC (EC17) or insects

          5. Pregnancy

          6. Brain metastases

          7. Taking compounds that inhibit active transport of organic anions (probenecid)

             for ALT, AST, or total bilirubin (except for known cases of Gilbert's syndrome), or
             renal impairment, as evidenced by greater than 1.5x the ULN for BUN or creatinine

          9. Received study agent in another investigational drug or vaccine trial prior to
             surgery
