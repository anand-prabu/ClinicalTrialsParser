            "textblock": "Rosacea is a chronic inflammatory disorder that is characterized by severe flushing\n      (transient erythema), non-transient erythema, papules, pustules, and telangiectasia. Topical\n      therapy is not always effective in treating symptoms of rosacea. Furthermore, rapid\n      recurrence is common following the use of systemic antibiotics, resulting in the chronic use\n      of these medications to control the disease. Although the exact pathogenesis of rosacea is\n      unknown, treatment for this condition has been investigated based on its similarity to acne\n      and photodamaged skin. Case reports have shown promising results in rosacea patients treated\n      with methyl aminolevulinate photodynamic therapy (MAL - PDT).  Other than a case report\n      which observed significant improvement of papules, pustules, erythema, and flushing\n      following 5 - aminolevulinic acid photodynamic therapy (ALA-PDT) treatment of a patient with\n      rosacea, the role of ALA-PDT in the treatment of rosacea has not been reported.\n\n      We have designed a pilot study investigating the efficacy of ALA-PDT in treating\n      papulopustular rosacea. The objectives of the study are as follows:\n\n      Primary objective:\n\n        1. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules),\n           erythema, and telangiectasia of rosacea as assessed by the Investigator's Global\n           Assessment (IGA).\n\n        2. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of\n           rosacea as assessed by the Inflammatory Lesion Investigator's Global Assessment\n           (ILIGA).\n\n           Secondary objectives:\n\n        3. To evaluate improvement of rosacea associated erythema as assessed by the Clinical\n           Erythema Assessment (CEA) scale.\n\n        4. To evaluate improvement of the inflammatory lesions (papules, pustules, nodules) of\n           rosacea as measured by a difference in inflammatory lesion count.\n\n        5. To evaluate improvement of rosacea as assessed by the Patient Overall Assessment Scale."
