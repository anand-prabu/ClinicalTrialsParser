  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanisms that typically result in increased cardiac output, such as inotropic support,
      increased heart rate, and decreased afterload, have a blunted effect in Fontan circulation.
      The &quot;thoracic pump&quot; is a contributor to venous return that has been largely unexplored in
      patients with Fontan physiology. Inspiratory muscle training can improve the performance of
      competitive athletes across a range of sports and can improve quality of life and functional
      capacity in heart failure patients, presumably by reducing inspiratory muscle fatigue and
      possibly by improving peripheral blood flow during exercise.  One could surmise that the
      effects of these changes would be particularly important in the Fontan population. The
      investigators propose to study the effects of inspiratory muscle training on exercise and
      pulmonary function parameters in a cohort of adult Fontan patients.

      The investigators hypothesize that a 12-week program of inspiratory muscle training with an
      inspiratory impedance threshold device will improve inspiratory muscle strength and
      endurance, and that this will translate into improved exercise performance in patients with
      Fontan physiology.

    <description>Subjects will be provided with noseclips and a threshold impedance device set to 40% of their measured maximal inspiratory pressure and will be trained on using the device.  Specifically, subjects will be instructed to breathe through the inspiratory muscle training device while wearing noseclips at a rate of 12 to 16 breaths per minute for 30 minutes a day, 5 days a week for 12 consecutive weeks. Each subject will be provided a customized schedule for increasing resistance by 2 cm H2O every 2 weeks to a maximum resistance of 41 cm H2O.</description>
