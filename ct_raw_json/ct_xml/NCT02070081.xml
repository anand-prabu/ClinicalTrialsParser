  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim is to study the multiple factors determining the variation of weight loss
      after Roux-en-Y Gastric Bypass surgery (RYGB). The specific aims are to evaluate a) what
      explains the large individual differences in weight loss seen after RYGB surgery, b) if it
      is possible pre-operatively to identify which patients will not obtain beneficial effects of
      bariatric surgery in relation to weight loss and quality of life and c) if patients in need
      of improved care can be identified pre- and/or early post-operatively.
