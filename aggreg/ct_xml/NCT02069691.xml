      Background: Hemiplegia is one of the main reasons why stroke survivors lose their walking
      and balancing ability. Many studies point out that cycling is an effective means for lower
      limb rehabilitation. However, during training, the unaffected limb may compensate for the
      affected one resulting in suboptimal rehabilitation. To address this issue, the
      investigators developed the virtual reality-cycling training system (VRCTS) which can
      acquire force and speed signals in real-time through a cycling module. The system then
      analyzes the acquired data and uses a 3D VR rehabilitation program to help patients to train
      their affected side. The aim of the study was to develop the VRCTS, verify its function and
      test system function on both normal subjects and stroke patients.

      Methods: In this system, the investigators designed a cycling device that is embedded with
      load cell and encoder sensors to detect cycling force and angle in real-time. A Cycling
      Graph User Interface Control and Data Recode System (Cycling CR System) was applied for
      signal analysis and feedback control. The investigators designed a 3D interactive VR
      rehabilitation program that can guide and train the users through visual feedback. Each user
      performed a pre-test to examine determine condition, left-right balance and other
      parameters, which allows the system to be customized.
