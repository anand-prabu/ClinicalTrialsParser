Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from\n      dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining thalidomide with irinotecan may kill any\n      tumor cells remaining after radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining thalidomide with irinotecan\n      in treating patients who have glioblastoma multiforme that has been treated with radiation\n      therapy."

Patients also receive oral thalidomide daily. Treatment repeats\n      every 21 days for at least 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 1 week after the first course, prior to all\n      subsequent courses, and then after course 6.\n\n      Patients are followed for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
