After maintenance is achieved, all subjects will begin performing DBPCFCs (staged so\n      as to ensure safety) at Week 104 and every 13 weeks thereafter.  At Week 104, individuals\n      that reach criteria  will, based on the randomization that was done at the start of the\n      study, either stop therapy with peanut and be switched to oat flour, or will be maintained\n      on 300 mg peanut protein per day and all placebo subjects will decrease to the equivalent\n      volume of oat flour (approximately 600 mg oat flour) to optimize the blind.  All subjects\n      will be evaluated every 13 weeks thereafter with DBPCFCs until the end of study.\n\n      Individuals in Arm A will be defined as \"clinically tolerant\" if there is no clinical\n      reactivity at the Week 104 and Week 117 DBPCFC. Clinical reactivity is defined as any\n      reaction \u2265 Grade 1 based on the Bock's Criteria. Individuals in Arm A who meet the\n      definition of \"clinically tolerant\" will continue to avoid peanut protein (i.e. continue on\n      600 mg per day of oat flour) as long as each subsequent DBPCFC (performed every 13 weeks\n      until end of study) shows no clinical reactivity.\n\n      Individuals in Arm B will be defined as \"desensitized\" to a minimum of 300 mg per day of\n      peanut protein if they show no clinical reactivity at DBPCFCs (week 117 to end of study).\n\n      Individuals in Arm C will be defined as \"natural loss of responsiveness\" if they show no\n      clinical reactivity at DBPCFCs (week 117 to end of study).\n\n      We plan to identify the basic immune mechanisms which can explain the differences in the\n      effects of OIT in individuals who do or do not become clinically tolerant and to determine\n      whether immune monitoring can predict the safety and efficacy outcomes in peanut OIT\n      protocols.\n\n      After initial screening and enrollment, there are three phases of the study:\n\n        -  Dose escalation and Build up Phase\n\n        -  Maintenance phase\n\n        -  Tolerance and Desensitization Testing phase Overall, 120 subjects who are eligible will\n           undergo the Initial Dose Escalation Day.  Subsequent updosing visits will occur every 2\n           weeks as a part of the build-up phase. They will continue to updose until they reach\n           4,000 mg protein daily, which is the maximum maintenance amount of protein. We expect\n           active OIT treatment subjects to reach 4,000 mg of peanut protein between 44-78 weeks.\n\n      Treatment and Desensitization Failures:\n\n      A treatment failure will be defined as a) failure to reach 1.5 mg peanut protein (single\n      dose) during the Initial Dose Escalation Day or b) failure to reach 1,000 mg peanut protein\n      by week 104.\n\n      Subjects who do not meet the criteria  at Week 104  and who demonstrate clinical reactivity\n      will be considered desensitization failures.\n\n      If Arm B subjects demonstrate clinical reactivity  in any DBPCFC from Week 117 to end of\n      study, they will be considered desensitization failures.\n\n      If Arm A subjects demonstrate clinical reactivity (\u2265Grade 1,  in any DBPCFC from Week 117 to\n      end of study, they will be considered tolerance failures.\n\n      Treatment failures, desensitization failures, and tolerance failures will be unblinded (both\n      participant and research staff) and will be followed until the end of the study at the\n      specified study visits but will not undergo DBPCFCs.  They will be considered in statistical\n      analyses of the intent-to-treat population."
