Patients\n      will be randomized to receive either a TAP injection or a TPI.  Because the TAP injection\n      involves a larger area to be anesthetized, a larger volume of medication will be used.\n\n      Thirty minutes after the injection, a sensory exam will be performed on the patient to\n      determine the level of block.  At one week, one month, three months and six months after the\n      injection, a staff member will telephone the patient to assess how they are doing.  The call\n      will take approximately 10 minutes and will consist of relaying a pain score as well as\n      daily functioning and sleep questions.\n\n      Subjects are responsible for all clinical costs associated with the injection.\n\n      There is no remuneration offered for study participation."
