    <textblock>
      This phase II randomised, double blind, placebo controlled, multicentre trial is designed to
      assess the efficacy and safety of continuous icotinib plus  chemotherapy versus chemotherapy
      alone in patients who have progressed after benefiting from previous second or third-line
      icotinib treatment (more than 6 months) in locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell
      lung cancer.

    <description>A duration from randomization date to disease progression(as defined by RECIST) or death. If a participant
are known to have progressed, the time to progression is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of progression. Otherwise, a  participant will be censored at the last date they are known not to be progressed.</description>

    <description>Overall Survival is assessed via calculation of the time to death due to any cause. If a participant is known to have died, the time to death is defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death. Otherwise, a participant will be censored at the last date they are known to be alive.</description>
