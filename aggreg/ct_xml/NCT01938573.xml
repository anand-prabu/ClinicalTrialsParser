    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of sirolimus when given
      together with cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride and to see how well it works in
      treating patients with bladder cancer. Biological therapies, such as sirolimus, may
      stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used
      in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving sirolimus together with cisplatin and gemcitabine hydrochloride may be an
      effective treatment for bladder cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) of rapamycin (sirolimus) combined with
      gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin (GC). (Phase I)

      II. To determine the pathologic complete response rate at cystectomy in patients with
      localized, muscle invasive carcinoma of the bladder (clinical T2-4, N0 or N1). (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the response rate to rapamycin combined with GC. (Phase I)

      II. To assess effect of rapamycin with GC on deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage surrogates
      in cancer associated stroma compared to untreated and GC treated stroma. (Phase I)

      III. To assess effect of rapamycin with GC on DNA damage surrogates in cancer associated
      stroma compared to untreated and GC treated stroma. (Phase II)

      IV. To assess toxicity of the MTD dose of rapamycin with GC. (Phase II)

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose de-escalation study of sirolimus followed by a phase II
      study.

      Patients receive sirolimus orally (PO) with grapefruit juice on day -2, cisplatin
      intravenously (IV) on day 1 and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and
      8. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression
      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo cystectomy as clinically appropriate after 1-4
      courses of treatment.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 28 days.
