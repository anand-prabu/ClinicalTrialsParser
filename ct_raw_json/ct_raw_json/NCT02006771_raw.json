It is hypothesized that the changes of\n      POS differ with meals from different cultures. Four cultural meals are chosen, namely\n      Southern Chinese, Northern Chinese, American, and South Indian, based on the known\n      prevalence of chronic diseases between Caucasians, Chinese and Indians, and within the\n      Southern and Northern Chinese population."
