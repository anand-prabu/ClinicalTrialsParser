            "textblock": "In the proposed study, the standard Weight Watchers program will serve as the base\n      curriculum.  Persons with increased risk for developing type 2 diabetes will be exposed to\n      an initial \"orientation session\" designed to frame the rationale for participation in the\n      program and to encourage attendance to a core series of sessions.  This orientation session\n      will reinforce the pre-diabetes status of participants and present the rationale for\n      lifestyle modification as a means to reduce diabetes risk.  In addition, this session will\n      highlight the recommended sessions and topics that are needed to help reduce risk.  In many\n      respects it mirrors the curriculum content used in the DPP with regards to themes and\n      specific topics.  There are significant differences, however, between the two approaches\n      that warrant investigation.  Weight Watchers uses a point system to help users select\n      appropriate foods.  This system is less focused on fat gram control as a central theme than\n      was the case with the DPP.  More importantly, it uses an \"open visit\" system in which users\n      get a core set of materials for home review that is then reviewed in facilitated group\n      sessions.  In this regard, the group session content is not configured as a sequential\n      series of sessions delivered in a specific order, as was the case with the DPP.  Moreover,\n      participants can rejoin groups at any time that they choose.  Weight Watchers also provides\n      a sophisticated set of support materials online, using both phone apps (to help users track\n      food consumption and \"points\" used) and a website program.  The open attendance feature and\n      the availability of online support should, in theory, facilitate long-term adherence."
