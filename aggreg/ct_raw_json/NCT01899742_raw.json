            "textblock": "This is a Phase IIIb multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel group\n      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of UMEC/VI Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg) when\n      administered once-daily via a novel dry powder inhaler (DPI) compared with tiotropium (18\n      mcg) administered once-daily via the HandiHaler over a treatment period of 12 weeks in\n      subjects with COPD who continue to have symptoms while on tiotropium.\n\n      The key objective of the study is to recruit those subjects who continue to have symptoms\n      while on tiotropium and to ensure that their symptoms are not associated with poor\n      adherence. The study will screen approximately 1300 subjects who continue to have symptoms\n      whilst on tiotropium. After a 4 week run-in period on open label tiotropium, those subjects\n      who continue to have symptoms and have adhered to the treatment schedule will progress into\n      the double-blind treatment phase.\n\n      At the end of the run-in phase approximately 666 subjects will be randomised 1:1 to UMEC/VI\n      Inhalation Powder (62.5/25 mcg), or tiotropium (18 mcg) in order to achieve 283 evaluable\n      subjects per arm at the end of the 12 week double-blind phase. During the double-blind\n      phase, each subject will receive two inhalers, a preloaded novel DPI and a HandiHaler dry\n      powder inhaler with capsules, for once-daily administration of one active treatment and one\n      placebo treatment for 12 weeks.\n\n      There will be a total of 9 study clinic visits conducted on an outpatient basis. Subjects\n      will sign the informed consent form (ICF) at either Visit 0 or Visit 1 and will be assigned\n      a subject identifier. See Time and Events Table (Table 4) for further details. Subjects who\n      meet the eligibility criteria at Screening (Visit 1) will enter the open label tiotropium\n      run-in phase. After 4 weeks all subjects will be reviewed (Visit 2) and if they satisfy the\n      randomisation criteria they will be randomised and enter the double-blind phase.\n\n      After Visit 2, there will be a further 6 study clinic visits. Further visits are scheduled\n      at Day 2, Week 2, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12 and Week 12 +1 day (Visits 3 to 8 respectively).\n      Vital signs (blood pressure and pulse rate) will be obtained at all clinic visits.\n\n      Trough FEV\u2081 and trough FVC will be performed at Visit 3 and Visit 8. Pre-dose and post dose\n      FEV\u2081 and FVC measurement at 15 mins and 3 hrs will also be performed at Visit 2, Visit 5,\n      Visit 6 & Visit 7.\n\n      At selected study sites, a subset of approximately 400 subjects will be assessed using body\n      plethysmography to determine effects of UMEC/VI and tiotropium on lung volumes and\n      hyperinflation.  At these sites, the evaluation of trough lung volumes at Visit 3 and Visit\n      8 will be performed.  In addition, pre-dose and 3 hrs post-dose assessments at Visit 2,\n      Visit 5 & Visit 7 will also be performed.\n\n      An assessment of dyspnea will be obtained using the Baseline and Transition Dyspnea Index\n      (BDI/TDI).  At Visit 2, the severity of dyspnea at baseline will be assessed using the BDI.\n      Change from baseline will be assessed using the TDI at Visit 5, Visit 6 and Visit 7.\n\n      In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, health status will be captured using the\n      St. George Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C) scale at Visit 5and Visit 7.\n\n      The impact of COPD on the subjects wellbeing and daily life is measured with the\n      self-assessment CAT and the EQ5D.  In addition to the baseline assessment at Visit 2, the\n      COPD Assessment Test (CAT) and the Euroqol-5D (EQ-5D) is also completed at Visit 5 and Visit\n      7. Furthermore, the CAT is also completed during screening.\n\n      The Patient Reported Global Severity Impression and Global Impression of Change is a\n      self-reported global assessment of severity of illness (see Appendix 5) and are performed at\n      Baseline during Visit 2 and at Visit 5 and Visit 7.\n\n      A safety Follow-Up assessment will be conducted either by phone call or clinic visit where\n      required (e.g., Germany) approximately 7 days after the end of the study treatment (Visit 9\n      or Early Withdrawal, if applicable).  The total duration of subject participation, including\n      follow-up, will be approximately 18 weeks. All subjects will be provided with\n      albuterol/salbutamol for use on an \"as-needed\" basis throughout the run-in and study\n      treatment periods."
