Both magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) will be used to evaluate\n      skeletal muscle in research participants. MRS is a type of imaging used to measure the\n      levels of different chemicals in body tissues. It is done as part of a routine clinical MR\n      exam in other parts of the body such as the brain, but has yet not been widely used in the\n      musculoskeletal system.  This research is being done to assess the effectiveness of MRS and\n      MRI in helping doctors measure the type and severity of musculoskeletal disease. The\n      investigators also hope to use MRI and MRS in developing outcome measures that can be used\n      in future clinical trials for FSHD."
