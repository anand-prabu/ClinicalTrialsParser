Differences in the degree of selection pressure\n      caused by various antimicrobials have not been systematically investigated until today. The\n      aim of the proposed project is the determination of the impact of antibiotic treatment on\n      the copy number of resistance genes in the human intestinal microbiome using metagenome\n      shotgun sequencing. The resistance gene count in the gastrointestinal tract will be\n      determined in a clinical cohorts of patients treated with either ciprofloxacin or\n      cotrimoxazol as monotherapy. The subsequent quantification and comparison of the selection\n      pressure facilitates the application of antibiotics with a lower potential to select for\n      resistance. To achieve this goal, a self-controlled, prospective observational\n      epidemiological study will be performed at two centres of the German Centre for Infection\n      Research (T\u00fcbingen, Cologne)."
