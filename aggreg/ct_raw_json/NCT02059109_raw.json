The purpose of the study is to\n      evaluate proficiency and the retention of knowledge of how to use the device based on\n      current methods of training compared to revised training methods.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. The use of the traditional method of training is not effective, predicting less then\n           half of staff will pass on the first attempt.\n\n        2. Restructured test with hands-on training as opposed to oral presentation only with a\n           written test will result in a pass rate of > 80%.\n\n        3. Staff members who work in pairs will perform better than working alone when setting up\n           the Belmont Rapid Infuser (BRI).\n\n        4. Retention at 3 months will be higher with the restructured training method than with\n           the traditional training method."
