Medical treatments\n      to prevent recurrence have had limited effect. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) agents\n      appear promising but are hampered by immunogenicity, side effects and high cost.\n\n      Vitamin D has recently received a lot of scientific attention and was found to have strong\n      anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects in gut and liver inflammation. Many CD patients\n      appear to have deficiency in Vitamin D. A controlled trial to prevent relapse of CD in\n      medical (not surgical) remission suggested a preventive effect for Vitamin D but marginally\n      missed its endpoint because of lack of power.\n\n      The ultimate proof of the anti-inflammatory effect of Vitamin D in CD can best be studied in\n      the prevention of postoperative recurrence."
