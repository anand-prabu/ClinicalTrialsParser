Determine whether in advanced colorectal carcinoma patients who have been previously\n      treated with 5-FU, the overall survival of patients treated with OXAL + 5-FU + CF followed\n      by CPT-11 is equivalent to the survival of patients treated with CPT-11 followed by OXAL +\n      5-FU + CF.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Evaluation of time to tumor progression, time to treatment failure, toxicity of\n      treatment, and overall response rate in patients treated with these two regimens.\n\n      II. To compare quality-of-life measurements patients treated with these two regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      performance status (ECOG 0-1 vs 2), primary indicator lesion (hepatic vs pulmonary vs\n      other), age (less than 65 vs at least 65 years), alkaline phosphatase (less than 2 vs at\n      least 2 times ULN), fluorouracil failure (adjuvant vs metastatic), and membership\n      (intergroup vs expanded participation project). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV over 2\n      hours on days 1 and 2, and fluorouracil IV bolus followed by IV infusion over 22 hours on\n      days 1 and 2. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who experience progression or toxicity on the initial regimen may crossover to the\n      other regimen. At least 3 weeks must elapse between regimens.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to each chemotherapy course,  at crossover,\n      and at the end of the study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 3 years or until death."
