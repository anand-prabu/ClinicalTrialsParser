Parenteral\n      nutrition-associated cholestasis is indeed the most worrisome complication because it is\n      difficult to treat and may progress to eventual cirrhosis and liver failure namely\n      parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease (PNALD).\n\n      Two types of lipid emulsions are currently used for adult as well as pediatric patients: one\n      lipid emulsions prepared from soybean oil that are composed of long-chain triacylglycerols\n      (LCTs),  and the other lipid emulsions composed of 50% medium-chain triacylglycerols (MCTs)\n      and 50% LCT soybean oil. A new lipid emulsion prepared from a mixture of soybean oil and\n      olive oil contains only LCTs and has a lower proportion (20%) of polyunsaturated fatty\n      acids(PUFAs)and 60% monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). So we compare the different fat\n      emulsion, and want to see if the olive oil lipid emulsions can improve hepatic tolerance in\n      preterm infant."
