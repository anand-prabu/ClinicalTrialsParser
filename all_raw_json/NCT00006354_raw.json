The MTD is defined as the dose at which 20% of patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity during the first course. Additional patients are treated\n      at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another\n      therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 37 patients will be accrued for this study."
