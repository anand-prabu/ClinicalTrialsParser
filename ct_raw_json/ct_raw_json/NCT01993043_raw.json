            "textblock": "Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a leading cause of childhood blindness. Vascular\n      endothelium growth factor (VEGF) is an important component of this disease. The goal of\n      treatment is to reduce the production of VEGF in the immature retina and to eliminate the\n      abnormal growth of new vessels. Currently, laser photocoagulation of the peripheral\n      avascular retina is the treatment standard. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF antibody\n      Bevacizumab (IVB) has been used clinically off-label as an alternative therapy. However,\n      VEGF is important for the development of neurons and vessels in the systemic organs in\n      premature infants. Pharmaceutical study showed that IVB was absorbed into the bloodstream.\n      It is unclear if the systemic absorption of Bevacizumab is dose related, and the short and\n      longterm effects on ocular and systemic systems, especially neurological development. In\n      this study, our goals are to establish the pharmacokinetics of Bevacizumab in the premature\n      infant and to compare the short and long-term vision and neurodevelopmental outcomes of\n      infants treated with IVB compared to laser ROP."
