Myocardial deformation imaging is a sensitive means of detecting LV\n      dysfunction, but this technique has not been evaluated in patients treated with trastuzumab.\n      The aim of this study was to investigate whether changes in tissue deformation, assessed by\n      myocardial strain and strain rate (SR), are able to identify LV dysfunction earlier than\n      conventional echocardiographic measures in patients treated with trastuzumab."
