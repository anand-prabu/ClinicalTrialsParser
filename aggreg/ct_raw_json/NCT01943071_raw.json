We aim to investigate to what\n      degree attendance in day care centres with programs for people with dementia is effective\n      for patient and their caregivers whilst also cost efficient for society. The study consists\n      of a quasi-experimental trial with comparison group. 400 patients with dementia, along with\n      a family caregiver, will be included in the trial. Effects will be measured at baseline,\n      after one and two years. Data collection will be made at three levels; at patient level with\n      measures of cognition, depression, quality of life, functioning in activities in daily\n      living, neuropsychiatric symptoms and death; at caregiver level with measures of depression,\n      level of burden and quality of life; and at societal level with measures of nursing home\n      admittance, hospital stays and use of other health resources. Additionally,a qualitative\n      interview study will include 20 dyads from the main trial. The main focus will be on how\n      attending day care centre programs for patients with dementia affect the lives of both\n      patients and caregivers. Five of these dyads will be followed closely throughout the\n      participation period to be used as case examples."

Furthermore, a survey will be used to explore\n      the communication and co-operation between the professional staff at the day care centre,\n      the patients and the family carers by administering questionnaires to all three parties.\n      Only patients with mild degree of dementia will be asked to participate in the\n      questionnaire.  Finally, qualitative interviews will be made with 20 dyads of patients and\n      family carers to collect their in depth experience with the day care centre program. Five of\n      these patients and their family carers will be followed closely as case examples for two\n      years."
