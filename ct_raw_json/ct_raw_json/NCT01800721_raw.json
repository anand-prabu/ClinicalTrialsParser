The sample will include Black Men who have\n      Sex with Men (MSM) who will be randomized into an experimental or control condition and then\n      asked to recruit peer and risk network members for HIV testing over a 3 month period.  Some\n      of the network members who are recruited for voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) will\n      enroll into the longitudinal study for assessments only. Both index and network participants\n      will be assessed at baseline, 6, and 12-months.\n\n      The specific aims of the proposed study are to:\n\n        1. Train Black MSM (index participants in the experimental condition) to conduct peer\n           health education, to promote VCT and HIV risk reduction among social network members,\n           and to recruit social network members for VCT.\n\n        2. Examine changes in HIV risk behaviors and VCT among index participants and their\n           network members in the experimental intervention as compared to those in the control\n           condition.\n\n        3. Examine mediating effects of social environments (networks, social norms) on HIV risk\n           behaviors and VCT, among indexes and network members.\n\n        4. Examine mediating effects of individual level factors (substance use and depression) on\n           HIV risk behaviors and VCT among indexes and network members."

Index\n      participants are African American/Black men who have sex with men (MSM) who are randomized\n      to either a peer education intervention or comparison condition.  After the baseline is\n      complete, index participants refer social network members (i.e. network participants) to the\n      research clinic for HIV antibody testing.
