            "textblock": "Heart Failure (HF) represents one of the major social and health problems, for its high\n      prevalence and its huge economic impact, as well as the elevated morbidity and mortality\n      associated. In Spain, the estimated prevalence is 7% over 45 years old, and it increases\n      until 18% over 75 years old. Currently, HF is the leading cause of hospital admission over\n      65 years and the mortality for patients with symptomatic HF remains worse than the majority\n      of cancers. The estimated minimum expenditure is 1.1% of total health care costs and 2% of\n      specialized medical care. This accounts for a staggeringly large financial burden on the\n      health care system.\n\n      Chronic HF is a complex disease, whose progression involves multiple pathophysiological\n      systems. It is well established the deleterious effect of activation of\n      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and sympathetic nervous systems. The blockage of these systems\n      by beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin-receptor\n      blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists has improved prognosis. However, in spite of\n      these therapies, the prognosis of patients with chronic HF remains poor.\n\n      During the HF progression to advanced stages, it has been shown an anabolic and metabolic\n      deterioration, resulting in a predominance of catabolic processes. The deficiency of\n      anabolic hormones correlates with greater severity of symptoms, activation of neuroendocrine\n      and inflammatory systems, insulin resistance, metabolic impairment, exercise intolerance,\n      anemia and cardiac cachexia. All these processes take part of the final progression of the\n      HF disease until death, when HF becomes a systemic disease. In men with HF, levels of\n      testosterone (the main anabolic hormone) are decreased; in fact, 30% of men have levels\n      below the 10th  percentile of a reference healthy population adjusted for age. The\n      deterioration of anabolic hormones correlates inversely with the severity of HF disease and\n      it determines a higher mortality. In fact, low testosterone levels are associated with\n      reduced cardiac output, greater symptomatic limitation and higher mortality. Therefore,\n      testosterone deficiency in men with HF has a detrimental impact on symptoms and prognosis.\n\n      In addition, testosterone has shown to have beneficial effects on HF patients, such as\n      vasodilatation of coronary and peripheral arteries, inotropic effects, reduction of\n      neurohormonal activation, anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions, reduction of\n      cytokine production and improvement of muscle strength. All these actions have a potential\n      benefit in patients with HF, because they are involved in the progression of the disease,\n      especially at advanced stages.\n\n      The rational approach \"testosterone replacement for improving the prognosis of patients with\n      advanced HF and testosterone deficiency\" has strong pathophysiological plausibility. To\n      date, no other clinical trials have evaluated the effect of testosterone replacement on\n      morbidity and mortality.\n\n      However, in the last years, numerous editorials in leading journals have concluded on the\n      need to clarify the effect of testosterone therapy on cardiac function and the\n      morbimortality in patients with advanced HF.\n\n      Our group has worked in the last years in this field, confirming the presence of a\n      testosterone deficiency in men with chronic HF, which is associated with a worse prognosis\n      and a greater decline in exercise capacity.\n\n      Therefore, the investigators propose a clinical trial of morbimortality in a population with\n      advanced heart failure and associated deficiency on testosterone; in which, the previous\n      background justifies the potential benefit of testosterone replacement therapy. In addition,\n      the large clinical impact of this disease supports the priority need of an independent\n      study."
