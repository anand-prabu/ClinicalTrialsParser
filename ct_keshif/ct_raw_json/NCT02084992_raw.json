Patients will be asked to interact with the system daily with transmission of weight, heart rate, blood pressure and symptom reports to the nurse manager.   A nurse manager will check the data daily and contact patients if any parameters exceed pre-specified parameters.  Nurse managers will also touch base with the participants at regular intervals as in the control arm.  In addition, educational modules will be placed onto individual tablet computers and given to each patient."

During these phone calls the nurse manager will focus on identifying changes in clinical condition and education reinforcement.

Both interventions are\n      home based with heart failure education and symptom monitoring provided by nurse managers.\n      The nurse managers are in close communication with both the participants and the\n      participants' physicians .  The components of the disease management program have been\n      developed at Tufts Medical Center and the New England Quality Care Alliance with studies\n      showing improved clinical outcomes, including reduced hospitalizations.  The goal of this\n      study is to transition this successful home monitoring and disease management program to a\n      table computer and web-based implementation to both improve clinical outcomes (reducing\n      hospitalizations and improving self-perceived health status) and improve provider-patient\n      satisfaction.  We hypothesize that the tablet computer based disease management will\n      decrease heart failure hospitalizations."
