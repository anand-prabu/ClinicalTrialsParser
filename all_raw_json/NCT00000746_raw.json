(Per 10/01/92 amendment,\n      boosts with VaxSyn (gp160) were eliminated.) To evaluate the immunogenicity of one versus\n      two priming doses of HIVAC-1e prior to a boost with gp120. To compare the relative\n      immunogenicity of the three subunit vaccines when administered as boosters.\n\n      Secondary: To examine the safety of administering the individual subunit vaccines in\n      combination with HIVAC-1e and the safety of administering the gp120 subunit vaccine alone.\n\n      In a previous study of candidate HIV vaccines, the evidence suggested that administration of\n      a booster vaccination with a different vaccine preparation may produce a better immune\n      response than administration of HIVAC-1e vaccine alone."
