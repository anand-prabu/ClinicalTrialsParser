            "textblock": "CT colonography (CTC) is a recently developed radiological examination to find colorectal\n      neoplasia. Fecal/fluid tagging using oral administration of contrast is an essential\n      procedure for CTC. Iohexol, which has recently started being used as an agent for\n      fecal/fluid tagging, has great advantages as it has much more tolerable taste and much lower\n      rates of adverse effects such as clamping or diarrhea compared with traditionally used\n      Gastrografin/Gastroview. However, iohexol is frequently associated with an occurrence of a\n      lot of bubbles in the colon, which makes CTC interpretation more time-consuming and\n      laborious.\n\n      Past experience in colonoscopy field suggests that simethicone, a safety-proven highly\n      inexpensive over-the-counter medicine, might resolve this issue. Given the fact that patient\n      convenience is an important factor for a successful CTC and the fact that time-intensive\n      nature of CTC interpretation is one of the major deterrents to wide spread adoption of CTC\n      while CTC also needs to be as time efficient as possible in order to effectively serve the\n      role of population screening for colorectal cancer, investigating the effect of simethicone\n      to prevent the colonic bubbles on the time efficiency of CTC interpretation would be\n      important. If simethicone can resolve the colonic bubble problem, CTC can be performed more\n      conveniently for the patients as well as for the interpreting radiologists.\n\n      This study is to determine whether colonic bubbles associated with CT colonography performed\n      with iohexol for fecal/fluid tagging could be reduced by adding simethicone to the standard\n      cathartic preparation."
