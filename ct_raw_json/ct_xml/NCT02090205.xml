  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory insufficiency is a common complication after cardiac surgery, ranging between
      mild subclinical events to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
      Physiopathology is complex and involves atelectasis, hyper-oxygenation and systemic
      inflammatory activation, with recruitment of neutrophils and increased pulmonary vascular
      permeability. The practice of stopping mechanical ventilation during cardio-pulmonary bypass
      (CPB) is widely diffused, because it is not necessary to maintain blood oxygenation and
      elimination of carbon dioxide, and furthermore respiratory movements can interfere with the
      surgical procedure. Nevertheless the ventilation stop during CPB is associated with the
      formation of post-operative micro-atelectasis, idiopathic pulmonary edema, higher incidence
      of infections and alterations of respiratory mechanics. Moreover the movement of
      compression/decompression of pulmonary tissue can be important for pulmonary lymphatic flow.
      Recent studies suggest that the application of a CPAP during CPB can reduce the
      post-operative shunt fraction. Similar results can be achieved with recruitment maneuvers
      before the end of the CPB. Mechanical ventilation during the CPB seem to reduce the systemic
      inflammatory response.

      In this study we want to test the hypothesis that a mechanical ventilation at low
      frequency/volume or the application of a CPAP ventilation during CPB can reduce the
      incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications. This is a randomized controlled
      multi-centric trial.

      Our primary endpoints will be:

        -  To reduce the PaO2 / FiO2 ratio (arterial oxygen partial pressure/fraction of inspired
           oxygen) in patients treated with mechanical ventilation during CPB

        -  To reduce the incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications in patients with
           mechanical ventilation during CPB.

      Post-operative pulmonary complications are defined as:

        -  respiratory infections

        -  postoperative respiratory failure

        -  pleural effusion

        -  pneumothorax

        -  atelectasis

        -  aspiration pneumonia

        -  bronchospasm

      Our secondary endpoints will be to reduce the incidence of:

        -  postoperative infections

        -  cardiovascular complications

        -  postoperative residual curarization (PORC)

        -  duration of ventilatory support

        -  need of re-intubation

        -  need of non-invasive mechanical ventilation

        -  need of ICU admission and ICU length of stay

        -  total length of hospitalization

        -  mortality during hospitalization and postoperative outcome (assessed at 30, 60 days and
           1 year after hospital discharge)

      Data will be collected by each center in an appropriate Case Report Form and sent to the
      coordinator center for the statistical analysis. Statistical analysis will be performed
      after all data will be collected, using the statistical softwares Epi Info 2002 (CDC), SPSS
      11.0 (SPSS), and STATA 9.0 (STATA), when appropriate.
