            "textblock": "Septic shock has a high mortality risk despite the availability of various treatments.\n      Endotoxin, that is present in the cell walls of gram-negative bacteria, is a potent trigger\n      of innate immunity. Endotoxin leads to an activation of a cascade with an overwhelming\n      systemic overflow of pro- and anti- inflammatory mediators at the early phase of sepsis with\n      generalized vascular endothelial damage, tissue injury and multi-organ failure.\n\n      Extracorporeal blood purification therapies aim to reduce the circulating level of\n      endotoxin. Different extracorporeal blood purification systems are available. The oXiris\u2122\n      device comprises a surface treated AN69 membrane capable to adsorb a large spectrum of\n      plasma cytokines, such as IL-6 and HMGB1 protein. The positively charged inner surface of\n      the membrane allows absorbing negatively charged bacterial products such as endotoxin. From\n      an historical perspective, filters containing AN69-based membranes have been the most\n      commonly used products for CRRT in the management of critically ill patients and a\n      substantial volume of published data exist.\n\n      Another extracorporeal endotoxin removal therapy is the hemoperfusion with ToraymyxinTM\n      (PMX) filter, which is a cartridge selectively removing blood endotoxin. PMX is composed of\n      polymyxin B covalently bonded to polystyrene-derivative fibres. It is well known that the\n      polarity of the polymyxin B antibiotic binds endotoxin and has bactericidal activity.\n      Therefore, the rationale underlying extracorporeal therapy with PMX is to remove circulating\n      endotoxin by adsorption.\n\n        -  Trial with medical device"
