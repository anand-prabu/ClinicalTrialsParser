Significant pre-retinal fibrosis involving the macula in the study eye (where, in the\n             opinion of the investigator, the pre-retinal fibrosis is causing distortion or\n             traction on the central macular region which may be limiting vision, or inducing\n             retinal edema/thickening, beyond that due to underlying CNV)\n\n         18.
