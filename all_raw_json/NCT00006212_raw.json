            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Drugs such as phosphorus-32 may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation\n      therapy. Chemotherapy combined with radiation therapy and phosphorus-32 may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of phosphorus-32 plus radiation therapy\n      and chemotherapy in treating patients who have stage II or stage III non-small cell lung\n      cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dosimetry and toxicity of interstitial phosphorus P32 colloid\n      plus chemotherapy and radiotherapy in patients with previously untreated stage II, IIIA, or\n      IIIB non-small cell lung cancer. II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of phosphorus P32\n      colloid in these patients. III. Determine the response in patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of phosphorus P32 colloid. Patients receive\n      vinblastine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29; cisplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and\n      29; and phosphorus P32 colloid interstitially on day 50. Patients with tumor size less than\n      8.0 cm receive radiotherapy following phosphorus P32 injection 5 days a week for 6.5 weeks.\n      Patients with tumor size greater than 8.0 cm receive radiotherapy 5 days a week for 4.5\n      weeks prior to phosphorus P32 injection, and for an additional 2.5 weeks following\n      injection. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of phosphorus P32 colloid until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every\n      3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
