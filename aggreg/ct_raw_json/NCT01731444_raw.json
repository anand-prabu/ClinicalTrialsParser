This\n      solution of epinephrine has been shown to have effects on the body outside the donor site.\n      Some people have increases in heart rate and blood pressure. We will study the effect of a\n      phenylephrine solution in place of an epinephrine  solution to control blood loss. We think\n      that phenylephrine will help decrease blood loss and not change blood pressure or heart\n      rate.\n\n      The injured area will be injected under the skin and a skin graft will be taken in the same\n      way as we usually do. The only change will be the use of phenylephrine in the solution\n      instead of epinephrine.\n\n      Our goal is to find whether or not phenylephrine or epinephrine solution results in a\n      reduction of blood loss without affecting the rest of the body."
