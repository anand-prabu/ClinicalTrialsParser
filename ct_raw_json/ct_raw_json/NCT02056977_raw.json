            "textblock": "The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases the morbidity and mortality of\n      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the postoperative period of cardiac\n      surgery, the use of intraoperative extracorporeal circulation is one of the factors\n      triggering the syndrome, its incidence increasing.\n\n      Potentially, a protective ventilatory strategy with optimal positive end expiratory pressure\n      (PEEP) could improve the prognosis of those patients with ARDS.\n\n      An already validated maneuver to titrate the ideal PEEP to these patients has a longer\n      duration, about 40 minutes. The lung Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitors\n      respiratory system mechanics and intrathoracic lung volume changes and provides information\n      about regional behavior and recruitability of lung tissue and thereby allows shortening\n      titration maneuver, reducing its hemodynamic effects.\n\n      Pulmonary Ultrasound (PU) is a useful tool in the alveolar-interstitial syndrome,\n      consolidations, pleural effusion and pneumothorax diagnosis, and often has higher accuracy\n      than chest radiography performed at bedside. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PU\n      can identify and quantify the changes in lung aeration secondary to different treatments and\n      procedures, and individual optimization of the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).\n\n      Will participate this study patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery with a\n      diagnosis of ARDS diagnosed from PaO2/FiO2 ratio < 250 mmHg calculated values supplied by\n      arterial blood gas collected with FiO2 60% and presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest\n      radiography, admitted to the surgical ICU from Heart Institute, University of S\u00e3o Paulo.\n\n      Recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration maneuver will be monitored by EIT and PU.\n\n      All patients will be followed and monitored for 4 hours, with measures of the evolution of\n      alveolar collapse . Hemodynamic and oxygenation data will also be recorded ."
