      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of
      Ipilimumab i.v. followed by NY-ESO-1 Protein vaccine with Poly-ICLC and Montanide s.c. (Arm
      A), or NY-ESO-1 OLP4 vaccine with Poly-ICLC and Montanide s.c. (Arm B), or NY-ESO-1 OLP4
      vaccine mixed with Poly-ICLC without Montanide s.c.(Arm C).

      This is a phase I, open-label, non-randomized study in 27 patients with unresectable or
      metastatic melanoma, for whom treatment with ipilimumab is indicated.  Patients must have
      evidence of NY-ESO-1 or LAGE-1 tumor positivity, radiologically measurable disease by
      immune-related Response Criteria (irRC), and meet all other eligibility criteria.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2.

          -  The following laboratory parameters must be within the ranges specified: Hemoglobin ≥

             (e.g.: +ANA, +RF, antithyroglobulin antibodies), or mild arthritis requiring no
             therapy or manageable with NSAIDs.

          -  Unresolved immune related adverse events following prior biological therapy.

          -  Systemic treatment with high dose corticosteroids (greater than Prednisone 10mg daily

             including radiotherapy, may be available.

          -  Myocardial infarction, angina, congestive heart failure, cardiomyopathy, stroke or
             transient ischemic attack, chest pain or shortness of breath with activity, or other
             heart conditions being treated by a doctor.
