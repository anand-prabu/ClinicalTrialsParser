Continuous glucose monitors (CGM) are minimally invasive devices\n      that measure glucose levels in interstitial fluid. A small wire is inserted subcutaneously\n      which transmits the ambient subcutaneous glucose concentration every 5 minutes to a wireless\n      recorder. In usual use, the patient can see these data and graph the previous 1, 3 or 9\n      hours to identify trends or look back over time (ie over night). In our study, the patient\n      will be blinded to the data so as not to confound results, as it has been noted in another\n      study that patient's blood sugar control was better when they were able to see CGM results\n      and modified their diet. CGM's have been shown to have clinical accuracies of 95.5-98.9% and\n      have been used in clinical trials and found to be safe. Having the patient do a finger-stick\n      glucose intermittently during the time they are wearing the CGM improves accuracy."
