If you are eligible and\n      agree to be in the study, your participation will last for approximately 8 weeks.

Seventy-two male and female smokers will be randomly assigned to one of the 3\n      treatment conditions: GAL (8 or 16 mg/day) or placebo. The dose of GAL will be gradually\n      increased to the target doses over a 2-week period (Table 2). During Week 3, following\n      overnight abstinence from smoking, participants will present for a laboratory Test Session\n      in which they will have the option of cigarette self-administration. After this Test Session\n      is completed, smokers will be maintained on their randomized medication condition for an\n      additional 4-week period. Smokers will establish a quit date at the beginning of this\n      Treatment Phase, and will receive brief weekly behavioral treatment for the 4 weeks of this\n      phase. Additionally, at the beginning of Week 3, participants will be given a PDA that will\n      administer EMA assessments. The study medication will be tapered after the end of Week 4 of\n      the Treatment Phase. Participants will be contacted by phone at one week, and one month,\n      after treatment termination to inquire about any adverse events and about their recent\n      smoking status."
