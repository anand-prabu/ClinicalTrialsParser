            "textblock": "Background: Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common postoperative complication after heart\n      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Multiple studies have demonstrated that patients\n      with AKI have worse clinical outcomes, such as longer ventilation times and increased length\n      of stay, which is thought to be secondary to associated oliguria and subsequent fluid\n      overload. Studies suggest that early renal replacement therapy (RRT) via peritoneal dialysis\n      (PD) may prevent fluid overload and therefore be a superior management to diuretic (i.e.\n      furosemide) administration. However, there is no published evidence to suggest superiority\n      or laboratory data available to guide decision making.\n\n      Objective: Our primary objective is to determine if early institution of PD improves\n      clinical outcomes compared to administration of furosemide in post-operative cardiac infants\n      with acute kidney injury.  We hypothesize that early initiation of PD will improve clinical\n      outcomes.  We will determine if these clinical outcomes will be better among good responders\n      of furosemide compared to poor responders. We will determine if postoperative NGAL\n      concentrations are predictive of poor response to furosemide.\n\n      Design / Methods: The study will be a single-center randomized clinical trial among neonates\n      undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB with planned placement of a PD catheter due to risk of\n      AKI.  If patients demonstrate oliguria within the first postoperative day, they will be\n      randomized to early PD or trial of furosemide. Clinical and laboratory data will be\n      collected and compared between groups."
