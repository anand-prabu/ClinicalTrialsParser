            "textblock": "The MAGIC trial, also considered the \"milestone\" study, definitely proved that neoadjuvant\n      chemotherapy improves the outcome of patients with locally advanced gastric cancer.\n      Resection was considered curative in 79% under combination therapy versus in 69% of only\n      operated patients (P = 0.02), 2-year survival rates were 50 and 41%, and 5-year-survival\n      rates were 36 and 23% (P = 0.009), respectively. The substantial weak point of the MAGIC\n      trial remains the fact that only about 40% of the patients received the full dosage of\n      scheduled postoperative chemotherapy, mainly due to intolerance or toxicity reasons.\n\n      The noninferiority in relation to survival of capecitabine to 5-FU in triplet regimens for\n      the treatment of patients with advanced esophagogastric cancer was demonstrated in the large\n      multicenter randomized phase III, REAL-2 study, including 1002 patients. Capecitabine has\n      overcome the doubts concerning the potential efficacy of oral drug administration in\n      patients with gastric carcinoma, especially in relation to those patients who have undergone\n      partial or total gastrectomy. The same study demonstrated the noninferiority of oxaliplatin\n      versus cisplatin in advanced gastric cancer and confirmed the acceptable tolerability\n      profile of this third-generation platinum analogue. It was anticipated that the use of these\n      newer agents as components of triplet regimens would reduce toxicity and thereby render an\n      alternative to the standard ECF combination easier to handle as a consequence of replacing\n      the cisplatin component with oxaliplatin, replacing the infusional 5-fluorouracil component\n      with oral capecitabine in EOX regimen. Furthermore, achieving a median overall survival time\n      of 11.2 months, the EOX regimen appeared to be more active than ECF (median overall survival\n      time, 9.9 months), with the higher 1-year survival rate 47% vs 38%, respectively. Compared\n      with the ECF regimen, EOX was associated with significantly lower rates of grade 3 or 4\n      neutropenia and grade 2 alopecia, but significantly higher rates of grade 3 or 4 lethargy,\n      diarrhea, and peripheral neuropathy. Based on the results of the REAL study, EOX is\n      therefore tolerable, and at least as active as ECF. This modified regimen could therefore be\n      considered to be a new standard treatment and may be an appropriate reference regimen for\n      future studies in advanced gastric cancer."
