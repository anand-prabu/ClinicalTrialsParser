      Healthy adults and adults diagnosed with fibromyalgia, aged 18-50, are needed for a research
      study investigating whole brain functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging to assess cerebral
      blood flow and functional connectivity change in fibromyalgia patients.

        Criteria for fibromyalgia patients.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-50 years of age.

          -  Fibromyalgia for at least the past 3 months, as determined by the referring
             physician.

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language
             provided that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the
             assessment measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Specific causes of pain (e.g., cancer, fractures, spinal stenosis, infections)

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened
             potential for adverse outcome.

          -  Presence of any contraindications to fMRI scanning.  For example: cardiac pacemaker,
             metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.

        Criteria for healthy adults.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Volunteers 18-50 years of age.

          -  At least a 10th grade English-reading level; English can be a second language
             provided that the patients feel they understand all the questions used in the
             assessment measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Chronic and acute pain (ex. Fibromyalgia).

          -  History of cardiac, respiratory, or nervous system disease that, in the
             investigator's judgment, precludes participation in the study because of a heightened
             potential for adverse outcome.

          -  Presence of any contraindications to fMRI scanning.  For example: cardiac pacemaker,
             metal implants, fear of closed spaces, pregnancy.
