  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of pterygium is still quite controversial. Previous studies using a large
      incision for pterygium excision and a large graft and has reported a very low recurrence
      rate with the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique. However, the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique is a
      relatively lengthy procedure and may not be suitable for patient with limited conjunctival
      reserve. Thus, we try to evaluate the final outcome of a sutureless amniotic membrane
      transplant technique combining the extended pterygium excision in hope to avoid the
      complication of the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique.

    <textblock>
      The treatment of pterygium is still quite controversial. There is a lack of consensus in the
      ophthalmological community about the optimal surgical management of pterygia. The main
      challenge to successful surgical treatment of pterygium is recurrence, evidenced by
      fibrovascular growth across the limbus onto the cornea.

      Previous studies using a large incision for pterygium excision and a large graft and has
      reported a very low recurrence rate with the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. technique. However, the
      P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique is not that perfect since it is a lengthy procedure,
      requires meticulous handling of tissue, and is associated with significant postoperative
      pain and, frequently, transient diplopia. Therefore, we try to evaluate the final outcome of
      a sutureless amniotic membrane transplant technique combining the extended pterygium
      excision in hope to avoid the complication of the P.E.R.F.E.C.T. for PTERYGIUM technique.
      This sutureless technique with the tissue glue may promote increased clinical use of
      amniotic membrane patch by alleviating patients' pain and shortening surgical time.

Grade 1 with a normal appearance of the operated site; Grade 2 with the presence of fine episcleral vessels in the excised area, extending to the limbus, but without any fibrous tissue; Grade 3 with fibrovascular tissue in the excised area, reaching to the limbus but not invading the cornea; Grade 4 with aA true corneal recurrence, with fibrovascular tissue invading the cornea and across the limbus.</description>
