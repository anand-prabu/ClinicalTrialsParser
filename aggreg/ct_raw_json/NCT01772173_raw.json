Improved prediction of diabetes complications has the potential\n      to improve the care for veterans with diabetes, especially if this can be done without any\n      extra effort for the veterans or their caretakers. All veterans with diabetes in VHA are\n      required to undergo annual retinal photography to screen for current diabetic retinopathy.\n      We have recently developed an automated, precise, fast, novel tool for measuring retinal\n      vessels in these images. Manual measurement of retinal vessels has shown that these can\n      predict future -not current- development of hypertension and also diabetic retinopathy. If\n      we can confirm that our tool can flag those veterans at increased risk for developing these\n      diabetes complications, this will allow earlier intervention and prevention. Because the\n      tool only uses the images that are being taken anyway, there is no extra effort for either\n      the veteran or VA staff."

Population\n      studies have shown that changes in arterial and venous diameter are associated with future\n      development of these complications.\n\n      Purpose: Determine the potential utility of retinal vessel derived biomarkers, from color\n      fundus photographs, as a non-invasive independent risk factor for diabetic retinopathy (DR)\n      and hypertension in veterans with diabetes.\n\n      Methods: Aim 1. We will evaluate automatically derived retinal vessel parameters (arterial\n      and retinal vessel width and branch relationships) as an early biomarker for future\n      development of hypertension no less than 2 years later, with normal current normal blood\n      pressure. We will compare this biomarker  in retinal images from 500 veterans with diabetes,\n      all of whom did not have hypertension at the time of imaging, for those who were and were\n      not diagnosed with hypertension no more than 3 years later. Aim 2. To evaluate automatically\n      derived retinal vessel parameters as an early biomarker for the risk for development of\n      diabetic retinopathy (defined as transition from less than moderate retinopathy AND no\n      apparent macular edema according to the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy and\n      Diabetic Macular Edema Severity Scale) in at risk veterans with diabetes. We will compare\n      this biomarker in retinal images from a population of 4000 veterans with diabetes, currently\n      without DR, ~10% of who developed retinopathy no less than two years later while the\n      remainder did not."
