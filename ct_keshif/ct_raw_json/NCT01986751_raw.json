This research study will test whether adding a\n      medicine called clonidine to nerve blocks helps to improve them. Nerve blocks typically last\n      less than a day after surgery. We are looking for ways to make them work better and last\n      longer. Clonidine is approved for use as a blood pressure medicine. Its use in nerve blocks\n      is investigational, but it may help nerve blocks to last longer. Adding clonidine to nerve\n      blocks may also decrease the amount of pain medicine a person has after surgery. All people\n      who enter this study will receive a nerve block with the normal medicine, but half of people\n      will also have clonidine added to their nerve block. This study will enroll 60 participants\n      from UAB hospitals."
