In the first year in one-half of the schools,\n      children and school staff will participate in a standardized asthma education program\n      presented by the American Lung Association (ALA). Children will have daily monitoring of\n      their inhaled asthma medication. The other half of schools will continue with the usual\n      treatment of children with asthma. In the second year of the study, all schools and children\n      will have the asthma education program and monitoring. Parents will be queried quarterly for\n      information about their child's asthma."
