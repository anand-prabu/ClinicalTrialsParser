  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in amount of worry over 8 weeks of treatment measured by the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Administered at all treatment sessions ( once a week for 8 weeks) by the study investigators. It will also be administered once at 6 months and 12 months follow up following treatment completion</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome measure will be the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). This will be administered routinely to participants.

    <time_frame>This will be administered in the first and last treatment session (week 1 and week 8) by the study investigators, and once at 6 months and 12 months follow up following treatment completion</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) measures trait and state anxiety, and can be used to diagnose anxiety and to distinguish it from depressive syndromes(Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, &amp; Jacobs, 1983).</description>

    <measure>Change in depression over 8 weeks of treatment measured by Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>

    <measure>Change in anxiety levels over 8 weeks of treatment measured by the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in metacognitions over 8 weeks of treatment measured by the Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>This will be administered in the first and last treatment session (week 1 and week 8) by the study investigators, and once at 6 months and 12 months follow up following treatment completion</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Metacognitions Questionnaire (MCQ-30) will be used to assess five domains of metacognitive beliefs. The five subscales include positive beliefs about worry, negative beliefs about uncontrollability and danger, cognitive confidence, negative beliefs about not controlling thoughts, and cognitive self-consciousness.</description>

    <measure>Change in symptoms of generalized anxiety disorder over 8 weeks of treatment measured by the generalized anxiety disorder questionnaire (GADQ)</measure>
