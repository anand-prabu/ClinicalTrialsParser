Patients also receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes\n      beginning on day 1 and continuing for up to 5 days during courses 2-7. Courses repeat every\n      28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every\n      6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
