  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is well known that ICU patients need sedation. Now no ideal sedation drug existed and
      every sedation drug has its advantage and disadvantage,so combined sedation may use the
      advantage and avoid the disadvantage of the sedation drug according to the
      patients'condition. Until now, there is rare study about the combined sedation or sequenced
      sedation of different sedation drug.The purpose of the study is to explore the value of
      combined sedation with midazolam and dexmedetomidine compared to single drug sedation in
      ICU, so as to seek an ideal sedation protocol that could reduce the cost of treatment,obtain
      the appropriate  sedation not under sedation or over sedation,reduce the incidence of
      delirium, reduce the adverse event of sedation.
