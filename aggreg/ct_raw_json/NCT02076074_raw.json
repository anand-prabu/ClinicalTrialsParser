Axillary sampling is\n             required only for cases of invasive cancers. Tumor size is determined by the\n             pathologist. Clinical size may be used if the pathologic size is indeterminate.\n             Patients with invasive cancer must have no positive axillary lymph nodes with at\n             least 6 axillary lymph nodes sampled or a negative sentinel node.\n\n          -  Negative histologic margins of partial mastectomy or re-excision specimen.
