    <textblock>
      In recent years medicine has been enhanced by the incorporation of technological innovations
      from areas as diverse as cell biology, biochemistry, genetics, biophysics and
      bioengineering. One of the few exceptions in this rapid process of implementing
      technological advances occurs in clinical medicine, where its penetration is much less
      effective than in other scientific and professional fields, or even in everyday life.
      Attempts to tackle this problem have given rise to various initiatives in the US and Europe,
      including Spain.

      There is a surprising paucity of telemedicine systems in clinical practice, especially with
      respect to sleep-related breathing disorders, and most particularly obstructive sleep apnea
      (OSA), where protocols are urgently needed to alleviate this healthcare problem represented
      by its under-diagnosis and comorbidity, as well as the long waiting lists for treatment. In
      others words, the growing awareness of sleep disorders, especially OSA, has not been
      accompanied by strategic changes in the cost-effective diagnosis and/or treatment of these
      diseases.

      CPAP therapy compliance is not always appropriate. Helping patients during the first two
      months usually determines compliance. Therefore, the development of strategies to support
      the patient during the first weeks is essential. However, this &quot;collides&quot; with reality,
      where it is difficult to properly care all patients because of congested sleep units. It is
      therefore necessary to implement new and imaginative control schemes especially at the
      beginning of the treatment. Patients' follow-up performed by telemedicine technology is an
      option that aims to substitute the face-to-face visits or at least reduce them considerably.
      In a future context, the idea is that the professional in charge of CPAP patients monitoring
      has on his/her agenda face-to-face visits and televisits (at distance) and information which
      patient will provide through online questionnaires with a certain frequency.

      In this sense, this project aims to analyze whether CPAP treatment compliance of OSA
      patients monitored by telemedicine techniques (website and televisits) is similar to that
      achieved by standard monitoring but more cost-effective. The study design is a multicenter
      randomized trial with parallel groups and blind final evaluation after CPAP treatment
      following two different strategies: one through conventional monitoring in the hospital
      (face-to-face visiting) and another by telemedicine monitoring (non-contact visiting and
      website).
