All but two of the remaining sessions are dedicated to the titration of total sleep time and to ensuring patient adherence. One session (session 5) entails the delivery of a specific form of cognitive therapy. The final session (session 8) is used to engage in a relapse-prevention didactic, i.e., to review first, how insomnia becomes chronic and second, the strategies that are likely to abort an extended episode of insomnia."

The therapist presents the QDT as a means to eliminate \"conditioned arousal,\" occurring after nocturnal arousal using 8 sessions on a weekly basis. The therapist initially helps the subject to develop a chronological 12-item hierarchy of commonly practiced activities on awakening at night, like opening eyes and clock watching. As a next step, the subject develops 6 imaginable scenes of himself/herself engaged in neutral activities like reading a newspaper. The therapist then helps the subject pair the neutral scenes with the items from the 12-item hierarchy, which is then practiced by the subject 2 hours before bedtime."

Some preliminary studies have shown that CBT-I\n      may be efficacious for insomnia during recovery.\n\n      The current study proposes to use a standard 8-week CBT-I to treat the insomnia with a\n      post-treatment follow-up at 3- and 6-months (after treatment). Further, it will evaluate if\n      an improvement in the insomnia is associated with an improvement in the underling alcoholism\n      and the daytime functioning. On an exploratory basis, the association of a first-degree\n      family history of alcoholism with the insomnia severity and treatment response will also be\n      evaluated."
