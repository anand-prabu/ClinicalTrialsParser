Treatment continues\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 8 weeks for 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months\n      for the third and fourth years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
