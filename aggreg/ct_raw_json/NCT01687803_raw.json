This group will be offered an opportunity to have a gym membership/access to the\n           training facility after completion of the 6-month period of serving as controls.\n\n      The specific aims of this pilot study are to:\n\n        -  Assess each participant's level of compliance/adherence\n\n        -  Assess the dietary habits of study participants as they become more physically active.\n\n        -  Identify barriers to physical activity in this specific population.\n\n        -  Measure changes in body composition, physical fitness and energy expenditure.\n\n        -  Evaluate changes in chronic disease risk factors.\n\n        -  Determine if regular physical activity reduces chronic stress."
