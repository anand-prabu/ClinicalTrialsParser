And it is well known that the modulation of S6K1 by oltipraz inhibited\n      the development of insulin resistance and hyperglycemia through the AMPK-S6K1 pathway.Also\n      some research reported that LXRg (a member of the nuclear hormone receptor)-mediated\n      increases in SREBP-1c (the sterol regulatory element-binding protein-1c gene) promote the\n      expression of lipogenic genes and enhance fatty acid synthesis and oltipraz inhibits LXRg\n      and SREBP-c. Therefore, Oltipraz inhibits fatty acid synthesis through AMPK-S6K1 pathway and\n      LXRg-SREBP-1c pathway in liver."
