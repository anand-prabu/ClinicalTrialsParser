Despite the known challenges to the ability of persons with spinal cord\n      injury (SCI) to maintain Tcore, and the effects of hypothermia to impair mental function in\n      able-bodied (AB) persons, there has been no work to date addressing these issues in persons\n      with tetraplegia.\n\n      The aim of this study is to determine if exposure of up to 2 hrs to cool temperatures (64\u00b0F)\n      causes body core temperature to decrease in persons with tetraplegia and if that decrease is\n      related to a decrease in mental performance.\n\n      After sitting in a cool (64\u00b0F) room for up to 2 hours the investigators hypotheses are:\n\n      Hypotheses (1): Tcore of most of the persons with tetraplegia will decline approximately\n      1.8\u00b0F (e.g., 98.6 to 96.8\u00b0F) while Tcore of controls will not decline at all; (2) Most of\n      the persons with tetraplegia will show a decline in mental performance (memory or\n      clear-headedness) while only some of AB controls will show a decline.\n\n      The second aim of this study is to determine if a 10 mg dose of an approved blood pressure\n      raising medicine (midodrine hydrochloride) will (1) reduce the decrease in body core\n      temperature and (2) prevent or delay the decline in mental performance in the group with\n      tetraplegia compared to the exact same procedures performed on the day with no medicine\n      (Visit 1) in the same group.\n\n      Hypotheses (3 & 4): The changes in blood flow to the skin caused by taking a one-time dose\n      of midodrine will lessen the decline in Tcore and prevent or delay the decline in mental\n      performance compared to the changes in Tcore and mental performance during cool temperature\n      exposure without midodrine in the group with tetraplegia."

            "textblock": "This study will investigate the mechanisms contributing to the thermoregulatory fragility in\n      persons with tetraplegia when exposed to cool ambient temperatures that are routinely\n      encountered during activities of daily living (ADL). Subnormal body core temperatures and\n      vulnerability  to hypothermia (Tcore<95\u00b0F) has been reported in veterans with tetraplegia\n      upon exposure to relatively mild environmental temperatures. The impact that a drift in\n      Tcore will be expected to have on cognitive performance, specifically working memory and\n      executive function, will be demonstrated. These 2 areas of cognitive performance are vital\n      for the ability to optimally care for one's self, which persons with higher cord lesions\n      must excel at to ensure health, as well as to be able to attain the maximal degree of\n      independence possible. Administration of an alpha agonist, midodrine hydrochloride, in an\n      attempt to attenuate the drift in Tcore and prevent or delay the expected decline in\n      cognitive performance to exposure to cool on cognitive function will be investigated as\n      well.\n\n      Primary Specific Aim: To determine the change in: (1) Tcore and (2) cognitive performance\n      (attention, working memory, processing speed, and executive function) in persons with\n      tetraplegia after exposure to a cool environment (64\u00b0F) for up to 120 min in the seated\n      position.\n\n      Primary Hypotheses:(1) 66% of persons with tetraplegia will demonstrate a decline of 1.8\u00b0F\n      in Tcore while 0% of controls will demonstrate that same thermal decline; (2) 80% of persons\n      with tetraplegia will have a decline of at least 1 T-score in Stroop Interference scores\n      (executive functioning) while 30% of controls will demonstrate that same magnitude of\n      decline.\n\n      Secondary Specific Aims: To determine the change in: (1) the average of distal skin\n      temperatures, (2) metabolic rate, and (3) subjective rating of thermal sensitivity after\n      exposure to 64\u00b0F in the seated position.\n\n      Secondary Hypotheses: Persons with tetraplegia will have less of a percent change in average\n      distal skin temperatures and metabolic rate, and report lower thermal sensitivity ratings\n      compared with AB.\n\n      Tertiary Specific Aim: To determine if a single, 10 mg dose of midodrine will (1) reduce the\n      decrease in Tcore and (2) prevent or delay the decline in cognitive performance in the group\n      with tetraplegia.\n\n      Tertiary Hypotheses: Because administration of a peripheral alpha-agonist will address the\n      primary thermoregulatory impairment to cool temperature exposure in persons with\n      tetraplegia\u2014that is, lack of vasoconstriction, the midodrine-induced peripheral\n      vasoconstriction will be anticipated to blunt the decrease in Tcore and prevent or delay the\n      decline in cognitive performance compared to cool exposure without drug administration.\n\n      Preparation for Study Visits: The study visits will be separated by a minimum of 1 day and\n      no more than 14 days. Subjects will wear minimal clothing (gym shorts, sports bra) during\n      the study to maximize bare skin exposure to the cool temperature. Each subject will be asked\n      to eat a light, standard meal 2 hours prior to their scheduled visit consisting of either a\n      plain bagel or 2 pieces of toast. For each visit they will be asked to empty their bladders\n      prior to arrival and again upon arrival, if needed.\n\n      Visit 1: Cold Ambient Challenge: Instrumentation: During Visit 1, all subjects will be\n      transferred to a padded table for instrumentation, after which they will be transferred back\n      to their own wheelchair or, for controls, to a provided wheelchair. All subjects will use a\n      Roho seat cushion for air circulation consistency and decubiti prevention. A rectal probe\n      will be placed 4 inches beyond the anal sphincter for core temperature measurement, and skin\n      thermal sensors will be taped at 15 sites above and below the level of lesion for collection\n      of skin temperatures. A  mask will be placed over the subject's nose and mouth for\n      measurement of exhaled gases from which resting metabolic rate will be calculated from\n      analysis of expired gases (VO2) by a metabolic cart.  Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) will be\n      used to measure changes in microvascular perfusion by taping a doppler probe on the skin in\n      the area of the ulnar styloid processes and medial malleoli bilaterally (wrists and ankles)\n      to confirm vasoconstriction. A pulse oximeter will be placed on the left second digit to\n      obtain blood oxygen saturation and heart rate (HR).  An automated blood pressure cuff will\n      be placed above the right elbow to measure brachial BP. An intravenous catheter will be\n      placed in the right antecubital or nearby vein and secured for sequential blood collection\n      for cortisol and norepinephrine.\n\n      Baseline Collection: At the end of the 30 minute acclimation period (81\u00b0F), a baseline (BL)\n      collection of the following parameters will be performed for 15 minutes with Tcore, skin\n      temperatures, and VO2 measured continuously; HR, BP, blood oxygen saturation, subjective\n      measures of thermal sensitivity, and 5 minutes of LDF will be measured at 10 minute\n      intervals. A venous blood draw will be collected once at baseline for norepinephrine and\n      cortisol concentrations. At the end of the BL period, a cognitive performance battery will\n      be administered.\n\n      Thermal Challenge: Following completion of the baseline period, subjects will be wheeled\n      into an 18\u00b0C thermal chamber for 120 minutes or until Tcore \u2264 95\u00b0F. Tcore, skin\n      temperatures, and VO2 will be continuously monitored to ensure subject safety throughout the\n      protocol; brachial BP, HR, blood oxygen saturation, thermal sensitivity, and symptoms of\n      hypothermia and autonomic dysreflexia will be assessed at 10 min intervals while LDF will be\n      measured for 5 minutes every 20 minutes. Venous blood will be collected at 50 minute\n      intervals. A decrease in Tcore to \u2264 95\u00b0F, or moderate subject discomfort, will result in\n      termination of the protocol. The cognitive performance battery will be administered when\n      Tcore has declined 1.8\u00b0F or is \u2264 95.9\u00b0F (in subjects with tetraplegia) or after 120 minutes\n      of cold exposure (in both groups) on Visits 1 & 2.\n\n      Visit 2: Cold Ambient Challenge with Midodrine: Visit 2 will be completed in subjects with\n      tetraplegia who participated in Visit 1 and who had an impaired ability to maintain Tcore.\n      Following completion of the BL period, subjects will be orally administered midodrine\n      hydrochloride (10 mg tablet). Forty minutes after midodrine administration (for onset of\n      drug effect), a second BL collection will be obtained, and subjects will be wheeled into the\n      64\u00b0F thermal chamber for 120 minutes or until Tcore \u2264 95\u00b0F. Data collection will follow the\n      same schedule and be conducted in the seated position as in Visit 1. If brachial BP\n      increases to 160/90 mmHg, the subject will be removed from the cool room and evaluated by\n      Dr. William A. Bauman, who may consider the administration of labetalol (to lower BP), if\n      deemed necessary."
