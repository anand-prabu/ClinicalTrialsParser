Determine the objective response rate, time to\n      progression, and survival in patients treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxic\n      effects of this regimen in these patients. IV. Assess the common functional polymorphisms in\n      genes involved in chemotherapeutic response to improve prediction of clinical outcomes and\n      provide insight into the potential for genotype-specific drug dosage.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour and\n      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve stable disease (SD),\n      partial response (PR), or complete response (CR) may receive 4 additional courses past SD,\n      PR, or CR. Patients are followed every 6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 55 patients will be accrued for this study within 11 months."
