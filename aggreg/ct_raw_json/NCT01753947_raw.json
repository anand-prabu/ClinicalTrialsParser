Currently described simulation-based curricula\n      consist of trainees practicing the same tasks until expert proficiency is reached. It has\n      yet to be investigated whether individualized deliberate practice, where curricula tasks\n      vary depending on prior levels of technical proficiency, would translate to the operating\n      room.\n\n      This randomized controlled trial effectively demonstrates that deliberate practice on a\n      virtual reality simulator results in an improvement in technical skills in a real clinical\n      situation.  This enhances the feasibility of implementing simulation-based curricula into\n      residency training programs, and consequently has the potential to improve patient safety."
