Working in parallel with the San\n      Mateo Medical Center (SMMC) electronic medical records (EMR) system, the software tool will\n      automate reminders that request text responses from patients to either confirm or request to\n      reschedule their upcoming appointments. While simple in concept, this tool aims to free up\n      scarce clinical resources which are currently allocated to daily patient phone call\n      reminders. With funding from a Bay Area foundation, the investigators will develop and pilot\n      this open-source software tool in a 12-month randomized-controlled trial, slated to begin in\n      October 2012. The endpoints of the study will aim to demonstrate improvements in both\n      appointment adherence and glycemic control."
