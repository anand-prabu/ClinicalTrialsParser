  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ertugliflozin (MK-8835/PF-04971729) in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus with Stage 3 Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) who
      have inadequate glycemic control on background antihyperglycemic therapy. The duration of
      this trial will be up to 67 weeks.  This will consist of a 1-week Screening Period, a
      10-week wash-off period from metformin, if needed, and a 2-week placebo run-in period, a
      52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 14-day post-treatment follow-up period. The
      primary objective of this trial is to assess the A1C-lowering efficacy of the addition of
      ertugliflozin compared to the addition of placebo with an underlying hypothesis that
      addition of treatment with ertugliflozin provides greater reduction in A1C compared to the
      addition of placebo; the primary objective will be tested for both 5-mg and 15-mg doses of
      ertugliflozin.
