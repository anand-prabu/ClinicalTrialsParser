It is based on\n      decades-old observations that nerve cell firing can be altered by low amplitude direct\n      current (DC). The researchers in this study believe that tDCS may have a positive impact on\n      hyperphagia and weight.\n\n      In this study, the investigators intend to assess whether the effects tDCS differ between\n      obese subjects, non-obese subjects, and subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome by measuring the\n      amplitude and latency of eyeblink startle responses to a set of food- and non-food-related\n      visual stimuli in all subjects, various hyperphagia questionnaires, and cognitive and\n      behavioral assessments. It is hypothesized that as a group, subjects with Prader-Willi\n      syndrome will demonstrate behavioral and psychometric evidence of abnormal food image\n      processing, craving and associated behaviors relative to our control groups, and this group\n      may receive potentially beneficial effects from tDCS sessions.  Obese subjects are also\n      predicted to have decreased hyperphagia and food cravings as a result of tDCS."
