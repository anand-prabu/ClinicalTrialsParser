The benefits of the study outweigh the risk as\n      there is the possibility of developing better computerized neurocognitive measures, and the\n      risks are limited to no more than minimal test related fatigue and psychological stress.\n\n      Depressed humans, and depressed human participants undergoing ECT (age 18-70) will be\n      invited to participate in this study. After providing informed consent participants will\n      undergo a clinical psychiatric evaluation to confirm the inclusion/exclusion criteria. After\n      the clinical psychiatric evaluation, participants will complete common and new\n      neurocognitive measures. There will be a total of two testing visits (baseline, 1-month\n      follow-up). The anticipated duration of the participants involvement is no more than 2 study\n      visits that can take place over a 4-day period (i.e., the clinical evaluation can occur on\n      day 1 and the neuropsychological measures can be administered on day 2 of each study visit)\n      equating to approximately 6-hours (3-hours each day) per study visit."
