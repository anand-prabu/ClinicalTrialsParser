      Primary research hypothesis: Patients who continue their chronic ACEI therapy up to and
      including the morning of an intermediate risk surgery will experience more intraoperative
      hypotension than those who hold their chronic ACEI perioperatively.

      Secondary research hypothesis #1: Patients who continue their chronic ACEI up to and
      including the morning of an intermediate risk surgery will experience better postoperative
      control of hypertension than those who hold their chronic ACEI perioperatively.

      Secondary research hypothesis #2: Patients who continue their chronic ACEI up to and
      including the morning of an intermediate risk surgery will experience less acute renal
      failure than those who hold their chronic ACEI perioperatively.

      Secondary research hypothesis #3: Patients with a preoperative systolic blood pressure less
      than 110 mmHg who are continued on their chronicACEI therapy perioperatively will have a
      significant decrease in blood pressure during anesthesia compared to those who have a
      preoperative systolic blood pressure greater than 110 who are continued on their chronic
      ACEI.

      Secondary research hypothesis #4: Patients above the age of 64 who are continued on their
      chronic ACEI therapy perioperatively will have a significant decrease in blood pressure
      during anesthesia compared to those aged 64 or younger who are continued on their chronic
      ACEI.

      The purpose of this study is to determine if discontinuation of angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) is necessary prior to intermediate risk surgery. ACEIs have been
      associated with intraoperative hypotension during vascular and cardiac surgeries. Patients
      presenting to the UNMC Pre-Anesthesia Screening (PAS) Clinic for an intermediate risk
      surgery who are on chronic ACEI therapy will be eligible for enrollment. Subjects will be
      randomized to either continue or hold their ACEI perioperatively. The outcome of interest is
      intraoperative hypotension defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 60 mmHg or a
      decrease in systolic pressure greater than a 30%. Blood pressure will be followed not only
      throughout surgery, but also during recovery and the remainder of hospitalization. Renal
      function will be assessed with creatinine measurements in the PAS clinic and on the first
      postoperative day. No follow-up is planned beyond discharge from the hospital.
