The reasons for\n      this finding are unknown and have not been studied in depth so far. We hypothesize that\n      surgical trauma in this region might activate pro-inflammatory pathways. By examining the\n      proteome of patients at different stages (prior to the surgery, at ICU admission, on the\n      second postoperative day and when SIRS has ended clinically), we aim to identify the\n      involved pro-inflammatory pathways and identify possible target proteins that might be clues\n      to modification of postoperative SIRS in the future."
