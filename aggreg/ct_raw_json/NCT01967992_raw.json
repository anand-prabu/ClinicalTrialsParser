Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.\nParticipants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness."

A substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of\n             investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to participate in\n             the intervention.

Previous use or recent changes in medications that can interfere with the measures\n             used in the study: current use of insulin; use of systemic (oral or IV)\n             corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to enrollment or severe autoimmune disorders or\n             other conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), that are likely to require these\n             medications; and initiation of new class of psychiatric medications in past 2 months.\n\n          6. Pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the next 12 months, breastfeeding or less\n             than 6 months post-partum.\n\n          7.
