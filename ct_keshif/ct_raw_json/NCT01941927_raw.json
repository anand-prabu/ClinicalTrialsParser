Imaging (CT or MRI) will be performed within 7 days prior to day 1 of\n      Odd Cycles, starting with Cycle 3.\n\n      Patients may continue treatment with trametinib in combination with GSK2141795 on trial\n      until disease progression or the development of unacceptable toxicity that does not improve\n      with maximal supportive care or dose reduction per protocol.\n\n      Treatment-associated adverse events will be assessed based on clinical and laboratory\n      findings using the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0. Adverse event\n      assessments will be performed every week through cycle 3 day 1, and on day 1 for every cycle\n      thereafter. AEs and SAEs will be monitored by UCSF's Data Safety Monitoring Committee.\n\n      Safety assessments will include medical history, physical examination, CBC with\n      differential, chemistries panel, thyroid function and pregnancy tests, ECGs, and\n      ophthalmology evaluations. Screening assessments will also include a transthoracic\n      echocardiogram or MUGA scan, and brain imaging.\n\n      It is estimated that 48 patients will complete the study."
