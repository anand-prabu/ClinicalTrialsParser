The scale for 'severity of illness' measures mania, depression and overall illness on a 7 point scale from 1 ('normal, not ill') to 7 ('very severely ill'). The scale for 'change from preceding phase' and 'change from worst phase' measures mania, depression, and overall illness on an 8-point scale from 1 (very much improved) to 8 ('not applicable'). If the patient, in 'change from preceding phase', at any visit during the double-blind, has a score of 5, 6, or 7 in any of 3 categories (mania, depression, or overall bipolar illness), then the illness will be considered to have worsened.",
