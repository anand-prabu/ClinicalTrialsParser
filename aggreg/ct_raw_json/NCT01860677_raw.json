The present study\n      proposes to explore whether transcranial stimulation (or cranial electrotherapy stimulation;\n      CES) using an FDA-approved device can alter brain function, mood and responses to cognitive\n      tasks in patients diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Furthermore, the\n      study will test whether such changes parallel clinical improvement in signs and symptoms.\n      The dependent variables of interest will be magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Secondarily,\n      we will assess the effects of CES on brain chemistry through the use of magnetic resonance\n      spectroscopy procedures in normal, healthy control participants."

For each item, standardized questions and probes are provided. As part of the trauma assessment (Criterion A), the Life Events Checklist (LEC) is used to identify traumatic stressors experienced.
