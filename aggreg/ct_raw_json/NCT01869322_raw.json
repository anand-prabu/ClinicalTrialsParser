The two most common ways of stabilizing the broken parts of the arm are 1) with a\n      plaster-based coaptation splint, or 2) with a soft cloth sling and swathe. These hold the\n      arm steady until the patient can schedule an appointment with the OHSU Orthopaedic Trauma\n      clinic where they will receive definitive evaluation and stabilization/fixation. In much of\n      the orthopaedic literature coaptation splints are the default immobilization method. The\n      investigators hypothesize however, that sling and swathe immobilization may be equally\n      effective for short term stabilization, while being faster to apply, and more comfortable\n      for the patient. This randomized, unblinded prospective study will follow the satisfaction,\n      quality of life and limited functional outcomes of all enrolled participants during the\n      first week following their injury."
