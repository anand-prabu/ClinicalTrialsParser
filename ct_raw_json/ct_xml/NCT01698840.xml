  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transitional formulas (22 kcal/oz) are recommended for infants less than 35 weeks gestation
      at birth. However, few data are available related to follow-up of infants receiving these
      formulas who were 28-34 weeks gestation at birth.

      Primary hypothesis: Provision of supplemental vitamin D to a transitional formula will lead
      to higher serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25-OHD) levels and no infant with a serum 25-OHD less
      than 20 ng/mL when assessed at approximately 52 weeks post-menstrual age (PMA).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Born at 28 0/7 to 34 6/7 weeks PMA and 1000-2250 g birth weight.

          -  Currently 34 0/7 to 38 6/7 weeks post-menstrual age at time of consent.

          -  Born at Texas Children's (including Pavilion for Women) or Methodist campus hospitals
             or transferred within 48 hours of birth.

          -  Care expected to be provided at one of these institutions until discharge home.

          -  Any initial feeding will be permitted, but expected to transition to primarily (80%
             of feeds or up to 2 breast milk feeds per day) infant formula by 38 6/7 weeks PMA or
             hospital discharge, whichever comes first.

          -  Able to tolerate 22 kcal/oz transitional formula and receive a volume of at least 130
             mL/kg/day total feeding volume.

          -  No longer receiving any form of mechanical ventilation or diuretics. Low flow nasal
             cannula (&lt; Â¼ LPM) will be permitted if it is anticipated this will be discontinued
             before hospital discharge.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) requiring daily use of diuretics beyond 38 6/7 weeks
             PMA (or hospital discharge, whichever comes first) and &gt; 22 kcal/oz concentration
             formula beyond 38 6/7 weeks PMA.

          -  Major congenital anomalies, history of proven Stage 2 or above NEC, or severe feeding
             intolerance.

          -  Caloric density greater than 22 kcal/oz.

          -  Higher order multiples (However, twins are acceptable. Twins will be randomized
             together. Only data from 1 twin picked at random will be used in the final analyses.)
