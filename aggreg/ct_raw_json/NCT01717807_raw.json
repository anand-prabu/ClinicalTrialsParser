Tang PA, Tsao MS, Moore MJ.\n      Expert Opin Pharmacotherapy. 2006 Feb;7(2):177-93.)\n\n      Noninvasive PET/CT imaging of EGFR expression activity and mutation status in NSCLC could\n      aid in the selection of patients for individualized therapy with EGFR kinase inhibitors.\n\n      Whole-body noninvasive PET/CT imaging could estimate treatment-responsive vs. -resistant\n      tumor burden before the initiation of therapy with EGFR inhibitors.\n\n      The purposes of the study are:\n\n        1. To adjust an optimal treatment for patients with tumors that have high expression of\n           EGFR by identification of this type of cancer using C11-Erlotinib PET/CT during\n           pretreatment work-up; as well as to follow up after treatment response.\n\n        2. To recognize patients with advanced pancreatic cancer responding to treatment with\n           erlotinib and to distinguish them from non-responders."
