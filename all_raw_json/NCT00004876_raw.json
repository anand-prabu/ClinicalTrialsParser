Thalidomide may stop the growth of ovarian cancer by stopping\n      blood flow to the tumor.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving carboplatin together\n      with thalidomide works compared to carboplatin alone in treating patients with ovarian\n      epithelial cancer."

Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour. Treatment continues every 4 weeks\n           for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive carboplatin as in arm I. Patients receive thalidomide orally\n           once daily. Thalidomide treatment continues for up to 24 weeks commencing on the first\n           day of carboplatin therapy and ceasing 4 weeks after the last course of carboplatin.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
