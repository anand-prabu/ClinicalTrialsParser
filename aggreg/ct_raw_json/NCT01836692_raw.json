Patients with non-small cell\n      lung cancer have a risk of the tumour in the lung recurring or progressing after treatment.\n\n      In this study, we will investigate:\n\n        -  whether giving a more targeted and individualised type of chest irradiation or\n           radiotherapy to the lung tumour (known as Isotoxic IMRT), is practical and whether it\n           causes side effects which can be tolerated\n\n        -  whether this new method of delivering the radiotherapy can reduce the risk of the\n           tumour in the lung recurring or progressing\n\n        -  whether survival can be improved by using this new radiotherapy method\n\n      The dose of chest irradiation will be calculated specifically to suit patient's body shape,\n      the position of the lung cancer, and how close healthy tissues are to the tumour.\n      Radiotherapy will be delivered twice a day over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks. The duration\n      of treatment will vary individually according to the delivered dose to the tumour area."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Approximately 12,000 patients are diagnosed with stage III NSCLC in the UK each year and\n      their survival is ~15% at 5 years. As the majority of patients are not suitable for the gold\n      standard treatment (concurrent chemo-radiotherapy (CTRT), novel strategies integrating\n      radiotherapy (RT) technological advances and radiobiological knowledge need to be evaluated\n      in patients treated with the alternative treatment option, sequential CTRT. There is solid\n      evidence that improving local control in lung cancer leads to increased survival. Strategies\n      to improve local control in stage III NSCLC include dose escalation and individualisation\n      which are limited by the dose delivered to surrounding normal tissues. We hypothesise that\n      this will be facilitated by the use of IMRT.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      To demonstrate the feasibility of delivering isotoxic RT using IMRT and hyperfractionated\n      accelerated RT in stage III NSCLC patients who are not suitable for concurrent CTRT.\n\n      Endpoints:\n\n      Primary endpoint: Delivery of isotoxic IMRT to dose >60 Gy EQD2 (total biologically\n      equivalent in 2 Gy fraction).\n\n      Secondary endpoints: Estimation of the suitability for lung isotoxic IMRT, estimation of\n      proportion of patients with acute grade 3+ non haematological toxicity, estimation of late\n      toxicity,  estimation of local control/overall survival and development of a robust Quality\n      Assurance (QA) process for lung IMRT.\n\n      Design:\n\n      Prospective multicentre, non-randomised feasibility study with early stopping rules.\n\n      35 patients will be recruited in this prospective multicentre feasibility study. Stopping\n      rules are in place to ensure the safety of patients. We estimate that this regimen would be\n      of added value to a national randomised phase II trial if 80% of the patients can be planned\n      to a dose >60 Gy EQD2.\n\n      Intervention:\n\n      Patients with stage III NSCLC, PS 0-2, not suitable for concurrent CTRT, will be treated\n      with individualised doses of radiation based on pre-specified normal tissue doses (spinal\n      cord, brachial plexus, lung tissue, heart and great vessels/proximal bronchial tree).\n      Radiotherapy will be delivered twice-daily over a maximum period of 4.5 weeks using IMRT and\n      the dose of radiation will be increased until one or more of the organs at risk tolerance or\n      the maximum dose of 79.2 Gy is reached."
