  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deployment impacts both service member and family, and the cost can be high.  Spouses'
      reactions to deployment may include emotional distress, loneliness, anticipatory fear or
      grief, somatic complaints, and depression.  The goal is to help spouses learn ways to manage
      stress and solve problems related to deployment and reintegration, communication, managing
      long distance relationships, and other common problems.  The study will compare telephone
      support groups to online education sessions.  The study will enroll 160 spouses.  In the
      Telephone Support groups, a group leader and participants will meet 12 times over six months
      to focus on education, skills building and support.  Education Only online sessions will
      provide the same education content, without skills building or support.  Content includes
      strategies to reduce or eliminate communication difficulties during deployment, how to find
      help; practical concerns during deployment; fostering resilience and decreasing stress;
      fostering relationships while apart, negotiating roles and relationships; changes during
      deployment; strategies to support the spouse and the service member; and cues to alert
      spouses when to seek mental health services for the family or themselves.  Outcomes will
      include resilience, depression, anxiety and coping behaviors.  Telephone data collection
      will be conducted at baseline, six and twelve months.
