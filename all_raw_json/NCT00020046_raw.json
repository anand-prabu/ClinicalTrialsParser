Thalidomide may stop the growth of prostate cancer by stopping\n      blood flow to the tumor.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of docetaxel with or without\n      thalidomide in treating patients who have metastatic prostate cancer."

Determine the efficacy of thalidomide with docetaxel in terms of clinical\n      response in patients with androgen-independent metastatic prostate cancer.\n\n      II.  Compare the pharmacokinetics of docetaxel with or without thalidomide in these patients\n      III.  Determine whether any pharmacodynamic relationships exist between plasma\n      concentrations and clinical activity or toxicity of these regimens in this patient\n      population.\n\n      IV.  Compare changes in molecular markers of angiogenesis and markers of apoptosis after\n      treatment with these regimens in these patients.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.  Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I:  Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes once weekly for 3 weeks. Arm II:\n      Patients receive oral thalidomide daily beginning on day 2 and docetaxel IV over 30 minutes\n      on days 2, 9, and 16.\n\n      Treatment continues every 28 days in both arms in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or\n      disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 75 patients (25 to arm I and 50 to arm II) will be accrued for this study within\n      18 months."
