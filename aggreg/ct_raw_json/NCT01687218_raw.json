The study population will be sexually active, HIV-uninfected males who are 18 years of\n      age or older, who report a history of receptive anal intercourse in the past 3 months.  Each\n      of the study product regimens offers different advantages to participants seeking an\n      effective HIV prevention agent.  How these relative advantages will compare in terms of\n      safety, acceptability, systemic and local absorption, and adherence will be examined within\n      this study."
