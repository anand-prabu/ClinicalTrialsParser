  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare the functional performance of voluntary opening (VO) and voluntary
      closing (VC) body powered prostheses. We hypothesize that the ability to sense cable tension
      and produce progressively higher pinch from shoulder force will result in advantages for the
      VC terminal device (TRS, Grip 3) in terms of proprioception, grip strength, overall
      function, and quality of life. The specific aims of this clinical trial are to:

        1. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved grip
           force.

        2. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved movement
           symmetry and reduced compensatory motion during activity.

        3. Determine if accommodation with a VC Grip 3 prehensor will result in improved function
           in activities of daily living by self-report.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the performance of the prehensors, subjects will complete a randomized A-B
      crossover study with a subjective follow-up. Two subject categories will be evaluated: 1.)
      healthy non-amputees using a unilateral prosthesis simulator, and 2.) unilateral transradial
      amputee subjects who currently use, or are interested in using a body-powered prosthesis. We
      anticipate data collection data with 10 non-amputee subject, and approximately 8 amputee
      subjects.  Non-amputee subjects will perform the same randomization, test, and short surveys
      as the amputee subjects, except they will have a 1-hour accommodation immediately prior to
      testing, will have a minimum of 1 week between Phase A and Phase B testing, and will not
      complete the follow-up survey.
