          -  Anticipated to be hospitalized for at least 3 consecutive days after initial study
             transfusion

          -  Expected to require no more than 2 units of Fresh Whole Blood in the 3 days following
             randomization

          -  Agree to return to the hospital for the follow-up visits

          -  Women of Child Bearing Potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 72 hours
             before randomization when warranted and must agree to practice a medically acceptable
             contraception regimen or agree to abstain from heterosexual intercourse during their
             study participation.

          -  Patient or legally authorized representative has given written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Symptoms of clinical malaria (confirmed by microscopy)

          -  Patient has received antimalarial treatment within 7 days prior to randomization

          -  Fever (Central body temperature greater than 38.5°C)

          -  Massive bleeding expected to require more than two Fresh Whole Blood units within 3
             days from randomization

          -  Transfusion(s) of a blood product within 1 month prior to randomization

          -  Acute or chronic medical disorder that, in the opinion of the investigator, would
             impair the ability of the patient to receive protocol treatment

          -  Previous treatment with other pathogen-reduced blood products

          -  Females who are pregnant
