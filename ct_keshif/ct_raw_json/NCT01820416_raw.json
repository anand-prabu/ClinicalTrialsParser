Subjects will be randomly assigned to a\n      treatment, placebo, or control group. The treatment group will be given a three treatment of\n      low-level laser therapy, which consists of shining low-level lasers beams onto the ear and\n      head. The laser beams are cool to the touch, and do not cause discomfort. Each laser\n      treatment will last approximately 4 minutes. Three treatments will be applied three times\n      within the course of one week. Hearing tests will be administered immediately before\n      treatment, immediately after treatment, and six weeks after treatment. Results will be\n      analyzed to determine the effect of the laser treatment on hearing."

            "textblock": "Low-level laser therapy has been practiced for about 20 years in Europe and is beginning to\n      be practiced in the US. Theoretically, laser energy in the red and near infrared light\n      spectrum is capable of penetrating 2-5 cm into tissue and can stimulate mitochondria in the\n      cells to produce more energy (through the production of adenosine triphosphate), which in\n      turn may help prevent or repair tissue damage. The effects of low-level laser therapy on\n      hearing have not been well studied. It has been suggested that laser therapy might help\n      repair damage to the cochlea and restore some degree of hearing loss. Studies of low-level\n      laser stimulation of cochleae utilizing microscopy, PET imaging, and MRI suggest potential\n      therapeutic benefit to hearing. While preliminary studies suggest a possible improvement in\n      hearing thresholds, a carefully controlled study is needed to verify the results using a\n      valid battery of audiological tests."
