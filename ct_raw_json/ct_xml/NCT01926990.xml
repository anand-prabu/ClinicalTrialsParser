    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies perfusion computed tomography (CT) in predicting response
      to treatment in patients with advanced kidney cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic
      procedures done before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's
      response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Early prediction of response to treatment by correlating changes in quantitative
      perfusion CT with circulating tumor cells after 1 week of targeted therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Demonstrate quantitative perfusion CT characteristics can predict early response to
      targeted therapeutics in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC).

      II. Correlate CT results with circulating tumor cells (circulating tumor cells [CTC]
      collection and analysis covered under separate protocol, e-protocol 12597) to predict
      response to targeted therapies (TT) in advanced RCC.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo perfusion CT at baseline, 7 days, and 12 weeks.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up for 1 year.
