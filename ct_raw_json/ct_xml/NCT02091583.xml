  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of consumption of a novel supplement
      beverage consisting of Canola Oil, Fibre and DHA, containing the most effective food
      bioactives, including n-3 fatty acid enriched dietary oil high in monounsaturated fatty
      acids (MUFAs) and soluble dietary fibre, aiming at the management of heart disease risk
      factors in people with metabolic syndrome and to test its efficacy and safety in humans.

      The proposed study is a randomized, double-blind, crossover trial, it will be conducted at
      the Richardson Centre for Functional Food and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN), University of
      Manitoba. The study design will consist of 4 phases with 28 days per phase, each phase will
      be separate by 4-week washout periods. Participants will consume a controlled
      weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate, 15% protein) supplemented
      with the following novel beverages: (a) control beverage containing corn and safflower oil
      comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of n-6 linoleic acid, common to
      current North American intakes, (b) beverage containing high oleic canola oil and
      docosahexaenoic acid (HOCO-DHA), (c) beverage containing high molecular weight barley
      B-glucan, (d) beverage containing combination of HOCO-DHA and high molecular weight barley
      β-glucan. Treatments will be isocalorically incorporated into fruit beverage made with fruit
      juice and consumed in equal parts at breakfast and supper.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants will be asked to consume 13C-cholesterol and deuterium oxide (D2O) at the end of each phase. On day 23, fasting blood samples will be obtained (0h), prior to oral administration of a 75mg of 13C-cholesterol mixed in 5g of margarine and spread on half English muffin. Fasting samples will be obtained over the following 96 hours on day 24 (24h), day 25 (48h), day 26 (72h) and day 27 (96h) to measure cholesterol absorption. In addition, on day 27 a fasting baseline blood sample is taken prior to administration of an oral dose of D2O as tracer to measure fractional cholesterol synthesis. Fasting blood samples will be obtained 24 h following the tracer dose on day 28.</description>

    <measure>Change in body composition</measure>
    <time_frame>Measurements will be done at the beginning and end of each of the four 4-week treatment phases over a period of seven months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Changes in body composition will be assessed using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. In addition, body weight, waist and hip circumferences will be measured.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Insulin concentrations will be determined using ELISA kits. Glucose concentrations will be determined using a finger-prick blood glucose monitor. In addition, glucose response to breakfast will be assess before and at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 and 120 minutes following the initiation of breakfast.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Satiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Assessment will be done at the end of the four 4-week treatment phases over a period of seven months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants will be given 30 minutes to consume the full portion of their prescribed treatment. At 60 minutes after treatment participants will be instructed to eat until they reached a point of comfortable satisfaction. Food intake and level of comfortably full will be assessed by questionnaire. In addition, a visual analogue scale (VAS) questionnaire will be used to measure motivation to eat before and after an all you can eat meal.</description>
