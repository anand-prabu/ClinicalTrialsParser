The proposed model consists of vaccinating healthy,\n      hookworm-na\u00efve adults with a candidate hookworm vaccine, followed by challenging them with\n      the investigational product, Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to assess the effect of\n      vaccination on infection.  The first proposed study will be a feasibility study that will\n      consist of administering different doses of the Necator americanus Larval Inoculum to\n      healthy adult volunteers to determine the optimal dose (i.e., number of infectious larvae)\n      that is safe, well-tolerated and results in consistent infection."
