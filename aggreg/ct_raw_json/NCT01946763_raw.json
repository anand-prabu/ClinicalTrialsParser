This education includes :  information about anesthesia emergence, recovery and\n      extubation.\n\n      Anesthesia and education are conducted by the same anesthesiologist. All patients are\n      operated by the same surgeon. All patients receive same balanced general anesthesia\n      protocol. The recovery starts immediately after the end of the procedure, when the patient\n      has BIS \u226590 and TOF\u22659.\n\n      Recovery assessment and data recording is done by a blinded anesthesiologist."
