Each intervention period is three weeks and the participants are\n      allocated to the test and placebo regimes in a randomized order.\n\n      Material: 40 healthy adults are enrolled after informed consent from the School of\n      Dentistry, University of Copenhagen.\n\n      Methods: Samples of resting, unstimulated whole saliva (UWS) and stimulated whole saliva\n      (SWS) are collected five times during the study period. The samples are immediately frozen\n      in 0.5 ml aliquots.\n\n      Intervention: The subjects are instructed to ingest two tablets containing Lactobacillus\n      reuteri or placebo, twice daily for 3 weeks. No probiotic food or health products are\n      allowed during the intervention period. All normal oral hygiene routines should be\n      maintained during the entire study. The compliance is checked through interviews. Any\n      perceived side effects are reported without delay to the research staff.\n\n      Endpoints: The concentration of total protein and secretory IgA in saliva are determined\n      with the enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA).\n\n      Scientific importance: The study may provide evidence that probiotic supplements can\n      influence the innate defense system in the whole saliva which may open up for novel\n      strategies to combat oral diseases."
