The\n      ataxia performed low intra-cortical facilitation mainly due to the degenerative cerebellum.\n      Noninvasive sensory stimulations such as peripheral electrical stimulation were reported to\n      modulate the excitability of the motor excitability. Neuromuscular electrical stimulation\n      (NMES) was proposed as a neuromodulation tool for the aberrant motor excitability on the\n      SCA. This study aims to investigate the effect of NMES on the motor excitability in the SCA,\n      and the differentiation on the central or peripheral motor excitability changed by the NMES."
