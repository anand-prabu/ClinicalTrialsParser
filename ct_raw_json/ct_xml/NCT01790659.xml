    <textblock>
      This study is a pivotal Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, 3-site, two-group trial assessing
      the efficacy and safety of WR 279,396 Topical Cream and Paromomycin Alone Topical Cream in
      subjects with CL in Panama. The primary objective of this study is to determine if WR
      279,396 results in statistically superior final clinical cure rates of an index lesion when
      compared with Paromomycin Alone for the treatment of CL in Panama expected to be caused by L
      panamensis.
