    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to determine the safety of ATX-101 subcutaneous (SC)
      injections in the submental area and to evaluate the effects of four interventions, relative
      to placebo in the submental area, particularly with regard to assessment and management of
      pain, bruising, and swelling/edema.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is to evaluate the effects of four interventions, pre- and post-SC injections of ATX
      101 relative to placebo in approximately 80 subjects.  Subjects will be randomized to either
      ATX-101 or placebo at a ratio of 4:1.  Approximately 64 subjects will receive ATX 101 and
      approximately 16 subjects will receive placebo in one of four Patient Experience Management
      Paradigms.

      Subjects are required to visit the research facility on 10 separate occasions for
      protocol-defined treatments, procedures, tests, and observations.
