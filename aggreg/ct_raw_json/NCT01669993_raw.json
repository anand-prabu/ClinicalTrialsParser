The investigators preliminary experience (Dr.\n      Sadhasivam PI: IRB No. 2008-0848) with the pharmocogenetic study, studying the phenotypic\n      and genotypic influences of pain and use of opioids in patients undergoing tonsillectomy\n      indicates that a significant number of patients scheduled as outpatients experience\n      prolonged recovery phases in the PACU, some of whom are admitted or re-admitted following\n      discharge. The identification of those factors that are, predictive of adverse events in\n      tonsillectomy patients and the development of a prototype prediction model in this\n      single-center study to support clinical decision-making.  The rationale of this project is\n      that developing a model to predict postoperative adverse events will not only lead to\n      improved clinical outcomes and enhance patient safety, but also reduce family psychosocial\n      distress associated with unanticipated hospital visits or re-admission, while reducing the\n      burden on the health care system."
