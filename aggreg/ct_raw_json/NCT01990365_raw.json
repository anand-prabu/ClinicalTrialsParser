            "description": "The investigators plan to analyze 300 patients who presented with acute back pain and were diagnosed as having acute OVFs on MRI.\nAll radiographs were taken at the initial visit. Fracture mobility was determined by comparing cross-table supine lateral radiographs with sitting lateral radiographs (dynamic radiography). Mobility was considered present when a measurable change in vertebral body height occurred between supine and sitting radiographs.We also evaluate low back pain using visual analog scale (VAS) score.\nThen the patients undergo external fixation using Gips. After Gips fixation, dynamic radiography was performed again to evaluate reduction of dynamic mobility of the OVF body. VAS score was also evaluated after external fixation.\nWe investigate patients' background such as age, sex, bone mineral density, etc.\nWe performed statical analyses to determine the factors which related to low back pain after acute OVFs, especially fracture mobility.",
