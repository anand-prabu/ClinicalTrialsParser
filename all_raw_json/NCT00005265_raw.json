This study used data collected in two completed clinical trials, the\n      BHAT and AMIS.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Study endpoints included all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality such as sudden death,\n      recurrent and non-fatal myocardial infarction, and incident congestive heart failure.\n      Univariate and multivariate analyses of baseline data variables from BHAT were conducted to\n      determine which were predictive of study endpoints.  Baseline variables included\n      sociodemograhic characteristics, medical history, medication use, physical examination\n      finds, and electrocardiographic characteristics. Baseline characteristics found to be\n      predictive of study endpoints in the BHAT placebo group were examined in the AMIS placebo\n      group.  Long- and short-term prognoses for patients suffering a transmural myocardial\n      infarction were compared for those suffering a subendocardial infarction."
