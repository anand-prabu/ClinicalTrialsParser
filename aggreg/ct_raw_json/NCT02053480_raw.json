The study will collect retrospective medical history and\n      routine clinical care data at baseline and annually for patients with PKD. Patients without\n      a genetic diagnosis will have a blood sample drawn for genetic diagnostic confirmation for\n      research purposes.  Understanding the clinical variation among participants with PKD, and\n      assessing treatments specific to PKD and their outcomes will accelerate improvement in the\n      care of patients with PKD. Understanding the natural history of PKD may be useful in the\n      design of future interventional studies. Detailed genotypic and phenotypic characterization\n      of the cohort will allow for continued in depth characterization of PKD. Finally, the PKD\n      Natural History Study will identify interested participants for future PKD studies.\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n        1. To estimate the transfusion burden in splenectomized and non-splenectomized\n           participants with PKD.\n\n        2. To establish a patient registry as a potential source for recruitment to future\n           research studies in PKD.\n\n      Secondary Objectives:\n\n        1. To determine if patient-reported outcomes, including quality of life and fatigue\n           scales, are associated with age, genotype, hemoglobin nadir, and/or transfusion burden,\n           overall and within the subgroups of splenectomized vs. non-splenectomized participants;\n\n        2. To describe changes over time in the range of hemoglobin values and markers of\n           hemolysis within individual participants and among participants with PKD;\n\n        3. To estimate the incidence of past splenectomy and annual splenectomy rate, as treatment\n           for PKD;\n\n        4. To estimate the prevalence and severity and describe the treatment of hepatic and\n           cardiac iron overload and its complications in PKD (liver, cardiac, growth defects,\n           hypogonadotropic hypogonadism, and other endocrine defects).  To describe the changes\n           in these complications that may occur over time and by age group;\n\n        5. To estimate the prevalence of co-morbidities associated with chronic hemolysis in PKD,\n           to identify which co-morbidities are the most common, and to determine if the\n           prevalence and/or severity of co-morbidities change over time and by age at the time of\n           the first appearance of the co-morbidity;\n\n        6. To determine pregnancy outcomes among participants with PKD;\n\n        7. To describe genotypic and phenotypic variation among participants and explore\n           genotype-phenotype correlation in PKD."
