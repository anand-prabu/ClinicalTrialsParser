  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and tolerability of V503 in 16- to
      26-year old men and women. The overall goal is to bridge V503 efficacy findings in young
      women to young men based on the demonstration of similar immunogenicity and safety profiles.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be administered a 3-dose regimen of V503. They will be assessed for
      immunogenicity 1 month following completion of vaccination. All participants will be
      followed for safety for a total of 12 months.
