            "textblock": "Background: In hypertension, a highly prevalent disease, up to 10-15% of hypertensive\n      patients have uncontrolled blood pressure despite a regimen of \u2265 3 drugs, which is known as\n      resistant hypertension (RH). Cardiovascular prognosis in patients with RH is worse than in\n      controlled hypertensives. Efferent renal sympathetic nerves play an important role in volume\n      homeostasis and blood pressure. A novel minimally invasive technique based on the use of\n      selective radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation has shown promising preliminary\n      results for the treatment of these patients. On the other hand, some patients with RH could\n      improve their blood pressure control by adding spironolactone, an antagonist of aldosterone\n      receptors.\n\n      Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of radiofrequency renal sympathetic denervation in\n      patients with RH, as compared with the addition of spironolactone to the therapeutic regimen\n      at baseline.\n\n      Method: interventional, prospective, randomized, open study, of a cohort of 50 patients with\n      RH, with office systolic blood pressure \u2265 150 mmHg and also with 24h systolic blood pressure\n      \u2265 140 mmHg, despite treatment with \u2265 3 drugs in adequate doses, one of them a diuretic, and\n      whitout treatment with either spironolactone or eplerenone. Patients will be randomized\n      (1:1) to renal sympathetic denervation treatment or spironolactone (50mg), performing\n      determination of office blood pressure and 24h-ABPM at pre-randomization, 1, 3 and 6 months,\n      as well as laboratory tests, echocardiography, measurement of carotid intima-media thickness\n      and central blood pressure measurement at pre-randomization and after 6 months."
