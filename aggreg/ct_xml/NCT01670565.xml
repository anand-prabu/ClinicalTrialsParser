  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 48 week, phase IIa, single center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      proof-of-concept pilot study. All participants will first be treated with mycophenolate
      mofetil (MMF, Cellcept) and titrated up to a dose of 2 grams/day. Following this period,
      half will be given either a belimumab (Benlysta®) or placebo intravenous infusion to treat
      early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis. Belimumab/MMF is expected to improve disease
      activity measured by an improvement in skin thickening and stability of pulmonary function
      test measurements when compared to patients treated with placebo/MMF.

      The specific objectives of this study are to:

        1. Determine whether belimumab used in combination with MMF is safe and tolerable in the
           treatment of patients with early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis (Disease duration
           &lt; 3 years).

        2. Determine whether belimumab used in combination with MMF is more effective in the
           treatment of diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis than MMF alone, as measured by change
           in modified Rodnan Skin Score (mRSS), forced vital capacity (FVC), hemoglobin corrected
           diffusion capacity (DLCO), Medsger Severity Scale (MSS), and by other physician and
           patient derived outcome measures.

        3. Determine the biological activity of Belimumab/MMF as assessed by effect on histology
           of skin, change in B-Cell profiles, effect on BLyS levels, and effect on serological
           and cutaneous biomarkers of disease activity.

    <description>The Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ) is a patient survey which indexes the participants degree of disability. The Short Form-36 is a questionnaire that addresses the patient's health-related quality of life.

    <description>All patients who enroll in this trial will FIRST receive mycophenolate mofetil (MMF, Cellcept), which is a drug commonly given to patients with scleroderma in clinical practice. This drug will be given at no cost to the patient. After the patient has been titrated to 2 grams of MMF per day, the patient will receive EITHER a 10 mg/kg belimumab (Benlysta) intravenous infusion OR a placebo (saline) infusion. This medication and infusion will of course be covered by the study.</description>

    <description>Belimumab (Benlysta®) decreases B-Cell survival and has been FDA approved for the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus, another rheumatic autoimmune disease. Belimumab is a recombinant, fully human monoclonal antibody; it binds to the soluble human B lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) with high affinity and inhibits its biologic activity. Prior research provides a robust rationale for the investigation of belimumab in combination with MMF (Cellcept ®) for the treatment of early diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis.</description>

          2. Disease duration of greater than 3 years.

          3. Patients with mixed connective tissue disease or &quot;overlap&quot; (i.e. those who satisfy

          4. Limited scleroderma.

          5. Systemic sclerosis-like illness associated with environmental or ingested agents such
             as toxic rapeseed oil, vinyl chloride, or bleomycin.

          6. Ongoing treatment with immunosuppressive therapies including cyclophosphamide,
             azathioprine, methotrexate, or cyclosporine, or use of those medications within 1
             month of trial entry.

          7. The use of other anti-fibrotic agents including colchicine, D-penicillamine,
             minocycline, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (nilotinib, imatinib, dasatinib), or Type 1
             oral Collagen in the month prior to enrollment.

          8. Use in the prior month of corticosteroids at doses exceeding the equivalent of
             prednisone 10 mg daily. Use of corticosteroid at &lt; 10 mg of prednisone can continue
             during the course of the study.

          9. Treatment with MMF at a dose of ≥ 2 grams daily for &gt; 3 months.

         10. Concurrent serious medical condition which in the opinion of the investigator makes
             the patient inappropriate for this study such as uncontrollable CHF, arrhythmia,
             severe pulmonary or systemic hypertension, severe GI involvement, hepatic impairment,
             serum creatinine of greater than 2.0, active infection, severe diabetes, unstable
             atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, malignancy, HIV, or severe peripheral
             vascular disease.

         11. A positive pregnancy test at entry into this study.

         12. Men and women with reproductive potential will be required to use effective means of
             contraception through the course of the study, such as a tubal ligation or
             hysterectomy, condom or diaphragm used with a spermicide,or an intrauterine device
             (IUD). Approved hormonal contraceptives (such as birth control pills, patches,
             implants or injections) may interact with and reduce the effectiveness of MMF and
             thus, are not acceptable. Contraceptive measures such as Plan B (TM), sold for
             emergency use after unprotected sex, are not acceptable methods for routine use.

         13. Breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is contraindicated with the use of MMF.

             investigational drug within ninety days of entry into this study.

         15. The presence of severe lung disease as defined by a diffusion capacity of less than
             30% of predicted or requiring supplemental oxygen.

         16. History of HIV infection

         17. Known active bacterial, viral, fungal, mycobacterial, or other infection r any major
             episode of infection requiring hospitalization or treatment with IV antibiotics
             within 4 weeks of screening, or oral antibiotics within 2 weeks prior to screening

         18. Any other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that
             contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that may affect the
             interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from treatment
             complications

         19. Prior use of Belimumab, Rituximab, or other B-Cell depleting therapies ever

         20. The use of other biologics including TNF inhibitors, abatacept, or tocilizumab within
             1 month of enrollment [this is a safety issue]

         21. Patients with a history of severe depression, psychosis, or suicidal ideation will be
             excluded.
