    <time_frame>Screening, Day 1, Day 28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The UHDRS is a clinical rating scale which has been developed by the Huntington Disease Study Group (HSG) to provide a uniform assessment of the clinical features and course of HD. the Total Motor Score (TMS) is one of the six sub components of UHDRS.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Day28 in fMRI parameter estimates and percent signal change  during Monetary Incentive Delay</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The monetary incentive delay (MID) task is established as a reliable method to elicit ventral striatal activity in relation to reward/punishment anticipation and tracked with dysfunctionalities across a range of conditions in which incentive motivation is thought to be abnormal (schizophrenia, depression, substance abuse, and pathological gambling). Pharmacological intervention has demonstrated reversal of observed deficit.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline to Day28 in Grip Strength Incentive Motivation task score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline predose, Baseline postdose, Day28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This incentive force task was developed to independently dissociate the degree to which a subject responds to reward motivation versus emotional motivation, as well as a subject's perception of difficulty level in performing a given task.</description>
