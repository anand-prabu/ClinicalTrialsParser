This study hopes to understand RA flare\n      after total joint replacement surgery and what the result of flaring is for patients over\n      the next year. We will ask patients about their RA, whether it has gotten worse, and whether\n      they are able to work with the physical therapist. During the course of this study, we'll be\n      collecting questionnaires, and we'll be drawing blood to better understand what's going on\n      with RA and with a patient's recuperation from their joint replacement.\n\n      We want to understand whether a flare of RA might affect the outcome of a patient's joint\n      replacement.  We believe this study might show us how to better manage patients with\n      rheumatoid arthritis following a joint replacement.  If RA patients who flare are unable to\n      participate in physical therapy and do worse after one year after a total hip replacement,\n      more effective treatment could be developed. The study will also help us to identify early\n      factors that may influence long-term outcomes of joint replacements in RA patients."

            "textblock": "The condition to be studied is worsening (flare) of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in patients\n      who have undergone arthroplasty.  RA patients undergoing arthroplasty most often have\n      severe, erosive disease. If the rate of flare approaches the estimated 26% rate suggested in\n      a previous study for RA patients after arthroplasty (Johnson ACR 2011), this could be of\n      significance in regards to their long term arthroplasty and disease outcomes.  Patients who\n      flare may not be able to participate in the post-operative rehabilitation thought necessary\n      for optimal arthroplasty outcomes, and it may be difficult for patients who flare after\n      discontinuing immunosuppressant medications for surgery to regain remission or low disease\n      activity.  Detailed clinical data collected longitudinally from RA patients with severe\n      erosive disease undergoing arthroplasty in conjunction with further characterization of the\n      molecular profile of blood and operative tissue could provide valuable information to inform\n      best practices for this patient group."
