    <description>The Grief Recovery Method is a structured process designed to help people with spinal cord injuries examine their knowledge of their injury, their emotional reaction to their injury, and their ability to acknowledge their grief over the injury in order to learn techniques to resolve the grief in order to achieve a more complete recovery. Participants will attend a total of 18 sessions, some one-on-one, and some in a group setting. The Grief Recovery Handbook, handouts, DVD (digital video disc) presentations and questionnaires will be used. Targeted activities to decrease isolation and assist volunteers to identify goals for recovery will be utilized.</description>
