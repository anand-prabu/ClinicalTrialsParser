  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will investigate the efficacy and safety of using tranexamic acid by intravenous,
      intra-articular and combinational administration to reduce blood loss during total knee
      replacement. We hypothesize a combined intra-articular and single intravenous dose protocol
      of tranexamic acid may achieve a higher therapeutic concentration at the intra-articular and
      extra-articular bleeding site with little or no systemic absorption and subsequent systemic
      side effects.

      A randomized, double-blind, single-center, controlled and parallel-assigned study comparing
      the efficacy and safety of intravenous, intra-articular and combinational administration of
      tranexamic acid to reduce blood loss during total knee replacement. Subjects will be
      monitored for occurrence of any complications, particularly deep venous thrombosis and
      thromboembolism during the hospital stay and for 3 months postoperatively.
