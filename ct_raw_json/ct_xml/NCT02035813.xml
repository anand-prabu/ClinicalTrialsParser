  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have indicated that determining prevalence and number of circulating tumor
      cells (CTCs) at various time points during treatment may be an effective tool for assessing
      treatment efficacy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC). However, even if the prognostic value
      of CTCs in MBC is well understood, the role of both CTC prevalence and CTC phenotype in
      predicting treatment response needs further investigation. DETECT IV is a prospective,
      multicenter, open-label, single arm phase II study aimed at postmenopausal patients with
      hormone-receptor positive, HER2-negative MBC and exclusively HER2-negative CTCs. The primary
      objective of the trial is to estimate the clinical efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus
      in combination with endocrine therapy as assessed by progression-free survival (PFS).
      Additional research on CTC dynamics and characteristics will provide a better understanding
      of the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs and is one step into a more personalized
      therapy for MBC.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: 1. Metastatic breast cancer (MBC), which cannot be cured by surgery or
        radiotherapy. The primary tumor and/or biopsies must have been confirmed as cancer by
        histopathology.

        2. HER2 status (as investigated on all primary tumor tissue and/or biopsies from
        metastatic sites or loco regional recurrences) must be negative. HER2-negativity is
        defined as (i.e.: immunohistochemistry (IHC) score 0-1+ or 2+ and fluorescent in situ
        hybridization (FISH) negative or just FISH negative, whichever was performed) in all
        tissue samples.

        3. Indication for an endocrine therapy. (Histological confirmation of estrogen receptor
        positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor positive (PgR+) breast cancer) 4. Any
        endocrine therapy in the history is allowed. 5. Disease progression following prior
        treatment with endocrine therapy (endocrine therapy does not have to be the last therapy
        before inclusion in the trial) 6. Evidence of CTCs. At least one CTC has been detected in
        7.5 ml patient blood by means of the CellSearch® Circulating Tumor Cell Kit (Veridex LLC,
        Raritan, USA).

        7. HER2 negativity of all detected CTCs. HER2-negativity is defined as staining &lt; HER2 3+.

        8. Up to two lines of previous cytostatic treatment for MBC. 9. Adequate organ function
        within 7 days before date of recruitment, evidenced by the following laboratory results: -
        absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500/μL, - platelet count ≥ 100000/μL, - hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL,
        - ALT (SGPT)/AST (SGOT) ≤ 3.0 × ULN, - bilirubin ≤ 2.0 × ULN - creatinine ≤ 2.0 × ULN -
        serum cholesterol ≤ 2.0 × ULN 10. Postmenopausal women. The investigator must confirm
        postmenopausal status. Postmenopausal status is defined either by - Age ≥ 55 years and one
        year or more of amenorrhea - Age &lt; 55 years and one year or more of amenorrhea and
        postmenopausal levels of FSH and LH - Prior hysterectomy and has postmenopausal levels of
        FSH and LH - Surgical menopause with bilateral oophorectomy 11. Written informed consent
        in study participation. 12. Undergoing a re-biopsy prior if tissue is accessible, which
        can be safely biopsied, is optional but desirable.

        13. Tumor evaluation has been performed within 6 weeks before date of recruitment and
        results are available.

        14. Patients must have at least one not previously irradiated lesion that can be evaluated
        according to RECIST version 1.1 (Eisenhauer 2009). Patients with measurable and
        non-measurable disease are eligible. Presence of clinically and/or radiologically
        documented disease.

        15. Age ≥ 18 years. 16. ECOG Performance Status ≤ 2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other mTOR inhibitors or to any of the other
             given drugs.

          2. Indication for treatment with chemotherapy.

          3. Disease or condition, which might restrain the ability to take or resorb oral
             medication. This includes malabsorption syndrome, requirement for intravenous (IV)
             alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption (for example resection
             of small bowel or stomach), uncontrolled inflammatory GI disease (e.g., Crohn's
             disease, ulcerative colitis) and any other diseases significantly affecting
             gastrointestinal function as well as inability to swallow and retain oral medication
             for any other reason.

          4. Treatment with other investigational agents of any type or anticancer therapy during
             the trial, within 2 weeks prior to the start of treatment.

          5. Known HIV infection.

          6. Current active hepatitis B or C, known liver dysfunction according to Child Pugh
             Classification class B and C or biliary disease (with exception of patients with
             Gilbert's syndrome, asymptomatic gall-stones, liver metastases or stable chronic
             non-viral liver disease per investigator assessment).

          7. Concurrent disease or condition that might interfere with adequate assessment or
             evaluation of study data, or any medical disorder that would make the patient's
             participation unreasonably hazardous.

             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent or which might interfere
             with the patient's adherence to the protocol.

         10. Life expectancy &lt; 3 months.
