Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone and carfilzomib, work in\n      different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. A virus called wild-type reovirus may be able to kill cancer\n      cells without damaging normal cells and seems to work best when given with chemotherapy.\n      Giving wild-type reovirus with chemotherapy may be a more active treatment than chemotherapy\n      alone."

Obtain evidence of reovirus protein production by immunohistochemical localization of\n      reoviral capsid protein in myeloma cells from bone marrow biopsies obtained on cycle 1 day\n      9.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.

Obtain pilot overall and progression free survival data for all treated patients.\n\n      III. Assess cytokine arrays of peripheral blood obtained on days 1, 2 and 9 to obtain\n      exploratory data regarding inflammatory cytokine concentrations and their correlation with\n      response.\n\n      IV. Cryopreserve marrow aspirates obtained cycle 1 day 1 and all subsequent marrow aspirates\n      while on trial for future studies of genetic and epigenetic changes focused in part on\n      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, autophagy and reovirus resistance studies.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV), carfilzomib IV over 10 minutes, and\n      wild-type reovirus IV over 60 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16.
