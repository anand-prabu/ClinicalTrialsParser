Giving\n      chemotherapy before a donor hematopoietic transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.\n      It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the\n      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's\n      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not\n      yet known whether giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan or busulfan and\n      fludarabine phosphate before a donor stem cell transplant is more effective in treating\n      juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia."

To compare - in a randomized fashion - the day 100 treatment related mortality (TRM)\n      incidence for two myeloablative conditioning regimens, busulfan-fludarabine (fludarabine\n      phosphate) (BU-FLU) and busulfan-cyclophosphamide-melphalan (BU-CY-MEL), prior to\n      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia\n      (JMML), in order to determine the preferred regimen for future trials.\n\n      II. To compare - in a randomized fashion - the 18-month event-free survival (EFS) following\n      two different myeloablative conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL) prior to HCT for\n      children with JMML, in order to determine the preferred regimen for future trials.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the 18-month relapse incidence (RI) following two different myeloablative\n      conditioning regimens busulfan-fludarabine phosphate(BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL) prior to HCT for\n      children with JMML.\n\n      II.

To determine the rates of severe toxicities (grade 3/4) at day 100 post-HCT between the\n      two myeloablative conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL).\n\n      II. To determine the rates of acute and chronic (at 18 months post-HCT) graft-versus-host\n      disease (GVHD) following HCT using two different conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs.\n      BU-CY-MEL) in children with JMML.\n\n      III. To create a JMML-specific pre-HCT index to allow better risk-stratification of future\n      patients.\n\n      IV. To determine the feasibility of assessing post-transplant disease burden by donor\n      chimerism measurements and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in mononuclear\n      and sorted cell subsets.\n\n      V. To validate gene expression and methylation classifiers predictive of relapse in patients\n      with JMML.\n\n      VI.
