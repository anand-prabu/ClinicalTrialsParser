    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies potential genetic markers which might be used to predict
      which patients with acute myeloid leukemia or myelodysplastic syndromes respond to
      decitabine. This study will contribute to the efforts to find effective and less toxic
      therapies to provide durable remissions in a significant proportion of elderly AML patients.
