Preliminary studies about effects of colostrum\n      supplementation show its potential for increasing human exercise performance; however, more\n      evidence across the lifespan is required to confirm effects and to understand mechanisms of\n      action. The objectives are to determine the effect of 8 weeks of bovine colostrum\n      supplementation, compared to whey protein supplementation on the following dependent\n      variables in men and women 50 years and older while participating in a resistance-training\n      program:\n\n        -  muscle mass\n\n        -  strength\n\n        -  blood levels of growth factors and markers of inflammation\n\n        -  urine levels of muscle and bone catabolic markers\n\n        -  tests of cognitive ability It is hypothesized that bovine colostrum supplementation\n           will result in greater increases in muscle mass, strength, blood IGF-1 levels (an\n           anabolic hormone), and cognitive ability, and greater reductions in inflammation, and\n           markers of muscle and bone catabolism, compared to placebo."
