            "textblock": "The ELIOT trial is a prospective single center randomised phase III trial which compared\n      intraoperative radiotherapy with electrons to the tumor bed  with conventional scheme of\n      whole breast external beam radiotherapy. Patients were randomly  allocated to intraoperative\n       radiotherapy group  or external radiotherapy group  in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n      The rationale for providing partial breast irradiation to the tumor bed lies on the patterns\n      of ipsilateral breast tumor relapse reported in  Literature. In fact, the majority of\n      recurrences occur close to the tumor bed. Several randomized trials of breast conserving\n      surgery with or without whole breast radiotherapy showed that  in 75-90% of cases\n      recurrences were  at the site of original primary tumor. In this context, limiting\n      irradiation to the tumor bed may result in a similar local control as whole breast\n      irradiation, provided that patients are properly selected.\n\n      The intraoperative treatment was delivered with a mobile miniaturized  accelerator, located\n      in the operating room, while for external radiotherapy a 6 MV linear accelerator was used.\n      The surgical technique to perform ELIOT has been standardized in every step. The breast\n      gland is prepared by separating it from the subcutaneous tissue and the underlying\n      pectoralis muscle  and by restoring the continuity of the surgical breach after having\n      protected the thoracic wall by lead and aluminium disks to optimize the delivered dose. The\n      linear accelerator delivers electrons at variable energy, ranging from 3 to 9 MeV: the\n      proper  electron energy is chosen according to the target thickness. Collimation is achieved\n      by hard-docking system, consisting of 5 mm thick high- quality polymethyl methacrylate round\n      applicators of 4 to 10 -cm diameter.\n\n      For radiation protection a primary beam stopper  and mobile 1.5 cm thick lead shields are\n      provided. The prescribed dose was 21 Gy  at the 90% isodose. After delivery of the radiation\n      dose, the applicator and the disk were removed and the gland is reconstructed again.\n\n      In the conventional arm of the study, the external beam radiotherapy is given after the full\n      recovery from the surgical excision. All patients undergo virtual simulation including a\n      treatment-planning CT scan. The clinical target volume is defined to extend to 5 mm below\n      the skin surface and include breast parenchyma down to the deep fascia, but not including\n      the underlying muscle and rib cage. The irradiated volume should extend medially to the\n      midline, laterally to the mid axillary line and inferiorly to 1-2 cm below the level of\n      intra-mammary fold and  superiorly to the suprasternal notch. Using BEV, the blocks are used\n      to shield as much heart and lung  as possible without compromising the PTV.\n\n      Treatment is delivered by a pair of tangential fields  with wedges as necessary.  The\n      prescribed dose  to the whole-breast was 50 Gy delivered in 2 Gy fraction over 5 weeks with\n      a 6 -megavolt linear accelerator followed by a sequential boost of 10 Gy to the tumor bed\n      with electrons. A PTV dose homogeneity of -5% + 7% as recommended by ICRU (International\n      Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements) report no 50.\n\n      Patients were followed up with at least 6-month clinical examination up to 5 years and then\n      every 8 months thereafter.  Annual mammogram was performed ."
