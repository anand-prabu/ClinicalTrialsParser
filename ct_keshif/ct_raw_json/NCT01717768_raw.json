The medical name for low testosterone is hypogonadism.\n      Hypogonadism can be caused by many factors. Symptoms include: decrease in libido, lack of\n      energy and mood swings. The goal of testosterone replacement therapy is to return\n      testosterone levels to the normal range and relieve symptoms.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ability of TSX-002, which is testosterone\n      provided in easy to swallow capsules, to maintain serum (blood) testosterone levels within\n      the normal range in hypogonadal men. This will be determined by blood sampling at specified\n      times during the study. The study is also intended to evaluate the tolerability of TSX-002,\n      which will be taken orally twice per day for 15 days."
