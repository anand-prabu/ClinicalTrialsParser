Calcium and magnesium infusions were shown to decreased the incidence\n      and intensity of neuropathy symptoms related to oxaliplatin.\n\n      There are currently no effective drugs or treatment modalities for the prevention or\n      treatment of taxane related neuropathy. Given the morbidity of taxane induced neuropathy and\n      the safety of Ca/Mg infusion, it is reasonable to assess the feasibility of this\n      intervention in woman with stage I-III breast cancer receiving adjuvant or neo-adjuvant\n      paclitaxel treatment, either given every 2 weeks for 4 cycles or every week for 12 weeks.\n      Calcium gluconate and magnesium sulfate, 1 g of each agent in 100 ml D5W will be infused\n      over 30 minutes, immediately before and after each dose of paclitaxel.  The Ca/Mg infusion\n      will be given through the same line used for giving chemotherapy.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to assess paclitaxel-related neuropathy (grade 2 or\n      greater) as measured by NCI Common Terminology Criteria Version 3 in patients receiving\n      Ca/Mg infusion during paclitaxel chemotherapy and compare it with historical controls.\n      Secondary endpoints will include other measures of neuropathy and quality of life such as\n      the FACT-Tax score, taxane-related neuropathy pain as measured by the Brief Pain\n      Inventory-Short Form (BPI-SF), and measure of cognitive impairment using FACT-cog score."
