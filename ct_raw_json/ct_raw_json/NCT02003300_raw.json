The method has already been successfully tested in the laboratory under controlled\n      conditions. In the patient group chosen, oxygen uptake is simultaneously calculated, for\n      comparison purposes, from monitoring measurements made routinely as part of normal patient\n      care in these cases, using a pulmonary artery catheter - an invasive technique from which\n      severe complications occasionally arise, including death.\n\n      A secondary aim is to elucidate the time course of uptake of the anaesthetic vapor,\n      isoflurane, during this kind of surgery."

Oxygen and anaesthetic agent uptakes are then\n      automatically determined by a computer directly linked to a rapid gas analyzer, every 15\n      seconds.\n\n      As a control, oxygen is calculated using the reverse Fick method. Measured arterial and\n      mixed venous oxygen saturations were used to do this, and the cardiac output which was\n      determined by thermodilution."
