  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether remifentanil influence the pharyngeal phase
      of swallowing using using pressure and impedance recordings. The purpose is also to compare
      remifentanil to morphine and younger to elderly volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Remifentanil and other opioids are widely used as anesthetic sedation during minor surgical
      procedures and as pain relief in postoperative patients when the patient is spontaneously
      breathing and the airway is not secured by endotracheal intubation. In a previous study (not
      yet published) we showed that remifentanil induce pulmonary aspiration in healthy volunteers
      and the aim of this study is to objectively determine weather remifentanil infusion in
      healthy volunteers influence the pharyngeal phase of swallowing. The purpose is also compare
      the effect of remifentanil to morphine and younger volunteers to elderly volunteers.  To
      assess this question we are going to study 24 volunteers, 12 younger and 12 elderly,  who
      are randomised to receive remifentanil infusion with target concentration 3 ng/ml during 30
      minutes at one occasion and an injection of morphine (younger: 0.1 mg/kg, elderly 0.07
      mg/kg) at the other. The volunteers are asked to swallow  10 ml normal saline several times
      both before and after opioid administration and pharyngeal motility is parallelly recorded
      using combined manometry and impedance catheter placed transnasally into to the
      pharyngo-esophageal segment. Any subjective swallowing difficulties are also recorded.
