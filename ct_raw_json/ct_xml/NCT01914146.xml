  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, the investigators examine in older adults with Type 2 diabetes the
      impact of beginning insulin therapy on the orthostatic drop in blood pressure as well as the
      response of arterial blood pressure and Doppler measures of cerebral blood flow during
      upright tilt.  The investigators hypothesize that in older adults with Type 2 diabetes, the
      cardiovascular effects of insulin would precipitate or worsen orthostatic intolerance not
      present at baseline.

      Before and 2 weeks after the start of standard insulin therapy several tests will be done:

        -  orthostatic hypotension will be tested for with 3 orthostatic maneuvers

        -  vasovagal syncope will be tested with 2 tilt table tests, one augmented with 400ug of
           nitroglycerin

        -  MCA velocity will be measured with a transcranial doppler

        -  Heart Rate and Blood Pressure will be measured throughout the test with a Finometer and
           Power Lab on a beat to beat basis

    <measure>1. The nadir of middle cerebral artery (MCA) velocity</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>

    <description>lowest middle cerebral artery flow velocity determined by transcranial Doppler</description>

    <measure>2. The presence or absence of a positive augmented tilt table test</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The augmented tilt table test will occur after receiving 300 μg nitroglycerin (GTN), and is a recognized method of testing for risk of vasovagal syncope. The tilt table will be considered positive and aborted prior to the 20 minutes if the subjects have a syncopal spell or demonstrate presyncopal (lightheadedness) symptoms in association with a 30 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure.</description>

    <time_frame>1 day</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>lowest systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure during tilt table tests and when they occur.</description>
