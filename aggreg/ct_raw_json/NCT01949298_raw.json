This delay in loading of implants can be handicapping for the patient,\n      esthetically and functionally. Hence this project was undertaken with the purpose of\n      reducing this wait period and achieving early rehabilitation in these patients. The aim of\n      the project is to compare immediate loading versus delayed loading of implant supported\n      mandibular dentures."
