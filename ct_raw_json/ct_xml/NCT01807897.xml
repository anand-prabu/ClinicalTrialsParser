  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three treatment modalities for central, or mixed
      obstructive and central, sleep apnea in patients with chronic heart failure and reduced
      ejection fraction.  The modalities to be tested are nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO),
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV).  The main
      outcome measures will be left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiogram and peak
      oxygen consumption on cardiopulmonary exercise testing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic heart failure (HF) is a highly prevalent disease, with a lifetime risk of
      approximately 20%.  Sleep apnea is a common co-morbid condition, occurring in approximately
      half of patients with chronic HF, and often has predominantly central or mixed obstructive
      and central characteristics.  Although it is associated with increased mortality in patients
      with HF, sleep apnea is usually asymptomatic and patients are therefore often unwilling to
      accept standard therapy with positive airway pressure.  There are three treatment modalities
      currently recommended by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine for the treatment of
      predominantly central sleep apnea in HF patients: nocturnal supplemental oxygen (NSO),
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV).  There are
      only limited data on the comparative efficacy and tolerability of these three modalities.
      The present study is designed to compare these modalities with respect to effects on
      ventricular function, exercise capacity, and other measures of cardiovascular risk.

    <description>Treadmill exercise testing will be performed using a motor-driven treadmill and a modified Naughton protocol, with a lightweight disposable pneumotach device positioned in the participant's mouth interfaced with a metabolic cart.  VO2 peak will be the co-primary outcome of the study.  Secondary outcome measures from cardiopulmonary exercise testing include VO2 at anaerobic threshold and VE/VCO2 slope.</description>

    <description>24-hour blood pressure will be measured using a blood pressure cuff that is connected by rubber tubing to a small pressure monitoring device, programmed to measure BP at 20 minute intervals during the day and 30 minute intervals at night (11 PM to 7 AM) for a period of 24 hours.   We will assess 24-hour mean arterial pressure as the primary blood pressure outcome, with additional assessment of nocturnal versus diurnal blood pressure effects.</description>
