  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim for the study is to determine whether transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) enhances training gains on cognitive training (CT) tasks. Secondary aims
      are to determine whether tDCS combined with CT causes larger transferable improvements on
      non-trained tasks (i.e., generalisation effects) and whether these generalisation effects
      are maintained over time (i.e., maintenance effects).

      Specific hypotheses are:

        1. CT combined with active tDCS will produce greater training gains on CT tasks compared
           to a similar control group receiving CT with sham tDCS.

        2. CT combined with active tDCS will produce greater generalisation effects on non-trained
           cognitive tasks compared to CT with sham tDCS.

        3. The cognitive improvements gained by patients from both interventions will be
           maintained over 1 month follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects are 18 years of age or above.

          2. Subjects meet criteria for a DSM -IV schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder but
             with a stable mental status as demonstrated by a stable Positive and Negative Symptom
             Score (PANSS) score over a period of 2 weeks.

          3. Subjects have had no medication changes in the 2 weeks prior to obtaining informed
             consent.

          4. Subjects are right-handed.

          5. Subjects able to give informed consent for the trial.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Drug or alcohol abuse or dependence (preceding 3 months).

          2. Concurrent anticonvulsant or long acting benzodiazepine medication, as these
             medications may interfere with the effects of tDCS.

          3. Subject requires a rapid clinical response due to inanition, psychosis or high
             suicide risk.

          4. Clinically defined neurological disorder or insult, including history of seizures,
             cerebral aneurysm or trauma, significant head trauma with loss of consciousness for â‰¥
             30 minutes.

          5. Subject has metal in the cranium, skull defects, or skin lesions on scalp at proposed
             electrode sites.

          6. Female subject of child bearing age, sexually active and not using reliable
             contraception
