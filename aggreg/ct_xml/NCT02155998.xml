      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in
      representative medical institutions in order to get the information on administration of
      postoperative and post-radiation adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (including &quot;go&quot; / &quot;no
      go&quot; decision, regimens, dosages and duration) used in locally advanced prostate cancer
      patients with high and very high risk of recurrence  in Russia.

      This is a multicentre, non-interventional, prospective study to be carried out in
      representative medical institutions in order to get the information on administration of
      postoperative and post-radiation adjuvant androgen deprivation therapy (including &quot;go&quot; / &quot;no
      go&quot; decision, regimens, dosages and duration) used in locally advanced prostate cancer
      patients with high and very high risk of recurrence  in Russia.

      No additional procedures besides those already used in the routine clinical practice will be
      applied to the patients. Treatment assignment will be done according to the current
      practice.

      It is planned to enrol 200 subjects in up to 30 sites in Russian Federation. The average
      number of patients per site is planned as 6 - 10; there are no restrictions on minimum and
      maximum number of subjects per site in this study.

             properly signed by both the subject and the investigator.

          2. Locally advanced stage of PCa  (stage T3-T4, Nx-N0, M0: prostate adenocarcinoma with
             extracapsular invasion (T3a) or invasion to the seminal vesicles (T3b), invasion to
             adjacent structures (T4) but without lymphatic invasion (N0) nor metastasis (M0))

          3. Prostatectomy or radiotherapy completed within 3 months prior to the study enrolment

          4. High (T3a or Gleason score = 8-10 or PCA &gt;20 ng/ml) and very high (T3b-T4) risk of

          5. Hystologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients participating in clinical trials

          2. Any medical condition which on the opinion of the investigator may interfere with the
             patient's participation in the study, e.g. severe non-malignant concomitant disease
             which can affect life expectancy

          3. Evidence of metastatic disease on imaging studies
