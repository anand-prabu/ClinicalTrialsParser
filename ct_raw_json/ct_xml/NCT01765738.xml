  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine whether antibiotic impregnated PICC catheters have a lower infection rate than
      a conventional PICC catheter in a tertiary care patient population.  Secondary goals will be
      to determine if there is a difference between the two catheters with early and late
      infections, to determine the cost comparison including extra cost of treatment for a line
      related infection, to determine if there are any non-infectious related complication
      differences between the two catheters.

      All patients who are referred to VIR for a PICC line will be evaluated to see if they
      satisfy the inclusion/exclusion criteria.  The study will be discussed with those who do and
      informed consent will be obtained from those wishing to participate.  The patient will then
      be randomized to one of two types of PICC lines.  All lines will be placed by identical
      technique.  This will include sterile technique, placement via a vein of the upper arm using
      ultrasound guidance, and positioning of the catheter tip under fluoroscopic guidance.  A
      database of all catheters placed will be kept. Records will be reviewed at 1 week, 30 days,
      and 60 days by the Interventional Radiology Fellow.Review will include length of time
      catheter was in place, whether treatment was completed, whether catheter was removed
      prematurely, the clinical reason for removal, results of other imaging tests, and results of
      cultures on any catheters removed for suspicion of infection.  Any non-infectious
      complications related to the catheter will also be noted. The reviewer will be blinded to
      which catheter was used during the procedure.
