                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Male and female veterans.\n\n          2. Ages 18 to 65 (inclusive).\n\n          3. TBI: a history of mild traumatic brain injury, as defined by American Congress of\n             Rehabilitation Medicine (ACRM) and VA, in the chronic, stable phase of recovery (>6\n             months from injury).  The ACRM defines mild TBI as a traumatically-induced\n             physiological disruption of brain function as demonstrated by at least one of the\n             following:\n\n        3.a. loss of consciousness of up to 30 minutes;\n\n        3.b. any loss of memory for events immediately before or after the event;\n\n        3.c. any alteration in mental state at the time of the event, for example feeling dazed,\n        disoriented, or confused; and\n\n        3.d. a focal neurological deficit or deficits that may or may not have been transient, for\n        example loss of coordination, speech difficulties, or double vision.  ACRM's definition\n        further specifies that a person may be designated as having a mild TBI only if the\n        severity of the injury does not include a loss of consciousness that lasted longer than 30\n        minutes, and post-traumatic amnesia lasting longer than 24 hours.\n\n        Rationale:\n\n          1. This is the most common description of patients currently served by our VA\n             facilities.\n\n          2. Studies at this stable phase will facilitate detection of otherwise subtle changes as\n             findings are less likely to be confounded by 'spontaneous' recovery.\n\n        4. Current (past month) hazardous alcohol use or harmful alcohol use.\n\n        4.a. Hazardous use is drinking that must meet criteria for \"at-risk\" or \"heavy\" drinking\n        by National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  (NIAAA) criteria: Subjects must\n        report current (past 30 day) \"at-risk\" or \"heavy\" drinking on an average weekly basis,\n        consisting of an average of 15 or more standard drinks per week for men and 8 or more\n        standard drinks per week for women during the 30 days prior to Screening Visit 1 as\n        measured by the Alcohol Timeline Followback (TLFB) method.\n\n        4.b. Harmful use is drinking behavior that meets Diagnostic and Statistical Manual\n        (DSM)-IV diagnostic criteria for an Alcohol Use Disorder (Alcohol Dependence or Alcohol\n        Abuse).\n\n        5. Subjects must express a desire to reduce or stop alcohol use.\n\n        6. Female subjects must have a negative urine pregnancy test and must be either\n        postmenopausal for at least 1 year or practicing an effective method of birth control\n        (e.g., surgically sterile, spermicide with barrier, male partner sterilization; or absent\n        and agrees to continue abstinence or to use an acceptable method of contraception, as\n        listed above, should sexual activity commence).\n\n        7. Subjects must have a Breath Alcohol Concentration (BAC) of less than 0.02% when signing\n        the informed consent form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Psychotic disorders, bipolar disorders, dementia, or other psychiatric disorders\n             judged to be unstable.\n\n          2. Subjects known to have clinically significant unstable medical conditions, including\n             but not limited to: Clinically significant renal disease and/or impaired renal\n             function as defined by clinically significant elevation of blood urea nitrogen (BUN)\n             or creatinine or an estimated creatinine clearance of < 60 mL/min; AST and/or ALT > 5\n             times the upper limit of the normal range and/or a serum bilirubin > 2 times the\n             upper limit of normal.\n\n          3. History of glaucoma.\n\n          4. History of kidney stones.\n\n          5. Concurrent participation in another alcohol treatment study or any study involving\n             medications.\n\n          6. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          7. Topiramate use in the past week prior to study entry.\n\n          8. Use of medications for alcohol dependence (disulfiram, naltrexone, or acamprosate)\n             within the past week.\n\n          9. Needing acute medical detoxification from alcohol based on a score of 12 or more on\n             the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment of Alcohol Scale (CIWA-AD).\n\n         10. Subjects who are legally mandated to participate in an alcohol treatment program.\n\n         11. Subjects who have had a suicide attempt in the past 6 months or suicidal ideation,\n             with intent, in the 30 days prior to enrollment.\n\n         12. Subjects who have previously been treated with topiramate for any reason and\n             discontinued treatment due to an adverse event or due to a hypersensitivity reaction\n             to topiramate.\n\n         13. Subjects with seizure disorders.\n\n         14. Subjects currently being treated with another anticonvulsant.\n\n         15. Subjects who in the opinion of the investigator should not be enrolled in the study\n             because of the precautions, warnings or contraindications outlined in the topiramate\n             package insert."
