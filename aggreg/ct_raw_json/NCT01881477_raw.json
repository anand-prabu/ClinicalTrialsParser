This perpetuates the stays in\n      hospital and intensive care units (ICU). To combat this, there physiotherapy intervention\n      methods that can reverse or reduce their occurrence.\n\n      OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this research is to determine the effects of passive movements,\n      assisted active and resisted, and changes of position on grip strength, joint mobility and\n      functional capacity in patients in ICU.\n\n      METHODS: A quasi-experimental intervention, before and after, no control group, in which 40\n      patients in an adult ICU in Medellin, receive physiotherapy care. Electrogoniometry,\n      dynamometry and functional independence measure, will be made before the intervention and\n      serial assessments every four days, until discharge from ICU."

The\n      recruitment of patients was very limited due to the complexity of their health condition.

The range of\n      motion were measured using the electronic goniometer Biometrics \u00ae.

Dynamometry was applied during the initial evaluation or after\n      the patient's consciousness allowed, bilaterally, choosing the best score of three. The FIM,\n      was filled out at the foot of the patient bed, by the evaluators. Were followed for clinical\n      outcome in four days of starting treatment, and dynamometry applied only if the state of\n      consciousness allowed. Evaluations were completed once the patient was transferred to the\n      Special Care Unit (SCU)."
