  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a complication of percutaneous coronary angiography
      that occurs in about 10 to 20% of patients exposed to contrast media. Iodinated contrast is
      used during coronary angiography to see the coronary arteries. It has been shown that
      exposure to this agent may cause kidney injury. CIN usually goes away on its own but in some
      high risk patients it progresses into renal failure.

      This research study offers a new possible option to prevent CIN. We propose that if
      intravenous nitroglycerin is given before the procedure it may lower the chances of
      developing contrast-induced nephropathy.

      The Contrast Nephropathy and Nitrates trial (CoNaN) is a single center, randomized, 1 x 1
      factorial clinical trial designed to test the effects of intravenous nitroglycerin infusion
      in renal function given prior to PCI.

      Specific aims for this trial include:

        -  To determine whether the intravenous nitrates have any effect on the glomerular
           filtration rate (GFR) after the exposure to contrast media.

        -  To determine if intravenous nitroglycerin will decrease the incidence of contrast
           induced Nephropathy.

           400 patients with a Mehran score of &gt; 6 and a pre-procedural creatinine measurement
           will be enrolled. Following baseline assessments, patients will be randomly assigned to
           receive intravenous infusion nitroglycerine plus intravenous normal saline or normal
           saline only. Subjects will participate in this study from the time they sign consent
           (prior to angiographic procedure), until 48-72 hours post procedure.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this trial will be to determine the change in glomerular filtration rate after exposure to contrast media.  We will compare the change in GFR before and after PCI of the group that received intravenous nitroglycerin with the change in GFR before and after PCI of the group that did not receive intravenous nitroglycerin.</description>
