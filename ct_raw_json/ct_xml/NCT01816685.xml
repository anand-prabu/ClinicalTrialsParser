  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a medical condition known as obstructive sleep apnea may be at increased risk
      of delirium following surgery.  This study loans autotitrating CPAP machines to
      randomly-selected patients who are at high-risk for obstructive sleep apnea with the goal of
      preventing post-operative delirium.
