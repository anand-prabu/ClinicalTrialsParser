    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether the use of Seprafilm reduces the
      incidence rate of adhesion formation following a primary C-section.

      A secondary objective of the study will be to determine whether or not a correlation between
      the adhesion score and the difficulty or delay in delivery of the infant exists.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A cesarean section or delivery (C-section/CD) is the surgical removal of an infant and
      placenta through the mother's abdominal and uterine wall. This procedure is performed by an
      obstetrician and is one of the most common types of surgical methods used today. According
      to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the rate for this method of delivery has
      risen over the past decade. However, recent research has shown that patients who receive
      this surgical procedure become more susceptible to adhesions.

      Adhesions are formations (bands) of scar tissue that occur immediately following most
      surgical procedures.  Adhesions limit the mobility of tissues and organs near the incision
      site by causing them to stick together.  This limited mobility can generate an increased
      rate of morbidity (occurrence of other diseases). Morbidities caused by adhesions include
      but are not limited to abdominal and/or pelvic pain, bowel obstruction (partial or complete
      blockage of the bowel), subfertility (difficulty getting pregnant) and infertility
      (inability to get pregnant).

      A study conducted by Dierdre Lyell, MD reported that the incidence of adhesion formation
      following a primary CD ranges from 46-65%. Another study (Morales et al) reported that for
      women who had undergone a CD, the incidence rate of adhesions and severe adhesions was
      greater in women who had had repeat CDs compared with women who only had a primary CD. In
      addition, this study also states that the percentage of adhesion occurrence increases in
      women with each subsequent (following) CD.

      Numerous methods have been implemented toward the preventions of adhesions.  Currently,
      Seprafilm is an approved adhesion prevention method that is used in most surgical
      procedures. Seprafilm is a clear film that is composed of chemically modified sugars (some
      of which occur naturally in the human body). Unlike its counterpart Interceed, Seprafilm is
      unaffected by the presence of blood. After being placed, Seprafilm becomes a gel within
      24-48 hours and then is slowly absorbed and excreted by the body over the course of 1-4
      weeks.

      Seprafilm Adhesion Barrier is FDA approved for use in patients undergoing abdominal or
      pelvis laparotomy as an adjunct intended to reduce the incidence, extent and severity of
      post-operative adhesions between the abdominal and between the uterus and surrounding
      structures.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Females 12 years and older undergoing a scheduled primary cesarean section at or
             after 24 weeks estimated gestational period

          -  Patients who have already consented to the study and have emergent C-sections

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients transferred from outlying hospitals who expect to undergo repeat C-section
             at that hospital.

          -  Patients who have had previous laparotomy

          -  Patients having a previous laparoscopy demonstrating adhesions of bladder peritoneum
             or uterine serosa or myometrium to the parietal peritoneum  or omentum  or bowel to
             the uterus or parietal peritoneum; or involving pelvic adhesiolysis, enterolysis or
             other surgery on bowel located in the pelvis, uterine myomectomy , adnexectomy or
             other adnexal surgery including ovarian cystectomy, tuboplasty, tubal reanastomosis,
             and removal of endometriosis

          -  Patients with an adhesion score &gt; 0 at the time of primary cesarean section

          -  Patents with chorioamnionitis, appendicitis or infection of other pelvic viscera at
             the time of primary cesarean section.

          -  Patients who have taken systemic corticosteroids within 2 weeks of the primary
             cesarean section. Provided however, patients who have been treated with systemic
             betamethasone or dexamethasone to promote fetal lung maturity are not excluded

          -  Patients undergoing tubal sterilization at the time of the primary cesarean section

          -  Patients with known allergy to hyaluronic acid

          -  Patients undergoing an emergent c-section who have not consented to the study

          -  The following criteria are seen as complications or adverse events experienced by the
             patients in the interval after the puerperium and will therefore exclude patients:

               1. Patient who have had a pelvic inflammatory disease documented by either cervical
                  motion, uterine or adnexal tenderness; and either oral temperature &gt; 101 degrees
