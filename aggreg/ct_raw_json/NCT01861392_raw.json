Diabetes mellitus type 2 (DM-2) is\n      considered a more problem of Public Health as having complications deficit in functional\n      performance of the lower limbs and falls, which can interfere with the maintenance of\n      balance, and is a strong predictor of functional limitations self referred. Aim: To assess\n      quality of life and the answers neuromuscular balance and baropodometric after sensory-motor\n      training in patients with type 2 diabetes. Method: To be recruited 50 volunteers aged\n      between 45 to 64 years with DM-2, of both sexes, divided into two groups: 1) Guidelines and\n      2) Guidelines + sensory-motor  training. Biomechanical data will be collected (balance,\n      baropodometry, electromyography strength and joint position sense), as well as\n      questionnaires ADDQoL and BESTest. The intervention will be twice a week for 45 minutes for\n      12 weeks, divided into three phases: heating, sensory-motor training and cool-down, with\n      monitoring of blood pressure and blood glucose. There will be a follow up after 3 months of\n      intervention. Statistical analysis will be used normality test to verify the data\n      distribution and consistent statistical test for the appropriate comparisons within and\n      between groups, and adopted a significance level of 5%. Expected Results: Considering\n      previous studies that demonstrate improvement in postural balance static and dynamic\n      responses under the forward training protocol sensorimotor disease Diabetes mellitus type 2,\n      is expected to improve neuromuscular, balance, distribution plant, the joint position sense\n      and the quality of life of voluntary DM-2.\n\n      Keywords: physical therapy modalities, exercise therapy, postural balance, Diabetes\n      Mellitus, quality of life."
