The policy of transferring more than\n      one embryo after IVF or ICSI has been the main reason for the numerous twin or triple\n      pregnancies reported in Europe and United States over the past 15 years.

In the past, embryos were replaced in the uterus\n      on either Day-2 or 3 of development at the cleavage stage. With the development of\n      physiologically-based sequential culture media, it has also been suggested that extending\n      embryo culture to Day-5 in order to transfer the embryo at the blastocyst stage would\n      enhance the likelihood of pregnancy. Nevertheless, it has been observed higher pregnancy\n      rate after the transfer of fresh blastocyst but not after the transfer of thawed blastocyst\n      frozen by slow freezing procedure.\n\n      However a recent embryo freezing technique (vitrification) seems to show significant higher\n      pregnancy rates when blastocyst are frozen by this method.
