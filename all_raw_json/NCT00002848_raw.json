Each session commences with a brief stress reduction\n      exercise and ends with a brief cognitive restructuring imagery exercise. The main portion of\n      the meeting emphasizes providing an environment in which patients can share their concerns,\n      feelings, and thoughts openly and honestly. The role of the cotherapist is to facilitate\n      expression of patients' concerns, offer empathy, and continue to encourage patients to\n      express their feelings and thoughts.\n\n      Quality-of-life questionnaires are filled out at 3 and 6 months and then every 6 months for\n      a total of 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 480 patients (including an estimated 53 minority patients)\n      will be entered in this multicenter study."
