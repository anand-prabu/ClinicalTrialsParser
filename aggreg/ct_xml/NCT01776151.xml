  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) above 500
      cluster-of-differentiation-4 (CD4)+ cells/milliliter (mL) ('early ART group') is better at
      reducing the stiffness of arteries than waiting to start ART until the CD4+ drops below 350
      cells/mL ('deferred ART group').  Artery stiffness has been associated with an increased
      risk of cardiovascular (heart) disease, and could be useful as an earlier indicator of heart
      disease. In this study, the stiffness of arteries will be measured at study entry, months 4,
      8, 12, and annually thereafter, using a tonometer on the participant's forearm.
