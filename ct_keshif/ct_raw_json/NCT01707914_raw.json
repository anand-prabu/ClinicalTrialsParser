In previous\n      animal studies from us and other investigators, anthocyanins have been shown to ameliorate\n      dyslipidemia and hepatic steatosis in different rodent models. The aim of the present study\n      was to examine the effects of Chinese bayberry juice (CBJ) on the serum lipid profile and on\n      levels of biomarkers related to antioxidant status in young adults with features of fatty\n      liver disease."
