Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop\n      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy\n      x-rays to damage tumor cells. Combining more than one drug and combining chemotherapy with\n      surgery and radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells."

To determine if the proposed treatment for children >= 8.0 months and < 3 years of age at\n      registration with non-metastatic (M0) medulloblastoma is more effective than the combined\n      treatments given to children of the same age and extent of disease on POG 9233, as measured\n      by event-free survival (EFS) rates.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the feasibility and safety of the planned use of second look surgery and focal\n      conformal radiation therapy following chemotherapy. II. To determine the acute and chronic\n      toxicities associated with the above treatment regimens.\n\n      III. To describe the neuropsychological and neuroendocrine effects of this systemic\n      chemotherapy, surgery, and local, conformal radiation. IV. To determine the feasibility and\n      validity of a centralized telephone interview based data collection method for\n      neuropsychological evaluations. V. To determine the incidence of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid\n      tumor (AT/RT) in children enrolled on this study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive induction chemotherapy consisting of vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15;\n      cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day 1; cyclophosphamide IV over 30 minutes on day 2; and oral\n      etoposide daily on days 2-22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 4 courses.\n      After completion of induction chemotherapy, patients with residual disease undergo a second\n      resection. Within 4 weeks after completion of induction chemotherapy or second resection,\n      patients receive focal conformal radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 6 weeks.

Patients receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, and 15 and cyclophosphamide IV\n      over 30 minutes on day 1 of courses 1, 3, 5, and 7 and oral etoposide daily on days 1-21 of\n      courses 2, 4, 6, and 8.
