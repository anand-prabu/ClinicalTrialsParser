II. Assess the\n      clinical and laboratory toxic effects and patient tolerance of this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes weekly for 4 weeks, followed by 2\n      weeks of rest. Treatment continues every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first two years, then\n      every 6 months for the next two years, and every 12 months thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study in 18-36 months."
