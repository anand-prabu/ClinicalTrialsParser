            "textblock": "Objective: A common, serious and debilitating long term complication of hematopoietic stem\n      cell transplant (HCST) is chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Ocular GVHD develops in\n      up to 85% of patients with chronic GVHD. It is characterized by progressive keratitis sicca\n      and cicatrizing ocular inflammatory surface disease with T cell mediated damage to\n      conjunctival and corneal epithelium and lacrimal tissue. Various medical and surgical\n      treatments have been used, such as various lubricating agents, steroid drops and ointments,\n      cyclosporin drops, punctal plugs or cautery and partial tarsorrhaphy. However, in severe\n      cases, none offer acceptable, long-lasting relief from pain, irritation, dryness and\n      diminished vision associated with ocular GVHD. An alternative treatment that has previously\n      been safely investigated is autologous serum eye drops (ASEDs). The objective of this study\n      is to determine whether ASEDs are more effective than control (normal saline) in the\n      treatment of severe chronic ocular GVHD in HSCT patients unresponsive to standard medical\n      treatment.\n\n      Study Population: Thirty-four (34) post-HSCT patients with severe ocular GVHD unresponsive\n      to standard medical treatment will be initially enrolled. Up to an additional 10\n      participants may be enrolled to account for participants who withdraw from the study prior\n      to reaching Month 3.\n\n      Design: This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-masked, controlled, crossover, single-center\n      study to investigate ASEDs in participants with severe chronic ocular GVHD. During the\n      initial crossover phase of the study, participants will participate in a two-period,\n      six-month, crossover study in which participants will be randomized to one of two treatment\n      sequence groups. The two groups are: 1) daily administration of ASEDs for the first three\n      months and then crossover to control (normal saline) eye drops beginning at Month 3 through\n      Month 6, or 2) daily administration of control (normal saline) eye drops for the first three\n      months and then crossover to ASEDs beginning at Month 3 through Month 6. Participants in\n      both groups will apply the assigned drops four times per day in both eyes for six months, as\n      well as maintain their current standard ocular GVHD therapy. Following the initial crossover\n      phase, beginning at the Month 6 visit, participants will be provided ASEDs as open-label\n      treatment on an as-needed basis until study completion. Participants and investigators will\n      remain masked to the masked treatment sequence group assignments. During the first year,\n      required clinic visits will occur at Baseline, Months 3, 6 and 12 with required telephone\n      follow-up visits at Months 7 and 9. Following the Month 12 visit, participants will be\n      evaluated every six months, alternating telephone follow-up visits with clinic visits, until\n      the last enrolled participant reaches his/her Month 12 visit. At the baseline visit and as\n      needed thereafter, all participants will supply blood for the preparation of the ASEDs.\n\n      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is the proportion of participants experiencing a\n\n      greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the combined score of the modified Oxford punctate\n      keratopathy grading and the NIH/NEI visual analogue scale in the study eye from baseline to\n      Month 3. A greater than or equal to 50% reduction in the combined score will be considered a\n      treatment success. While the design is a crossover study, the primary outcome is assessed\n      after the first period at Month 3. Secondary outcomes include changes in the combined score\n      of the modified Oxford punctate keratopathy grading and the NIH/NEI visual analogue scale in\n      the study eye from baseline to the end of each period, changes in the chronic ocular GVHD\n      Composite Assessment Scale (CAS) score, objective testing, subjective testing and global\n      chronic GVHD assessments in both eyes. Safety outcomes will be the number and severity of\n      systemic and ocular toxicities and adverse events. The number of participants withdrawn from\n      the study treatment due to vision loss, adverse events or treatment failure will also\n      contribute to the assessment of safety."
