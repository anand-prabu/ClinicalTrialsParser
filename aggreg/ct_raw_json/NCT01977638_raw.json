ECOG performance score of \u2264 1\n\n          4. Histologically or cytologically confirmed malignant tumour with the potential to\n             benefit from HDAC inhibitor therapy.\n\n          5. High HR23B expressing tumour sample on IHC (expansion cohort only).\n\n          6. Evaluable disease.\n\n          7. The patient is willing and able to comply with the protocol for the duration of the\n             study, including scheduled follow-up visits and examinations.\n\n          8. Patients must have recovered from effects of prior treatments, including surgeries\n             (persistent grade 1 toxicities are permitted at the discretion of the Chief\n             Investigator).\n\n          9. Female patients with reproductive potential must have a negative urine or serum\n             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to start of trial. Both women and men must agree\n             to use a medically acceptable method of contraception throughout the treatment period\n             and for 16 weeks after discontinuation of treatment. Oral contraception and\n             parenteral hormonal contraceptives (patches, injectables and implants) that may be\n             affected by enzyme-inducing drugs should only be used in combination with a barrier\n             method. All males with partners of childbearing potential or whose partners are\n             pregnant must use barrier contraception for the duration of dosing and for 16 weeks\n             post-dosing.\n\n         10. Able to give written (signed and dated) informed consent.\n\n         11. Haematological and biochemical indices within acceptable ranges as detailed in study\n             protocol.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pregnant or breast-feeding women or women of childbearing potential unless effective\n             methods of contraception are used.\n\n          2. Other psychological, social or medical condition, physical examination finding or a\n             laboratory abnormality that the Investigator considers would make the patient a poor\n             trial candidate or could interfere with protocol compliance or the interpretation of\n             trial results.\n\n          3. Patients who are known to be serologically positive for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C or\n             HIV.\n\n          4. Radiotherapy (except for palliative reasons), endocrine therapy, immunotherapy or use\n             of other investigational agents within 28 days prior to trial entry (or a longer\n             period depending on the defined characteristics of the agents used). Limited field\n             radiotherapy to an isolated lesion in bone or soft tissue must be completed 2 weeks\n             prior to trial entry.\n\n          5. Patients must not receive any concurrent anti-cancer therapy, including\n             investigational agents, while on-study. Patients may continue the use of\n             bisphosphonates for bone disease or corticosteroids providing the dose is stable\n             before and during the trial.\n\n          6. Major surgery within 4 weeks of starting the study.\n\n          7. Co-existing active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics or serious concurrent\n             illness deemed clinically significant.\n\n          8. Patients with known brain metastases, unless these are shown to be stable\n             (symptomatically and/or radiologically) over a period of 2 months or more.\n\n          9. History of refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic GI diseases (eg: inflammatory\n             bowel disease) or significant bowel resection that would preclude adequate absorption\n             of oral medication.\n\n         10. Patients who are unable to swallow oral medication.\n\n         11. Patients with corrected QT interval >450msec.\n\n         12. Persistent grade 2 or greater toxicities from any cause.\n\n         13. Previous treatment with a HDAC inhibitor."
