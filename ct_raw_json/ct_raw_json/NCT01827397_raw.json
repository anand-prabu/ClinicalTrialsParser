The\n      objective of the immunisation is to induce mucosal and systemic binding and neutralizing\n      antibodies against HIV in order to block the virus on the mucosal surface and neutralise the\n      viral particles that may eventually succeed in crossing the mucosal barrier.\n\n      This is a Phase 1 exploratory study. EN41-UGR7C will be administered for the first time in\n      humans.\n\n      Volunteers who are vaccinated with EN41-UGR7C may develop an immune response against HIV,\n      but its ability to induce meaningful protection against HIV will not be known before Phase 3\n      efficacy trials are completed, as correlates of protection against HIV are not yet clearly\n      defined.\n\n      Consequently, there is no direct benefit to volunteers. They will be reimbursed for their\n      time and travel."
