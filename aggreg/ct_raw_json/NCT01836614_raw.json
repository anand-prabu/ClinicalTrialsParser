The investigators plan to measure the following outcomes:  length of\n      stay in hospital following abdominal surgery, postoperative pain scores, cumulative morphine\n      consumption, incidences of opioid adverse-effects: respiratory depression, sedation, nausea,\n      vomiting, time to passage of flatus, time to first bowel movement and end-tidal Sevoflurane\n      in operating room throughout surgery. The following laboratory values will be measured:\n      serial lidocaine levels of pharmacokinetics and safety levels, Pro- and anti-inflammatory\n      cytokine measurements: IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-1RA and genetic variants."
