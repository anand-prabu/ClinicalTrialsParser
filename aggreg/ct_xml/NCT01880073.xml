  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A thorough infertility evaluation commonly involves determining whether a woman's fallopian
      tubes are patent.  The two most often utilized methods of evaluating the fallopian tubes are
      hysterosalpingogram (taking an X-ray of the pelvis after injecting dye through the uterus
      and fallopian tubes) and laparoscopic chromopertubation (a surgical procedure in which dye
      is visualized passing through the fallopian tubes).

      The FemVue Saline-Air device is a new method of assessing tubal patency.  The device
      utilizes a mixture of saline and air bubbles that can be seen passing through the fallopian
      tubes by ultrasound.  FemVue can be efficiently performed in a physician's office and is
      minimally invasive.  Unlike hysterosalpingogram and laparoscopic chromopertubation, it does
      not carry the risks of anesthesia or surgery, and doesn't expose the patient to radiation or
      contrast.  It does, like the other two methods, carry a small risk of infection.

      This study will involve using the FemVue device on patients under anesthesia in the
      operating room before they undergo scheduled laparoscopic chromopertubation, the gold
      standard for evaluating tubal patency.  The two methods will be compared to determine the
      accuracy of the FemVue device.

    <description>The device utilizes a mixture of saline and air to create &quot;scintillations&quot; or echogenic air bubbles, which , after passing through the intrauterine catheter, can be visualized by ultrasound passing from the endometrial cavity through the length of each fallopian tube into the peritoneal cavity.  Using a transvaginal ultrasound, if air bubbles are seen to flow through the length of the fallopian tube and into the peritoneal cavity, tubal patency is documented.</description>
