The effects of treatments are measured on nystagmus velocity, amplitude,\n      frequency and on visual acuity. None of the trials measured a functional visual score or\n      oscillopsia score.\n\n      The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of gabapentin and memantine on the mean\n      velocity, amplitude and frequency of pendular nystagmus, as well as on oscillopsia, visual\n      acuity and vision-specific health-related quality of life score, in 10 patients with\n      multiple sclerosis. The primary object is to find out the best variable to evaluate the\n      efficiency of nystagmus treatment and the secondary, to compare the efficiency of both\n      gabapentin and memantine in a common population of patients."
