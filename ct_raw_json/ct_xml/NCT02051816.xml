  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure requiring endotracheal intubation occurs in as many as 40% of critically
      ill patients.  Procedural complications including failed attempts at intubation, esophageal
      intubation, arterial oxygen desaturation, aspiration, hypotension, cardiac arrest, and death
      are common in this setting.  While there are many important components of successful airway
      management in critical illness, the maintenance of adequate arterial hemoglobin saturation
      from procedure initiation until endotracheal tube placement is paramount as desaturation is
      the most common factor associated with peri-intubation cardiac arrest and death.
      Interventions that either shorten the duration of time required for tube placement or
      prolong the period before desaturation may be effective in improving outcome.  The high rate
      of complications and the lack of existing evidence regarding the efficacy of current airway
      management techniques in shortening the time to airway establishment or prolonging the time
      to desaturation mandates further investigation.  The primary hypothesis is that video
      laryngoscopy will be superior to direct laryngoscopy in successful first attempt at
      endotracheal intubation (defined by confirmed placement of an endotracheal tube in the
      trachea during first laryngoscopy attempt) of medical ICU patients by Pulmonary/Critical
      Care Medicine fellows after controlling for the operator's past number of procedures with
      the equipment used.  Also, the investigators hypothesize that the provision of apneic
      oxygenation during the endotracheal intubation procedure (defined as a nasal cannula with 15
      liters per minute of oxygen flow placed prior to sedation or neuromuscular blockade and
      maintained until after completion of the procedure) will result in a higher arterial oxygen
      saturation nadir (defined as lowest noninvasive oxygenation saturation value observed
      between the administration of sedation and/or neuromuscular blockade and 2 minutes after
      successfully secured airway or death) compared to no apneic oxygenation.
