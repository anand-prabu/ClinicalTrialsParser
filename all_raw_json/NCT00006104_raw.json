Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of trastuzumab plus docetaxel in treating\n      women who have recurrent or metastatic breast cancer."

Determine the objective response rate of women with HER2-neu overexpressing\n      recurrent or metastatic breast cancer treated with trastuzumab (Herceptin) in combination\n      with docetaxel. II. Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in these patients. III.\n      Determine the duration of response to this treatment regimen in these patients. IV.\n      Determine the time to progression in these patients after receiving this treatment regimen.\n      V. Compare HER2-neu overexpression as determined by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)\n      versus immunohistochemistry, and correlate these findings with response to this treatment\n      regimen in these patients. VI. Correlate HER2-neu activation by immunohistochemistry and the\n      extracellular domain of HER2-neu by ELISA with response to this treatment regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 30 minutes weekly\n      for 6 weeks plus trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 30-90 minutes weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment\n      continues every 8 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 9 months, and then every 6\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-34 patients will be accrued for this study."
