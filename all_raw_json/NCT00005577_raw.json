Assess the antitumor activity of gemcitabine within a phase I study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes weekly for 2 weeks. Patients achieving\n      objective response or stable disease after 3 weeks may receive additional courses of therapy\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at week 4 and then every 6 months\n      until death."
