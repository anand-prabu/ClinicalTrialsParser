            "textblock": "The independent prognostic ability of the luminal A subtype has been demonstrated in two\n      retrospective analyses of prospective trials and suggests that luminal A combined with other\n      known clinical prognostic factors could be used to select patients treated with BCS at very\n      low risk for IBTR who could avoid BI.  Given that using intrinsic subtyping combined with\n      other clinical factors to identify women who could avoid BI would be a major change in\n      clinical practice, we propose that a prospective study is necessary to confirm that such an\n      approach can accurately identify a group of women at very low risk for IBTR following BCS.\n\n      We anticipate that the risk of IBTR in the low risk group is likely to be lower than that\n      observed in previous trials (predicted to be < 5% at 5 years and < 10% at 10 years) for\n      several reasons: first, our selection criteria (node negative, luminal A, > or = 60 years,\n      tumours < or = 2cm, excision margin > or = 2mm post-BCS, absence of lobular cancers,\n      extensive intraductal component and lymphovascular invasion) are  more restrictive than in\n      previous trials and second, the risks of IBTR are steadily decreasing over time due to\n      improvements in mammographic screening, pre-op staging, tumour localization, and surgical\n      practice. The expected low failure rates are unlikely to warrant the use of radiation.\n\n      A prospective cohort study was identified as the most appropriate and efficient design as\n      our primary hypothesis is that a group of patients at very low risk of IBTR can be\n      identified. A randomized trial could address the effectiveness of radiation in such a cohort\n      of patients, but would require a much larger sample size to detect very small differences,\n      which would not be clinically meaningful. During the conduct of this trial it is anticipated\n      that patients who do not meet study criteria or who decline study enrollment, will continue\n      to receive BI after BCS."
