            "textblock": "Major consequences of the global pandemic of obesity include cardiovascular disease, type 2\n      diabetes and dyslipidemia. The dyslipidemia of obesity commonly consists of fasting\n      hypertriglyceridemia with increased plasma very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), reduced\n      high-density lipoprotein (HDL) and the presence of small, dense low-density lipoprotein\n      (LDL). However, more recently, increased secretion of intestinally derived lipoproteins\n      (LPs) has been recognized as contributing to this dyslipidemic profile and postprandial\n      lipemia has been linked to adverse health outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), a\n      hormone secreted during meal absorption that plays a key role in the control of plasma\n      glucose has been implicated as a candidate hormone for regulating intestinal lipid\n      metabolism. Studies in rodents demonstrate that treatment with the GLP-1R agonist; exendin-4\n      (Ex-4) reduced postprandial chylomicron (CM) production and CM-associated cholesterol and\n      triglyceride (TG). Similar results were found in Type 2 diabetes (T2D) subjects treated with\n      Ex-4; in these reports there was a reduction in both intestinally derived LP production and\n      total plasma TG. The objective of this study is to determine whether GLP-1 is involved in\n      the physiologic regulation of postprandial lipid metabolism in healthy women, and to test\n      the hypothesis that the improved lipid parameters found in overweight women who have had\n      bariatric surgery are mediated by GLP-1. The specific aims for this project will 1)\n      determine if either pharmacologic treatment with GLP-1 and/or antagonism of endogenous GLP-1\n      activity improves postprandial lipid metabolism in healthy subjects and 2) determine the\n      role of elevated postprandial GLP-1 levels on lipid metabolism in obese subjects who have\n      had a sleeve gastrectomy. The investigators will use infusions of synthetic GLP-1 with the\n      native hormone to confirm the lipid-lowering results that have been published using\n      pharmacologic GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. The investigators will also use the GLP-1R\n      antagonist exendin-(9-39) to determine the role of endogenous GLP-1 on lipemia after a test\n      meal. A demonstration that this is a physiologic action would expand the current\n      understanding of lipid metabolism, provide new insight into the effects of bariatric\n      surgery, and allow the design of more refined, mechanistic studies of this process. In\n      addition, the potential for GLP-1R signaling to promote lipid metabolism has direct\n      translational importance in that therapies already exist that could capitalize on this\n      mechanism. Understanding the role of GLP-1R regulation of lipid absorption and clearance\n      could lead to more appropriate targeting of GLP-1 based drugs to specific diabetic patients,\n      i.e. ones with problematic dyslipidemia and higher risk for cardiovascular disease.\n      Moreover, understanding the effects of GLP-1 on plasma lipids could eventually lead to new\n      approaches for treating nondiabetic dyslipidemic persons."
