The study is divided into 5\n      dose levels. Subjects will be given a single dose delivered by IV infusion. The subjects\n      will be monitored and the data analyzed. After a set time, between 6 and 10 weeks depending\n      on the dose level, the next set of subjects will be dosed. The study drug is a gene therapy\n      treatment that produces molecules that destroy the Hepatitis C virus (HCV) in infected\n      cells. Once the study drug is given, it cannot be withdrawn. Additionally, once an\n      individual receives a dose, he or she will not be able to receive a second dose, but will\n      remain eligible to receive most other HCV treatments."

The transfer of the\n      anti-HCV sequences will be accomplished using a \"vector\" that was made from an\n      adenovirus-associated virus (AAV) by removing the viral genes and replacing them with a\n      non-replicating genetic sequence that produces three different shRNA that target three\n      different regions within the HCV genes.  This type of vector has been used in other clinical\n      trials in order to transduce the hepatocytes of subjects who suffer from hemophilia."
