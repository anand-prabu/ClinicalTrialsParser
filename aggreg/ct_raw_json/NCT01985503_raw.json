In the current\n      study, participants of BATPET, FATBAT and Dixon-BAT studies are recruited for a follow-up\n      study to examine associations between obesity, cardiovascular risk factors, serum metabolic\n      profile and BAT structure at baseline and during follow-up several years later. 43 BATPET\n      participants will be called for follow-up in 2013 with a follow-up period of 5 years and 52\n      FATBAT and Dixon-BAT participants in years 2014 and 2015 with a follow-up period of 3 years.\n      The aim of this study is to examine longitudinal associations between BAT function and\n      structure, liver adiposity and cardiovascular risk factors at baseline and during follow-up."
