Dairy foods are accepted by women during pregnancy as a healthy choice (from pilot study) and in our recent birth cohort study, women consumed an average of 3 or more servings of dairy per day.  Exercise intervention: In most previous studies and published guidance the focus has been on aerobic exercise. Walking is the easiest physical activity to undertake and also to implement in terms of setting goals of steps and monitoring of adherence using accelerometer-type devices as demonstrated in our previous studies. Walking was demonstrated most practical since women reduced moderate and vigorous physical activity during pregnancy but levels of walking were maintained."

            "textblock": "Weight gained during pregnancy is referred to as gestational weight gain (GWG).  Excess GWG\n      is a widespread problem that occurs in 55-75% of Canadian women who enter pregnancy\n      overweight or obese (a group that represents over 50 % of all pregnant women) and about 40%\n      women of normal weight. Excess GWG is associated with complications of pregnancy, such as\n      post-partum weight retention, type 2 diabetes, elevated fats in the blood, and high blood\n      pressure and may also lead to problems with the health of the newborn child.   Our research\n      aims to find ways to control GWG by developing new and practical approaches to diet and\n      exercise targeted to overweight pregnant women that hold promise of improving their health\n      both during pregnancy and thereafter. The experimental intervention is a diet of higher\n      protein provided by dairy foods combined with an exercise program modified to the abilities\n      of overweight pregnant women; and the control is the usual advice given by their primary\n      care providers, information on healthy pregnancy from Health Canada, and a focus group\n      session exploring women's experiences with exercise, nutrition, and gestational weight gain.\n      The results of this study will allow us to design future large clinical studies in all\n      pregnant women to help control the weight gain in all pregnant women."
