However,\n      there is little published data comparing Tc-MBI to MRI for evaluating extent of disease in\n      women with known breast cancer.\n\n      The study will target twenty (20) women with newly diagnosed breast cancer  who are\n      scheduled to undergo biopsy of additional suspicious lesions that were identified on\n      standard of care contrast- enhanced breast MRI. Prior to the biopsy, these subjects will\n      receive a Tc-MBI scan of the breast. The results from both imaging methods will be compared\n      to histological findings. These results may be used to design larger and more comprehensive\n      studies with an overarching goal to determine if there is a role for Tc-MBI in the\n      pre-operative evaluation of patients with known breast cancer."
