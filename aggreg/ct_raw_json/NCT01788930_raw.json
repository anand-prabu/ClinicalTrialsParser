Type 2 diabetes is often associated with sleep apnea syndrome with a prevalence\n      up to 60%.\n\n      The main objective of our study is to analyze the influence of sleep apnea on the response\n      to antiplatelet therapy in stable aspirin-treated type-2 diabetes patients.\n\n      Consecutive stable aspirin-treated type-2 diabetes patients referred for suspicion of sleep\n      apnea will be recruited after providing informed consent. Response to aspirin will be\n      assessed with the Verify Now Aspirin(TM)rapid analyser in the morning after nocturnal\n      polysomnography, and compared with a group of type-2 diabetes free of sleep apnea. Other\n      endocrine, metabolic, hematologic and cardiovascular confounders will also be assessed at\n      baseline to determine their influence on the response to aspirin.\n\n      Then, Patients with severe SAS (Apnea-Hypopnea Index> 30 events/h)will be randomized to 3\n      months of active or sham continuous positive airway pressure treatment in a pilot study.\n      After the 3-months of intervention, response to aspirin will be compared between the sham\n      and effective CPAP groups."
