            "textblock": "The prevalence of knee injuries has shown a striking increase of >24% over the last 5 years,\n      affecting work performance, limiting mobility, and impacting military deployment health.\n      This increase reflects the current high op-tempo and frequent deployments of a nation at war\n      including activities related to military operations, physical fitness, and demanding\n      training.  We have shown that neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) improves\n      quadriceps muscle strength. We have also shown that a pedometer-based protocol improves\n      fitness. The overall objective of this project is to compare three treatment regimens for\n      knee injury to the standard WRNMMC rehabilitation protocol as potential treatments for\n      improving strength, work efficiency, and mobility in active duty military personnel with a\n      knee injury.  Our central hypothesis is that the combination of NMES and walking while\n      wearing a weighted vest will demonstrate greater improvements in muscle strength, work\n      efficiency, and mobility, as compared to the usual care alone.  The rationale is that NMES\n      combined with graduated strength walking could produce marked improvements in muscle\n      strength and thereby enhance work performance, readiness and fitness, decrease physical\n      symptoms and faster return to duty.  NMES and graduated strength walking, simulate the\n      current uniform in the theatre of operation (body armor).The specific aims are to compare\n      the effectiveness of three treatment regimens to the usual care in improving: (1) muscle\n      strength, (2) work efficiency, (3) mobility, (4) symptoms/pain, and (5) quality of life.\n      After baseline testing, we propose to randomly assign male and female subjects (n=132) ages\n      18 to 50 years with a knee injury to one of 4 groups: 1) NMES, 2) strength walking, 3) NMES\n      and strength walking, or 4) usual care.  All groups will receive 12-weeks of the\n      intervention and 6-weeks of follow-up.  Generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods will\n      be used to build regression models for statistical analysis of longitudinal data.  If the\n      interventions are effective with respect to parameters of strength, mobility, work\n      performance, and symptoms, recommendations for future treatments can be made.  This is\n      hugely important, given the rising rate of knee injuries and the possibility that\n      provider-managed care would be critical for assisting our warriors in a rapid recovery and\n      return to duty."
