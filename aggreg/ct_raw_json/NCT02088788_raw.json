Patient exposure is measured by\n      the catheterization laboratory equipment and recorded.  Lindauer Microstar Nanodot badges\n      worn at waist level above the radiation lead will be used to measure operator radiation\n      exposure.  A new Nanodot will be used for every case.  Radiation exposure to the operator's\n      Nanodot will be measured immediately after each procedure by a technician blinded to study\n      assignment.\n\n      All patients 18-89 years old presenting to Geisinger Medical Center for diagnostic cardiac\n      catheterization will be evaluated for the study.  All interventional cardiologists and\n      fellows that will be performing the cardiac catheterization procedure also will be study\n      subjects.   Approximately 150 Geisinger patients who satisfy inclusion and exclusion\n      criteria will be included. Each arm will include 75 patients to participate in this study.\n      Approximately 8 interventional cardiologists and 10 fellows will be included in this study."
