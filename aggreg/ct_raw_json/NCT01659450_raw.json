However, energy intake is the key factor of weight maintenance. Energy intake\n      will decrease by reducing energy density (ED) of a diet without producing short-term calorie\n      restriction or feeling hunger. There are several studies which showed the beneficial effects\n      of low energy density diets on weight reduction. However, few studies discuses regarding the\n      effects of such diets on weight maintenance."
