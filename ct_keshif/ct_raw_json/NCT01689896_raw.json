            "textblock": "This research is being done to see whether testosterone replacement in men who take\n      opioid-based pain medications and have low testosterone levels will show improvement in pain\n      tolerance, pain perception and quality of life.\n\n      Some men who take opioid-based medications (narcotics) for pain develop low testosterone\n      levels.  Research has shown that low testosterone levels may make a person more sensitive to\n      pain.  This means that if a person with a painful condition develops low testosterone level\n      as a result of his pain medications, he might become more sensitive to pain and so may need\n      higher doses of pain medications for pain control.\n\n      Testosterone is a male hormone that is important for sperm production and the development of\n      male characteristics such as muscle mass and strength, fat distribution, bone mass and sex\n      drive.  Testosterone hormone replacement therapy has been used for decades to treat men with\n      low testosterone levels (male hypogonadism).  Testosterone replacement therapies are\n      available in the form of an injection into the muscle, implants under the skin, oral\n      capsules taken by mouth, topical gels applied to the skin, and skin patches.\n\n      This study will use Fortesta\u00ae, a topical testosterone gel (T-gel) absorbed into the skin.\n      Fortesta\u00ae is currently on the market as an FDA-approved treatment of male hypogonadism (low\n      testosterone levels).\n\n      Men with non-cancer related pain who take opioid-based medications for pain and have low\n      testosterone levels may join this study.  (A low testosterone level is defined as early\n      morning (before noon) blood testosterone level of 300 ng/dl or less, or a free testosterone\n      of 50 ng/dl or less))."
