In the last two decades, the Canadian Thoracic Society (CTS) has successfully\n      developed and disseminated evidence-based asthma and COPD clinical practice guidelines.\n      However, evidence suggests that guideline implementation in these diseases remains\n      inadequate.\n\n      Successful guideline implementation requires tailoring of selected strategies to settings\n      and population-specific barriers, based on established theories and principles. In 2004, the\n      CTS and its collaborators organized a symposium in Quebec City, to discuss existing barriers\n      to respiratory guideline implementation and possible knowledge translation (KT) strategies.\n      This was followed in the fall of 2007 by an expert-led workshop on guideline implementation\n      strategies.\n\n      Herein, the investigators report the planned methods and outcome of a project which resulted\n      from these meetings. This study sought to explore the effectiveness of a multi-faceted KT\n      strategy in improving concordance with COPD and asthma guidelines among primary care\n      physicians (PCPs) in Canada, but was aborted due to inadequate PCP recruitment. The\n      investigators discuss the difficulties encountered in recruiting PCPs, factors which may\n      have influenced recruitment, and alternative strategies. The goal of the investigators is to\n      provide practical lessons to inform the design of future KT initiatives with similar\n      interventions and/or a similar target audience."
