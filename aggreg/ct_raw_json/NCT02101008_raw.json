Able to ingest oral medications\n\n         11. No known allergy to disulfiram or zinc gluconate\n\n         12. Willing to refrain from ingestion of alcoholic beverages while on the study\n\n         13. Serum copper within the normal range at baseline, or if outside the normal range, the\n             PI will review for clinical significance\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Potential study subjects who meet any of the following criteria are not eligible for\n        participation in the study:\n\n          1. Participation in another clinical trial of a therapeutic drug during the past 30 days\n\n          2. Addiction to alcohol or cocaine\n\n          3. Baseline AST or ALT greater than 2.0 X upper limit of normal\n\n          4. Unable to ingest oral medications\n\n          5. Unable to undergo CT scanning because of inability to lie recumbent in the scanner;\n\n          6. Actively receiving cytotoxic cancer chemotherapy agents\n\n          7. Evidence of thiuram allergy (may present as contact allergy to rubber or elastic)\n\n          8. Current use of sertraline and cyclosporine\n\n          9.
