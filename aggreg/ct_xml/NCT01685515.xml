  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to observe if oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine can
      increase fetal hemoglobin levels and improve the symptoms of sickle cell disease, and to
      monitor how patient's bodies react to oral tetrahydrouridine and decitabine. The overall
      purpose is to develop disease modifying treatment for sickle cell disease that is less
      cytotoxic than the current standard of care, and which can directly and more efficiently
      reactivate fetal hemoglobin levels. The hypothesis is that patients treated with oral
      tetrahydrouridine and decitabine will have the same chance of severe non-hematologic
      toxicities as the placebo group. The primary end-point is ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic
      toxicity. The investigators' hypothesis is that patients in the treatment groups receiving
      oral THU-decitabine 2X/week over 8 weeks (n=15) will be equivalent to placebo group (n=10)
      with regards to the chance of ≥ grade 3 non-hematologic toxicity.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 years or older.

          -  Written, informed consent provided by the subject before study entry.

          -  Confirmed SCD (SS, S-b0-thalassemia, S-b+-thalassemia or SC on hemoglobin
             electrophoresis).

          -  Symptomatic SCD while on 6 months of HU OR symptomatic SCD and intolerant of HU
             (unable or unwilling to tolerate HU due to hematological or other toxicities).
             Symptomatic SCD is defined as having one of following:

               -  HbF &lt;5%, OR

               -  3 or more pain episodes per year requiring parenteral narcotics, OR

               -  1 or more acute chest syndrome episodes, OR

               -  Hemoglobin &lt;9 g/dL and absolute reticulocyte count &lt;250,000/mm3.

          -  Subject is in his/her steady state and not amidst any acute complication due to SCD
             (i.e., hospitalization, acute pain, or acute chest syndrome in the past 14 days).

          -  Regular compliance with comprehensive care and previous therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Inability to give informed consent.

          -  Experienced severe sepsis or septic shock within the previous 12 weeks.

          -  Last HU dose was ingested within the previous 4 weeks.

          -  Currently pregnant or breast-feeding.

             direct (conjugated) bilirubin greater than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl.

          -  Serum creatinine &gt;2.9 mg/dL and calculated creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min.

          -  Platelet count &gt;800 x 109/L.
