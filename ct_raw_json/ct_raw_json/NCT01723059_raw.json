This\n      includes amoxicillin, clarithromycin and a proton pump inhibitor all given daily for 10-14\n      days.  In Europe, the guidelines now advocate treatment of H pylori with sequential therapy\n      which is 5 days of amoxicillin therapy with proton pump inhibitor followed by 5 days of\n      clarithromycin, metronidazole, and proton pump inhibitor with better response rates.  We\n      hypothesize that H. pylori resistance pattern and treatment response rates observed in\n      Europe will not be predictive of resistance patterns and response rates in the United\n      States."
