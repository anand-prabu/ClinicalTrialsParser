Patients also receive oral capecitabine twice daily on days\n      1-5 weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and capecitabine until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-15 patients will be accrued for this study within 9-15\n      months."
