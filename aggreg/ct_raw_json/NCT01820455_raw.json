Only those patients who are determined to be colonized with MRSA at\n      admission will be included in the study.  All patients must be age 18 and older, admitted\n      directly to the ICU from either the Emergency Department or the operating room with\n      trauma-related injuries, and must not have active or recent known history of MRSA\n      infections.  Once patients have been determined to be colonized with MRSA, they will be\n      randomized to receive \"decolonization\" treatment or placebo.  \"Decolonization\" treatment\n      will include Chlorhexidine baths and Mupirocin ointment to both nares for 5 days and placebo\n      will entail \"routine\" soap baths and Lubricating Jelly.  Both groups will be kept on\n      standard contact precautions throughout the course of the study.  Repeat nasal swabs will be\n      performed at the completion of the treatment regimen to determine the efficacy.  Patients\n      will be screened for invasive MRSA infections as dictated by their clinical course.  The\n      primary outcome measure will be invasive MRSA infection rate (pneumonia, urinary tract\n      infection, bacteremia and soft tissue infection). Secondary endpoints include hospital\n      lengths of stay, ICU lengths of stay, mechanical ventilatory support requirements,\n      colonization status at the end of treatment, and death rates. As determined by our power\n      analysis, we aim to enroll 75 patients in each arm over the course of 12-24 months."
