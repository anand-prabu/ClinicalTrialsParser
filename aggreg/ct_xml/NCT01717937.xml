  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether phase variance optical coherence
      tomography (PV-OCT), a software-based optical coherence tomography(OCT) image processing
      technology, can be used to generate angiographic images of the retinochoroidal vasculature
      that are comparable to those produced by fluorescein angiography (FA), the current gold
      standard diagnostic test.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fluorescein angiography (FA) has long been the gold standard for vascular imaging of the
      retina and choroid.  It is a test that involves the intravenous injection of fluorescein
      dye, followed by imaging of the dye's passage through the blood vessels inside the eye.  It
      is commonly used to diagnose many forms of retinovascular disease, as well as to assess the
      retina's response to various therapeutic interventions.  While FA is a relatively safe
      diagnostic test, it carries the risk of both minor and major side effects.  These include
      nausea and vomiting, yellowing of the skin and urine, vascular extravasation with skin
      eruption and necrosis, vasovagal reactions, myocardial infarction, respiratory failure,
      anaphylaxis, cardiopulmonary arrest, and death.  Additionally, the test is time-consuming,
      technically difficult to perform, and requires patients to undergo the discomfort associated
      with intravenous access.  Despite these drawbacks, FA is still commonly used in clinical
      practice, as there are no existing alternative tests with the ability to provide comparable
      detail of the retinal and choroidal vasculature.

      Phase-variance optical coherence tomography is a novel, noninvasive, software-based
      technology capable of generating angiographic images from the data gathered by standard OCT
      scans. Preliminary research suggests it can produce high-definition representations of the
      retinal and choroidal vasculature which may be more detailed than the images produced by FA.

    <description>Masked examiners (retina specialists) will evaluate and grade coded PV-OCT and FA images for the presence and features of various retinovascular abnormalities (e.g., choroidal neovascular membranes, microaneurysms, venous dilation, etc.).  Metrics to determined and may include: size, depth, area, volume, and relative position.  Each subject's graded PV-OCT images will be compared to their graded FA images.</description>

    <description>Each time a subject is determined to require OCT imaging as part of their normal clinical evaluation over the duration of the study, a PV-OCT scan will also be performed.  Measured to be determined physical characteristics of these scans will be compared to measurements obtained from prior PV-OCT images in order to assess changes over time.</description>

    <description>Subjects will receive fluorescein angiography (FA) as part of their normal clinical evaluation and will undergo phase variance optical coherence tomography (PV-OCT) as the study intervention. This involves having subjects undergo standard, noninvasive optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans with an FDA-approved OCT device, and the data gathered by this device will be transferred to a separate computer for processing using novel software.  This software is capable of utilizing the existing data to generate phase variance OCT images.</description>
