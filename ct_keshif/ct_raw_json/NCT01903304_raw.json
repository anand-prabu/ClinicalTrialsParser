In addition, we will investigate the effect of high olive oil consumption on gene\n      expression of relevant pathways in circulating mononuclear cells, as well as on cognitive\n      function.\n\n      Subject recruitment and enrollment will be conducted at the USDA HNRCA. Following screening,\n      40 eligible overweight or obese participants aged 65 and above will be randomized into one\n      of two nutrition intervention groups for a period of 12 weeks: [1] Control Typical American\n      Diet A, (N=20) and [2] Experimental Diet B (N=20).\n\n      Participants on the Control Diet A will be consuming a low-fiber, high-fat typical American\n      Diet. Those on Diet B will consume a similar diet as the typical American diet, but they\n      will be asked to replace their oil intake with extra virgin olive oil. Dietary counseling\n      will be provided by the study dietitian at the Metabolic Research Kitchen of the Jean Mayer\n      USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (HNRCA) at Tufts University on where the study\n      oils will be replacing oils in the subjects' diets.  Subjects will be followed regularly by\n      the study dietitian throughout the intervention period to provide support and ensure\n      compliance to study protocol.  Data collection will take place at baseline, and after the\n      subjects have been on the study diets for a period of three months. Data collection for the\n      study outcome measures of interest will comprise blood drawing, anthropometric measurements,\n      and cellular and immune factors. Specifically, measures will include:\n\n        1. in vivo indices of T cell-mediated function [delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH)],\n\n        2. plasma inflammation markers (such as IL-1b, IL-6, TNF-a, CRP, MCP-1, sICAM-1, and\n           sVCAM-1),\n\n        3. ability of T cells and their subsets (such as CD4 and CD8, na\u00efve and memory) to\n           proliferate,\n\n        4. Ex vivo production cytokines and PGE2 by immune cells.\n\n        5. Gene expression of relevant pathways using transcriptomics analysis in circulating\n           mononuclear cells.\n\n        6.
