Patients presenting with an ulcer probing to bone (UT Grade IIIA-D). A positive\n             probe-to-bone will be confirmed when bone or joint can be felt with a sterile,\n             ophthalmological probe.\n\n          2.

Any pathology that would limit the blood supply and compromise healing;\n\n         13. Patients that have received a biomedical or topical growth factor for their wound\n             within the previous 30 days\n\n         14. Patient who are pregnant or breast feeding\n\n         15.
