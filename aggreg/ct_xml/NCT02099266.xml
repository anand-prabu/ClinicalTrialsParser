  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn the following:

        -  If providing hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy prior to an umbilical cord blood (UBC)
           transplant will help to improve the homing process

        -  The safety of HBO administration in the setting of the UBC transplant

        -  The effects of HBO therapy on the engraftment process
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Research has suggested that high levels of erythropoietin (EPO) decreases the ability of
      infused umbilical cord stem cells to home to the bone marrow.  The investigators will
      investigate the use of hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy to decrease the plasma concentrations
      of EPO prior to UBC transplant and evaluate the resulting impact on UBC homing.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Treatment limiting toxicities are defined as the occurrence of any of the following complications within 24hrs of treatment:  pneumothorax, death, irreversible grade III or any grade IV toxicity that is determined by the treating physician to be related to HBO therapy.</description>

    <time_frame>Daily measurement of neutrophil counts up to 90 days post transplant.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects will be followed daily until neutrophil recovery, defined as three consecutive days of achieving a neutrophil level &gt;/= 500 u/L.</description>

    <time_frame>Bone marrow chimerism testing at Day 21 or Day 28</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The degree of engraftment will be determined through bone marrow chimerism assessments at either 21 or 28 days.  Partial engraftment is defined as marrow reconstitution of 10-90% or donor cells and complete engraftment is defined as greater that 90% of donor cells.</description>

    <time_frame>EPO measurements:  Pre-HBO (Day 0), 6hrs, 8hrs, 24hrs, 48hrs post HBO.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Erythropoietin blood levels will be correlated to the daily neutrophil counts to assess any relationship between EPO levels and subsequent engraftment and neutrophil recovery.</description>
