The purpose of this protocol\n      is to establish a coordinating program with the pathology departments of the Washington D.C.\n      and metropolitan area hospitals and local medical examiner   s offices for the donation of\n      brain tissue.\n\n      Dissected brain tissue from selected brain regions, including but not limited to the\n      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampal formation, will be assembled from large\n      cohorts of normal controls and schizophrenic subjects. The expression of mRNA and protein\n      for selected molecules, chosen on the basis of their genetic association with schizophrenia,\n      will be measured with a variety of assays including but not limited to qPCR and Western\n      blots.\n\n      Outcome measures are the statistical comparison within normal controls of mRNA and/or\n      protein levels in groups segmented by genotype. Similar comparisons will be made between\n      schizophrenic cohorts and normal controls, in a diagnosis by genotype analysis with an\n      ANOVA, or when appropriate an ANCOVA (controlling for variables such as age, race, gender,\n      and postmortem interval)."

Tissue is obtained after death, with the\n        permission of next of kin, or from existing institutions with appropriate samples via an\n        MTA or other applicable agreement.\n\n        Brain tissue is excluded from collection if there is a previously known history of\n        strokes, lesions, or other major neuropathological abnormalities prior to the consenting\n        process."
