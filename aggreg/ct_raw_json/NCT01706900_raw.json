The evolution includes both the ovarian stimulation protocols and the\n      laboratory techniques. Optimization of the laboratory procedures is of great interest to the\n      scientists in the field of IVF.\n\n      Incubator temperature is one of the most precious variables in IVF labs. When the IVF\n      started, almost all incubator temperatures were set at 37 degrees which mimic in vivo\n      conditions.\n\n      Some authors speculated that gametes and early embryos might need low temperatures that\n      provide quieter metabolism. another group found increase in pregnancy rate for embryos\n      cultured below 37 degree compared to those cultured at 37 degree. Nevertheless; the majority\n      of embryologists still consider culture at 37 degrees is the back bone for the incubators.\n\n      The paucity of well designed studies makes it difficult to achieve a satisfactory answer\n      whether  lower temperature will improve the pregnancy rate. This encourage us to study the\n      effect of lower temperature (36.5 degrees) on the pregnancy rate compared to conventional\n      temperature (37 degrees)."
