  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of patients admitted with major traumatic injuries. Such patients may
      develop inadequate circulation to the organs as a result of internal blood loss. Early
      detection of internal blood loss can be difficult as physical examination alone may miss
      patients with significant blood loss. Some patients with internal bleeding will arrive with
      low blood pressure; these patients are usually given 2 liters of intravenous fluid to
      determine if their blood pressure will recover. If the blood pressure does not rise or if it
      drops again later, the blood loss can be assumed to be severe, and the patient will likely
      need transfusions, surgery and other interventions. However, this fluid treatment method can
      lead to delays and complications as some patients may initially respond but then continue to
      bleed.  The inferior vena cava (IVC) is the large vein draining blood from the lower body to
      the heart. The inferior vena cava is known to empty when the patient has had significant
      blood loss. The vena cava diameter can be seen using ultrasound. This study intends to
      perform ultrasound to examine the vena cava diameter on patients just after arriving with
      major trauma. The hypothesis of the proposed study is that an ultrasound assessment protocol
      of inferior vena cava diameter and collapsibility can detect and aid management of
      non-compressible hemorrhage in major trauma victims.  After the patient has been given the 2
      liter intravenous fluid treatment, the inferior vena cava diameter will be measured again. A
      third examination 8-24 hours after admission will determine if the inferior vena cava
      diameter has returned to normal. We propose that measuring the inferior vena cava in this
      manner can predict those patients who are likely to continue bleeding and require
      interventions such as surgery.  Early detection in these patients may avoid delays in
      treatment, complications and excess mortality. Because this examination is done with
      handheld ultrasound machines, it could be done outside hospitals and in military combat
      casualty care.
