            "textblock": "Patients typically experience moderate-to-severe pain following knee arthroplasty that is\n      usually treated with a combination of oral and intravenous analgesics and enhanced by\n      continuous peripheral nerve blocks.  There are currently two locations to place a perineural\n      catheter to provide analgesia following knee arthroplasty:  a femoral nerve catheter and an\n      adductor canal catheter.  Both have been demonstrated to be effective following knee\n      arthroplasty.  However, it remains unknown if one location is superior to the other; or,\n      more accurately, what the relative benefits are to each technique.\n\n      While femoral CPNB has many benefits, one of the challenges of using this technique is that\n      there is a decrease in quadriceps muscle strength which can be a limiting factor for\n      rehabilitation.  In contrast, the adductor canal catheter affects only the vastus medialis.\n      This block may lessen block-induced quadriceps weakness following knee arthroplasty compared\n      with a femoral infusion.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that compared with femoral perineural local anesthetic\n      infusion, an adductor canal infusion is associated with a shorter time until four discharge\n      criteria are met:  (1) adequate analgesia; (2) independence from intravenous analgesics; (3)\n      ability to ambulate 30 m; and (4) ability to stand, walk 3 m, and return to a sitting\n      position without another's assistance."
