Since the optimal dosage of this\n      drug has not been found yet, it remains as a subject of clinical study that needs to be\n      examined. If initial toxicity is minimized by developing dosage/regimen that replaces the\n      standard therapy, it will be possible to provide continuous treatment with increased\n      convenience by patients and treating physicians as well as improvement for safety in elderly\n      patients or those with serious cytopenia. In addition, it is expected to lead to a better\n      response by strictly keeping a treatment schedule.\n\n      Recent US study showed that 5-day regimen showed similar treatment results, but\n      retrospective data from Spain showed lower response rate in 5-day regimen. Considering the\n      recent circumstances around dosage and schedule of azacitidine in lower risk MDS, a Phase II\n      clinical trial is planned in lower risk MDS patients in order to explore the efficacy in\n      5-day treatment by comparing prospectively with 7-day standard regimen."
