Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver\n      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining vaccine therapy\n      with a monoclonal antibody may cause a stronger immune response and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining vaccine therapy with\n      monoclonal antibody therapy in treating patients who have stage IV melanoma."

Treatment repeats every 12\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 68 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
