Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining paclitaxel with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This trial is to study the effectiveness of concurrent administration of\n      chemotherapy and radiation therapy in treating women who have stage II or stage III breast\n      cancer by examining the complications and cosmetic effects."
