Implemented by an intervention team with expertise gained from current scientific research in weight control determinants, this program as well PICO, is free of charge for all interested adults who wish to manage their weight and health. It operates since 2005 with the aims to prevent obesity or reduce excess weight, as well as, some of the risks associated with obesity in adults through a change to steady healthy habits, attitudes and behaviors. PESO has 3 months duration and it is structured in 12 sessions of one and a half hour, once a week."

The duration of each session will be 60 minutes, being that 10 minutes are for patient reception, blood pressure control, pain register or others and the effective time inside the water is 45 minutes. The indoor pool works with an air temperature around 27\u00b11\u00baC and water temperature is controlled for 30.5\u00b15\u00baC. Workout is organized in order to have a progressive overload every week or every two sessions, when occurs an introduction of a new stimulus. Water is the main instrument to create resistance and only in the last weeks, according with participants progression and if the self-reported pain controlled, drag equipment will be added."

The author's opinion is that the musculoskeletal pain is\n      the main constraint for any kind of mobility and its control should be considered as an\n      important goal in the weight management's programs. Therefore the PICO project proposes an\n      aquatic exercise program to controlling pain and other symptoms management, showing that it\n      is possible to live with the disease, and motivating the change in lifestyle, thus\n      preventing the installation or worsening of KOA.  In this way, five hypotheses were\n      formulated: H1. 3 months of aquatic exercise is enough to improve KOA symptoms and\n      functionality in obese individuals; H2. The gait parameters of obese individuals with KOA\n      can be improved by aquatic exercise; H3. Beyond the exercises skills, aquatic exercise group\n      classes can work with an educational component, promoting lifestyles changes. H4: Pain\n      reduction and a better psychological status can lead an increase of functionally, increasing\n      amount of physical activity. H5: Even if the main goal is not weight management, the aquatic\n      exercise program can lead  a weight reduction or body composition change."
