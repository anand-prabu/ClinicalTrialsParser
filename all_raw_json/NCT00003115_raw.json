Demonstrate that the duration of the\n      analgesic effects of equal blood concentrations of hydromorphone is dependent on the method\n      used to attain this concentration by comparing continuous epidural infusion with that of a\n      continuous intravenous infusion.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a double blinded, randomized study. After all patients have undergone\n      radical prostatectomy, hydromorphone is administered in two different ways. Patients receive\n      either a hydromorphone bolus injection through an epidural catheter using a patient\n      controlled analgesia pump or a hydromorphone bolus injection through an intravenous catheter\n      using a patient controlled analgesia pump. Infusion for both groups is stopped at 24 hours.\n      Patients are followed every 30 minutes for 6 hours.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued into this study over a 3 year\n      period."
