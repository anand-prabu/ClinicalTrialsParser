Combining\n      monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may be an effective treatment for hematologic\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bevacizumab combined with cytarabine\n      and mitoxantrone in treating patients who have hematologic cancer."

Patients achieving partial or complete\n      remission may receive a second course of therapy beginning approximately 30 days after the\n      completion of the first course.\n\n      Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3\n      years."
