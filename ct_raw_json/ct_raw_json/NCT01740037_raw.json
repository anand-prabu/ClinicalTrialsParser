            "textblock": "Rationale: The treatment of patients with atrial fibrillation is often inadequate due to\n      poor guideline adherence. An integrated chronic care program (ICCP) at a specialized\n      AF-clinic was found to be superior to usual care provided by a cardiologist in terms of\n      cardiovascular hospitalizations and cardiovascular mortality.\n\n      Hypothesis: treatment at a specialized AF clinic is superior to usual care in terms of\n      cardiovascular mortality and cardiovascular hospitalizations, cost-effectiveness, quality of\n      life and guideline adherence.\n\n      Objectives: primary objective is to show that an ICCP reduces cardiovascular\n      hospitalizations and mortality. The secondary objectives include cost-effectiveness,\n      guideline adherence, quality of life, patient knowledge and patient compliance in\n      medication.\n\n      Study design: randomized controlled trial with two study arms: usual care provided by\n      cardiologists (control) versus ICCP at a specialized AF-clinic (intervention) in 9 hospitals\n      in the Netherlands. In total 1716 patients with newly diagnosed AF will be included. Total\n      duration of the study is 4,5 years and total mean follow-up will be 2,4 years. Data\n      collected at inclusion, after 3, 6, 12 months and every year thereafter.\n\n      Study population: Patients older than 18 year with newly diagnosed AF.\n\n      Intervention: treatment through an ICCP at specialized AF clinics, consisting of a nurse\n      specialist, cardiologist-supervisor and a guidelines-based information-communication\n      technology (ICT) decision support program and a web-based patient centered medication\n      management tool and tailored telemonitoring."
