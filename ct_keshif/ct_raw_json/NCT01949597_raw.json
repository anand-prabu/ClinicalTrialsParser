Several theories attempt to explain these high figures. The three most widely\n      accepted are:\n\n        -  The presence of residual endometriotic tissue or residual endometriotic cells not\n           completely eradicated during surgery\n\n        -  The growth of undetected microscopic endometriosis during surgery\n\n        -  The development of endometriotic lesions de novo Patients with symptomatic\n           endometriosis diagnosed by ultrasound or MRI and suitable for surgery will participate\n           in the study. The surgical specimens sent for pathology from bladder, vagina,\n           uterosacral, sigma or rectum will be properly marked for studying the presence of\n           endometriosis."
