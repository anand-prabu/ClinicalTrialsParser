    <description>The CGI-C scale measures a physician's global impression of a participant's clinical condition at final visit in terms of change relative to the start of treatment (CGI-C). At final visit, the participants CGI-C will be categorized into a three point scale as: improvement: CGI response of very much improved, much improved or minimally improved; no change: CGI response of no change; worsening: CGI response of very much worse, much worse or minimally worse</description>

    <description>The usual adult dosage for oral use begins at 150 mg/day of pregabalin twice daily, and should be gradually increased to 300 mg/day over 1 week or more and then maintained at 300-450 mg/day as needed. Dosage should be adjusted, depending on age or symptoms. However, the daily maximum dose should not be beyond 450 mg, and should be orally administered twice daily.</description>
