    <textblock>
      In the study benefits of using mobile phone assisted remote patient monitoring including
      self-measurements of blood pressure, heart rate and weight as well as monitoring of personal
      health status are investigated in the care of heart failure patients.

    <description>Telemonitoring assisted self-care group was given a home-care package including a weight scale, a blood pressure meter, a mobile phone and self-care instructions.  A pre-installed software application in the mobile phone supported uploading of measurements and self-assessment of symptoms. The patients were advised to carry out and report the measurements together with the self-assessment once a week.</description>

    <description>The responsible nurse followed patients' status and the data once a week or more frequently if needed. Based on the reported measurements, the nurse could invite the patient for a control visit.  In case a patient did not make self-measurements as planned , the nurse contacted the patient and reminded him/ her to continue with monitoring.</description>
