Neuropeptides are substances (proteins) produced in the\n      body in very small amounts but without which the nervous system cannot function properly,\n      and which might have a role in the health of a newborn. As part of this study, we are\n      collecting blood samples from pregnant women.\n\n      Neuropeptides and hormones can be measured in blood. This study will involve three blood\n      draws from the participants arm. Demographic information will also be requested, and\n      participants will be asked to complete questionnaires about their mood and personal\n      experiences at each visit.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that participants with lower levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor\n      (BDNF) will be at increased risk for poor birth outcomes."
