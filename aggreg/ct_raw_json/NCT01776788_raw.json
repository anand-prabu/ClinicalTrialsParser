            "textblock": "The UK Prospective Diabetes Study has shown that \u03b2-cell function progressively deteriorates\n      over time in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus, irrespective of lifestyle and existing\n      pharmacological interventions. The progressive nature of type 2 diabetes is one of the major\n      challenges in the treatment of affected patients, and agents that could alter the natural\n      history of this condition would add greatly to current treatment approaches. Short-term\n      intensive insulin therapy of newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes will improve beta-cell function\n      and usually leading to a temporary remission time. The effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on\n      beta-cells is stimulation of glucose-dependent insulin release, followed by enhancement of\n      insulin biosynthesis. It is stimulating beta-cell proliferation, induction of islet\n      neogenesis, and inhibition of \u00df-cell apoptosis. Exenatide is synthetic exendin-4, GLP-1\n      receptor agonist. Exenatide exerts direct effects on \u03b2-cell, which indicates that may\n      contribute to delay disease progression. However, no study has evaluated effect of\n      short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide therapy model on \u03b2-cell function and\n      glycemic remission rate in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients. This current study is\n      thus designed to evaluate effect of short-term intensive insulin sequential exenatide\n      therapy model on \u03b2-cell function , glycemic control and glycemic remission rate in newly\n      diagnosed type 2 diabetic patients."
