Parents will then complete a sleep diary\n      (for both child and parent) and both child and parent will wear an actigraph that will\n      record movements during sleep over a 1 week period. Adult GSD patients will complete their\n      own questionnaires. Following this first assessment, they will be hospitalised over a 24\n      hour period as part of standard of care to start the modified UCCS, Glycosade, under\n      supervision and with a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. Following\n      hospitalization, the family will return home. Glucose will be monitored with the aid of the\n      CGM sensor for 5 to 7 days. The actigraphy and the sleep diary will be repeated after 2\n      weeks (for 1 week) while on Glycosade. One month after starting the modified UCCS,\n      questionnaires on quality of sleep and quality of life will be repeated."
