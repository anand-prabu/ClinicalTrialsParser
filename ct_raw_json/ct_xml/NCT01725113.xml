      The purpose of this non-inferiority study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of a
      mineral and bone disease treatment protocol based on calcitriol to one based on paricalcitol
      in hemodialysis  patients using revised Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO)
      parathyroid hormone targets.

    <textblock>
      Active vitamin D analogs have been the mainstay of treatment for patients on hemodialysis
      with mineral and bone disease (MBD) for the past decade. Intravenous calcitriol is an active
      vitamin D analog which is nearly identical to natural 1, 25 Vitamin D3. Calcitriol results
      from the hydroxylation of previtamin D3 in the liver and kidney. Paricalcitol, 19-nor-1 ,
      25-dihydroxyvitamin D2, is a newer agent vitamin D analog. This agent is believed to have an
      effect more specific to the parathyroid gland, and less specific to absorption of calcium
      and phosphorus from the gut. Although both formulations appear equally effective in
      suppressing parathyroid hormone (PTH), studies have suggested a greater calcemic effect with
      intravenous calcitriol as compared to paricalcitol (1).  Due to this, paricalcitol is the
      predominant active vitamin D analog used in hemodialysis patients in the United States.  Two
      recent changes in the management of hemodialysis patients will likely reduce the amount of
      active vitamin D analogs used in the near future: the liberalization of PTH goals according
      to international guidelines, (2) and the implementation of bundled payments for dialysis by
      Medicare. These changes challenge previous studies that have analyzed the safety and
      efficacy of these medications. The purpose of this prospective, randomized, cross-over study
      will be to determine whether calcitriol is as safe and effective as paricalcitol in the
      treatment of MBD in hemodialysis patients using the revised KDIGO parathyroid hormone
      targets. Our hypothesis is that calcitriol will be as equally safe and effective as
      paricalcitol in the treatment of MBD in hemodialysis patients.
