  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The main goal of diagnosing thyroid nodules is to differentiate the few
      malignant from the large background of benign lesion. Currently available pre-operative
      tests are unable to rule out malignancy in a subset of patients and diagnostic surgery is
      necessary. Therefore there is a need to develope the available diagnostic tools for the
      pre-operative diagnostic work-up of thyroid nodules.

      The study will investigate a novel ultrasonographic technique called Shear Wave Elastography
      (SWE) in the pre-operative evaluation of thyroid nodules.

      Hypothesis:

      1) SWE is a precise tool for evaluation of thyroid nodules in terms of inter- and
      intra-observer reliability and day-to-day variation.

      The study will be conducted as part of a larger PhD study, and an evaluation of the
      diagnostic value of thyroid SWE will be evaluated in a larger study.

      Perspectives:

      An optimization of the pre-operative risk-stratification and diagnosis of thyroid nodules
      can reduce unnecessary thyroid surgery, with a reduction in morbidity and better use of the
      economic and surgical resources.
