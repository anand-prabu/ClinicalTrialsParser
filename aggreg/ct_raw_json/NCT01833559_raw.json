With the development of social economy and the improvement of life, the incidence\n      of GDM increases to a level of 18-20% year by year. High blood glucose has a strong\n      relationship with many adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, but also influences their\n      metabolism including the increase of susceptibility of maternal type 2 diabetes and risk of\n      fetal type 2 diabetes, obesity, coronary heart disease, etc. And therefore, it is\n      significant to screening and managing maternal blood glucose to prevent maternal and fetal\n      adverse outcomes and metabolic disorder.\n\n      This multi-central prospective cohort study is supposed to study the pregnant women whose\n      fasting blood glucose is slightly increased (between 5.1 mmol/L and 7.0 mmol/L) at the first\n      gestational trimester. The aim of this study is to answer the scientific questions bellow:\n      whether interventions to whom the blood glucose is slightly increased can\n\n        1. decrease the incidence of GDM at the second gestational trimester;\n\n        2. improve gestational outcomes;\n\n        3. decrease the incidence of temporal and distant metabolic disorder of mother and her\n           child.\n\n      The result will provide scientific evidence for improving the gestational outcomes of GDM\n      women and preventing metabolic disorder of their child during adolescence and adult period."
