  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omega-3 fatty acids are provided through dietary intake of fish and seafood. Several dietary
      supplements containing omega-3 fatty acids are also commercially available. Some studies
      have described beneficial effects from omega-3 fatty acids, among them are
      anti-inflammatory, anti-thrombotic, anti-atherosclerotic, anti-arrhythmic, anti-hypertensive
      and lipid-modulating effects. Other studies have not confirmed these findings. This study
      will investigate the effects of omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and cardiovascular
      risk markers in renal transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There have been few interventional studies regarding the clinical effect of omega-3 fatty
      acids in renal transplantation. The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of
      omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant
      recipients.

      This study is a randomized double blinded placebo controlled interventional study of 140
      Norwegian renal transplant recipients. It will investigate, on the one hand, the effect of
      omega-3 fatty acids on renal function and, on the other, the effect of omega-3 fatty acids
      on cardiovascular risk markers in renal transplant recipients.

      8 weeks after transplantation, if renal function has stabilized,  patients with a eGFR&gt;30
      will be randomized to receive either 2,5 g of omega-3 fatty acids (3 capsules of Omacor a 1
      g) daily or placebo. Baseline measurements will be performed before they start taking the
      study medication. The same measurements will performed again1 year after transplantation and
      the patients stops taking the study medication.
