CT angiography and CT myocardial perfusion imaging will be\n      performed using a 320-slice MSCT Toshiba VISION Edition Aquilion One scanner according to\n      recommendations from the vendor and clinical routine developed at Rigshospitalet. Based on\n      CTA and/or CTP findings patients will be referred for invasive evaluation including\n      fractional flow reserve assessment (FFR) and treatment within 30 days. Invasive procedures\n      will be performed according to international guidelines and the frequency of\n      revascularization procedures recorded.
