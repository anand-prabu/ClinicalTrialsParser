Currently, the best way to determine the degree of fibrosis is to do a\n      liver biopsy. The investigators hope to show that measuring the degree of liver fibrosis\n      using an MRI with gadoxetate disodium is as good as or better than obtaining this\n      information by performing a liver biopsy. Gadoxetate disodium is a contrast solution given\n      through the veins that is considered safe, is approved for use by the Food and Drug\n      Administration, and is already routinely given to patients with various forms of liver\n      disease, including fibrosis."

            "textblock": "Liver damage, from a variety of causes, leads to a condition called liver fibrosis. Common\n      causes are chronic alcohol use and hepatitis C infection. The condition can progress to\n      cirrhosis and liver failure, and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States.\n      Presently, biopsy remains the only reliable way to test whether the various treatments that\n      have been proposed are working, but the risks of biopsy preclude frequent re-assessment.\n      Hence, truly personalized treatments are hampered by the lack of a non-invasive, low-risk,\n      but appropriately qualified test by which periodic assessments may be made.\n\n      In July of 2008, the FDA approved a new drug called Eovist that is absorbed by liver cells\n      and can be seen in the liver when performing an MRI. The amount and time course of Eovist\n      absorption will be different between health and fibrotic liver tissue. We believe that these\n      parameters, in combination with hematological and immunological  blood tests, can predict\n      the degree of liver fibrosis without the need for biopsy. This would allow improved\n      assessment of potentially important interventions that might alter the course of the\n      underlying disease.  Thus development of this non-invasive biomarker might not only obviate\n      the need for biopsy, but might in addition allow more intensive periodic assessments that\n      are not possible currently."
