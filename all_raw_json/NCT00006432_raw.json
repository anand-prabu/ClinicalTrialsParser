            "textblock": "There is some consensus that high fat diets can contribute to the development of obesity and\n      type 2 diabetes in humans and animals.  An increase in dietary fat has been shown to produce\n      obesity and diabetes in mice; such diet-induced diabetes can be reversed by reducing the fat\n      in the diet.  In humans, there is some evidence that low-fat diets can produce acute\n      improvements in blood sugar control in type 2 diabetes-even in the absence of weight loss.\n      In most human studies, however, dietary fat reduction has been accompanied by a reduction in\n      total calorie intake.  It is thus not possible to separate the effects of these 2 metabolic\n      changes.  The purpose of this study is to gather preliminary information on the effect of a\n      very-low-fat diet on blood metabolism in persons with type 2 diabetes.  The design\n      incorporates controlled feeding procedures, and 30 men and women with type 2 diabetes will\n      be given all foods for 4 weeks--a 2-week diet standardization period (diet composition:  35%\n      fat, 15% protein, 50% carbohydrate), followed by a 2-week experimental diet period. The\n      experimental diet conditions are A) continuation of the moderately-high-fat standardization\n      diet, or B) a very-low-fat diet composed of 10% fat, 15% protein, 75% carbohydrate.\n      Outcomes will be measured after the standardization and the experimental periods.  The\n      primary outcome variable is fasting plasma glucose; secondary outcomes are fasting insulin,\n      carbohydrate (meal) tolerance, insulin secretion and blood lipids.  In addition, we will\n      gather descriptive data on the potential acceptability and utility of a very-low-fat diet\n      constructed using the fat substitute, olestra (sucrose polyester).  There are no results\n      yet."
