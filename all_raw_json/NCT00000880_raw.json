Inhibition of\n      immune activation is therefore a potentially important area of therapy for patients with\n      early HIV infection.  CsA is capable of decreasing T cell activation, which in turn may\n      decrease HIV replication."

            "textblock": "There is increasing data on the potential for inhibition of immune activation as primary\n      therapy for HIV infection. The rationale of CsA therapy is to decrease T cell activation in\n      patients with early HIV infection. Activation of T cells leads to translation and\n      transcription of provirus, release of viral progeny, and ultimately cell death. T cell\n      activation also leads to increased cell death via apoptosis. CsA is capable of inhibiting\n      both these events and thus may lead to decreased CD4 cell turnover.\n\n      This study has 2 arms of 15 patients each. Patients in Arm I receive placebo. Patients in\n      Arm II receive CsA.  Each arm is further divided into 2 strata. Stratum 1 patients are not\n      allowed to receive antiretroviral therapy. Stratum 2 patients must receive 1 of the\n      following 4 stable nucleoside analogue combinations:\n\n        1. Zidovudine (ZDV) plus lamivudine (3TC)\n\n        2. ZDV plus didanosine (ddI)\n\n        3. Stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC\n\n        4. d4T plus ddI."
