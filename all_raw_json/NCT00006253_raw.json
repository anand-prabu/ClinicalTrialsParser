The primary outcome--total number of symptoms reported;\n\n        2. The secondary patient outcomes--reduced deterioration in physical role impact and\n           social functioning, emotional distress, levels of communication with caregiver about\n           care, and communication and satisfaction with provider care; and\n\n        3.

Second goals are to\n      improve physical and social functioning, lower emotional distress, and improve communication\n      with family caregiver in symptom management, and assist them to reduce their levels of\n      depression and burden. This research is funded through a grant from the National Cancer\n      Institutes, and builds upon the Family Care Research Team's program of supportive\n      cancer-care research.\n\n      OUTCOMES: This study tests a stepped-approach intervention to determine if it improves\n      symptom outcomes, especially pain and fatigue. Secondary outcomes addressed by the\n      intervention are physical role impact, social functioning, and emotional distress. These\n      outcomes can have significant impact on patients and family caregivers' well-being as\n      patients undergo chemotherapy. The shorter, more intense intervention corresponds to changes\n      int he clinical management of cancer patient with more intense, shorter chemotherapy\n      treatments; therefore, this intervention will be more easily translatable to the clinical\n      setting."
