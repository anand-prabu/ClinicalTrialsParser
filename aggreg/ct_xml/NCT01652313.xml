    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to fulfil regulatory requirements for registration of a new
      chemical entity in China. Rasagiline is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's Disease
      (PD) in Europe and the US. Rasagiline is safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects, and
      the efficacy and safety has been demonstrated in placebo- and active comparator-controlled
      phase III studies.
