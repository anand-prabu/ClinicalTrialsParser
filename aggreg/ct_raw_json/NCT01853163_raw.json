            "textblock": "The purpose of the study is to further investigate the safety of six different commercially\n      used Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. In order to get a better view of internal organs\n      such as the brain, joints and other body regions contrast agents containing Gadolinium are\n      often administered during magnetic resonance imaging.\n\n      Gadolinium-containing contrast agents were introduced in the 1980s, and presently many\n      different products are in common use. Although these agents are well tolerated, in 2006 it\n      was reported that some patients with severe renal failure undergoing magnetic resonance\n      contrast imaging developed signs of a rare condition known as Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis\n      (NSF). NSF is an extremely rare disease that has predominantly been reported in patients\n      with severe kidney impairment, acute kidney insufficiency due to the hepatorenal syndrome\n      (kidney failure in patients with advanced chronic liver disease) or in patients with acute\n      kidney insufficiency, who have recently had or soon expect to have a liver transplantation.\n\n      In order to collect additional clinical data on a global scale and across different agents\n      in common use, this study was requested by the European Medicines Agency to further\n      investigate whether Gadolinium in human bone and skin are retained for a long time after\n      administration of Gadolinium-containing contrast agents. It was recommended to analyse bone\n      and skin samples from patients undergoing a hip or knee replacement. Therefore, this study\n      has been developed to evaluate Gadolinium retention in patients with renal function ranging\n      from stable to severely impaired renal function who had previously received any of the six\n      different contrast agents within a magnetic reso\u00acnance contrast imaging procedure and who\n      will undergo a hip or knee replacement surgery.\n\n      For this study the patients will not be administered any research medication.\n\n      Participating sites are located in Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, Turkey, USA, Japan and\n      Republic of Korea."
