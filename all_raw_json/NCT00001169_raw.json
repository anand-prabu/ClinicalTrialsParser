In the process of working up these patients, we\n      sometimes encounter parasite isolates that are useful for research.  We also can perform\n      tests of cell-mediated immune function to evaluate how patients are responding to therapy.\n      In addition, the protocol permits us to observe therapeutic responses to other drugs besides\n      pentavalent antimony, if necessary."
