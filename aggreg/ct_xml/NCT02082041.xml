      The purpose of this study is to monitor the skin blood flow in the lower leg, with different
      levels and types of applied loads. These loads will not be placed over  the patient's wound
      nor will they be higher than loads the skin normally experiences in daily activities.  The
      results of this research will help investigators understand the development of pressure
      ulcers, commonly known as bedsores and stasis ulcers.
