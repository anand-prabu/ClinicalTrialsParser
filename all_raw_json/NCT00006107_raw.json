Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of docetaxel plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV head and neck cancer."

Patients also undergo\n      hyperfractionated radiotherapy daily, 5 days a week, for 4 weeks followed by radiotherapy\n      alone twice daily for 2 weeks.\n\n      Upon completion of chemoradiotherapy, patients not achieving complete response to induction\n      chemotherapy undergo neck surgical dissection at 4-12 weeks following completion of\n      radiotherapy.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 5 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
