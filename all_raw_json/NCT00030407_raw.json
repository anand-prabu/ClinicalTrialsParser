Combining chemotherapy and celecoxib may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of celecoxib and docetaxel in treating\n      patients who have non-small cell lung cancer."

Treatment repeats every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve a complete\n      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses after CR. Patients who achieve stable disease\n      (SD) or a partial response (PR) receive a minimum of 2 additional courses after SD or PR. At\n      the discretion of the treating physician, patients then receive maintenance therapy\n      comprising celecoxib only.\n\n      Patients who discontinue therapy for disease progression or unacceptable toxicity are\n      followed for at least 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-39 patients will be accrued for this study within 13-28\n      months."
