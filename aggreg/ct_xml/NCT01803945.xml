  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending dose study of
      orally administered AVE8112 in patients with Parkinson's Disease   (PD).  Sequential cohorts
      of eight patients with PD will be administered ascending oral doses of AVE8112 (n=6) or
      placebo (n=2) once a day for 14 days.  Dosing for subsequent cohorts will only proceed, and
      the dose level selected, after the safety and tolerability of the previous cohort has been
      reviewed. Doses are planned to be 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, and 4.0 mg once a day for 14 days.  These
      are planned treatments, but doses may be modified based on safety review of previous
      cohort(s). In addition, cohorts may be added to reconfirm a previously administered dose,
      and/or a titration strategy may be employed to reach a desired dose.

      Patients will be assessed in clinic for 30 hours following the initial oral dose of AVE8112
      or placebo. Subsequent dosing will occur on an outpatient basis.  Patients will receive
      telephone calls on Days 3 and 10 to monitor for adverse events (AEs) and concomitant
      medications, and will also be assessed in the clinic on Study Days 7 (outpatient), 14
      (outpatient), and 28 (± 3 days) (Follow-up visit). Safety assessments will include physical
      examinations, vital signs, ECGs, clinical laboratory evaluations, Movement Disorder Society
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS), and Columbia Suicide Severity Rating
      Scale (C-SSRS).   Pharmacodynamic assessment will include the Parkinson's Disease Cognitive
      Rating Scale (PD-CRS).
