    <textblock>
      Phase Ib study investigating whether liposome BLP25 mucin-1 (MUC1) peptide-specific
      immunotherapy (L-BLP25) administered as weekly subcutaneous doses over 8 weeks following a
      single dose of intravenous cyclophosphamide (CPA) induces a reproducible cytokine pattern
      measured in the serum of unresected Stage III non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) subjects
      after first-line chemo-radiation therapy.

          -  Documented stable disease or objective response, according to Response Evaluation
             Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Version 1.0, after primary chemo-radiotherapy
