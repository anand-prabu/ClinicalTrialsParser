According to the accepted guidelines, once H.pylori infection has been\n           diagnosed,first line therapy with three drugs should be given. The triple treatment\n           includes proton-pump-inhibitor-clarithromycin-amoxicillin but its eradication rate is\n           only 70-80%.\n\n        -  Curcumin has many beneficial merits and it was also been demonstrated to be efficient\n           in inhibition of H.pylori infection, in vitro.Therefore we aim to investigate whether\n           addition of Curcumin to the standard triple therapy will increase the eradication rate\n           of H.pylori infection.\n\n      Methods\n\n        -  150 consecutive patients that will undergo esophagogastroscopy in our Gastroenterology\n           department and will be positive for H.pylori according to urease test and then by\n           gastric biopsy, will be included. The patients will be randomized to two different\n           treatments, according to binomial distribution. 75 patients will be treated with the\n           standard triple therapy for 10 days and the other 75, will be treated for 10 days, with\n           triple therapy combined with Curcumin that will be given three times a day.\n\n        -  During the treatment the patients will complete an adverse effect's questionnaires. 6\n           weeks after the completion of the treatment the patients will undergo urea breath test\n           to confirm eradication. Patients will be asked to avoid antibiotics, bismuth compounds\n           or proton-pump-inhibitor until the second urea-breath-test.\n\n        -  We will compare the eradication rate and the adverse effects between the two groups by\n           using SPSS"
