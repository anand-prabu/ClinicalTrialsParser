      The purpose of this study is to compare the effect of two different implant abutment designs
      on gum tissue volume changes over time after implant placement.

      This is a randomized, prospective, controlled clinical trial comparing the facial gingival
      profiles around Atlantis™ abutments that have either a linear &quot;divergent&quot; or &quot;concave&quot;
      transitional profile on the facial and proximal aspect of the abutments.

      Sixty study subjects requiring replacement of a single-rooted tooth with an
      implant-supported restoration will be recruited.

      The Osseospeed™ Plus implant will be placed for all 60 subjects, with the use of Uni healing
      abutments to minimize lateral tissue displacement during healing. After implant placement,
      but before final impressions are obtained (8 weeks post-placement), subjects will be
      randomized to either a &quot;divergent&quot; or a &quot;concave&quot; transmucosal abutment design. For
      fabrication of the experimental abutment, Atlantis™ engineers will initially design a
      control &quot;divergent&quot; prototype that will be modified with a concavity on the facial and
      proximal transition zones to obtain an abutment that will otherwise retain all the features
      of the control abutment. Engineers will measure the linear topographical changes (ΔL=Lc-Ld)
      of the transition zone, as well as the volumetric change (x) on the mid-facial aspect of the
      abutment induced by the formation of a submucosal concavity. The primary outcome of the
      study will be the apico-coronal change of the peri-implant mucosal zenith from prosthesis
      delivery to one year.
