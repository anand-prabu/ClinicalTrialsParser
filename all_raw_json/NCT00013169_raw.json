San Diego\ufffds Short-Term Acute Residential Treatment (START) model is\n      one of the best established of these alternatives, comprising a network of 6 facilities with\n      a total of 77 beds.  Although veterans have been among those served at START programs for\n      many years, no previous study of START or any other model has focused specifically on\n      veterans.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The study tested the hypotheses that veterans treated in a START program would demonstrate\n      greater improvement in symptoms and quality of life, as well as greater satisfaction with\n      treatment and lower costs of care than veterans treated at the VA inpatient unit.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This study includes elements of both efficacy and effectiveness studies. VA psychiatric unit\n      treatment and START are compared in a randomized trial, with follow up of subjects at 2, 6,\n      and 12 months as they experience real-world treatment-as-usual. Symptoms, functioning,\n      quality of life, and satisfaction with services are assessed on multiple standardized\n      measures, as well as by qualitative assessments.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Final report is under preparation."
