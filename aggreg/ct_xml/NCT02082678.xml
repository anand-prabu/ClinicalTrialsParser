  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if ondansetron, as an add-on therapy, is associated
      with reduced depressive symptoms and alcohol use in outpatients with bipolar disorder (BPD).
      The investigators will also use blood samples to determine if the genotype for the serotonin
      transporter gene is associated with response to ondansetron.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 70 outpatients with alcohol use disorder and BPD will be enrolled in a 12-week,
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study of ondansetron.
      Participant will receive either ondansetron or a placebo for 12 weeks. He or she has an
      equal chance of receiving ondansetron or placebo.

      Randomization will be stratified based on &gt; 4 or ≤ 4 drinking days per week at start of the
      study. Ondansetron or placebo will be given at 0.5 milligrams twice a day for the first 4
      weeks. At weeks 4, 8 and 10 the dose may be increased to 1.0, 2.0 or 4.0 milligrams twice a
      day, respectively, if significant reductions in depression and alcohol use are not observed
      and the participant is not experiencing any side effects. Blood will be drawn for routine
      laboratory analyses including a complete blood count (CBC), liver panel, and CDT at baseline
      and weeks 4, 8 and 12.

      Each participant will return for weekly follow-up visits and repeat outcome measures. Pill
      counts will be conducted, and a list of current medications and doses will be recorded at
      each visit. Participants will be compensated at each appointment with a bus pass, gift
      cards, and a monetary incentive for compliance. Participants will be evaluated by both the
      research assistant (RA) and principal investigator (PI) at each visit.

      The HAMD and Timeline Followback will be given at each visit as the primary outcome
      measures. Cognitive assessments will be performed at baseline and week 12.
