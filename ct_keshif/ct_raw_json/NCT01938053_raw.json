We believe patients that are contacted by both a phone call and a text\n      message will be reached more often  and they will be reached sooner than those that only\n      receive a phone call or only a text message.  In addition, patients will be given reminder\n      cards at the time of testing to remind them that they will be contacted within 7 days if\n      they test positive.  Half of the reminder cards will have a number to call for test results.\n       We believe patients that receive a card with a number are more likely to be contacted\n      within 7 days."
