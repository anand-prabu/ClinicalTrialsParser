Based upon a complete medical history, including the physical examination, vital\n             signs (blood pressure [BP] and pulse rate [PR]), 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and\n             clinical laboratory tests;\n\n          2. Age-greater than or equal to 18 years and less than or equal to 55 years;\n\n          3. Body mass index (BMI) =18.5 to =29.9 kg/m2; and\n\n          4.

Any clinically relevant abnormal finding of the medical examination (including blood\n             pressure (BP), pulse rate (PR), and electrocardiogram (ECG) deviating from normal and\n             of clinical relevance;\n\n          2. Any evidence of a clinically relevant previous or concomitant disease as judged by\n             the investigator including gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory,\n             cardiovascular, metabolic, immunological, hormonal disorders, or diseases of the\n             central nervous system (such as epilepsy), psychiatric disorders, or neurological\n             disorders;\n\n          3.

Unwilling to avoid vigorous exercise for\n             7 days post dosing. Contact sport should be avoided during the entire study;\n\n         18. Any out-of-range laboratory values considered clinically significant by the\n             investigator; subjects with creatine kinase (CK) values three times the upper limit\n             of normal (ULN) at Day -1 are excluded from participation;\n\n         19. Subjects considered unsuitable for inclusion by the investigator (e.g., inability to\n             understand and comply with the study requirements or presence of any condition which,\n             in the opinion of the investigator, would not allow safe participation in the study);\n             or\n\n         20. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site.\n\n         21. Subjects with known Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Acquired Immunodeficiency\n             Syndrome, other clinically significant immunological disorders, or auto-immune\n             disorders, (e.g., Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), lupus erythematosus, scleroderma, etc.);\n\n         22. Subject has received a live or attenuated vaccine within 12 weeks prior to enrolling\n             in the trial; or\n\n         23. Positive finding in Interferon-gamma-release assay testing (IGRA-T).  In cases where\n             at the screening visit the IGRA result is indeterminate, the subject will have a PPD\n             skin test performed, provided that the screening period timeframe can be maintained.\n             If not, the subject will not be enrolled in this study."
