These\n           patients have a chronic renal failure moderate to end up being treated by ambulatory\n           dialysis or kidney transplantation. The patients of each population will be randomly\n           assigned in group 1 ie traditional care or in group 2 ie traditional care added by\n           telemedicine system.\n\n      Each patient and whatever the group will perform as part of its monitoring of the CKD\n      assessments at baseline , 6 months and end of study (12 months). These evaluations are about\n      compliance, quality of life, anxiety - depression state. To enhance costs the point of view\n      retained will be health insurance's point of view. Among the various costs, only direct\n      costs are considered: disease management, hospitalizations, consultations in hospitals and\n      private practice, prescribed medical transportation , home visits by health professionals,\n      additional assessments related to the evaluated intervention. A probabilistic matching with\n      the data bases of the National Information System of the Social Insurance will be performed.\n      In addition, the acceptability of the system of telemedicine by patients in the intervention\n      and health professionals will be also evaluated."
