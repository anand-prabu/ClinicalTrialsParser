At study check-in, the subjects reported to the clinical site at least 36 hours\n      prior to Day 1 dosing and were required to stay for 24 hours after Day 1 dosing.  Blood\n      sample collections were obtained within 90 minutes prior to dosing (0 hour) and after dose\n      administration at periodic interval up to 48.00 hour in each period. A total number of blood\n      draws during the study were sixty six (66) and the total volume of blood drawn did not\n      exceed 324 mL.\n\n      Following an overnight fast of at least 10 hour, a high-fat high-calorie breakfast was\n      served to the study subjects. Thirty minutes after start of this breakfast, a single oral\n      dose of Pantoprazole delayed release tablet 40 mg of either test or reference formulation\n      was administered during each period of the study, along with 240 mL of drinking water at\n      ambient temperature under low light condition and under supervision of trained study\n      personnel. Both test and reference products were administered to all the study subjects, one\n      in each period."
