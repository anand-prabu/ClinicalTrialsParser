Even a\n      mild, untoward effect on an essential function such a linguistic behavior, a directly\n      observable product of complex cognitive processes, is disruptive to daily life.\n      Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying a drug's impact on cognition are poorly understood.\n      This lack of understanding impedes the ability to predict both the effects of drugs in\n      development and the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to the cognitive impact of a\n      particular agent. Topiramate (TPM, an antiepileptic drug) is, with increasing frequency,\n      being prescribed for a range of conditions including migraine prophylaxis, obesity and pain.\n      It is a prime example of a drug that causes speech and language problems severe enough in\n      some patients to result in discontinuation of therapy. For reasons not well understood, TPM\n      has a poorer cognitive profile than many of the older antiepileptic drugs. The\n      investigators' rational for this study is that it will offer insight into the mechanisms\n      underlying drug-induced cognitive deficits."

The investigators' objective in this\n      application is to elucidate the relationship among drug exposure as measured by plasma drug\n      levels, its neurophysiological effects, and consequent effects on the cognitive processes\n      observable in everyday language use. Using topiramate (TPM) as a prototype, the\n      investigators will apply the tools of clinical pharmacology, computational linguistics,\n      neuroscience, and engineering to the design and execution of randomized, double blind,\n      crossover studies using three (3) doses of  TPM, one (1) dose of a comparator drug\n      (lorazepam-LZP) and a placebo. In order to isolate the cognitive effects of TPM from those\n      possibly arising from an underlying medical condition, subjects will be healthy adults. The\n      investigators will capitalize on an innovative system for automated language and speech\n      analysis (SALSA) developed in our laboratory, to quantify the effects of TPM administration\n      on effective language use, a crucial component of normal day-to-day functioning."
