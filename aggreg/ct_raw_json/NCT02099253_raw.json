            "textblock": "Dexmedetomidine(DEX) is a novel , highly selective \u03b12 adrenergic receptor agonists , and its\n      selectivity for \u03b12 receptor is 1600 times higher than \u03b11.It also could provide\n      dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and inhibition of sympathetic nerves and\n      other effects .At earlier time  It was approved by the FDA only for short-time sedation\n      during mechanical ventilation of adult patients (<24h) in ICU. Because of its minimal impact\n      on the respiratory , currently it was more and more widely used to sedate patients\n      undergoing regional anesthesia.Many anesthetic pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are\n      often affected by age and gender,such as the drug sensitivity of  propofol and remifentanil\n      is increased with age,while the current study also demonstrated that gender may influence\n      the sedate efficacy of propofol and the sensitivity of muscle loose of rocuronium. Current\n      studies with regard to the effects of age and gender on dexmedetomidine pharmacodynamic are\n      rare. The study is aim to explore the right DEX dose of different Age and gender of patients\n      to produce suitable sedation.Dexmedetomidine be used in patients with combined spinal and\n      epidural anesthesia for sedation,which is monitored by the BIS,during the operation.The\n      relation between BIS values and the depth of sedation for patients is also investigated."
