      Identify a biologic (molecular) basis for the increased susceptibility of cigarette smokers
      to pulmonary TB (Mtb) by testing the hypothesis that smoking reprograms AM polarization
      towards a distinct phenotype associated with impaired host defense function against Mtb and
      that normalization of that phenotype via therapeutic modulation of the AM macrophage
      polarization or smoking cessation can restore the anti-Mtb host defense function of AM.

        Recruitment will be from the referral base of the responsible investigator and other
        physicians, and review of admissions and hospital database. Patients, who may qualify for
        this study, will be identified by chart review, physician referral, and recruited by study
        investigators. The source of potential subjects will be the population of potential
        subjects with TB (smokers or non smokers), and with both TB and COPD, as defined before.
        Accrual will be random with no bias as to gender or racial/ethnic group.
