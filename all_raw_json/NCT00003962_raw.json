Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of interleukin-2 following\n      allogeneic T-cell depleted bone marrow transplant in patients with hematologic malignancies\n      at high risk of relapse. II. Determine the optimal dose of interleukin-2 in this regimen\n      which will result in maximal natural killer cell and lymphokine activated killer cell\n      activity in vitro.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive CD34+ stem cell augmented donor\n      bone marrow on day 0 on another protocol. Patients then receive interleukin-2 (IL-2)\n      subcutaneously on day 30. Treatment continues for 12 weeks in the absence of dose limiting\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 4 patients receive escalating doses of IL-2 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose prior to that which causes at least\n      grade 3 toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
