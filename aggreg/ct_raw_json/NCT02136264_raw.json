Hence a personalized categorical food avoidance diet averts\n      relapse and maintains remission of psoriasis, with side benefit on blood pressure and other\n      metabolic parameters (J Hypertension 2012; 30: e-suppl 1, poster 158). Study hypothesis:\n      this dietary approach would improve the control of essential hypertension. A randomized\n      controlled clinical trial is proposed to compare this dietary approach with conventional\n      DASH-type dietary counselling. 40 study participants will be randomly assigned to either\n      conventional or interventional dietary counselling. They will be comprehensively monitored\n      (including gene expression studies) for two years. Outcome criteria will include blood\n      pressure, complications of hypertension, side-benefit on comorbidity, and requirement for\n      antihypertensive drugs."
