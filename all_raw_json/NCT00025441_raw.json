Patients are stratified according to risk group\n      (standard vs high).\n\n      Standard-risk patients:\n\n        -  Initial chemotherapy: Patients receive vincristine IV on day 1 for weeks 1-7. Patients\n           also receive dactinomycin IV on day 1 and ifosfamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of week\n           1. Patients then receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour and epirubicin IV over 6 hours on\n           day 1 of week 4. Patients then receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over\n           4 hours on days 1-3 of week 7. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 3 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. After the second course,\n           patients with less than 50% partial response (PR) are removed from study.\n\n      Patients with parameningeal disease undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for about 8 weeks\n      beginning at week 9.\n\n        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, vincristine\n           IV, and dactinomycin IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 9 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who remain in PR at week 17 undergo radiotherapy for about 9 weeks beginning at\n      week 18.\n\n      High-risk patients:\n\n        -  Initial chemotherapy: Patients receive window study drug carboplatin IV over 1 hour or\n           doxorubicin on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 of week 7. Beginning\n      on day 8, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV or subcutaneously (SC) daily until day 13.\n      Patients may undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose etoposide IV over 24 hours on days 15-17. Beginning on day 22,\n      patients receive G-CSF IV or SC daily until day 27.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days 29-31. Beginning on day\n      36, patients receive G-CSF IV or SC daily until day 42. Patients may undergo PBSC collection\n      if not previously performed. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are removed from\n      study.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 44-48. Patients undergo PBSC\n      reinfusion on day 52. Beginning on day 55, patients receive G-CSF IV or SC daily until blood\n      counts recover.\n\n        -  Maintenance chemotherapy: Patients receive maintenance chemotherapy comprising\n           cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and dactinomycin in the same manner as the standard-risk\n           patients.\n\n      Patients with parameningeal disease and those not achieving CR undergo radiotherapy\n      beginning at week 17. Patients achieving CR, unless metastatic disease is resected, undergo\n      radiotherapy beginning on week 15.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 2 years, every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-30 standard-risk patients will be accrued for this study\n      within 4 years. A total of 15-75 high-risk patients will be accrued for this study within\n      4-5 years."
