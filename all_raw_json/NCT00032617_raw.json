We propose to compare exposure therapy, Prolonged Exposure, with a\n      comparison therapy that focuses on current problems, Present Centered Therapy.\n\n      The study is a randomized clinical trial involving 384 female veterans and active duty\n      personnel in 11 VA medical centers and 1 DoD medical center.  All subjects, even\n      self-referrals, will enter the study through referrals by mental health clinicians at the\n      participating sites.  Following informed consent, subjects will be screened for inclusion\n      and exclusion diagnoses.  If they meet these criteria and agree to participate, they will be\n      randomly assigned to one of the two treatments, which will occur weekly for 10 weeks.\n      Subjects will be assessed before treatment, immediately following treatment, and 3 and 6\n      months after the end of treatment.  The primary outcome is PTSD severity.  Secondary\n      outcomes are anxiety and depression.  Exploratory outcomes include associated features of\n      PTSD, such as dissociation and substance abuse; psychosocial functioning, quality of life,\n      physical health, satisfaction with treatment, and service utilization.  Both treatments will\n      be described in detail in a treatment manual and monitored intensively to ensure that they\n      are administered correctly."

The\n      Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) is considered to be the gold-standard for PTSD\n      assessment.\n\n      Secondary Hypothesis:  PE will be more effective than PCT for treating the anxiety and\n      depression that often are comorbid with PTSD.\n\n      Study Abstract:  As noted in a recent report on the VA Women's Health Project, it is\n      important to study women veterans because they are increasingly seeking VA health care.  For\n      many women veterans, Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is a specific healthcare concern\n      that is associated with substantial psychosocial and functional disability.\n\n      The study was proposed in response to the Research Priority Announcement on Posttraumatic\n      Stress Disorder research issued August 1, 1997, as a study aimed a special subpopulation of\n      VA patients with PTSD:  women veterans who have been traumatized during their military\n      service.\n\n      The first planning meeting for the study was held January 20-21, 2000 in Washington, DC.\n      The protocol was submitted on August 1, 2000; it was reviewed and approved by the\n      Cooperative Studies Evaluation Committee on October 10, 2000.  Intake of training cases is\n      expected to begin 01/01/2002."
