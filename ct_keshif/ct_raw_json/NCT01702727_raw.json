The game has been specially configured to\n      ensure the amblyopic eye is preferentially stimulated and the patient wears shutter glasses\n      which manipulate the image seen by each eye in order to provide more information to the\n      amblyopic eye.  Patients will be randomised to play the computer game using the I-BiTTM\n      technology, play the computer game but without the I-BiTTM technology, or watch a DVD using\n      the I-BiTTM technology."
