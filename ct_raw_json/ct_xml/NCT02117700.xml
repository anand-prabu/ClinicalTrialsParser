  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although weight reduction through physical activity-based interventions is the mainstay
      therapy for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), its maintenance is difficult and
      typically unsuccessful. This affirms the extreme need for alternate and/or adjunct
      therapies. Although convincing data from animal studies and a few adult human studies on the
      benefits of a natural product, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC), in a variety of liver conditions
      including NAFLD have emerged, studies in children are scarce. Therefore, the aim of the
      study is to test the use NAC as an innovative approach to attenuate the progression of NAFD
      in obese children. The central hypothesis is that NAC supplementation will reduce liver fat
      and liver enzymes and ameliorate risk factors of cardiometabolic disease in children with
      NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (PA)-induced weight reduction, the suggested therapy for noalcoholic liver
      disease (NAFLD), is difficult and its maintenance is typically unsuccessful in children,
      affirming the acute need for alternative/adjunct therapies. Although few promising
      approaches have been reported, the benefits are incongruent and mostly marginal. N-acetyl
      cysteine (NAC), a derivative of the natural amino acid, cysteine, appears to be promising as
      an adjunct therapy to PA. Animal and a few adult human studies suggest NAC-induced
      attenuation of liver abnormalities, oxidative stress, insulin resistance and inflammation.
      The primary aim of the proposal is to determine in obese children with elevated liver
      enzymes the effect of NAC at two different doses on liver fat using magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI), liver enzymes and risk factors of cardiometabolic disease. We hypothesize
      that NAC will produce beneficial effect on these parameters.
