            "textblock": "The woman fertility decrease with the age and there is a closely link with the ovarian\n      reserve, the number of available eggs in the ovaries. Therefore, it is important to evaluate\n      the ovarian reserve with specific marker to have a better prediction of the response of the\n      in vitro fertilization treatment and to have a better rate of pregnancy.\n\n      Until now, a lot of clinical criteria (age, duration of the infertility, number of antral\n      follicles) and biological (FSH, Oestradiol, Inhibin B, EFFORT test, number of the eggs at\n      the retrieval day) was suggested to help for the estimation of the ovarian reserve.\n\n      Since couple of years, the anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) is recognize to be one of the best\n      ovarian reserve marker, it corresponding the number of antral follicles, it is more\n      sensitive and predictive.  Moreover, during the In-Vitro Fertilization, the anti-m\u00fcllerian\n      hormone can provide the weak responds at the stimulation and the reverse, the risk of\n      excessive responds (hyperstimulation). To choose the gonadotropin doses to administrate\n      (stimulation ovarian hormone) during an In-Vitro Fertilization protocol, we need to know the\n      anti-m\u00fcllerian   hormone dosage. However, if the anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone is recognize to\n      evaluate the quantity of available eggs in the ovaries, his role to determine the quality of\n      these eggs still discussed.\n\n      The goal of this study is to verify if the serum anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (blood) is a good\n      indicator for the quality of the reserve ovarian evaluating the impact of anti-m\u00fcllerian\n      hormone rate on the pregnancy rate and implantation rate, during stimulate In-Vitro\n      Fertilization protocol."
