            "textblock": "Qigong is a mind-body exercise rooted in the paradigm of traditional Chinese medicine,\n      aiming to achieve a harmonious flow of energy (qi) in the body through gentle movements and\n      is thus considered as a holistic health practice towards promoting physical and mental\n      well-being and improving longevity. It was suggested that qigong exercise, as a stress\n      management strategy, could be effective in improving psychological symptoms, as well as\n      enhancing cellular telomerase activity by reducing oxidative stress level and regulating\n      immune response.\n\n      The study is to evaluate the effects of a qigong intervention on telomerase activity and\n      pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived stress, perceived coping, and depressive symptoms in\n      Chinese women with a history of intimate partner violence. The study design is a randomized,\n      wait-list controlled design with intervention and wait-list control groups. A total of 240\n      Chinese abused women will be recruited. The qigong intervention program consists of: (i) a\n      2-hr group qigong training twice a week for 6 weeks; (ii) weekly group follow-up of a 1-hour\n      group qigong exercise for 4 months; and (iii) self-practice of qigong exercise for 30\n      minutes each day throughout the intervention period lasting 5.5 months. It is hypothesized\n      that the participants in the intervention group will have higher levels of telomerase\n      activity and perceived coping, and lower levels of pro-inflammation cytokines, perceived\n      stress, and depressive symptoms, on completion of a qigong intervention program, compared to\n      abused Chinese women in the wait-list control group."
