  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy, Total skin electron beam therapy (TSEBT), achieves a high response rate
      and is an effective treatment for cutaneous T-cell lymphoma affecting the superficial
      region. One the most widely used TSEBT techniques consists of six dual fields initially
      developed at Stanford University. However, deviations occur from the prescription dose up to
      40% and the surface dose inhomogeneity as much as 90% in body areas such as the perineum and
      eyelid.

      Helical tomotherapy (HT) has advantages in irradiating extended volumes with treatment
      length of up to 160 cm, continuously in a helical pattern without the need for field
      junction. Using HT, an image-guided intensity-modulated radiotherapy, to replace
      conventional TSEBT technique to increase dose delivery and decrease toxicities possibly.
      Recently, we published the possibility of helical irradiation of the total skin (HITS) by
      physical proving and showed the clinical results of HITS successfully for a woman with T
      cell lymphoma failure by chemotherapy, topic UV irradiation and local radiotherapy (RT) to
      overcome the surface dose inhomogeneity by conventional RT.

      Here, investigators will enroll the stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of
      International Society Cutaneous Lymphomas (ISCL)/U.S. Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium
      (USCLC)/European Organization for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), patients who are
      candidates for TSEBT by recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines
      (Version 4.2011, Mycosis fungoid/Sezary syndrome) or who are refractory or not feasible to
      the topic UV irradiation, Interferon alpha, psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy,
      and Accutane® (Isotretinoin) or chemotherapy to receive HITS to replace TSEBT. Additionally,
      we will compare the advantages and disadvantages between the plan of HT and conventional RT
      for TSEBT.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The stage I-IV cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) of International Society Cutaneous
             Lymphomas (ISCL) and U.S. Cutaneous Lymphoma Consortium (USCLC)/European Organization
             for Research &amp; Treatment of Cancer (EORTC), patients who are candidates for TSEB by
             recommendation of National Comprehensive Cancer Network Guidelines (Version 4.2011,
             Mycosis fungoid/Sezary syndrome)

          2. Patients who are refractory or not feasible to the topic UV irradiation, Interferon
             alpha, psoralen plus ultraviolet A photochemotherapy, and Isotretinoin or
             chemotherapy.

          3. Eligibility criteria included the following: Karnofsky status 70% or greater;
             creatinine clearance greater than 50 mL/min; cardiac left ventricular ejection
             fraction 50% or greater; aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase less
             than 2.5 times the upper limits of institutional normal; adequate pulmonary function
             as shown by a forced expiratory volume of greater than 60%; and peripheral neuropathy
             grade 1 or lower. Patients were preassessed for their ability to lie supine for
