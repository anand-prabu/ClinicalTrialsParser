            "textblock": "Human recombinant interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) is a biological signalling protein playing a key\n      role in the regulation of the immune system.  At high doses, rhIL-2 activates the immune\n      effectors T cells (TEFFS) while at low doses rhIL-2 induces and activates regulatory T cells\n      (TREGS), a population of immune cells controlling the immune Teff response. In patients with\n      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), TREGS fail to control the autoimmune destruction by TEFFS of\n      pancreatic beta-cells producing insulin. The investigator recently showed that rhIL-2 at low\n      dose is well tolerated in patients with an autoimmune disease and in adults with established\n      T1D, inducing TREGS without effects on TEFFS. The investigators aim to use rhIL-2 at low\n      dose to induce/stimulate TREGS in young recently diagnosed T1D patients. This study will\n      investigate the dose effect relationship of low dose rhIL-2 on TREG induction such as to\n      optimize the risk benefit ratio of this treatment in T1D. Through Treg induction, the\n      investigators aim to protect the remaining/regenerating pancreatic \u03b2-cells from autoimmune\n      destruction, thus improving or even curing T1D."
