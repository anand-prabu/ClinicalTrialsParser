Results will be compared to a matched group of\n      patients undergoing anodal tDCS as well as a control group receiving sham tDCS. Functional\n      and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) before/after the intervention and during a 3\n      month follow-up will help investigating neural correlates of expected changes in motor\n      function of the affected upper extremity."
