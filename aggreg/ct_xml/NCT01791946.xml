  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness of an investigational
      binocular treatment in improving vision in strabismic amblyopes (i.e., patients with lazy
      eye, or poor vision in one eye due to a present or former eye misalignment).  Patients will
      be randomized to receive the study treatment either before or after strabismus surgery
      (i.e., corrective eye alignment surgery) or sham treatment before surgery.  The study
      hypothesis is that there will be no significant change in vision in neither the pre nor
      post-surgery groups and no significant change in vision in neither the sham nor actual
      treatment groups.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary outcome variable is a composite of the difference in visual acuity and stereo vision measurements taken before binocular treatment and strabismus surgery versus after binocular treatment and strabismus surgery.</measure>
    <time_frame>This is a change outcome measure.  That is measurements will be taken at baseline, 6 weeks, and approximately 3 months.</time_frame>

    <intervention_name>Binocular Treatment Training</intervention_name>
    <description>The binocular treatment training involves the completion of visual tasks via virtual reality goggles.  The stimulus is presented to each eye separately, allowing for varying levels of contrast to be presented to each eye.  (The visual task is therefore made more or less difficult with the variation of contrast presented to either eye.)  Subjects will complete the computer-based visual tasks for approximately 36 hours total over the course of six weeks, or six hours per week for six weeks.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of amblyopia in one eye due to congenital strabismus.

          -  Amblyopic eye has a fully-corrected visual acuity of 20/30 or less with no other
             cause for the visual loss except amblyopia.

          -  Patient is 18 to 60 years old.

          -  Corrected vision in other eye is normal.

          -  Eligible for strabismus surgery or has completed it previously with a successful
             outcome, as determined by the treating physician.

          -  Available and willing to comply with examination procedures and schedule.

          -  Signed and dated informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Fully-corrected visual acuity of less than 20/30 in both eyes.

          -  Visual decrement due to anything other than amblyopia.

          -  At high risk for developing intractable diplopia (double vision) if vision in weak
             eye is improved.  (To be determined by treating physician.)

          -  Unable or unavailable to complete at least 18 hours of binocular treatment over the
             course of six weeks.

          -  Currently enrolled in another research study.
