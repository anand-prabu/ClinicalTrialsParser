            "textblock": "The risk of malaria and hematologic toxicities from hydroxyurea in children with SCA living\n      in malaria endemic regions is unknown.\n\n      Some changes associated with hydroxyurea treatment (increased nitric oxide and HbF) would be\n      expected to protect against malaria, but the data on hydroxyurea-related endothelial changes\n      thought to be important in malaria pathogenesis (e.g. intracellular adhesion molecule\n      (ICAM)-1, von Willebrand factor (VWF), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1) is unclear, with some\n      studies suggesting that these factors might be increased with hydroxyurea and others\n      suggesting no difference or a decrease.\n\n      The specific aims of this study are as follows:\n\n        1. Determine the incidence of malaria in children with sickle cell anemia treated with\n           hydroxyurea vs. placebo\n\n        2. Establish the frequency of hematologic toxicities and adverse events in children with\n           sickle cell anemia treated with hydroxyurea vs. placebo\n\n        3. Define the relationship between hydroxyurea treatment and fetal hemoglobin (HbF),\n           soluble ICAM-1 (sICAM-1) and nitric oxide (NO) levels, and between levels of these\n           factors and risk of subsequent malaria.\n\n      Two hundred children from the Mulago Hospital Sickle Cell Clinic (MHSCC) in Kampala, Uganda\n      will be randomized to receive either hydroxyurea (100) or placebo (100) at a fixed dose of\n      20 \u00b1 2.5 mg/kg/day. The primary study endpoints will be evaluated after twelve months of\n      study treatment. After twelve months of study treatment, children will enter a follow-up\n      phase during which they can receive an additional twelve months of open-label hydroxyurea\n      treatment if they/their parents wish to do so after consultation with local physicians at\n      the MHSCC.\n\n      The working hypotheses of this research study are:\n\n        1. The incidence of malaria is not greater in children with SCA treated with hydroxyurea\n           than those treated with placebo\n\n        2. Children with SCA treated with hydroxyurea will have more medication-related\n           hematologic toxicities, such as neutropenia, but no increase in SCA-related adverse\n           events (e.g. pain crises, hospitalizations, requirement for blood transfusion) compared\n           to children treated with placebo\n\n        3. Hydroxyurea will increase HbF and plasma NO levels and decrease plasma sICAM-1 levels;\n           HbF and plasma NO levels will inversely correlate, and plasma sICAM-1 levels will\n           positively correlate, with subsequent malaria incidence"
