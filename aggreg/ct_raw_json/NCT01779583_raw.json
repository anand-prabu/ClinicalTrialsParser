It has been demonstrated that the content and function of exosomes depends on the\n      originating cell and the conditions under which they are produced. Tumor exosome production,\n      transfer and education of bone marrow cells supports tumor growth and metastasis.\n\n      In this prospective translational study, preclinical and clinical phases have been designed.\n       On the first step, the main goal is to characterize the molecular profile of gastric cancer\n      derived exosomes. This exosome biosignature may provide a useful diagnostic tool. As a\n      second step, the study will evaluate the prognostic and predictive value of gastric cancer\n      exosomes levels in plasma and kinetics in a prospectively recruited cohort of advanced\n      gastric cancer patients during first-line chemotherapy."
