The goal of the proposed study is to address this hypothesis and demonstrate that\n      the strength of the type I IFN signature in psoriatic skin is the major determinant of the\n      clinical response to anti-TNF treatment.\n\n      Purpose: Determine the strength of the type I interferon and TNF signal in psoriatic skin\n      prior to and during treatment with etanercept and correlate with degree of clinical\n      improvement.\n\n      Study Population: up to 50 subjects, men or women over the age of 18 with clinically stable\n      plaque psoriasis, who meet the wash out requirements and other exclusion criteria\n\n      Psoriatic patients will receive 100 mg etanercept per week (2 separate single-use pre-filled\n      50 mg subcutaneous injections taken on two separate days) for 3 months.\n\n      Procedures: Urine pregnancy test, TB test, photography, Physical Examinations, Skin\n      Examinations, Study Drug, Peripheral blood and biopsies\n\n      Anticipated Results: We expect that patients with strong IFN-\u03b1 signature in psoriatic skin\n      along with weak TNF-\u03b1 signature will have minimal response to anti-TNF treatment, while\n      patients with the opposite pattern, weak IFN and strong TNF signature, will have significant\n      clinical improvement."
