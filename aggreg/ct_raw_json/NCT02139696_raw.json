Activated microglia can be detected in vivo with a translocator protein (TSPO),\n      expressed in activated, but not resting microglia) binding radioligands and positron\n      emission tomography (PET). 11Carbon-PK11195 radioligand is one such radioligand.\n      Importantly, the possible effect of MS therapies on microglial activity can be evaluated in\n      patients in vivo with PET-imaging performed before and after the treatment."
