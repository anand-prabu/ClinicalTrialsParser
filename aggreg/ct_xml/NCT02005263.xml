  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Disease of the fallopian tubes is one of the most common reasons for infertility. The most
      common test, a hysterosalpingogram, tends to be painful,inconvenient, and frequently misses
      concurrent uterine disease. We propose using a less painful technique (through modified
      office hysteroscopy) for tubal assessment that can be performed in the office rather than
      hospital radiology and that uses gold standard technology for identifying coexisting uterine
      conditions.
