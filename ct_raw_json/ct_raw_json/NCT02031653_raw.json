Penile cuff test provides a means of obtaining a urodynamic diagnosis with a high level\n           of accuracy without the morbidity and expense of invasive Pressure flow study.\n\n        2. Penile cuff test may be particularly useful in the counseling of patients prior to\n           benign prostatic hyperplasia operation. Patients diagnosed as obstructed following a\n           penile cuff test can be reassured that surgery has a high chance of resulting in\n           symptomatic benefit"
