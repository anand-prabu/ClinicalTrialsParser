  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endoscopic correction of VUR has gained its popularity due to its less invasiveness,
      associated low morbidity and short hospital stay. Although short term follow-up had
      justified their efficacy; however, long term recurrence and complications following
      endoscopic correction were also being reported in the literatures (6). Currently, there are
      insufficient evidences on the efficacy and safety of biocompatible tissue augmenting
      materials used for endoscopic correction of VUR; particularly on the new tissue bulking
      agents. (6)  Polyacrylate polyalcohol copolymer (PPC)-Vantris ® (Promedon, Cordoba,
      Argentina) is the newest tissue augmenting biocompatible Acrylics used for endoscopic
      correction of VUR.
