Various fatigue tests have been utilized to examine\n      the effectiveness of beta-alanine supplementation. The physical working capacity test has\n      been used to show significant increases in physical working capacities following\n      supplementation. The physical working capacity tests were originally developed by Moritani\n      et al. 1981 and Devries et al. 1982 to measure the point of onset of muscular fatigue. It is\n      hypothesized that beta-alanine will increase physical working capacity at heart rate\n      threshold, thereby signifying a delay in fatigue."
