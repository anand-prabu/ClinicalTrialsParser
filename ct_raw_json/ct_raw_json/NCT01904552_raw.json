Each tooth was extracted and actual\n      working length (AWL) was determined by inserting a size 15 K-file until the tip could be\n      seen at a position tangential to the major foramen and then 0.5 mm was subtracted from the\n      measurement. The distance from the AWL to the file tip was calculated and compared between\n      the two groups by t-test. The accuracy of each ERCLMD within \u00b10.5 mm was compared between\n      the groups by Fisher's test. Statistical significance was set at P < .05."
