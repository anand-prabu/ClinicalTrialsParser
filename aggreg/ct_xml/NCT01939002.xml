  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the proportion of relapsing multiple
      sclerosis (RMS) patients who experience new and/or increased flu-like symptoms (FLS)
      transitioning from nonpegylated interferon beta (IFN-β) therapies to BIIB017.  Secondary
      objectives of this study in this study population are: to determine the severity and
      frequency (measured by flu-like symptom score [FLS-S]) of FLS in these subjects; to
      determine the duration (measured in number of hours) of FLS in these subjects; to determine
      the effect of BIIB017 on other patient reported outcomes (PROs) including treatment
      satisfaction (measured with the Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for Medication [TSQM])
      and disability status (measured with the Patient Determined Disease Steps [PDDS]) over a
      56-week period; to determine whether interferon-related FLS result in missed days of
      work/daily activities (e.g., absenteeism); to assess the use of additional medications (in
      addition to current medications used to treat FLS) to relieve BIIB017-related FLS; to
      determine the incidence of adverse events (AEs) throughout the study period; to characterize
      the immunogenicity profiles of patients switching from prior IFN-β therapy to BIIB017.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have a confirmed diagnosis of relapsing forms of MS, as defined by McDonald
             criteria #1-4 [Polman 2005].

          -  Must have an EDSS score between 0.0 and 5.0.

          -  Must have been treated with IFN-β and must be receiving treatment with stable dose of
             IFN for at least 4 months immediately prior to screening.

          -  All male patients and female patients of childbearing potential must practice
             effective contraception during the study and be willing and able to continue
             contraception for 3 months after their last dose of study treatment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary progressive, secondary progressive, or progressive relapsing MS [Lublin and
             Reingold 1996]. These conditions require the presence of continuous clinical disease
             worsening over a period of at least 3 months. Patients with these conditions may also
             have superimposed relapse but are distinguished from patients with relapsing MS by
             the lack of clinically stable periods or clinical improvement.

          -  History of severe allergic or anaphylactic reactions or known hypersensitivity.

          -  History of malignant disease, including solid tumors and hematologic malignancies
             (with the exception of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin that have
             been completely excised and are considered cured).

          -  History of seizure disorder or unexplained blackouts OR history of a seizure within 3
             months prior to Baseline.

          -  Known allergy to any component of the BIIB017 formulation.

          -  An MS relapse that has occurred within the 50 days prior to randomization and/or lack
             of stabilization from a previous relapse prior to randomization (Day 1).
