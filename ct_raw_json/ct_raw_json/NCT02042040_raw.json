            "textblock": "There is a lack of safety data regarding the combination of radiation and vemurafenib.  The\n      lack of data is due to the early and late stage clinical studies with vemurafenib excluding\n      concomitant or closely scheduled radiation therapy.   There have been anecdotal observations\n      of increased radiotoxicity when giving full doses of radiation therapy concomitantly with\n      vemurafenib.  The rate of these reactions is presently not known nor is the mechanism,\n      though the toxicity may be due to radiation enhancement.  Therefore, there is a pressing\n      need for information and guidance for a clinical scenario that will become very common now\n      that vemurafenib is approved by the FDA and widely used in the community.  Furthermore,\n      future studies in melanoma using radiation combined with BRAF inhibition will be possible\n      only after good safety data are established.\n\n      Although highly successful in creating tumor responses in BRAFV600 mutant metastatic\n      melanoma, the progression free survival remains, on average, 6 months with vemurafenib.  A\n      very common emerging problem exists when patients have had a dramatic tumor response to\n      vemurafenib at multiple sites, but later progress in a few areas which may be symptomatic;\n      this scenario can be defined as oligoprogressive disease.  Of those vemurafenib treated\n      patients who have progressive disease, the percentage of patients who progress in this way\n      is approximately 45%.  A common and widely used approach to treat oligoprogressions for\n      melanoma patients on other chemotherapy or immunotherapy is to treat the progressive or\n      symptomatic areas with radiation or surgery, while continuing on a systemic treatment which\n      has overall clinical benefit to the patient.  Small numbers of patients with\n      oligoprogressions on vemurafenib have been treated with radiation and/or surgery and have\n      enjoyed significant progression free survival.  In fact those eligible for this approach had\n      a median overall survival of >9.1 months vs. 3.4 months for those who did not undergo local\n      therapy and resume vemurafenib due to multiple progressing areas.  Furthermore, the patients\n      in the oligoprogressive population (73% Stage IV M1c), had a median OS of >25.5 months which\n      is more than would be expected for patients with disease this advanced.  The longer term\n      follow up of these patients will be reported soon.  These preliminary data suggest that\n      treating oligoprogressions with local therapy followed by continued vemurafenib will be\n      advantageous."
