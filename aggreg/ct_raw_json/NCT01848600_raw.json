The study\n      follows the CONSORT 2010 statements Participant will be invited to participate in an on-line\n      survey with a secured web site. Participants, after a characteristic description will be\n      randomized in one of the two arms: 1) abstract with a \" limitations \" section 2) abstract\n      without a \" limitations \" section.\n\n      ELIGIBILITY Eligible participants are corresponding authors of randomized trials published\n      between 2010 and 2012 and referenced in pubmed core set journal\n\n      INTERVENTION We will evaluate the impact of the presence of a \" limitations \" section in\n      abstract of systematic review with meta-analysis.\n\n      SELECTION OF ABSTRACTS We will retrieve all systematic review with meta-analysis published\n      in the journals Annals of Internal Medicine between the years 2006 and 2012, about health\n      care intervention with a conclusion in favor the experimental treatment or intervention. We\n      exclude updates, diagnostical, genetical, epidemiological or economical evaluation and\n      multiple or indirect comparisons.\n\n      MODIFICATION OF ABSTRACTS All selected abstracts will be standardised. Treatment name will\n      be replaced with \"experimental treatment A\", control treatment will be replaced by \"control\n      treatment B\" if necessary in the title and in the abstract.\n\n      The two groups of abstract will be presented as follow:\n\n        1. Abstract with \" limitations \" section\n\n        2. Abstract without \" limitations \" section: the \" limitations \" section of the original\n           abstract will be deleted.\n\n      OUTCOMES PRIMARY OUTCOME The primary outcome will be, the readers' recommendation of the\n      experimental treatment A\n\n      SECONDARY OUTCOMES Secondary outcomes will evaluate the interpretation of the results of the\n      meta-analysis. The readers will answers the following questions, with the choice of answers\n      based on a 10-point Likert scale\n\n        1. How would you rate the quality of the systematic review?\n\n        2. How confident are you in the results of this systematic review?\n\n        3. Do you consider that the experimental treatment A is a proven effective treatment?\n\n        4. How confident are you in the validity of the conclusion that the authors draw? NUMBER\n           OF PARTICIPANT A power analysis was conducted to estimate the number of subject\n           (participants) needed to achieve a power of 0.9 and an alpha value of 0.05 to discern a\n           different of effect size of 0.4 between the two versions of abstract. This resulted in\n           an estimate to the need of recruit a minimum of 133 participants in each arm, either a\n           total of 266 participants STATISTICAL ANALYSIS We will analyze data with R project\n           software, in intention to treat. Data for quantitative variables are expressed with\n           medians and interquartile (IQR) ranges. Qualitative variables are expressed with\n           frequencies and percentages and missing data Primary analysis will compare means of the\n           primary outcome between the 2 groups with a Student t test."
