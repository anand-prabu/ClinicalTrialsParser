        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects between 18 and 75 years of age;

          2. Undergoing elective vascular surgical procedures and with the  presence of an
             appropriate Target Bleeding Site (TBS) requiring an adjunct to achieve hemostasis as
             identified intra-operatively by the surgeon  ;

          3. Able  and willing to comply with procedures required by protocol;

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to any study related procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with any intra-operative findings that may preclude conducting of the study
             procedures;

          2. Intended use of Fibrin Sealants (including autologous Fibrin Sealants) other than
             Bioseal on the TBS;

          3. Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or unwilling to receive blood products;

          4. Subjects with known allergies to or previously used porcine derived products;

          5. Female subjects who are known breastfeeding or pregnant or intend to become pregnant
             during the clinical study period.

          6. The subject, in the opinion of the investigator, would not be suitable for
             participation in the study.

          7. Subjects who participated in another trial within 30 days prior to the planned start
             of treatment.
