  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KRX-0502,
      administered without food, in treating iron deficiency anemia in subjects with stage 3 to 5
      non-dialysis dependent chronic kidney disease (NDD-CKD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical trials have tested KRX-0502 administered with food, in dialysis-dependent
      and NDD-CKD patients.

      This clinical trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of KRX-0502 in treating iron
      deficiency anemia in anemic, stage III to V NDD-CKD patients in a new dosing regimen
      (without food).
