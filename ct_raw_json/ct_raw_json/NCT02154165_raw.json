Previous iv vivo studies have shown that turquoise light at wavelength\n      about 490 nm is more efficacious than blue light at wavelength 460 nm, which is the golden\n      standard in phototherapy treatment today. Though, previous studies used light tubes, today\n      we use light emitting diodes (LED'S).\n\n      The overall aim of this study was therefore to compare the efficacy of turquoise LED's\n      versus blue LED's for decreasing total serum bilirubin in neonates with gestational age > 33\n      weeks and uncomplicated hyperbilirubinemia."
