  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An organ transplant is frequently the best option and, in some cases, the only option to
      save the lives of transplant recipients. Receiving an organ from a living donor eliminates
      the need to wait for a deceased donor, an option that many transplant recipients do not
      survive. However, donating an organ presents health concerns to the donor as well. This
      study will use surveys to evaluate the understanding of risk and psychological pressure that
      living organ donors felt when making the decision to donate.  It will also compare
      participants' answers across geographic, racial and socio-economic backgrounds.
