            "textblock": "It is a paradox that medical efforts to control blood glucose in type 2 diabetes mellitus\n      have not decreased the risk of cardiovascular disease. Postprandial lipid concentrations are\n      a strong predictor of cardiovascular risk, independent of traditional cardiovascular risk\n      factors. The new classes of antidiabetic medications - GLP-1 agonists, DPP-IV inhibitors,\n      and PPAR-\u03bb agonists - affect lipid as well as glucose metabolism. This study will\n      investigate the efficacy of these medications in reducing postprandial hyperlipidemia,\n      disrupting the concurrent proinflammatory free fatty acid signaling, and ameliorating\n      endothelial dysfunction in individuals with prediabetes. This will consist of a single\n      center, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled double-blinded prospective trial involving\n      four study arms representing the aforementioned medications: exenatide (GLP-1 agonist),\n      saxagliptin (DPP-IV inhibitor), pioglitazone (PPAR-\u03bb agonist), and placebo (control arm).\n      For each study arm, subjects will eat a standardized atherogenic high-fat test lunch. Venous\n      blood draws and measurements of forearm blood flow will be done prior to the meal and\n      periodically during a 6-hour period after the meal. Forearm blood flow measurements will\n      assess for changes in endothelial function. The blood will be analyzed for multiple markers\n      of hyperlipidemia and free fatty acid signaling. The results will provide new insights into\n      the anti-inflammatory effects of multiple antidiabetic medications via the mechanisms of\n      postprandial hyperlipidemia, free fatty acid signaling, and endothelial function in\n      prediabetic individuals"
