Participants:\n      Surgeons who contribute to the assessment of manuscripts as experts (peer-reviewer) for\n      international scientific journals of surgery (Annals of Surgery, Archives of Surgery,\n      Gastrointestinal Surgery World Journal of International Journal of Surgical Oncology).\n\n      Intervention: Surgeons will be randomized into 2 groups. A group that will evaluate a case\n      vignette (synopsis) of a randomized trial in surgery, and the other group that will evaluate\n      the same case vignette with the representation of the external validity of the trial with\n      ASSIST tool.\n\n      Outcome measures: Participants will indicate on a numeric scale range from 1 to 10 if they\n      feel able to judge the applicability of the trial for 1) patients, 2) centers, 3) surgeons\n      and 4) intervention.\n\n      Sample Size: 28 case vignettes with randomized trials and their ASSIST tool have been\n      developed and evaluated. The inclusion of 130 participants (65 per arm) is required."
