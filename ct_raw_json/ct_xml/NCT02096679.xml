        Inclusion Criteria:

        1, Volunteers must be willing to use reliable methods of contraception (condom and
        spermicide), even if their partners are postmenopausal, surgically sterile, or using an
        effective hormonal method of contraception or intrauterine coil. 2. In addition,
        volunteers must agree to continue to take similar contraceptive precautions until 6 months
        after the last administration of AZD9291 and avoid procreative sex as well as sperm
        donation for 6 months.

        Exclusion Criteria: 1, Any clinically relevant abnormalities in physical examination,
        vital signs, hematology,clinical chemistry, urinalysis or ECG at baseline in the opinion
        of the investigator. 2.   Radiation exposure from clinical studies, including that from
        the present study, excluding background radiation but including diagnostic X-rays and
        other medical exposures, exceeding 5 mSv in the last 12 months or 10 mSv in the last 5
        years.         -
