  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      College drinking associated with sporting events is characterized by excess alcohol, along
      with food intake, over the duration of hours has the potential to cause a build up of fat in
      the liver.  Fatty liver can increase blood glucose concentrations leading to a prediabetes
      like state.

      The present study will determine how overweight men respond to the over-consumption of
      alcohol/food to identify which characteristics might protect some men from fatty liver,
      while others might be more susceptible to this condition.

      The goal of this work is to determine the direct impact of alcohol/food intake to cause
      acute fatty liver through the stimulation of de novo lipogenesis in 20 overweight, healthy
      men.  Understanding individual susceptibility to alcohol-induced fatty liver will aid in the
      development of strategies designed to help people mitigate these risks.

      Hypothesis is that 5h excess consumption of alcohol and food will increase liver
      triglycerides by 4% or more, in comparison to fasting state.

      Subjects will participate in a single screening visit and a 24 hours in-patient stay at the
      clinical research center for treatment and tests.

      No drugs will be used in this study, however, high amounts of alcohol will be consumed.

      The goals are to quantitate the increase in lipogenesis due to acute alcohol/food intake and
      to determine the effects of acute alcohol/food intake on liver-triglycerides.
