Subjects will then be\n      randomized to treatment with fenofibrate (160 mg/d) or an identical-appearing placebo for 12\n      weeks. They will be asked to continue their usual medications, diet and physical activity.\n      Subjects will receive a pedometer to wear daily to track their physical activity. Subjects\n      will meet with dietitians from the Lifestyle Intervention Core to complete a 24-hour dietary\n      recall. They will be instructed to record their daily blood glucose concentrations, distance\n      walked and any side effects, illnesses or stresses in a study-supplied log. Subjects will be\n      instructed to either email or fax the log to the study coordinator each week (or discuss by\n      phone).\n\n      Subjects will return 6 weeks after starting intervention for visit 3 to ensure their medical\n      safety. Procedures at this visit include an interim medical history, urine pregnancy test\n      for females, blood draw to rule out untoward effects of the study drug on liver or kidney\n      function, pill count to assess compliance, review of logs of blood glucose, distance walked,\n      and side effects, illnesses or stresses, and meeting with a dietitian for a 24-hour dietary\n      recall.\n\n      Subjects will continue to take their study medication/placebo and keep logs of blood glucose\n      levels, distance walked, and side effects, illnesses and stresses for another 6 weeks. They\n      will return for visit 4 after 12 total weeks of intervention. Visit 4 involves a urine\n      collection, 12-hour fasting blood draw, review of subject logs, pill count, and 24-hour\n      dietary recall. In addition, magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis of the liver and\n      resting echocardiogram analysis of the heart will be performed to determine if there have\n      been any changes in liver fat or heart function during the 12-week intervention."
