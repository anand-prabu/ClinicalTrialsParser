  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of ankle foot orthoses (AFOs) on the
      spatial and temporal gait parameters, electromyography (EMG), walking endurance, and quality
      of life in select individuals living with MS. The hypotheses of the study are: 1.
      Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in spatial and temporal
      gait parameters 2. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in
      walking endurance.  3. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate improvements in
      muscle firing profiles/EMG measures. 4. Individuals who are fit with an AFO will demonstrate
      improvements in quality of life.

      This is a non-randomized, single group (N=15), repeated measures study. The outcome measure
      for the study include: 1. GAITRite System for temporal and spatial gait parameters, 2. EMG
      of the anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, soleus, and vastus lateralis muscles, 3. 6 Minute
      Walk Test (gait endurance) 4. Lower extremity strength (dynamometry and single leg heel
      raise), 5. 12-Item MS Walking Scale, 6. Video tape of overground gait analysis, 7. Rate of
      Perceived Exertion (RPE), 8 Quality of life measure.  This study will be 24 weeks long. Over
      the 24-week period, the subject will participate in 14 gait training sessions which will be
      at weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20 and 23. The treatments will be 45-60
      minutes in duration. Outcome measures (all or part) will be assessed at the following times:
      initial (T1), week 5 (T2), week 13 (T3), and week 24 (T4). Subjects will be closely
      monitored throughout the 24 week study and will be un-enrolled by self-request or the
      following medical reasons: 1. Acute exacerbation of MS symptoms, 2. New diagnosis with
      direct consequences affecting gait training, 3. Inability to tolerate the AFO.
