  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to clinically evaluate a novel robot-assisted therapeutic
      approach to train sensorimotor hand function after stroke. It combines the profound
      experience of the clinic Hildebrand in neurocognitive therapy - involving brain and mind in
      the task and training both the motor and the sensory system - with the advanced haptic
      robotic technology of the Rehabilitation Engineering Lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of
      Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), allowing unmet interaction with the hand through the
      simulation of virtual objects with various mechanical properties. In a randomized controlled
      clinical trial, 10 sub-acute stroke patients will receive four weeks of robotic therapy
      sessions, integrated seamlessly into their daily rehabilitation program, while 10 other
      patients will receive conventional therapy. The investigators will assess baseline
      performance in an initial clinical and robotic assessment, with another assessment at the
      end of the four-week period, and in follow-ups four weeks and six months later. The contents
      of the patient-tailored robotic therapy sessions will match those of the conventional
      therapy as closely as possible. This study will demonstrate the feasibility of including
      robotic therapy of hand function into the daily rehabilitation program, and investigate the
      acceptance from patients and therapists. The investigators expect increased training
      intensity during the robotic therapy session compared to conventional sessions with similar
      contents, as well as novel insights into the recovery process of both the motor and the
      sensory system during the four weeks of therapy, through advanced robotic assessments
      integrated into the training sessions. This project is a first step towards making such
      robotic therapy available to patients as integration into the conventional individual
      therapy program (e.g. for self-training), and towards transferring this technology to the
      home environment.
