All subjects must\n             have had appropriate surgery for ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube\n             carcinoma with appropriate tissue available for histologic evaluation to confirm\n             diagnosis and stage. Pathology must be verified at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer\n             Center. Patients with initial cytoreduction surgery performed at outside hospitals\n             will be eligible for this protocol. Optimal debulking will be defined by the\n             operative report of the surgeon performing the initial cytoreductive surgery. All\n             patients who are stated to have been optimally debulked (\u2264 1 cm residual disease) in\n             their initial cytoreductive surgery operative report will be eligible.\n\n          -  Patients with the following histologic cell types are eligible:\n\n          -  Serous adenocarcinoma, endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma,\n             undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial\n             adenocarcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner's tumor,\n             adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.) or carcinosarcoma.\n\n          -  Subjects must have a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) of \u2265 70%.\n\n          -  Subjects must be entered no more than 12 weeks postoperatively.\n\n          -  Physical and Laboratory Test Findings\n\n          -  PT such that international normalized ratio (INR) is \u22641.5 (or an in-range INR,\n             usually between 2 and 3, if a patient is on a stable dose of therapeutic warfarin)\n             and a PTT \u2264 1.5 times the upper limit of normal.\n\n          -  Bone marrow function:\n\n          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 1,500/mcL\n\n          -  Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcL\n\n          -  Renal function:\n\n          -  Creatinine \u2264 1.5 mg/dl\n\n          -  Hepatic function:\n\n          -  Bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x ULN\n\n          -  AST and ALT \u2264 3 x ULN\n\n          -  Neurologic function:\n\n          -  Neuropathy (sensory) \u2264 CTC Grade 1\n\n          -  Urine Protein Creatinine:\n\n          -  Urine protein creatinine (UPC) ratio must be < 1.0 gm.\n\n          -  If UPC ratio  \u22651, collection of 24-hour urine measurement of urine protein is\n             recommended *\n\n          -  UPC ratio of spot urine is an estimation of the 24 urine protein excretion - a UPC\n             ratio of 1 is roughly equivalent to a 24-hour urine protein of 1 gm. UPC ratio is\n             calculated using one of the following formulas:\n\n               1. [urine protein]/[urine creatinine] - if both protein and creatinine are reported\n                  in mg/dL\n\n               2. [(urine protein) x0.088]/[urine creatinine] - if urine creatinine is reported in\n                  mmol/L *The UPCR has been found to correlate directly with the amount of protein\n                  excreted in a 24 hour urine collection. Specifically, a UPCR of 1.0 is\n                  equivalent to 1.0 gram of protein in a 24 hour urine collection. Obtain at least\n                  4 ml of a random urine sample in a sterile container (does not have to be a 24\n                  hour urine). Send sample to lab with request for urine protein and creatinine\n                  levels [separate requests]. The lab will measure protein concentration (mg/dL)\n                  and creatinine concentration (mg/dL). The UPCR is derived as follows: protein\n                  concentration (mg/dL)/creatinine (mg/dL). Patients must have a UPCR < 1.0 to\n                  allow participation in the study.\n\n          -  Patients of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test prior to\n             study entry and be practicing an effective form of contraception during the study and\n             for at least 6 months after receiving the final treatment of bevacizumab.\n\n          -  Patients must have an Intraperitoneal (IP) port in place.
