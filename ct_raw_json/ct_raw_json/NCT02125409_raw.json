In contrast, it is expected that the inhibitory effect on\n      extra-platelet sources of COX-1 will be short-lasting, if any, affecting only partially\n      COX-1, and this effect will be completely reversed at 24 hours after dosing. This is an\n      important point which will strengthen the platelet hypothesis underpinning the apparent\n      adequacy of a 24-hour dosing interval of ASA administration for the anticancer effect\n      detected in cardiovascular trials.\n\n      These patients will be stratified into individuals with adenomas/carcinomas (20 to 30%) and\n      patients without clinically detected adenomas/carcinomas (about 70 to 80%)."
