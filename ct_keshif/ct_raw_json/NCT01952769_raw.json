            "textblock": "1. Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) is the most\n           lethal pediatric malignant disease. Children are usually diagnosed at the age of 6-8\n           years following a short history of neurological deterioration with often a combination\n           of cranial nerve dysfunction, ataxia and long tract deficits. Diagnosis is MRI based\n           and a biopsy is required only when tumor features on imaging are non-classic . As of\n           today there is no curative treatment regardless of multiple clinical trials done in the\n           past. Following diagnosis children undergo radiation therapy aiming at symptoms\n           alleviation, with almost inevitable disease progression taking place several months\n           later. Overall survival ranges between 9-12 months and death due to disease progression\n           is the rule (1)\n\n        2. Relapsed high grade glioma High grade glioma consists of more than 50% of brain tumors\n           in the adult population. Cure rates are extremely low with median survival time of 8\n           months and overall survival of 8-20% at  2 years. At tumor recurrence treatment options\n           are highly limited. Bevacizumab may provide a further short term of stabilization but\n           unfortunately in almost all cases relapsed/resistant high grade glioma is lethal.(2)\n\n        3. Immunotherapy in brain tumors Data regarding possible role of the immune system in\n           cancer was first presented in 2001 when Schreiber and Old demonstrated that\n           lymphocytes, activated by interferon-\u03b3, inhibit the development of spontaneous and\n           carcinogen-induced tumors in immunodeficient mice (Shankaran et al, 2001).  Later\n           studies demonstrated progressively decreasing immunogenicity in tumor cells of advanced\n           cancer patients. Based on these and other data trials incorporating immunotherapy into\n           treatment of relapsed high grade glioma were constructed.  Past trials centered upon\n           active cell based  immunization trying to present the patients' immune system with\n           specific antigens derived from their tumor while using different techniques to enhance\n           immune response. These studies has shown positive results but the  need to prepare\n           patient specific vaccination limited their use to highly specialized centers and\n           results were hard to reproduce.(3)\n\n        4. The role of PD-1 in cancer immunotherapy One of the mechanisms through which tumor\n           cells escape immune detection is activation of the inhibitory lymphocyte receptor  PD-1\n           (programmed death 1). Low grade activation of the T cell receptor-secondary to\n           prolonged antigen exposure (as found in chronic disease or protracted exposure to\n           malignant cells) - strongly activates- PD-1. Upon activation, PD-1 drives the\n           lymphocyte towards apoptosis and  reduces cytokine production. PD-1/PD-1 ligand\n           interaction promotes tolerance of the immune system to a specific antigen (4). Lately,\n           studies reported  high levels of PD-1 expression in tumor infiltrating lymphocytes ,and\n           strong expression of PD-ligand within multiple tumor types including high grade glioma\n           .Both these findings support the data regarding the role of PD1 in cancer immune escape\n           (5).\n\n        5. Anti PD-1:Safety and efficacy in human studies Over the last two years data has been\n           accumulating regarding efficacy and toxicity profile of anti PD-1.Topalian et.al\n           reported at 2012 outcome of a large phase I study evaluating antiPD-1 in advanced\n           cancers. Out of 296 participating patients 14% had Grade 3 or 4 drug-related adverse\n           events with most being treated on an outpatient setup . Several patients were diagnosed\n           with pneumonitis. Most were observed or treated successfully with steroids but three\n           patients died. Among 236 patients in whom response could be evaluated, objective\n           responses (complete or partial responses) were observed in those with non-small-cell\n           lung cancer-a cancer not known to be immunoresponsive (18%), melanoma (28% ), or\n           renal-cell cancer (27%). Responses were durable; 20 of 31 responses lasted 1 year or\n           more (6). Further studies report a better toxicity profile with similar efficacy. Hamid\n           et.al reported outcome of 135 patients with advanced melanoma. Side effects were mostly\n           grade 1-2 with no treatment related mortality. Response rate among these patients was\n           38% and most responses lasted at least 7 months (7). A study evaluating anti PD-1 in\n           chronic HCV patient revealed similar safe profile. One patient out of 66  (10 mg/kg)\n           experienced an asymptomatic grade 4 ALT elevation coincident with the onset of a 4-log\n           viral load reduction. Six patients exhibited immune-related adverse events of\n           mild-to-moderate intensity, including two cases of hyperthyroidism consistent with\n           autoimmune thyroiditis (8).\n\n        6. Anti CTLA-4 and anti PD-1 activity in brain tumors Unlike chemotherapy or targeted\n           therapies, both antiCTLA-4 and anti PD-1 affect T lymphocytes rather than the tumor\n           itself. Binding to the lymphocyte receptor may take place outside of the central\n           nervous system. Following binding to their receptor the reactivated lymphocytes\n           penetrate the brain and arrive to the tumor thus the antibodies are not required to\n           cross the blood brain barrier. Data regarding activity of antiCTLA-4  within the brain\n           may be retrieved from retrospective summary of melanoma patients with brain metastasis.\n           These patients are usually ineligible for clinical trials due to their grim prognosis.\n           Margolin e al reported partial response in 5 patients and stable disease for 12 weeks\n           in another 4 out of 51 patients with asymptomatic brain melanoma metastasis. Patients\n           with symptomatic lesions requiring steroid therapy did not respond. Di Giacomo reported\n           disease stabilization in 5 and near total response in another 5 patients out of 20\n           patients with asymptomatic metastatic melanoma lesions. These data provide proof of\n           principle to the assumption that this regimen is active within the brain.\n\n           Zeng et al reported improved survival of glioblastoma implanted mice following\n           radiation and anti PD-1. Median survival was 25 days in the control arm, 27 days in the\n           anti-PD-1 antibody arm, 28 days in the radiation arm, and 53 days in the radiation plus\n           anti-PD-1 therapy arm, these data along with tolerability of  treatment calls for a\n           clinical trial assessing this treatment in this population with extremely poor\n           prognosis (9).\n\n        7. CT011 mechanism of action and early efficacy data\n\n      CT011 is one of several humanized anti PD1 antibodies currently under investigation in\n      multiple tumors. A single dose of CT-011 given to mice with metastatic melanoma,\n      fibrosarcoma,  lung carcinoma or colorectal adenocarcinoma led to significant reduction in\n      lung and/or liver metastases along with prolonged survival. Combination of CT-011 with\n      rituximab, chemotherapy and different types of vaccines has proven to be synergistic.\n\n      In a phase I study enrolling 17 patients with advanced stage hematological malignancies\n      (AML,CLL, Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease and multiple myeloma)  5 patients had\n      prolonged stable disease (averaging 60 weeks) and one patient with follicular lymphoma had a\n      complete response.\n\n      A Phase II study was conducted in 72 adult patients with DLBCL following autologous stem\n      cell transplantation; in this study, CT-011 was given at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg per patient at\n      3 cycles per patient every 42 days (treatment Days 1, 43, and 85). The PFS and OS 18 months\n      after transplant were 72% and 85%, respectively. These values compare favorably with results\n      obtained in previous similar cohorts. In addition, the ORR within the 40 patients who\n      enrolled in the study with measurable disease was 45% (30%CR, 15%PR).\n\n      A Phase II study was conducted in 30 adult patients with rituximab-sensitive, grade 1-2\n      follicular lymphoma who relapsed after 1-4 prior therapies with measurable disease. CT-011\n      was administered at 3 mg/kg IV every 4 weeks for 12 infusions and rituximab was dosed at 375\n      mg/m2 IV weekly for 4 weeks starting 2 weeks after the first infusion of CT-011.  Of the 29\n      patients eligible for efficacy analysis, 19 had an objective response for an ORR of 66%. CR\n      was observed in 15 (52%) and PR in 4 (14%). Altogether, 25 (86%) patients had measurable\n      tumor regression. The ORR of 66% and CR rate of 52% compare favorably with the previously\n      reported ORR of 40% and CR rate of 11% with single agent rituximab retreatment in relapsed\n      follicular lymphoma. Median time to response was 88 days. Of note, 17% of the patients\n      achieved initial response >3 months from first treatment. Median PFS was 19.6 months, and\n      was not reached for the 19 responders or the 25 patients with measurable tumor regression."
