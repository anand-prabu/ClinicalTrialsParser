Treatment repeats\n      every 4 weeks for a maximum of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SS1(dsFv)-PE38 immunotoxin until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
