This problem may be addressed in part by personalizing\n      treatment, including determining which children will benefit from caregiver involvement in\n      treatment. The goal of the current proposal is to pilot test an innovative experimental\n      design called Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART), which is used for\n      development of personalized treatments, and assess the acceptability and feasibility of\n      using this design, in preparation for a full-scale SMART in a larger clinical trial and for\n      the development of personalized treatment."

            "textblock": "Childhood depression constitutes a major public health concern, requiring effective\n      interventions. The effects of treatments for childhood depression are relatively modest and\n      short-lived, with sizeable percentages of children who maintain depressive symptoms\n      following treatment. A potential barrier to treatment success is the single uniform format\n      of treatment protocols, addressing all depressed children similarly, regardless of clinical\n      presentation. One strategy for addressing this barrier is to personalize treatment, fitting\n      intervention to the specific needs of the children being targeted. This approach is\n      consistent with the strategic plan of the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to\n      emphasize the development of personalized interventions.\n\n      Studies have documented the importance of family context in the development and maintenance\n      of childhood depression; however, the limited number of clinical trials that involved\n      caregivers provided mixed results, with only some youths benefiting from caregiver\n      involvement in treatment. A logical first step in personalizing treatment is to develop\n      decision rules about which children are likely to benefit from caregiver involvement in\n      treatment, and at what point in treatment caregiver involvement should occur. The proposed\n      study will take the first step toward addressing these key personalizing questions, using\n      the Sequential, Multiple Assignment, Randomized Trial (SMART) design, an experimental method\n      that is well-suited to the development of personalized treatments.\n\n      The proposed project will focus on the first step in the development of personalized\n      treatment for depressed children, piloting use of the SMART design. The study has two aims.\n      Aim 1 includes the refinement of the individual CBT and caregiver-child treatment manuals\n      for use in the SMART trial. Aim 2 includes a pilot study of the SMART experimental design,\n      with 48, 7-14 year-old children who meet criteria for Major Depressive Disorder and/or\n      Dysthymic Disorder. The pilot study will provide information about the acceptability of the\n      treatment manuals, assessments, and study procedures and about the feasibility of the\n      two-step randomization used in the SMART design. The resulting information will inform the\n      development of a full-scale properly-powered SMART trial (for a later study). The long-term\n      objective is to use the SMART trial methods to guide development of personalized treatment\n      for child depression."
