            "textblock": "Radiation dermatitis is experienced by almost all patients (up to 95%) receiving radiation\n      therapy for cancer.  Radiation dermatitis can be a serious condition because, in addition to\n      its direct physical complications and the resulting impact on overall quality of life, it\n      can also be a dose-limiting toxicity requiring changes to the prescribed course of radiation\n      therapy. The most common strategy employed in an attempt to prevent or minimize radiation\n      dermatitis involves moisturization of the irradiated area, use of a mild soap to keep the\n      area clean, and minimizing exposure to potential mechanical irritants, such as scratching\n      and rough clothing. However, this strategy has been shown to lack clinically significant\n      efficacy.  Consequently, there is a clinical need for new treatments that are effective in\n      protecting against radiotherapy-induced oxidative stress and the subsequent development of\n      radiation dermatitis.\n\n      Based on data from previous studies in animals and humans, Reata believes that RTA 408\n      Lotion may effectively prevent and mitigate radiation dermatitis in oncology patients\n      undergoing radiation therapy.\n\n      This randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled, parallel-group trial will study the\n      efficacy, tolerability and safety of two concentrations of RTA 408 Lotion (3% and 0.5%)\n      versus vehicle in patients with breast cancer for whom radiation therapy is recommended."
