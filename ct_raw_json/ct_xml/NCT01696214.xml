  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of the pilot (SAPS) protocol is to determine the feasibility and utility of
      implementing the provisional design of the full scale TOM trial (e.g., the six month
      treatment period, the impact of the smoking cessation intervention).

      There is no active hypothesis for the Vanguard Protocol.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The protocol is a small scale pilot of the full-scale TOM trial, and it will utilize an
      active control design (stepped up dose of ICS) and incorporates 4 treatment arms. In the
      Vanguard Protocol all participants are to complete a 4 week run-in with Advair 100/50,
      followed by randomization to 1 of 4 arms of study treatment. The 4 drug treatment
      combinations are (2 inhalers, 2 pills):

        -  Advair 250/50, Placebo, Placebo, Placebo

        -  Advair 100/50 and LTRA, Placebo, Placebo

        -  Advair 100/50 and Theo, Placebo, Placebo

        -  Advair 100/50 and tiotropium, Placebo, Placebo The 24 week treatment phase will be
           followed by a 4 week washout period on Advair 100/50. There is no crossover.

    <description>The primary symptomatic measure proposed for the full-scale TOM Trial, the Asthma Control Test (ACT) has been shown to be valid for measuring poor asthma control in asthmatic children and non-smoking adults.The Treatment Response Score (TRS) is the second composite measure proposed for the full scale TOM Trial. The TRS composite score has been informative in multicenter trials involving ICS and montelukast in childhood asthma.</description>

    <description>The Asthma Symptom Utility Index(AUSI), an important secondary outcome in the proposed full-scale TOM Trial, has also been shown to be useful in tracking the frequency and severity of asthma-related symptoms in non-smoking asthmatics.The composite score of Episodes of Poor Asthma Control (EPAC) is an important outcome measure incorporating multiple dimensions of asthma including physiology, symptoms and healthcare use.</description>
