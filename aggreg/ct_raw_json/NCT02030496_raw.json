            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Fractures of the distal radius are common and account for an estimated 17% of all fractures\n      diagnosed. Two-thirds of these fractures are displaced and require reduction. Although\n      distal radius fractures are considered to be relatively harmless, inadequate treatment may\n      result in impaired function of the wrist. The consequences of post-traumatic loss of\n      function are comprehensive, both on an individual and a social level, and have long been\n      underestimated. Despite the substantial implications, no evidence-based treatment method yet\n      exists. Good results have been described both in patients treated conservatively and\n      surgically. Nevertheless, 60% of all fractures redislocate after conservative treatment at\n      which point surgical reduction and fixation is the treatment of choice. Recently, the use of\n      volar locking plates has become more popular. This type of osteosynthesis employs a volar\n      approach to the wrist and provides immediate stable fixation of the reduced fracture. This\n      stability allows for early mobilisation and may therefore result in an improved regain of\n      function. The aim of this study is to compare the functional outcome following surgical\n      reduction and fixation with a volar locking plate with the functional outcome following\n      closed reduction and plaster immobilisation at one year follow-up in patients with displaced\n      extra-articular distal radius fractures.\n\n      DESIGN:\n\n      This single blinded randomised controlled trial will randomise between open reduction and\n      internal fixation with a volar locking plate (intervention group) and closed reduction\n      followed by plaster immobilisation (control group). The study population will consist of all\n      consecutive adult patients who are diagnosed with a displaced extra-articular distal radius\n      fracture which has been adequately reduced at the Emergency Department. The primary outcome\n      (functional outcome) will be assessed by means of the Disability Arm Shoulder Hand Score\n      (DASH). Since the treatment allocated involves a surgical procedure, randomisation status\n      will not be blinded. However, the researcher assessing the outcome at one year will be\n      unaware of the treatment allocation. In total, 90 patients will be included in this trial\n      which will be conducted in the Academic Medical Centre Amsterdam and its partners of the\n      regional trauma care network."
