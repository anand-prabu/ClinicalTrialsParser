Pre-exposure\n      prophylaxis (PrEP)  with oral, daily tenofovir/emtricitabine (TDF/FTC, Truvada\u00ae) is a novel\n      biomedical approach to HIV prevention shown in the iPrEx trial to be safe and efficacious in\n      reducing HIV acquisition by 44% among MSM, when provided in a comprehensive package of HIV\n      prevention interventions including counseling, testing/treatment of sexually transmitted\n      infections (STIs), and condoms. There is now widespread mobilization to assess the\n      feasibility of PrEP roll-out worldwide, with urgent calls for 'demonstration projects'\n      addressing real-world PrEP implementation issues.\n\n      PREPARATORY-5 is Canada's first PrEP demonstration project, and will examine real-world PrEP\n      implementation issues including acceptability, effectiveness, impact on sexually transmitted\n      infections, and strategies for supporting adherence outside the clinical trial setting.  The\n      investigators have also established a comprehensive community-based research program\n      investigating the role of community-based organizations in PrEP implementation and delivery."
