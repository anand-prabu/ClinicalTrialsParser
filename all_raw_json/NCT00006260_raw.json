Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. Drugs\n      such as mesna may be effective in preventing some of the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of\n      etoposide and ifosfamide given with mesna, and cisplatin in treating patients who have\n      metastatic breast cancer."

Mesna is administered IV over 15 minutes 30\n      minutes prior to and 4 hours after ifosfamide, then orally at 8 hours post infusion.\n      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease\n      progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 36 patients (16 per stratum) will be accrued over 36 months."
