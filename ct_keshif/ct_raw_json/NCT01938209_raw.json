There is evidence that thoracic spine manipulation is an\n      effective treatment for patients with cervical spine pain.  This evidence includes a variety\n      of techniques to manipulate the thoracic spine.  While each of them is effective, no\n      research has compared techniques to determine which produces the best outcomes.\n\n      METHODS: Thirty-nine patients with cervical spine pain were randomly assigned to either a\n      seated thoracic manipulation or targeted supine thoracic manipulation group.
