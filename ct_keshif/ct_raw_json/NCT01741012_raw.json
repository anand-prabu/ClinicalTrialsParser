Thus lupus patients\n      (who are susceptible to cervical cancer) may benefit from getting Gardasil vaccine which can\n      prevent cervical cancer. Vaccines are generally safe and efficacious in SLE but no studies\n      have been done on the use of this vaccine in SLE. The investigators hypothesize that\n      Gardasil vaccine is safe and effective in SLE. This study will look at vaccine safety in\n      patients with mild to moderate and minimally active or inactive SLE and measure how well\n      they make protective antibodies after receiving the vaccine. In other words this will check\n      how well the vaccine works in SLE."
