      -  Evaluate subjects in an prospective observational study

        -  Subjects will be administered scientifically validated questionnaires

        -  Determine the affect of the Portable Oxygen Concentrator (POC) on improvements in:

             1. Exercise capability, dyspnea and quality of life as primary endpoints

             2. Utilize:

                  1. Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI)

                  2. Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI)

                  3. Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ)

                  4. Six minute walk test (6MWT)

                  5. Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS)

        -  The secondary endpoints will be:

             1. Rate of exacerbations, sleep quality

             2. Health care utilization (emergency room encounters, hospital admissions)

      Evaluate subjects in an prospective observational study in which subjects will be screened
      and administered scientifically validated questionnaires at study entry and during the
      observation period at specified intervals to determine the affect of the Portable Oxygen
      Concentrator on improvements in exercise capability, dyspnea and quality of life as primary
      endpoints, utilizing the Baseline Dyspnea Index (BDI), Transitional Dyspnea Index (TDI), the
      Chronic Respiratory Disease Questionnaire (CRQ) and six minute walk test (6MWT). The
      secondary endpoints will be rate of exacerbations, sleep quality (reported as number of
      hours sleep improvement; utilize Epworth Sleepiness Scale [ESS]), and health care
      utilization (emergency room encounters, hospital admissions).

    <description>More than 12 million adults are diagnosed with COPD
COPD is the 4th leading cause of death in the U.S.
Breathing difficulty is the major reason patients seek medical attention
COPD patients requiring hospitalization were associated with higher costs
Oximetry is an important tool for assessing need for Long-term oxygen therapy
LTOT has been proven to improve survival and quality of life
Patients will be provided a lightweight portable oxygen concentrator to:
support increased activity
improve quality of life
increase functional capacity</description>
