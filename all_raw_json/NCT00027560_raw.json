It also stops the patient's\n      immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The donated stem cells may replace the\n      patient's immune system and help destroy any remaining cancer cells (graft-versus-tumor\n      effect). Sometimes the transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response\n      against the body's normal cells. Giving cyclosporine after the transplant may stop this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well fludarabine, melphalan, alemtuzumab, and\n      peripheral stem cell transplant work in treating patients with hematologic cancer."
