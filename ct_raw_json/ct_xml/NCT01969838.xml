  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine the efficacy of momelotinib (MMB) versus ruxolitinib in
      participants with primary myelofibrosis (PMF) or post-polycythemia vera or post-essential
      thrombocythemia myelofibrosis (post-PV/ET MF) who have not yet received treatment with a
      Janus kinase inhibitor (JAK inhibitor).

      Participants will be randomized to receive either MMB or ruxolitinib for 24 weeks during a
      double-blind treatment phase, after which they will be eligible to receive open-label MMB
      for up to an additional 168 weeks. After discontinuation of study medication, assessments
      will continue for 12 additional weeks, after which participants will be contacted for
      survival follow-up approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years from the date of
      enrollment.
