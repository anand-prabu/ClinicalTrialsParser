A total number of 52 consecutive cases of mandibular\n      third molar surgical extractions were performed using either a trapezoidal flap or an\n      envelope flap. The choice of the flap was randomized. The following parameters were\n      recorded: Probing Pocket Depth, Clinical Attachment Level, Bleeding on Probing, Full Mouth\n      Plaque Score, Full Mouth Bleeding Score, total time for the surgical intervention, age of\n      the patient, type of inclusion, ostectomy. All the patients received a questionnaire to\n      evaluate the post-intervention discomfort (swelling, pain, number of pain-killers,\n      bleeding). Periodontal parameters were checked at 6-month follow up."
