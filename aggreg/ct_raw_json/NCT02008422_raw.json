            "textblock": "Multiple pre-clinical studies have indicated that in dozens of animal tumor models and human\n      tumor-metastatic mice tumor models, the effective rate of Endostar was 47%\uff5e91% in daily\n      dosage of 10\uff5e100mg/kg, and covered human commonly seen malignant tumors, such as lung\n      cancer, gastric cancer, breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatic cancer, malignant melanoma\n      and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, etc.. The development and progression of gastric cancer was in\n      association with angiogenesis. An animal research observed the influence of Endostar on\n      tumor strains in nude mice with gastric cancer, and the results showed that tumor size\n      shrunk rapidly and the expressions of VEGF, bFGF, VEGF-C, VEGFR-3, bcl-2 and PDGF decreased\n      significantly after treatment in experimental group, demonstrating that Endostar could\n      reduce angiogenesis, increase tumor cell apoptosis and inhibit tumor growth in gastric\n      cancer. An investigation of small-sample Endostar concomitant with chemotherapy on patients\n      with advanced gastric cancer primarily indicated the efficacy and feasibility of Endostar\n      concomitant with chemotherapy in treating gastric cancer.\n\n      With the expanded application of Endostar in clinic, it also obtains certain effect in\n      treating patients with lung cancer and colorectal cancer. The safety, efficacy, evaluation\n      of relationship between benefit and risk in common or special population as well as the\n      modified dosage of administration of Endostar in wide application should be further explored\n      to provide sufficient scientifical basis for the safety, efficacy, applicable rule in\n      special population and investigation of optimal administrative protocols for Endostar in\n      wide application.\n\n      This control, single-center clinical study of EndostarTM Injection with/without SOX\n      protocols to treat advanced gastric cancer was conducted to explore the feasibility,\n      efficacy and safety of Endostar concomitant with SOX protocols, and to provide more\n      evidence-based medical basis for the clinical application of Endostar."
