  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the visual performance of a new multifocal High ADD
      contact lens compared to the currently-marketed AIR OPTIX® AQUA MULTIFOCAL (AOAMF) High ADD
      Contact Lens.

    <time_frame>Day 1, 10 minutes after lens insertion</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Visual Acuity will be measured at high contrast level.  HCVA will be assessed monocularly (each eye separately) at 40 centimeters using an ETDRS chart and measured in logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR).  A lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>

    <description>Visual Acuity will be measured at high contrast level.  HCVA will be assessed monocularly (each eye separately) at 6 meters using an ETDRS chart and measured in logMAR.  A lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>

    <description>Visual Acuity will be measured at high contrast level.  HCVA will be assessed monocularly (each eye separately) at 1 meter using an ETDRS chart and measured in logMAR.  A lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>

    <description>Visual Acuity will be measured at low contrast level.  LCVA will be assessed monocularly (each eye separately) at 6 meters using an ETDRS chart and measured in logMAR.  A lower logMAR value indicates better visual acuity.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must sign an Informed Consent document;

          -  Presbyopic and require at least 2.25 diopters (D) spectacle ADD power;

          -  Current or previous soft contact lens wearer;

          -  Not able to achieve monocular near visual acuity (VA) 0.2 logarithm of the Minimum
             Angle of Resolution (logMAR) [Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)]
             or better in each eye with AIR OPTIX® AQUA Multifocal (AOAMF) High ADD Contact
             Lenses;

          -  Willing and able to wear multifocal contact lenses in both eyes within the available
             range of powers for this trial;

          -  Manifest cylinder less than or equal to 1.00 D;

          -  Able to achieve best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/25 or better in each eye at
             distance (as determined by manifest refraction);

          -  Other protocol-defined inclusion criteria may apply.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any anterior segment infection, inflammation, disease, or abnormality that
             contraindicates contact lens wear within 6 months prior to enrollment, as determined
             by the investigator;

          -  Any use of systemic or ocular medications for which contact lens wear could be
             contraindicated, as determined by the investigator; or any use of topical ocular
             medications that would require instillation during contact lens wear;

          -  Any history of herpetic keratitis;

          -  History of corneal or refractive surgery, irregular cornea or unilateral
             pseudophakia;

          -  Biomicroscopy findings (except for corneal vascularization) that are moderate (Grade
             3) or severe (Grade 4);

          -  Corneal vascularization that is mild (Grade 2) or higher;

          -  A pathologically dry eye that precludes contact lens wear;

          -  Monocular (only 1 eye with functional vision);

          -  Anisometropia ≥ 1.50 D (contact lens distance prescription);

          -  Clinically significant (&gt; 1 millimeter) anisocoria;

          -  History of intolerance or hypersensitivity to any component of the investigational
             products;

          -  Concurrent participation in a contact lens or contact lens care product clinical
             trial within the previous 30 days;

          -  Eye injury or ocular or intra-ocular surgery within 6 months prior to enrollment;

          -  Any ocular or systemic medical condition that may, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, preclude safe administration of the study lenses or affect the results
             of this study;

          -  Other protocol-defined exclusion criteria may apply.
