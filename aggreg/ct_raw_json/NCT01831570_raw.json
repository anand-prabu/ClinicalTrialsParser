            "textblock": "Introduction Osteoarthritis is a chronic disease characterized by a progressive degradation\n      of articular cartilage. Hand OA involves symptomatically more than 1 million of subjects in\n      France (i.e., painful or with functional impairment). To date, the treatment of OA is only\n      symptomatic and no drugs are able to stop the degradative process of cartilage.\n\n      50% of patients with hand OA exhibit a functional impairment responsible for a severe\n      handicap, which is almost similar to rheumatoid arthritis. While the risk factors of hand OA\n      are well identified (i.e., familial history, female sex, menopause, obesity), clinical\n      outcome in large cohort is poorly known. In addition, the investigators miss predictive\n      clinical, biological or imaging factors of severe clinical (i.e. pain, functional impairment\n      or aesthetic damage) or structural evolution (i.e., aggravation of radiographic scores).\n\n      Primary objective To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological,\n      genetic and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 6 years of follow-up.\n\n      Secondary objectives To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological,\n      genetic and imaging factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.\n\n      To investigate in hand OA patients predictive clinical, biological, genetic and imaging\n      factors of clinical aggravation after 3 years of follow-up.\n\n      To investigate whether variations of clinical evaluation of hand hand OA and radiographic\n      structural changes are associated or correlated between inclusion and 3 years of follow-up\n      or between inclusion and 6 years follow-up To investigate whether clinical status and\n      radiographic alterations are correlated at inclusion To determine whether hand OA is\n      associated with OA at other sites or with other hand diseases (carpal tunnel syndrome,\n      tendinitis) To evaluate frequency of erosive hand OA among the whole hand OA cohort at\n      inclusion, at 3 and 6 years of follow-up To identify clinical, biological, genetic and\n      imaging factors associated with erosive hand OA (versus non erosive hand OA) at inclusion or\n      during the follow up (3 and 6 years) To investigate predictive clinical, biological, genetic\n      and imaging factors of clinical or radiographic aggravation after 3 or 6 years of follow-up\n      in the erosive hand OA subgroup\n\n      Methods :\n\n      the investigators plan to include 500 patients in the cohort (5/week) 7 visits (one per\n      year) are planned: M0, M12, M24, M36, M48, M60 and M72. A clinical evaluation of hand OA\n      will be performed at each visit. At visit M0, M36 and M72, hand radiographs and radiographs\n      of other OA localisation (if symptomatic) will be performed.\n\n      A blood sample will be taken at inclusion for biomarker studies and genetic investigations.\n\n      A blood sample will be taken at M36 and M72 to build a prospective serum collection.\n\n      Duration of the study: 8.5 years with 2.5 years of inclusion period Duration of the study\n      for one patient: 6 years Recruitment at the Rheumatology Department of Saint-Antoine\n      Hospital with a multicentric international steering committee\n\n      Potential outcomes :\n\n        -  Identification of clinical, radiological and biological tools useful to predict\n           clinical and  structural outcomes\n\n        -  Description of the history course of hand OA and predictive factors of severe evolution\n           (i.e. erosive form of hand OA) To integrate in daily practice, clinical and\n           radiological tools allowing a standardized follow up of hand OA patients."
