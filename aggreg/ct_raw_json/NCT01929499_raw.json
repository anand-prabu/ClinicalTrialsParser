In another retrospective study, investigators found that\n      adjuvant CIK therapy would prolong the disease-free survival (DFS) for colorectal cancer\n      patients.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine wether adjuvant immunotherapy with CIK cells in\n      patients with colon cancer after operation will prolong DFS, and overall survival (OS)."
