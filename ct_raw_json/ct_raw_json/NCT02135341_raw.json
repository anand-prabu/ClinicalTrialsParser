            "textblock": "Overactive bladder (OAB) is a symptom syndrome characterized by urgency frequency with or\n      without urgency incontinence, usually no metabolic or anatomical disorders can be found and\n      it may have great impact on quality of life. OAB symptoms were found to have a significant\n      effect on the emotional well-being and productivity of those affected. Although there are\n      several new therapeutic options with promising treatment outcome, antimuscarinic drugs\n      remain the first line treatment and clinical effects with good tolerability have been\n      confirmed. However, not all OAB patients can benefit from antimuscarinic agent, and this\n      treatment has some adverse effects such as dizziness, dry mouth, blurred vision, and\n      constipation, which are intolerable for some patients. Of these patients intravesical\n      botulinum toxin (BoNT) injections provide an alternative treatment with a favorable\n      efficacy.\n\n      Based on the understanding of the pathophysiology of OAB and detrusor overactivity (DO),\n      BoNT has been enthusiastically applied in treating urinary urgency or incontinence\n      refractory to antimuscarinics in recent years. Although promising therapeutic effects have\n      been confirmed by several case series or clinical trials, the occurrence of adverse events\n      are reported inconsistently. Analysis of patients demographics and urodynamic variables\n      reveals that patients with ageing, low detrusor contractility, with chronic medical disease\n      carry risks of adverse events. Although safety and efficacy were similar between elderly\n      patients without frailty and younger patients, an increased risk of large post-void residual\n      urine volume and a lower long-term success rate in frail elderly patients were noted after\n      intravesical 100 U BoNT-A injection for refractory idiopathic DO. Therefore, careful dose\n      and injection site adjustment and patient selection is mandatory to achieve satisfactory\n      results using intravesical BoNT-A therapy.\n\n      This study aimed at compare the safety and efficacy between 100 U suburothelial injection\n      and combined 50 U suburothelial and 50 U urethral sphincter injection of BoNT-A in patients\n      with detrusor overactivity and inadequate contractility (DHIC). A total of 60 patients with\n      DHIC will be enrolled and randomly allocated to each group and treated with either regimen.\n      The safety and efficacy will be assessed by the Patient's Perception of Bladder Condition\n      (PPBC) at different time points after injection. The results of this study may provide\n      valuable evidence for the rational treatment regimen for patients with DHIC.\n\n      Estimated Total Sample Size 60 evaluable patients in total will be recruited\n\n      Method of Patient Assignment\n\n      Patients who meet all eligible requirements for entry into the study will be randomized into\n      one of the two treatment groups in 1:1 ratio as shown below:\n\n        1. BoNT-A 100 units in normal saline 10ml, suburothelial injection at 20 sites of bladder\n           wall in single treatment\n\n        2. BoNT-A 100 units in normal saline 10ml, suburothelial injection 50 U in 10 sites and 50\n           U urethral injections in 5 sites\n\n      Patient Inclusion Criteria\n\n        1.

Incidence of adverse events and the categories of\n      adverse event severity between treatments will be analyzed by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test.\n      The coding system used will be the Coding Symbols for a Thesaurus of Adverse Reaction Terms\n      (COSTART).\n\n      Changes in physical examinations will be displayed for each individual system. All\n      statistical tests used will be two-tailed with \u03b1= 0.05."
