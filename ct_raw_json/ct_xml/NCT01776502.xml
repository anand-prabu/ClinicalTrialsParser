  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the evolution of the non specific symptoms for 116
      patients with mild primary hyperparathyroidism before and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery.
      A clinical score predicting clinical improvement at one year will be created.
