Vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q10 has been recognized as\n      antioxidants and anti-inflammatory nutrients in recent clinical studies. The purposes of\n      this study are going to investigate the relation of vitamin B-6 and coenzyme Q10 with the\n      indicators of oxidative stress, antioxidant enzymes activities and the inflammatory markers\n      in patients with stage 1 and stage 2 HCC. The study is designed as an intervention study.\n      The investigators will recruit HCC patients with stage 1 and stage 2 (n = 150) who are\n      identified by liver biopsy. HCC subjects are randomly assign to placebo, vitamin B-6 (50\n      mg/d), coenzyme Q10 (300 mg/d), and vitamin B-6 plus coenzyme Q10 supplements groups.\n      Intervention is going to administration for three months. The concentrations of vitamin B-6,\n      coenzyme Q10, oxidative stress indicators, antioxidant enzymes activities, antioxidant\n      vitamins (vitamin A and E), and inflammatory markers are going to be analyzed. The results\n      would provide more information nutrients for clinical physicians and dietitians for\n      considering suggesting patients with HCC using vitamin B-6 or coenzyme Q10 supplementation\n      to improve their clinical outcomes."
