Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of hydroxyurea that can be given in\n      combination with other chemotherapy regimens in patients with incurable non-small cell lung\n      cancer. II. Determine the toxicity of this combination chemotherapy regimen in these\n      patients. III. Observe the efficacy of hydroxyurea in patients with incurable non-small cell\n      lung cancer refractory to front-line chemotherapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This study seeks to estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of hydroxyurea in\n      combination with other chemotherapy. Groups of 3 patients take escalated doses of oral\n      hydroxyurea three times weekly or daily throughout treatment with cisplatin plus (per their\n      previous regimen) vinblastine, vindesine, vinorelbine, or etoposide. Treatment continues in\n      responding and stable patients until 3 months beyond documentation of complete remission\n      (minimum 4 courses), maximum of 6 courses beyond documentation of partial remission, or 3\n      courses beyond documentation of stable disease. Patients are followed every 3 weeks for 3\n      months, every 6 weeks for 3 months, then every 3 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An anticipated 15-30 patients will be entered."
