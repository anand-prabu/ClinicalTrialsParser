Recommendations for influenza\n      immunization of children vary somewhat among countries in the European Union, but\n      immunization of children at high risk for complications of influenza infection is\n      recommended by WHO and according to criteria in most countries. Currently, the immunization\n      practices are progressing to quadrivalent formulations of inactivated influenza vaccines\n      (IIV4) which are approved in the US for most of the indicated population.  Additionally,\n      live attenuated vaccine (LAIV4) is approved in the U.S. for individuals aged 2-49 years and\n      Flublok\u00ae(RIV3), a purified trivalent recombinant hemagglutinin protein vaccine is approved\n      in the U.S. for adults 18-49 years of age. Children are at particular risk of complications\n      of influenza, including the B lineages, so expansion of the Flublok indication into the\n      pediatric age group with a quadrivalent formulation is warranted."
