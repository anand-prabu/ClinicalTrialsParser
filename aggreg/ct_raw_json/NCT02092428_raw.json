This method allows faster\n      data acquisition and better spatial resolution.\n\n      Specific aims of this study are to:\n\n        1. compare coronary artery imaging with and without contrast media on both   healthy\n           subjects and patients;\n\n        2. assess the accuracy of coronary MRI in detecting coronary artery disease as compared to\n           conventional x-ray angiography\n\n      Researchers hypothesize that contrast-enhanced MRI will improve the delineation of coronary\n      arteries over non-contrast-enhanced MRI and that optimized, contrast-enhanced coronary MRI\n      technique will accurately detect coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to conventional\n      x-ray angiography."
