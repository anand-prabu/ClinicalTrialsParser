The study is designed to provide data to a large global dataset of phase-III\n      studies including breast cancer, prostate cancer, and all solid tumors, plus multiple\n      myeloma, to support the regulatory approval for marketing and patient access to denosumab\n      for the prevention of SREs in Chinese subjects with bone metastases from solid tumors. The\n      primary objective of this study is to evaluate and compare the percent change from baseline\n      to Week 13 in the bone marker urinary amino-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type I\n      collagen (uNTx) corrected for urine creatinine (uNTx/uCr) in subjects treated with denosumab\n      to those treated with zoledronic acid.
