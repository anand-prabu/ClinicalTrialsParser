Therapeutic approaches\n      modulating inhibitory pathways, including pharmacologic options as pregabalin, and non\n      pharmacological ones as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have been proven to\n      be of limited utility independently.  Aiming to evaluate a better understanding of the\n      pathophysiogenic mechanisms and the effect of these treatments on neuroplasticity, this\n      study was designed evaluating neurophysiologic, neurochemical and clinical parameters.\n      Neurophysiologic parameters and functions to be assessed will include pain threshold, motor\n      evoked potential, silent period, intracortical facilitation and inhibition assessed by\n      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) and optic functional neuroimaging. Neurochemical\n      measurements considered will be neurotrophins (BDNF) and inflammatory mediators (TNF, IL1,\n      IL6, IL10 and cortisol).  Clinical characteristics will be assessed using validated scales\n      capable to detect functional capacity, quality of life (WHOCOHL), catastrophism, sleep\n      disruptions (Pittsburgh) and depressive symptoms (Beck Depression Inventory).  Considering\n      the above described hypothesis, the present randomized clinical trial with blinded patients\n      and evaluators is proposed.  It pretends to analyze short-, mid- and long-term\n      neurobiological mechanisms triggered by the selected interventions."
