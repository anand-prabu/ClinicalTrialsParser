  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to find out the dose of enzalutamide that can be safely
      given with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer.
      Researchers also want to find out the side effects of these drugs when given together. This
      study will help in finding out the effect on tumor of the combination of enzalutamide,
      gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. In the first part of the study, different doses of
      enzalutamide will be tested. In the second part of the study, all patients will be started
      at the same dose of enzalutamide.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed pancreatic
             adenocarcinoma that is metastatic or unresectable. In the dose expansion phase, the
             tumor must express Androgen Receptor (AR) by immunohistochemistry. If ≥1% of the
             tumor cells express AR, it will be considered positive for this trial.

          -  Must have measurable disease per Response Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria
             version 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%)

          -  Life expectancy of greater than 3 months

          -  Must have normal organ and marrow function

          -  Prior treatment with gemcitabine alone or 5-Fluorouracil with radiation as an
             adjuvant therapy will be allowed; Should not have received gemcitabine within 6
             months of starting the study treatment; 5-Fluorouracil or radiation treatment should
             be received more than 4 weeks prior to receiving the study drug.
