The study focuses on the ultra acute phase, <4.5 hours from symptom onset,\n      including the prehospital setting. Analyses will include known biomarkers (e.g. GFAP, NR2\n      peptide) and a discovery phase for novel markers. Patient outcome will be evaluated at 3\n      month using the modified Rankin Scale (mRS)."
