Elderly patients have larger upper airways than young adult patients at all\n      pharyngeal levels as revealed by CT. Another study explained that there is a progressive\n      descent of the larynx and epiglottis with aging, which lengthens the upper airway and\n      possibly makes it more likely to collapse.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical efficacy of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) in\n      elderly patients with young adults. In this study, the investigators will measure the ease\n      of insertion, success rate of insertion, the time of insertion, oropharyngeal leak pressure,\n      gastric leak pressure, fiberoptic position and intraoperative complications of the classic\n      LMA."
