  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The two-layer bioresorbable HYTOP® matrix consists of an upper layer of highly purified
      porcine splint-skin which contains natural pores, and a lower layer of highly purified
      collagen fleece containing hyaluronan (HA).

      In this study, the medical device will be used and evaluated in a one-step procedure
      combining microfracturing with surgical implantation of HYTOP®. HYTOP® will support
      haemostasis in the articular cartilage defect, act as a support for cell growth and as a
      three-dimensional scaffold for cell differentiation. HYTOP® will protect the underlying
      tissue after cartilage debridement and/or microfracturing of the subchondral bone.

      The primary working hypothesis is that HYTOP® is safe and suitable as a cell-free matrix to
      support haemostasis, as a cover for the cartilage lesion and eventually to enhance cartilage
      regeneration in a one-step surgical procedure.
