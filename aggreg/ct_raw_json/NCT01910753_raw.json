            "textblock": "The loss of muscle mass (i.e., sarcopenia) has been identified as a negative prognosis\n      descriptor, disregarding the type of cancer. It is also a predictive descriptor for\n      treatment-related toxicity. Therefore it appears crucial to save muscle mass of patients,\n      following an adequate physical training together with a personalised diet program. The\n      latter point is of major importance as malnutrition concerns 45% patients having head and\n      neck cancer cancer, who stop physical activity due to extreme tiredness and decrease of\n      quality of life. In the present project, we plan a physical activity program that would be\n      adapted to each patient, accompanied by the rethought diet over a 3-month period. The\n      adapted physical activity (APA) is constituted of two aerobic stages and one resistance\n      training stage per a week. The evaluation will then proceed at three different moments,\n      namely (i) at T0 i.e., beginning of the program, (ii) at 3 months i.e., when the program\n      will be stopped, and (iii) at 6 months i.e., three months after the program stop. This\n      evaluation will include the success rate, the level of satisfaction, the physiological\n      parameters (VO2max, muscle mass and strength, BMI) and quality of life."
