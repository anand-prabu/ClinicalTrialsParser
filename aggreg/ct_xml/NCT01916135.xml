  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is the first time that a new experimental drug called [18F]-SKI-249380 is being
      used in people. [18F]-SKI-249380 is not a therapeutic drug. [18F]-SKI-249380 is a drug that
      will be used with PET scanners to 'see' where [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body, after its
      injected. The researchers believe that scans with [18F]-SKI-249380 might be able to find
      tumors in patients.

      This study is being done to see how long [18F]-SKI-249380 stays in the blood, when it is
      given to people in tiny amounts by an injection into a vein in their arm, and to see where
      [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study
      doctors plan to use [18F]-SKI-249380 in another trial to see if scans with [18F]-SKI-249380
      are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use.

PET scans will be performed immediately, at approximately 90 minutes, and optionally at approximately 3 hours after injection of the radiotracer.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with history of histologically-confirmed cancer of any of the following
             classifications: carcinoma; sarcoma; myeloma; melanoma; and lymphoma.

          -  Histology confirmed by MSKCC Department of Pathology.

          -  Disease is measurable or evaluable as defined by RECIST (1.1 or original version) or
             other tumor response criteria from an MSKCC IRB-approved clinical research protocol
             Age between 21-90

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for females of child-bearing age (11-55 years) and
             potential (ie, women who were not postmenopausal before the start of ongoing
             treatment, if applicable; and who have not had a surgical intervention whose intent
             or effect is sterilization, such as tubal ligation or hysterectomy.)

          -  Not breast-feeding, if applicable.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal or inability to discontinue medications or other substances (eg, foods or
             dietary supplements) that may affect [18F]-SKI-249380 metabolism. Notably, as
             dasatinib metabolism is CYP3A4-dependent, the metabolism of [18F]-SKI-249380 may be
             altered by inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The
             acceptability of medications and other substances used by the patient will be
             determined by the study investigators.

          -  Dasatinib may alter the biodistribution of [18F]-SKI-249380. A patient who is being
             or will be treated with dasatinib or has previously-received dasatinib therapy will
             be eligible for this study, if (in addition to meeting all other study criteria) the
             following two conditions are acceptable:

               1. The patient will not ingest dasatinib for 60 hours prior to the scheduled
                  [18F]-SKI-249380 tracer-injection. This allows for systemic 'wash-out' of
                  dasatinib, if applicable (60 hours â‰ˆ 10 clearance half-times past the average
                  human plasma Tmax of dasatinib and its metabolites).

               2. The patient will not ingest dasatinib for 3.5 hours after receiving the
                  [18F]-SKI-249380 tracer-injection. 3.5 hours is the time-period needed for
                  completion of all study-related [18F]-SKI-249380 PET scans and blooddraws.
                  Dasatinib therapy can be administered immediately-thereafter, if applicable.
                  Note: Patients are not required to be taking dasatinib therapy to participate in
                  this [18F]-SKI-249380 PET study.

          -  Inability or refusal to have at least one peripheral intravenous line for intravenous
             access (as applicable to the day of [18F]-SKI-249380 injection and blood draws.)

          -  Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia)

          -  Hepatic: from assays obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Bilirubin &gt; 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  AST/ALT &gt;2.5 x ULN

          -  Albumin &lt; 2 g/dl

          -  GGT &gt; 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase &gt; 2.5 x ULN.

          -  Renal: Creatinine &gt;1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance &lt; 60 mL/min, from assays
             obtained &lt;2 weeks prior to study enrollment

          -  Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)
