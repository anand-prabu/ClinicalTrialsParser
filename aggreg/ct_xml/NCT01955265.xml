      Physical activity is beneficial to human health. Besides improving fitness, such as lowering
      blood pressure and improving physical composition, the benefits of sports span across almost
      all domains of developmental trajectories. Unfortunately, many young people in Hong Kong do
      not have enough physical activity on a regular basis. Data from government surveys in 2009
      show that only 34.2% of children ages 7-12 had at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous
      activity five days a week over a 3 month period. According to a more recent representative
      survey, only 6.6% of secondary school students in Hong Kong met the WHO recommended standard
      of 60 minutes of moderate and vigorous activity in the past 7 days while 27.1% reported of
      not meeting the standard in any days of the past week.

      This project will explore the possibility of fostering positive adolescent development
      through tailoring a community-based youth project in Kwai Tsing district in Hong Kong.
      Specifically, physical activity would benefit the adolescents in terms of physical,
      psychological/emotional, social and intellectual development, together of which forms the
      important foundation for a healthy and productive adult life. The project will incorporate a
      physical activity intervention guided by behavioral theory in a secondary school-based
      setting. The role of personality along the effect will also be examined which may enhance a
      personalised platform to promote physical activity among adolescents.

      A randomized controlled design will be used in intervention. Half of the randomized students
      will be in the physical activity intervention group, receiving regular physical activities
      tailor-made to them, while the other half will be receiving another intervention campaign
      which will not increase their physical activity level. The interventions will take place for
      about one academic year. Interim and final assessments will be administered to evaluate
      their developmental growth.

      Trained professionals will administer the physical activity programme which could minimize
      the chance of sport injury. Personal information and data collected would be kept
      confidential. A safety protocol will be implemented to ensure safety, confidentiality and
      privacy of the participants.

      Background :

      Many young people in Hong Kong do not have a habit of practicing physical activity
      regularly. Data from government surveys in 2009 show that only 34.2% of children ages 7-12
      had at least 60 minutes of moderate or vigorous activity five days a week over a 3 month
      period. The lack of physical activity comes with an uprising adolescent health problems such
      as substance abuse, shoplifting, and mental health problems. Sports related positive youth
      programmes (PYDs) have been developed and implemented globally to tackle these problems.
      However, not much studies have been done in putting physical activity participation, PYD,
      and personality into one framework in Hong Kong and in Asia. According to a meta-analysis
      conducted in 2011, among the 7 rigorously evaluated PYD in Asia, none has used sports /
      physical activity as the main theme. The proposed study could answer the research gap
      identified above by using sports as an intervention in examining its role on youth positive
      development.

      Aims :

        1. individual-level : to increase participation in physical activity among intervention
           school students.

        2. school-level : to develop school-based year-round physical activity programs that would
           expand opportunities for participation in physical activities for all students.

        3. community-level : to provide opportunities for inter-school and intra-community
           competitions that involved students, families and neighbours.

        4. individual-level : to enhance positive adolescent development including resiliency,
           social connectedness, and academic performance.

        5. community-level : to foster social network and community development within the
           community

      Inclusion criteria :

      All Form 1 and Form 2 students in the participating schools will be recruited for the study.

      Outcome measurements :

      Physical development would be measured both objectively and subjectively. The Hong Kong
      Education Bureau has suggested students to involve in a physical fitness test comprising of
      skinfolds (triceps and calf), sit-ups, sit-and-reach, push-ups, and 9-minute run/walk[31]
      every year. These fitness records of each student would be retrieved from the school
      masters. Other figures such as BMI-ratio, waist-hip ratio, and body fat percentage would
      also be measured objectively.

      The subjective physical development would be measured by the Physical Component Summary
      score (PCS-12) of the Chinese (HK) SF-12v2 Health Survey.

      the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ), the Healthy Kids Resilience Assessment
      (HKRA), the Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC), the 10-item uni-dimension General
      Self-Efficacy Scale and the Mental Component Summary score (MCS-12) of the Short Form
      12-Helath Survey (SF-12) will be used in measuring the psychological / emotional
      development.

      The Hemingway Measure of Adolescent Connectedness Questionnaire would be used for social
      development while school academic scores of the main subjects including Chinese, English and
      mathematics would be the measuring tool for intellectual development.
