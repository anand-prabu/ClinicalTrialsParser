Because the outcomes can be came out differently each study by\n      measurement, criteria, treatment period, treatment method and morbid extremities of\n      lymphedema. Therefore it is required for understanding about the incidence, risk factor and\n      physical progress for to be treated and prevented of lymphedema. Also it is necessary that\n      to understand characteristics of lymphedema measurements and to establish diagnostic\n      criteria of lymphedema through comparative study.\n\n      The aim of this study was to analyze the incidence and risk factor of lymphedema through\n      prospectively observation, and to determine effects on the quality of life of lymphedema\n      after breast cancer surgery with ALND."
