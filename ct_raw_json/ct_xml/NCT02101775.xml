    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II clinical trial studies how well gemcitabine hydrochloride and WEE1
      inhibitor MK-1775 work compared to gemcitabine hydrochloride alone in treating patients with
      recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. Gemcitabine hydrochloride
      may prevent tumor cells from multiplying by damaging their DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid,
      molecules that contain instructions for the proper development and functioning of cells),
      which in turn stops the tumor from growing. The protein Wee1 may help to repair the damaged
      tumor cells, so the tumor continues to grow. WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 may block the Wee1
      protein activity and may increase the effectiveness of gemcitabine hydrochloride by
      preventing the Wee1 protein from repairing damaged tumor cells without causing harm to
      normal cells. It is not yet known if gemcitabine hydrochloride with WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775
      may be an effective treatment for recurrent ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the progression free survival (PFS) of subjects with recurrent
      platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer receiving
      gemcitabine (gemcitabine hydrochloride) in combination with MK-1775 (WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775)
      compared to subjects receiving single agent gemcitabine.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the objective response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) 1.1 of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with MK-1775 compared to patients
      receiving gemcitabine as single agent.

      II. To evaluate the Gynecologic Cancer Intergroup (GCIG) cancer antigen (CA)125 response
      rate of patients receiving gemcitabine combined with MK-1775 compared to patients receiving
      gemcitabine as single agent.

      III. To evaluate the overall survival of patients (max 1-year [yr] follow-up) receiving
      gemcitabine combined with MK-1775 compared to patients receiving gemcitabine as single
      agent.

      IV. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of the combination of gemcitabine combined with
      MK-1775 in patients with recurrent, platinum-resistant ovarian, fallopian tube or primary
      peritoneal cancer.

      V. To evaluate tumor protein p53 [TP53] mutations (presence of mutation and type of
      mutation) as potential predictive factors of benefit (defined as response or
      progression-free survival [PFS] prolongation) to MK-1775 and gemcitabine treatment.

      VI. To evaluate p53 protein expression by immunohistochemistry as potential predictive
      factors of benefit (defined as response or PFS prolongation) to MK-1775 and gemcitabine
      treatment.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the concordance of TP53 mutations in the tumor specimen and TP53 mutations
      determined by tagged-amplicon deep sequencing (Tam-Seq) in circulating tumor
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA).

      II. To correlate the levels circulating DNA TP53 mutations by Tam-Seq with response III.
      Validation of pCDC2 and gamma H2A histone family, member X (gH2AX) in skin and tumor tissue
      as a pharmacodynamic marker of therapy.

      IV. To correlate changes in pCDC2 and H2AX phosphorylation (pH2AX) with survival outcomes
      and response rate.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive WEE1 inhibitor MK-1775 orally (PO) on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16
      and gemcitabine hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and 15.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15, and 16 and gemcitabine
      hydrochloride as patients in Arm I. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6-8 weeks for up to 1
      year.
