While lung disease is recognized as the leading cause of\n      death amongst patients with scleroderma, there is not a large body of literature describing\n      the long-term morbidity and mortality rate of these scleroderma patients.  For this reason,\n      the investigators are following participants of the Scleroderma Lung Study (NCT00004563)\n      after their participation in that study was concluded.  In addition, the investigators will\n      assess if the subjects who received one year of oral cyclophosphamide in the Scleroderma\n      Lung Study experienced progression of their scleroderma-related lung disease following the\n      end of the study."
