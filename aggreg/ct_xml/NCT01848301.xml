  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Coronary allograft vasculopathy (CAV) is the leading cause of late graft failure and second
      leading cause of late mortality after heart transplantation. CAV has been associated with a
      variety of traditional risk factors for atherosclerosis; however, immune mediated injury
      from development of de-novo donor-specific antibodies after transplantation also likely
      plays an important role.  Similar to the progression of traditional atherosclerosis, it is
      likely that endothelial dysfunction is the precursor to the development of intimal
      thickening and CAV.

      The investigators hypothesize that coronary allograft vasculopathy after heart
      transplantation as defined by progressive neointimal hyperplasia is preceded by endothelial
      dysfunction, which in turn is at least partly mediated by donor specific antibodies.

      The investigators are proposing a prospective study in humans to test the above hypothesis
      and further mechanistically understand how CAV progresses.  In this study the investigators
      will test for coronary endothelial function by infusing acetylcholine into the coronary
      artery and measure intimal hyperplasia by optical coherence tomography (OCT) and compare
      findings in patients with and without donor specific antibodies.
