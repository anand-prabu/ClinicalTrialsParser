            "textblock": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infects the CD4 subset of T-cells that are critical for\n      initiating immune responses to infection. The level of CD4 cells in the blood is a marker of\n      a patient's immunological status. The number of CD4 cells decreases in the course of the HIV\n      infection and results in a reduced immunological response and eventually immune deficiency.\n\n      Vacc-4x is one of the few peptide-based therapeutic vaccines tested, and consists of four,\n      slightly modified HIV Gag p24 consensus peptides. Vacc-4x was first tested by intradermal\n      injections using GM-CSF as adjuvant. A recent multinational placebo-controlled study found\n      improvement of vaccine-specific T cell immunity and decrease in viral loads (presented at\n      the AIDS vaccine 2011 conference, Bangkok).\n\n      Lenalidomide (CC-5013) is a substance in the class of immunomodulatory agents. The\n      lenalidomide mechanism of action includes anti-neoplastic, pro-erythropoietic, and\n      immunomodulatory properties. Lenalidomide inhibits proliferation of certain hematopoietic\n      tumor cells, enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and increases\n      the number of NK T cells.\n\n      The anti-HIV p24 immune response resulting from Vacc-4x immunization could in combination\n      with ART potentially improve immune reconstitution in patients who have not fully regained a\n      healthy CD4 level (> 600 x106/L). Adding the immunomodulatory agent Lenalidomide (CC-5013)\n      to Vacc-4x immunization could enhance the immune response to Vacc-4x and further strengthen\n      immune reconstitution."
