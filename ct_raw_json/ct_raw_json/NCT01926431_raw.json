Functional magnetic resonance techniques were used\n      to assess the brains response to images of high and low calorie foods, following a short\n      bout of high-intensity exercise. Appetite hormone concentrations were also measured. It was\n      hypothesized that, due to the known effects of high-intensity exercise on appetite\n      regulatory hormones and subjective appetite ratings, the activation of reward-related brain\n      regions to visual food cues would be modulated following intense physical activity."
