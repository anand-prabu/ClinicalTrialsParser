In addition\n      to erythropoietin deficiency, many studies have identified iron deficiency as a cause of\n      anemia in CKD patients. Most patients with CKD are iron deficient because of: inadequate\n      intake  and absorption, gastroenteric bleeding, urinary iron loss in patient with\n      significant proteinuria. The  iron treatment is pivotal to manage anemic patients with CKD:\n      the prescription of iron is usually oral because of practicality and safety, but often it is\n      inevitable to administer intravenous iron because of gastroenteric malabsorption,\n      intolerance to oral administration, irregular intake. There're few randomized controlled\n      studies about the efficacy of oral iron versus intravenous iron in patients not on dialysis;\n      most of them demonstrate superiority of intravenous therapy to restore iron deficiency and\n      hemoglobin levels. A particular formulation of iron, liposomal iron  has a high\n      gastroenteric absorption and high bioavailability with lower incidence of side effects. The\n      investigators study aims to evaluate the efficacy of treatment with liposomal oral iron\n      compared to  intravenous iron in  CKD anemic patients not on dialysis in the presence of\n      iron deficiency."
