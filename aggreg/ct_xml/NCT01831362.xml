      This study addresses NCCAM's request for research that investigates the neuropsychological
      mechanisms underlying mind-body therapies, and for precise criteria and better delineation
      of meditation practices.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the clinical efficacy and mechanism of action of 2
      component practices of &quot;mindfulness meditation&quot;, i.e. focused awareness (FA) and open
      monitoring (OM) in comparison to each other and to the standard package, Mindfulness-Based
      Cognitive Therapy (MBCT).

    <textblock>
      Meditation, particularly mindfulness meditation, is one of the most popular Complementary
      and Alternative Medicine (CAM) therapies for alleviating emotional stress, depression and
      anxiety. While standardized meditation-based treatment packages like Mindfulness Based
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) have reliably shown
      sustained improvements in emotional disturbances and wellbeing, they contain so many
      different components and practices that the active ingredient cannot be ascertained. What is
      commonly called &quot;Mindfulness&quot; meditation is actually comprised of two separate practices: 1)
      focused awareness practice (FA), and 2) open-monitoring practice (OM). This project aims to
      create separate 8 week programs for FA and OM meditations, compare their clinical efficacy
      and investigate their separate mechanisms of action in individuals with clinically
      significant levels of persistent negative affect and depression. The clinical benefit and
      mechanism of action of focused awareness (FA) vs open-monitoring (OM) vs MBCT  will be
      examined with a 3-armed randomized control trial of these 8 week interventions. Outcome
      variables include negative affect (depression, anxiety, stress) and wellbeing. Hypothesized
      mediating processes include objectively measured attention, emotion regulation and the basic
      wakefulness on which they depend.
