Patients with hemoglobin levels of 10.0-12.0 g/dL\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Patients with hemoglobin levels greater than 12.0\n      g/dL are not randomized until their hemoglobin levels decrease to 12.0 g/dL or below.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients immediately receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously each week.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients are observed for 6-8 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated.\n           Patients whose hemoglobin levels decrease below 9.0 g/dL receive epoetin alfa\n           subcutaneously each week. Patients whose hemoglobin levels are at least 9.0 g/dL are\n           observed for another 3-4 weeks and then hemoglobin levels are reevaluated.\n\n      Patients receive epoetin alfa treatment for up to 15 or 16 weeks.\n\n      Qualify of life questionnaires are completed every 3 or 4 weeks until week 30 or 32.\n\n      Patients are followed through week 36.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 275 patients (at least 130 per treatment arm) will be accrued\n      for this study."
