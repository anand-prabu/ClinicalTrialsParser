Assess the response rate, local control, time to progression, pattern of failure, and\n      magnetic resonance spectrographic data following this therapy in these patients.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: All patients undergo stereotaxic head frame placement, followed by\n      stereotaxic radiosurgery on day 1. The dosage of radiation therapy administered is dependent\n      on the tumor diameter.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 and 6 weeks and then every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      Up to 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-10 months."
