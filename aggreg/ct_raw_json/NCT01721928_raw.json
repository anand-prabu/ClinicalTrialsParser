The main objective is to compare the prophylactic effect of dalteparin in\n      intensive care unit (ICU) patients with AKI and Citrate-Calcium dialysis (CiCa-dialysis)\n      with a control group of ICU patients with normal kidney function. Our main hypothesis is\n      that CiCa-dialysis reduces dalteparin effect, and that patients undergoing CiCa-dialysis do\n      not achieve adequate prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism (VTE). The primary endpoint\n      is development of DVT during ICU stay, the secondary endpoint inadequate heparin effect\n      measured in blood samples."
