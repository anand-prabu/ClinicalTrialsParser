To know safety and effectiveness of received 2 doses varicella vaccine with different\n           interval.\n\n        3. To know safety and effectiveness of received varicella vaccine and MMR at the same\n           time.\n\n      To achieve that, this study selects children with specific varicella vaccine history, gives\n      1 or 2 doses varicella vaccine, collects blood specimens and makes a follow-up visit after\n      vaccination.\n\n      All blood specimens will be tested by a third-party detection institution."
