In fact the rehabilitation treatment, that aims\n      at reducing motor disability, preserving gait functions and preventing falling risks, is an\n      interesting therapeutic approach. Literature recommends balance re-training exercises,\n      muscle strengthening, selective stretching and retraining of motor activity.\n\n      New technologies produced in the recent decades different devices used in strengthening\n      exercises (electromechanical dynamometers), balance recovery (balance platforms) and gait\n      (analyzing treadmills) have visual feedbacks through which the patients may independently\n      monitor accuracy and intensity of their exercises, being therefore strongly motivated and\n      resulting in a high training intensity. These technologies are often used in rehabilitation\n      of different patients, but are rarely employed for DSP.\n\n      The purpose of this case control study was to examine the effectiveness of the application\n      of analysing treadmill, muscle strengthening and balance training compared to a control\n      intervention in patients with diabetic neuropathy."
