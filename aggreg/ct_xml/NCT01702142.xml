  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A team of researchers from the University of Wisconsin-Madison College of Engineering and
      Oregon Health &amp; Science University will test whether clinician training and the use of
      organizational change strategies are sufficient for disseminating an evidence-based practice
      (EBP), or if changes to both organizational systems and payer policy results in greater EBP
      use. Demonstrating the role of payment policy as a driver in the adoption of evidence-based
      practices could provide a contribution to dissemination and implementation science. This
      study will employ an intervention that was developed through the Robert Wood Johnson
      Foundation-funded Advancing Recovery (AR) program. In AR, payer/treatment organization
      partnerships in 12 states collaborated to remove systemic barriers to the adoption of EBPs
      such as medication-assisted treatment for substance abuse disorders. The resulting &quot;AR
      Framework&quot; of payer and organizational change strategies will be tested against its ability
      to increase the use of the addiction medication buprenorphine as compared to organizational
      change strategies alone. Buprenorphine is an EBP for treating people addicted to heroin or
      opioid-based pain medications for non-medical use. Buprenorphine has experienced low
      adoption rates and is not a standard part of addiction treatment. In Ohio, the location of
      the study, deaths to due to accidental overdoses of opioids has increased by 304% over the
      past decade and surpassed auto accidents as the leading cause of accidental deaths in 2006.
      Ohio was selected for the study because of the public health significance of opioid abuse
      and because each county in Ohio acts as a stand-alone payer, offering 48 unique eligible
      payer environments. This trial will develop a deeper understanding of the role payers and
      treatment organizations play in implementing and disseminating EBPs and will focus on the
      public health issue of rising opioid abuse.

    <textblock>
      Buprenorphine (EBP) use data will be collected from November, 2012 to May, 2016 through
      administrative databases located at the state of Ohio.  Participants will be followed for
      the duration of Buprenorphine use that is an average of 5-7 months.  Organizational and
      Payer data will be collected from January, 2013 to January, 2015. The data from the study
      will be analyzed and reported during January 2015 to February 2017.
