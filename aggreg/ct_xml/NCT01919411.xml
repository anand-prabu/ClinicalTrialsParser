  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgeons commonly prescribe post operative prophylactic antibiotics after sinus surgery.
      There is minimal data to support this.  The investigators' study will aim to demonstrate
      that patients' quality of life and rate of post operative infection is the same whether they
      receive or do not receive antibiotics post operatively. The investigators hypothesis is that
      the disease specific quality of life of patients taking post-operative antibiotics is not
      inferior to the quality of life of patients who do not take post-operative antibiotics, and
      the rate of post-operative infections are the same.  The investigators' specific aim is to
      compare validated symptom scores between post-operative populations who are given or are not
      given antibiotics.  Rates of infections in the first 10 days after surgery will be recorded.
       The investigators will also compare endoscopic grades of sinus cavities during the
      post-operative follow up exams as an additional outcome measure.

    <textblock>
      Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) is a commonly performed procedure in the United
      States to treat chronic rhinosinusitis.  Common practice is to prescribe prophylactic
      antibiotics postoperatively.  This is similar to the long tradition of prophylactic
      antibiotics after tonsillectomy.  The American Academy of Otolaryngology - Head and Neck
      Surgery recently strongly recommended against prophylactic antibiotics after tonsillectomy.
      In this light, this study would demonstrate the lack of need for antibiotics after FESS.
      Currently one surgeon does not prescribe antibiotics except when evidence of active
      infection was found during surgery.  The other surgeon in the study currently prescribes
      antibiotics.  This study would prospectively compare the two groups in a randomized fashion.
       The investigators' plan to use the Sinonasal outcomes test - 22 (SNOT-22) as the
      investigators' primary outcomes measure, which is a validated quality of life instrument in
      sinusitis.

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - Patients eligible for surgery would be patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (defined by
        the AAOHNS 2007 consensus statement by Rosenfeld et al) and have been determined by their
        surgeons to have persistent symptoms after maximal medical therapy.  Maximal medical
        therapy is defined as a course of broad spectrum or culture-directed antibiotics used in
        conjunction with a nasal steroid.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Penicillin, cephalosporin, amoxicillin/clavulanate allergy

          2. Cystic Fibrosis

          3. Immunodeficiency

          4. Presence of any foreign body (ie.absorbable and non-absorbable packing) after surgery

          5. Odontogenic causes of sinusitis

          6. Fungal ball

          7. Infected mucocele

          8. Complication of sinusitis (meningitis, orbital complication, cellulitis, brain
             abscess)

          9. Non endoscopic sinus surgery (Caldwell luc, external approaches, etc)

         10. Age &lt;18
