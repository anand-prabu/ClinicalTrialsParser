If even and for how long the\n      medication was discontinued, if any other antithrombotic therapy was used in the\n      perioperative period and prevalence of perioperative complications - especially ischemic or\n      bleeding. These complications will be correlated with the pattern of antithrombotic therapy\n      administration. Working hypothesis is to obtain a large database of unselected cohort of\n      consecutive patients for mapping of this practically important, but in the evidence-based\n      medicine, still neglected problem."
