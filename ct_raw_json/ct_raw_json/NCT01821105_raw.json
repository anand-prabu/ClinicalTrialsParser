To complete development of software for the nonlinear registration of PET and CT\n      datasets.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo preoperative whole-body PET scans and CT scans of the abdomen and pelvis.\n      Patients then receive 18 F fludeoxyglucose (FDG) intravenously (IV) 60-90 minutes prior to\n      surgery and undergo intraoperative CT scans using a handheld probe and computer navigation\n      system."

In cases of primary cancer, there must be a tissue-confirmed diagnosis.\n             In recurrent cases, patients must have clinical evidence by CT or MRI of disease\n             suitable for resection.\n\n          -  Patients must be candidates for clinically indicated surgery.\n\n          -  Patients with recurrent disease may have had prior surgery and/or chemotherapy with\n             no limit to the number of prior therapeutic procedures or chemotherapeutic regimens.\n\n          -  Patients must have a performance status of 0, 1 or 2 by ECOG(Eastern  Cooperative\n             Oncology Group)standards.\n\n          -  Patients must give written informed consent including consent to have IV line placed\n             for FDG administration.\n\n          -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age.  Children under the age of 18 are excluded\n             from the study due to the rarity of colorectal cancer in children.\n\n          -  Because radiolabeled agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing\n             potential and men must agree to use an acceptable form of contraception prior to\n             study entry and for the duration of the study participation.  Should a woman become\n             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should\n             inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n          -  Organ function requirements: Patients must have organ and marrow function adequate to\n             undergo laparotomy.  Specifically:\n\n          -  Serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl\n\n          -  Serum bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl\n\n          -  AST(aspartate aminotransferase,serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase, serum\n             glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase,serum glutamate pyruvate\n             transaminase)[SGOT]/ALT[SGPT]<4 times institutional upper limit of normal\n\n          -  Total WBC(white blood cell)>4,000/mm3 or ANC(absolute neutrophil count)> 1,500/mm3\n\n          -  Platelets > 100,000/mm3\n\n          -  Hgb >10g/dl\n\n          -  Patient must have no clinically significant cardiac disease (New York Heart\n             Association Class III/IV); no serious infection requiring treatment with antibiotics;\n             no other serious ill-ness or illness requiring the use of steroids; no clinically\n             significant pulmonary disease or other illness that would contraindicate or increase\n             the risk of complications at surgery.\n\n          -  Fasting blood sugar less than 120 mg/dl\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with active CNS (central nervous system)tumor involvement are ineligible.\n\n          -  Any patient who has retained childbearing potential will not be pregnant or lactating\n             and must use adequate contraception to assure avoidance of conception.\n\n          -  Body size prohibits use of the diagnostic equipment (portable CT scanner).\n\n          -  Tumor burden is so great (as determined by preoperative PET scanning or\n             intraoperative findings) that further surgery is not advised.\n\n          -  If lesions are detected with preoperative CT but not with PET scanning (in other\n             words, all patients will have a positive PET scan as part of the inclusion criteria)."
