Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD)\n      is a serious life-threatening complication after allo-HSCT. The outcome for patients with\n      aGVHD is poor and overall survival is low. Acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), as the\n      major complication of allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell transplantation(PBSCT), limits\n      the application of this curative therapy. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multipotent stem\n      cells, which are able to  modulate immune response in vitro and in vivo, and have\n      possibilities of treating diseases caused by immune dysregulation such as aGVHD. MSCs\n      obtained from umbilical cord (UC) have similar immunosuppressive properties as bone\n      marrow-MSCs. In addition, UC-derived MSCs can be used for off-the-shelf use and are obtained\n      without any harm to donors than bone marrow-MSCs. Therefore, the investigators designed this\n      study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of UC-derived MSCs in patients with aGVHD."

The umbilical cord is\n      one of the important sources of MSC. Human UC-MSC compared with the bone marrow-derived MSC\n      has the following advantages: (1) the umbilical cord, as a \"waste\" after giving birth can be\n      obtained without any harm to the donor. (2) easy available, and no ethical issues. (3) its\n      likelihood of contamination is small because of the protection of the placental barrier. (4)\n      human UC-MSC has a stronger amplification capacity, a shorter doubling time, a higher colony\n      forming efficiency and lower immunogenicity. (5) which avoids the activity and\n      differentiation of bone marrow-derived MSC latent with the donor disadvantage of increasing\n      age decreased.\n\n      hUC-MSC not only for hematopoietic stem cell graft implantation and amplification has a role\n      in promoting and exhibit immunomodulatory effects and characteristics of damaged or targeted\n      sites of chronic inflammation. hUC-MSC in the prevention and treatment of graft-versus-host\n      disease (GVHD) induced organ transplantation immune tolerance and other fields has broad\n      application prospects.\n\n      After more than 10 years of exploration, the investigators and other practitioners caught\n      studies found that the umbilical cord is more suitable as mesenchymal stem cells seed cells\n      relative to the bone marrow, umbilical cord easily obtained, no ethical issues, better\n      amplification ability in vitro, viral contamination risk is small, and many other\n      advantages. Therefore, over the years, the investigator team for the umbilical cord\n      mesenchymal stem cells in a lot of the basic work has been confirmed that mesenchymal stem\n      cells derived from the umbilical cord had safety and effectiveness in in the treatment of\n      acute graft versus host disease in zoology test, and successfully establish a perfect\n      umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells in standard operating procedures (including screening\n      umbilical cord, large-scale preparation, quality inspection, preservation, recovery,\n      transportation, infusion, etc.). The investigators will carry out the clinical research\n      based on above preliminary results."
