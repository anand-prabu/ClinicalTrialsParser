Courses repeat every 4 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 24 additional\n      patients are treated at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-45 patients (24 patients for phase II) will be accrued for\n      this study within 2 years."
