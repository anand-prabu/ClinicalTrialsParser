It aims to facilitate and potentiate\n      the wound healing by restorating the natural microenvironment.\n\n      CACICOL20 was used in treating corneal dystrophies and chronic corneal ulcers. It\n      significantly favored corneal healing. It was well tolerated with no side effects.\n\n      Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular condition that may result in significant\n      sight-threatening corneal sequelae. The common risk factors for infectious keratitis include\n      ocular trauma, contact lens wear, recent ocular surgery, preexisting ocular surface disease,\n      dry eyes, lid deformity, corneal sensational impairment, chronic use of topical steroids,\n      and systemic immunosuppression. Serious cases of keratitis are hospitalized to administrate\n      an intensive hospital-made local antibiotic.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate efficiency of CACICOL20 for bacterial keratitis. It\n      is a double blinded comparison of epithelial defect in two groups of patients randomized\n      between CACICOL20 and physiological salt solution."
