They documented the nature\n      and extent of changes in cardiac function based on pulse Doppler measures and indices and\n      developed corresponding reference values. They also investigated clinical findings based on\n      M-mode and Doppler measurements as well as changes in body size and composition, sexual\n      maturation, and other covariates. They used existing data from Project HeartBeat! 's 12\n      four-monthly examinations over the age range from 8 to 17 years."
