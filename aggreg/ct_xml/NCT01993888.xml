    <description>SoC is a composite of techniques/methods typically used by the surgeon to control bleeding after conventional methods (i.e. suture, ligation, cautery) are ineffective or impractical.   For this study, SoC will be initiated with continuous firm manual compression with or without gauze or sponge and with or without a topical absorbable hemostat (example SURGICEL).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects ≥ 18 years of age, requiring elective or urgent, open hepatic surgery.

          -  Presence of an appropriate bleeding hepatic parenchymal Target Bleeding Site (TBS) as
             identified intra-operatively by the surgeon

          -  Subjects or legally authorized representatives must be willing to participate in the
             study, and provide written informed consent. (Note: This criteria does allow for
             hospital translators to be used where approved by Ethics Committees/Institutional
             Review Boards)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any intra-operative findings identified by the surgeon that may
             preclude conduct of the study procedure;

          -  TBS is from large defects in arteries or veins where the injured vascular wall
             requires repair with maintenance of vessel patency and which would result in
             persistent exposure of EVARREST™ to blood flow and pressure during healing and
             absorption of the product;

          -  TBS with major arterial bleeding requiring suture or mechanical ligation;

          -  Subjects admitted for trauma surgery;

          -  Subject is a transplant patient for fulminant hepatic failure

          -  Subject with TBS within an actively infected field;

          -  Bleeding site is in, around, or in proximity to foramina in bone, or areas of bony
             confine;

          -  Subjects with known intolerance to blood products or to one of the components of the
             study product or is unwilling to receive blood products;

          -  Subjects who are known, current alcohol and / or drug abusers;

          -  Subjects who have participated in another investigational medical device or
             investigational drug trial within 30 days of surgery or are expected to participate
             in another medical device or investigational drug trial during the course of the
             study;

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or nursing.
