Surprisingly, however, given the high\n      prevalence of depression in cancer patients, there are very few studies on the efficacy of\n      psychotherapy in this population. Published studies of psychotherapy in cancer patients\n      generally include patients with high heterogeneity of psychiatric diagnosis and frequently\n      include patients without a psychiatric diagnosis, with the aim of preventing the appearance\n      of a psychiatric disorder. This heterogeneity complicates the interpretation of the efficacy\n      and specificity of these interventions. Specifically, the efficacy of psychotherapy for\n      major depression in patients with cancer is unknown."

Patients  that  are  deemed\n      eligible  for  the  study  will have  IPT  for twelve weeks. Patients will receive twelve\n      50-minute sessions over 16 weeks.
