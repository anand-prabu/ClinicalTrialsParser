  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the conducting ability of distal extremity nerves
      after a supraclavicular brachial plexus nerve block (with local anesthetic) has been placed
      at a more proximal location in the upper extremity.

        Male and female military health care beneficiaries age 18 years and older presenting for
        hand surgery and eligible for a brachial plexus nerve block will be asked to participate
        in this study.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female military health care beneficiaries 18 years and older, capable of
             providing informed consent indicating awareness of the investigational nature of the
             study, in keeping with institutional policy

          -  Written informed consent must be obtained from each patient prior to entering the
             study

          -  Patients must be willing to have a regional anesthetic nerve block placed prior to
             their scheduled procedure

          -  Patients must be willing to have neurodiagnostic tests performed prior to placement
             and after placement of the regional anesthesia nerve block

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to have a brachial plexus nerve block placed

          -  Refusal to have serial nerve conduction studies performed

          -  Contraindication for a regional anesthesia nerve block (allergy to local anesthetic,
             infection at site of injection, elevated coagulation time)

          -  Presence of conditions affecting the hand or arm (e.g., injury, infection) that might
             preclude the performance of nerve conduction studies

          -  Presence of known major abnormalities of nerve conduction, e.g., absent median
             sensory potential in a patient scheduled for carpal tunnel release

          -  Presence of conditions affecting the contralateral hand or arm (e.g., injury,
             infection) that might preclude the performance of sensory and motor studies to test
             block or absence of a contralateral upper extremity
