            "textblock": "The goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that immediate elbow motion is safe after\n      anterior submuscular ulnar nerve transposition, and will not result in disruption of the\n      repaired flexor pronator origin, under which the nerve is placed. The advantages of\n      immediate elbow motion after submuscular ulnar nerve transposition for performing activities\n      of daily living and self-care are evident, however theoretical advantages include early\n      \"gliding\" of the transposed ulnar nerve with a lower risk of nerve adhesions and subsequent\n      traction neuritis, as well as improved blood flow and quicker, more complete, recovery of\n      nerve function.\n\n      A group of 44 consecutive patients that are determined to be candidates for anterior\n      submuscular ulnar nerve transposition based on history, positive findings on physical\n      examination, and confirmatory electrodiagnostic testing will be prospectively randomized to\n      either immediate motion or long arm cast immobilization after surgery. All patients will be\n      counseled about the two postoperative treatment options (immobilization followed by\n      protected range of motion versus immediate range of motion), risks involved with each\n      treatment protocol, postoperative follow-up and need for radiographs. If they choose not to\n      participate, they will be treated by the same postoperative protocol currently used by the\n      principal investigator: arm sling at rest for six weeks with intermittent active assisted\n      range of motion exercises."
