Our hypothesis is that there will\n      be differences in the use of oral anticoagulants and the persistence in patients between the\n      control and interventional group. There will be a greater change in the use of oral\n      anticoagulants over one year in the cohort in the intervention sites than the control sites.\n      This will be due to two factors: greater initiation of oral anticoagulants among patients\n      not treated at baseline and greater persistence of treatment for those on treatment at\n      baseline"
