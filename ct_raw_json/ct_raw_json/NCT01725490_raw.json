Chemopreventive strategies have been studied in FAP patients\n      to delay the development of adenomas and cancers. The non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs\n      (NSAIDs) and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor have shown the regression of colorectal\n      and duodenal adenomas in FAP patients. However, these drugs showed gastrointestinal damage\n      and cardiovascular risks, and new preventive strategies are needed.  Metformin, a biguanide,\n      which is widely used for treating diabetes mellitus, has recently been suggested to have a\n      suppressive effect on tumorigenesis via mTOR-inhibiting pathway, and have no significant\n      safety issues in long term use. The investigators devised a double-blind randomized\n      controlled trial to evaluate the effect of metformin on polyps of colorectum and duodenum in\n      non-diabetic FAP patients."
