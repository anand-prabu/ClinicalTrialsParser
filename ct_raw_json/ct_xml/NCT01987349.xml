  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate markers, mechanisms and define general predictors for
      immunological health. This goal is analogous to what has been achieved in cardiovascular
      medicine where the levels of different forms of cholesterol have provided useful benchmarks
      for cardiovascular health. In this context, immunization with FDA approved flu vaccines
      represents a safe and accessible opportunity to gauge the immune response in a particular
      individual as a function of age and genetics and then to try to find predictive biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>

      The investigators plan to study the immune response to different influenza vaccines much
      more broadly and deeply across different age groups and with different vaccine modalities
      and to probe the influence of genetics on these responses using monozygotic and dizygotic
      twins. The investigators plan to compare various immunological responses, identify
      age-specific biomarkers or clusters of markers, quantify the frequency of influenza-specific
      T-cells pre- and post-vaccination, and determine the effective breadth of T-cell repertoire
      to an influenza vaccine within an individual as a function of age and to what degree this is
      genetically determined. This work may help in the improved design of new vaccines, both for
      influenza and for other respiratory pathogens as well.
