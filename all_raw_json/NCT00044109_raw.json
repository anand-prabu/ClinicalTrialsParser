In the first phase,\n      after one week baseline, subjects will be randomized to 4 different treatments in a\n      cross-over design. These 4 treatments which will last two weeks each are: 1 magnetic device\n      positioned in 2 different ways along the spinal axis (up-down along the lumbo-sacral spine\n      and left-right across the lumbo-sacral spine), a sham device of similar configuration and a\n      no treatment control. The length of phase I will be 8 weeks. At the end of this phase, codes\n      will be broken to select the magnetic device associated with the greatest amount of pain\n      score reduction. During the second phase which will also be double-blinded, subjects will be\n      randomized to wear the selected magnetic device and sham in a cross-over design. Each of the\n      2 periods will be 5 weeks in duration. The primary outcome measures will be the daily pain\n      score in the leg. Daily pain level in the low back and the back and leg combined in addition\n      to the patients' quality of life and activities of daily living will be secondary outcome\n      measures as assessed by the SF 36, Oswestry, and Beck depression inventory."
