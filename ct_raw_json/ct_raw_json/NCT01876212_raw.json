Correcting immune dysfunction in advanced-stage melanoma patients using\n      tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) such as dasatinib is proposed to relicense the patient's\n      immune system to respond optimally to specific immunization. The integration of antigens\n      expressed by tumor-associated blood vessel cells provides a means to selectively target the\n      genetically-/antigenically-heterogeneous population of tumor cells in the advanced-stage\n      melanoma patient.\n\n      This is a single-center, prospective randomized Phase 2 trial evaluating the activity,\n      safety and immune effects of dasatinib given in combination with an autologous type-1\n      polarized Dendritic Cell (\u03b1DC1) vaccine. The current trial represents a randomized Phase 2\n      study to determine the activity and safety of intradermal (id) administration of \u03b1DC1s\n      loaded with a mixture of six TBVA-derived peptides at the time of, or immediately after, an\n      initial therapy cycle with the TKI dasatinib.\n\n      Dasatinib will be administered at the standard dose and schedule recommended by the FDA (70\n      mg BID). The autologous type-I DC vaccine will be administered either prior to, or\n      concomitant with, the initiation of dasatinib administration.  All patients will receive\n      dasatinib at a starting dose of 70 mg twice daily by mouth in the outpatient setting\n      approximately every 12 hours, at the same time each day.\n\n      The DC vaccine will be administered by a single intradermal injection of approximately 10e7\n      cells, with all the DCs being administered on days 1 and 15 of every cycle on an outpatient\n      basis in the University of Pittsburgh Clinical and Translational Research Center\n      (UPCI-CTRC).\n\n      Patients on Arm A will start dasatinib administration on cycle 2, day 1 (week 5), while\n      those patients in Arm B will start dasatinib administration on cycle 1, day 1 (week 1).\n\n      Men and women at least 18 years of age must be HLA-A2+ and have histologically confirmed\n      melanoma that is metastatic (Stage IV) or unresectable Stage IIIB/C and for which standard\n      curative or palliative measures do not exist or are no longer effective."

We hypothesize that administration of dasatinib to melanoma patients will promote the loss of EphA2 protein within the tumor lesion, leading to an enhancement in the sensitivity of EphA2+ cells in the tumor microenvironment to EphA2-specific CD8+ T cells that have been activated as a consequence of DC1/peptide-based vaccination.",

Two recent clinical trials, including our DC1/glioma peptide vaccination trial in patients with brain tumors strongly support CXCL10 (aka IP-10) as a chemokine associated with superior clinical outcome to immune-based therapy. We hypothesize that this will also be the case in our DC1/TBVA peptide vaccinated patients with melanoma where Type-1 CXCR3+ responder T cells require a gradient of CXCL10/IP-10 (as detected in serum) in order to traffick to tumor sites in vivo.",
