Especially\n      patients with low CD4+ counts have a higher incidence of structural heart disease.\n      Myocardial T1 relaxation time, as well as T1-derived extracellular volume fraction are\n      relatively new methods for non-invasive myocardial tissue characterization, including\n      diffuse myocardial fibrosis.\n\n      In our study HIV-patients with high and low CD4+ counts are examined on a 3T MRI scanner\n      (Ingenia 3T, Philips Medical, Best, Netherlands). Scanning protocol includes common SSFP\n      sequences, STIR imaging and LGE [Late gadolinium enhancement]. All HIV patients are treated\n      in the HIV outpatient clinic of the hospital's Internal Medicine department and have an\n      unremarkable history of cardiac disease. Patients are recruited from all over Germany. In\n      order to obtain reference values, a subgroup of healthy, age-matched controls is included in\n      this study.\n\n      Aim of this study is to show differences in T1- and ECV-values in the investigated\n      subgroups. In addition, we also want to create cut-off values for healthy and affected\n      myocardium in asymptomatic HIV-infected patients. This study could show whether myocardial\n      T1 mapping is a potential screening parameter for beginning heart disease as part of an\n      HIV-infection, and whether an application in routine diagnostic is reasonable."
