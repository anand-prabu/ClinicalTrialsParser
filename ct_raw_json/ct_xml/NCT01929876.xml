    <textblock>
      This open-label, 2-period, fixed sequence, drug interaction study will investiga te the
      effect of co-administration of itraconazole on the pharmacokinetics of co bimetinib in
      healthy volunteers. Volunteers will receive multiple repeating dose s of cobimetinib and
      itraconazole. The anticipated time on study treatment is ap proximately one month.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult volunteers

          -  Within BMI range 18.5 to 32 kg/m2, inclusive

          -  Creatine phosphokinase levels must be below 2.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN)
             and if elevated, must not be clinically significant

          -  Liver function tests for aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and
             alkaline phosphatase must be below 2 times the ULN; bilirubin must be below 1.5 times
             the ULN; and all liver function test elevations must not be clinically significant

          -  In good health, determined by no clinically significant findings from medical
             history, 12-lead ECG, and vital signs

          -  Clinical laboratory evaluations within the reference range for the test laboratory,
             unless deemed not clinically significant by the Investigator

          -  Negative test for selected drugs of abuse at Screening and at each Check-in

          -  Negative hepatitis panel (including HBsAg and anti-HCV) and negative HIV antibody
             screens

          -  Females must not be pregnant or lactating

          -  Males and females (of child-bearing potential) must use two forms of adequate
             contraception

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant history or clinical manifestation of any metabolic, allergic,
             dermatological, hepatic, renal, hematological, pulmonary, cardiovascular, GI,
             neurological, or psychiatric disorder

          -  History of significant hypersensitivity, intolerance, or allergy to any drug
             compound, food, or other substance, unless approved by the Investigator

          -  History of stomach or intestinal surgery or resection that would potentially alter
             absorption and/or excretion of orally administered drugs; except that appendectomy,
             hernia repair, and/or cholecystectomy will be allowed

          -  History of diabetes mellitus and/or elevated fasting glucose at baseline

          -  History or presence of an abnormal ECG, which, in the Investigator's opinion, is
             clinically significant

          -  History of alcoholism or drug addiction within 1 year prior to study start

          -  Use of any tobacco- or nicotine-containing products (within 6 months prior to study
             start and during the entire study

          -  Participation in any other investigational study drug or biologic agent trial in
             which receipt of an investigational study drug occurred within 5 half-lives or 30
             days, whichever is longer, or exposure to any biological therapy or investigational
             biological agent within 90 days prior to study entry and during the entire study from
