  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the standard of care against EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome
      injectable suspension) to determine if total opioid consumption is reduced when using
      EXPAREL, thereby possibly reducing total hospitalization costs.

      This is a Phase 4 prospective, sequential, open-label study designed to evaluate the
      efficacy, safety, and health economic benefits of intraoperative local wound infiltration
      with EXPAREL (bupivacaine liposome injectable suspension) compared with postsurgical
      administration of standardized intravenous (IV) morphine sulfate for postsurgical analgesia
      in adult patients undergoing laparoscopic colectomy with general anesthesia.

    <description>Patients in this group will receive IV morphine sulfate via patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) pump, as needed.  The PCA pump will be set up postsurgically as soon as possible and prior to the patient leaving the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) or immediately upon transfer to the floor if the stay in the PACU is less than one hour.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will receive 266 mg EXPAREL diluted with preservative-free 0.9% normal saline to a total volume of 40 cc administered via wound infiltration prior to wound closure.  When not contraindicated, 30 mg IV ketorolac will be given at the end of surgery.  If not indicated, an IV non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may be substituted per the site's standard of care.
All patients will be offered rescue analgesia, as needed.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 years of age and older.

          -  Patients scheduled to undergo laparoscopic-assisted colectomy with planned primary
             anastamosis, as defined by cecectomy, right hemicolectomy, resection of transverse
             colon, left hemicolectomy, or sigmoidectomy. (Note: patients who convert from a
             planned laparoscopic colectomy to an open colectomy are not eligible)

          -  Ability to provide informed consent, adhere to study visit schedule, and complete all
             assessments.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reactions or intolerance
             to any local anesthetic, opioid, or propofol.

          -  Patients who abuse alcohol or other drug substance.

          -  Patients with severe hepatic impairment.

          -  Patients currently pregnant or who may become pregnant during the course of the
             study.

          -  Patients with any psychiatric, psychological, or other condition that the
             Investigator feels may make the patient an inappropriate candidate for this clinical
             study.

          -  Patients who have participated in an EXPAREL study within the last 30 days.

          -  Patients who have received an investigational drug within 30 days prior to study drug
             administration, or planned administration of another investigational product or
             procedure during the patient's participation in this study.

        In addition, the patient will be ineligible if he/she meets the following criteria during
        surgery:

          -  Patients who have any concurrent surgical procedure.

          -  Patients with unplanned multiple segmental resections or large intestine.

          -  Patients who convert from laparoscopic-assisted colectomy to traditional open
             colectomy.

          -  Patients who have unplanned, temporary, or permanent colostomies placed.

          -  Patients who receive intraoperative administration of opioids (other than fentanyl or
             analogs) or any other analgesic, local anesthetics, or anti-inflammatory agents.

          -  Patients who receive Entereg(R).
