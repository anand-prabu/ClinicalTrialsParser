    <textblock>
      A multicenter prospective single arm interventional trial in hospitals where therapeutic
      hypothermia is standard practice.  This trial will enroll 50 subjects to evaluate the
      ability of the ZOLL Intravascular Temperature Management (IVTM) System to induce, maintain,
      and reverse mild therapeutic hypothermia and maintain normothermia post cardiac arrest.
