They are retrospective and report on\n      lobectomies and segmentectomies, excluding the live-saving pneumonectomies. They are\n      potentially ignoring the intention-to-treat principle, excluding conversions.\n\n      Based on scarce existing literature and conference worst-case presentations a pattern of the\n      most common intraoperative major complications can be drawn In Europe, a large percentage of\n      high-volume-centres have now successfully implemented a vats lobectomy program. In this era\n      with low-volume-centres switching into vats anatomical resections, it is important to focus\n      on potentially life-threatening complications. To be aware of potential hazards is the best\n      way to avoid them."
