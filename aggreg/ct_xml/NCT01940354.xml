  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will test a hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will have a higher rate of
      successful first attempt peripheral IV placement and higher clinician and patient
      satisfaction compared to Conventional IV Catheters.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate user/physician preference as it relates to use of a
      510(k) cleared vascular access peripheral IV catheter device compared with peripheral IV
      conventional needle/catheter devices, in terms of first stick success rates, adverse events
      and overall user and patient satisfaction.  As noted above, the study is designed to
      formally test the hypothesis that the AccuCath™ System will exhibit superiority in terms of
      the rate of successful first attempt peripheral IV placement and higher user and patient
      satisfaction compared to Conventional IV Catheters.
