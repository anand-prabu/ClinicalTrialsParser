Establish a registry for Alzheimer's disease (AD) and  subcortical ischemic vascular\n           dementia (SIVD)\n\n             -  Collect longitudinal clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical biomarker data\n                for clinical and neuroscience studies on 500 subjects in five diagnostic\n                categories: cognitively normal control (NC), mild cognitive impairment (MCI), mild\n                AD, vascular MCI (vMCI), and SIVD.\n\n             -  The following measurements known as representative parameters of dementia progress\n                will be included. 1) clinical characteristics, 2) neuropsychological test, 3)\n                structural and functional magnetic resonance image (MRI), 4) Fludeoxyglucose\n                (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET), 5) amyloid PET (18F-flutemetamol), 6)\n                cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and blood sample, 7) genetic analysis.\n\n        2. Determination of factors that are crucial in the aggravation or deterrence of progress\n           of dementia syndrome, so that these factors can be used as predictors and outcome\n           measures of AD and SIVD\n\n             -  Determine the relationships among clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical\n                biomarker characteristics of the entire spectrum of AD, as the pathology evolves\n                from normal aging through very mild symptoms, to MCI, and finally to dementia.\n\n             -  Also, determine the relationship among clinical, imaging, genetic, and biochemical\n                biomarker characteristics of the vascular MCI (vMCI) and SIVD, which is an\n                important sub-population of dementia syndrome especially in Asian population.\n\n        3. Identification of surrogate markers for new drug development in patients with AD and\n           SIVD\n\n           - Identify prognostic markers of AD and SIVD, identify outcome measures that can be\n           used in clinical trials, and help develop the most effective clinical trial scenarios\n           for new drugs.\n\n        4. Development of the standard model for acquiring multi-site neuroimaging study data -\n           Develop improved methods which will lead to uniform standards for acquiring\n           longitudinal multi-site clinical, MRI, PET, and other biological markers (blood, CSF,\n           gene) data on patients with AD, MCI, vMCI, SIVD, and elderly controls."
