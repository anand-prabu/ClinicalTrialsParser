            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the toxicity of intralesional immunotherapy with a recombinant\n      vaccinia virus encoding the gene for sargramostim (GM-CSF) in patients with metastatic\n      melanoma. II. Determine the efficiency of viral infection and GM-CSF gene insertion and\n      function in these patients. III. Determine the capacity of this regimen to generate\n      antiviral and antitumor immunity in these patients. IV. Determine the frequency of\n      regression of injected and uninjected lesions in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of intralesional recombinant vaccinia virus\n      encoding the gene for sargramostim (GM-CSF) (rV-GM-CSF). Patients are stratified by center.\n      Patients receive small pox (vaccinia) vaccine via multipuncture technique on day 0. On day\n      4, patients with a progressive major reaction to the initial vaccination receive rV-GM-CSF\n      intralesionally twice weekly for 5 weeks. Only 1 lesion is treated and at least 1 measurable\n      lesion is left untreated in each patient. Patients with responding disease after week 5 are\n      retreated at a clinically appropriate dose and schedule. Cohorts of 5 patients receive\n      escalating doses of intralesional rV-GM-CSF until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. Additional patients receive rV-GM-CSF at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients (15 for each phase) will be accrued for this\n      study."
