Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then after completion of the second course.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-18\n      months."
