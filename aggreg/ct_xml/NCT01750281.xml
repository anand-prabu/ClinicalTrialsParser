  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to treat patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC
      with a combination therapy of selumetinib and two different doses of docetaxel 75mg/m2 or 60
      mg/m2 vs placebo and compare how well each dose affects how their cancer responds. It will
      also help us to understand the tolerability profile of the different dosing regimens in
      these patients.
