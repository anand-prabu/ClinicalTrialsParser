Treatment repeats every 2 weeks\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve normal beta-human chorionic\n      gonadotropin (HCG) receive 2 additional courses after attaining normal beta-HCG.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 weeks for 2 months and then monthly for 10 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-42\n      months."
