The\n      investigators introduced Atricure cryoprobe (Nitreos Oxide based) in hope of overcoming\n      these shortcomings of ATS probes last year.\n\n      Up to date, the investigators have been satisfactory in terms of the surgical convenience.\n      On the other hand, we have the questionability of transmural lesion of Atricure probe\n      because of the higher temperature of Atricure probe compared with ATS probe.\n\n      The aim of this study is compare the surgical convenience and early and long-term outcomes\n      of cryomaze procedure using nitrous oxide with using Argon gas.\n\n      The investigators will analyze the pathologic findings of atrial tissue after cryoablation\n      using two probes and early and long-term outcomes with Holter monitoring. Atrial\n      fibrillation burden 3 months and 1 year postoperatively and atrial activity will be checked."
