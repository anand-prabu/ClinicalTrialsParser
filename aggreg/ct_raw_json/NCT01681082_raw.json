The investigators will test subjects enrolled in a semester-long\n      tai chi course along with control subjects. The specific aims are to measure duration of\n      practice, cognitive function, physical balance, and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder\n      (ADHD) indicators. The investigators primary hypotheses are that, compared to controls,\n      subjects in the tai chi course will show improvements in (1a) spatial working memory and\n      (1b) response inhibition. The investigators secondary hypotheses are that, among the\n      subjects participating in the tai chi course, these cognitive improvements will correlate\n      with (2a) improvements in balance and (2b) duration of tai chi practice, and that, among all\n      participants, (2c) ADHD indications will correlate with cognitive measures."
