Standard post-operative topical antibiotic and steroid will be also given\n      concurrently, dosed QID for the first week and BID for the second week (dexamethasone 0.1%\n      and tobramycin 0.3% eye drops association).\n\n      Measurements will be carried out at baseline and after one day, 3 days, 1 week and 4 weeks\n      from cataract extraction."
