Preliminary work\n      suggests that FM patients do benefit from MCMB therapy (Singh et al 1998; Creamer et al\n      1998).  This two-arm clinical trial will randomize 110 patients to either a 12 week MCMB\n      intervention or a 12 week education/attention intervention.  The primary aims of this study\n      are 1) to determine if a 12 week MCMB intervention improves short term (i.e. at 12 weeks)\n      outcomes in FM patients compared to an education/attention control group; and 2) to\n      determine if a 12 week MCMB intervention improves long term (i.e. at 24 weeks) outcomes in\n      FM patients compared to an education/attention control group.\n\n      A secondary aim of this project involves determining if there are patient characteristics\n      (i.e. disease severity and duration, demographics, psychological factors) associated with\n      improvements in short or long term outcomes as well as responses to the MCMB intervention.\n\n      The primary outcome measure will include physical functioning and pain as measured by the\n      Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire."

            "textblock": "Fibromyalgia (FM) is a common, complex and chronic  condition of unknown etiology (Carette\n      1994).  It is characterized by widespread musculoskeletal pain, multiple tender points,\n      fatigue and a range of other symptoms (Wolfe 1990).  FM accounts for 15% of rheumatology\n      consultations, with a prevalence of 2% in the general population (3.4% in females and 0.5%\n      in males), rising to 7% in the elderly females (Wolfe 1995).  Disability levels in social\n      and work roles, as well as use of medical care, is high.  Current treatment options often\n      meet with limited success.\n\n      The goal of this proposal is to evaluate the efficacy of a multiple component mind-body\n      (MCMB)therapy for fibromyalgia, both in short and long term outcomes.  Preliminary work\n      suggests that FM patients do benefit from MCMB therapy (Singh et al 1998; Creamer et al\n      1998).  This two-arm clinical trial will randomize 110 patients to either a 12 week MCMB\n      intervention or a 12 week education/attention intervention.
