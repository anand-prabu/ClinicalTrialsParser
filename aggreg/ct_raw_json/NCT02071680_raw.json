            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia.  Symptomatic patients are\n      generally treated with antiarrhythmic agents or undergo catheter ablation. Patients undergo\n      catheter ablation to control or eliminate their arrhythmia.  Catheter ablation consists of\n      inserting catheters from the groin into the inside of the heart to deliver pulses of energy\n      (radiofrequency current) to areas of heart tissue. Certain nerve endings, ganglionated\n      plexuses (GP), release neurotransmitters, both parasympathetic and sympathetic, thought to\n      be related to the initiation or continuation of atrial fibrillation (AF).  The signal\n      pathways are interrupted with the ablation procedure, with the goal of eliminating the\n      arrhythmia. Localizing the GPs is done with a special catheter which isolates the\n      electrogram signals using High Frequency Stimulation (HFS). Recently, non-invasive nuclear\n      imaging using D-SPECT technology and 123I-mIBG has shown that localized positive images of\n      123I-mIBG coincide well with expected anatomical regions of GPs in the atrium. 123I-mIBG is\n      an iodine based radioisotope that is chemically similar to norepinephrine (NE) which\n      regulates the sympathetic nervous system. The mapping of the areas to be treated can\n      potentially be enhanced using the visual 123I-mIBG scan in conjunction with the catheter\n      that measures electrical signals. This 123I-mIBG scan can also potentially be used following\n      the ablation procedure to assess the effectiveness of the procedure to see if any areas are\n      still seen as positive.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that there will be concordance between the Carto\u00ae mapping\n      system with HFS and the 123I-mIBG visual imaging in the identification of GP's in\n      participants with atrial fibrillation."

Furthermore, using a clinically approved\n      catheter that provides the ability to measure contact force, we will be able to correlate\n      the (endocardial) contact force required or associated with thresholds required to identify\n      (epicardial) ganglionated plexuses. This will be followed by the clinical ablation\n      procedure, as discussed by the cardiac electrophysiologist, consisting of pulmonary vein\n      (PV) isolation, with additional ablation of regions of autonomic innervation, and sites\n      showing complex fractionated atrial electrograms (CFAE) when clinically indicated."
