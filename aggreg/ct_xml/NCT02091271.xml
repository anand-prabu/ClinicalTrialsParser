  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Institute on Aging (NIA) Intramural Research Program (IRP) has a number ofiRB
      approved research studies involving human subjects, both normal volunteers and patients. As
      a means of identifying interested volunteers and other participants in the research process,
      this screening mechanism is established to identif'y potential eligible participants for NlA
      protocols.

      To participate, volunteers/patients must meet the specific requirements of at least one of
      the available NlA research studies; this protocol serves as a first step for admitting
      volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved protocol and creating a contact database for
      approved NlA studies.

      This protocol will facilitate their recruitment into NIA approved studies and provide NlA
      staff the opportunity to examine subjects where diagnostic observations can be documented
      and evaluated for research potential.

    <textblock>
      The screening protocol is designed to evaluate volunteers/patients for participation in IRB
      approved clinical studies of the National Institute on Aging (NIA). An additional purpose of
      this protocol is to develop a registry of individuals who have been evaluated through the
      NIA Clinical Research Unit screening clinic. To participate, volunteers/patients must meet
      the specific requirements of at least one of the available NIA research studies. This
      protocol serves as a first step for admitting volunteers/patients to an appropriate approved
      protocol, and it is used to develop a registry of individuals who meet eligibility criteria
      for existing research projects.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               1. All volunteers/patients who meet the criteria of an approved NIA protocol.

               2. People with diagnosed or undiagnosed conditions

               3. Patients may be eligible if they have rare, unusual, interesting or unknown
                  conditions that require diagnosis

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          1. Subjects unable to provide informed consent, or the absence of a guardian who is
             authorized to provide informed consent in the case of minor subjects.

          2. The volunteer/patient does not meet the criteria of any approved NIA protocol and
             does not wish to remain in the contact database for future studies.

          3. Volunteer/patient has contacted the NIA Clinical Research Protocol Office and
             notified them that they would like to be removed and no longer contacted for NIA
             approved studies. They will be removed.
