For COPD patients, implementation of telehealth reduced readmissions,\n      emergency room visits, and exacerbations and was cost-effective. Telehealth as a method of\n      delivering healthcare to remote, resource-deprived areas is not lacking in evidence of\n      benefit; however, the situation about its more widespread use for monitoring purposes is\n      much less clear. To date, most of the studies dealing with telehealth in COPD were conducted\n      in countries covering vast territories. Therefore, it needs to be investigated whether\n      telehealth conveys similar advantages for COPD patients in a small island country."
