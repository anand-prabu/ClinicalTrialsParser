  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate that patients treated with cangrelor can be directly switched to oral
      prasugrel and that patients treated with prasugrel can be switched to cangrelor without a
      significant decrease in the extent of  inhibition of platelet aggregation.
