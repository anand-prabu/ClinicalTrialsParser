  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence and consequences of musculoskeletal pain is considerable among healthcare
      workers, allegedly due to high physical work demands of healthcare work. Previous studies
      have shown promising results of physical exercise for relieving pain among different
      occupational groups, but the question remains whether such physical exercise should be
      performed at the workplace or in the private sphere at home. Performing physical exercise at
      the workplace together with colleagues may be more motivating for some employees and thus
      increase compliance. On the other hand, physical exercise at the workplace may be costly for
      the employers in terms of time spend. Thus, relevant ground exists to compare the efficacy
      of workplace- versus home-based training on musculoskeletal pain. This study investigates
      the effect of workplace-based versus home-based physical exercise on musculoskeletal pain
      among healthcare workers.

      The main hypothesis is that physical exercise at the workplace for 10 weeks compared with
      physical exercise at home results in reduced musculoskeletal pain among healthcare workers.

    <description>The change in &quot;pain intensity during the last week&quot; from baseline to 10 week follow-up between the workplace- and home-training group. The home-training group will be considered the reference group. 2-way analysis of variance (Proc Mixed of SAS) with repeated measures will be used, with time and group as fixed factors and subject as random factor. Department will be added as a cluster effect.</description>
