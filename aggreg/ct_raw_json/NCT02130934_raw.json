The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a safe and effective method for\n      early diagnosis of heart problems in children who are receiving chemotherapy treatments that\n      may be toxic to the heart."

All\n      tests and procedures noted below are being done for the sole purpose of the study:\n\n      Visit 1.   Subjects will be asked to complete some questionnaires and answer questions\n      regarding smoking status and use of alcohol or smokeless tobacco.   We will also gather\n      basic information such as age, height, weight, gender, ethnicity, race, pertinent medical\n      history as well as collect vital sign information  (height, weight, blood pressure, heart\n      and respiratory rate.)  Next, subjects will undergo a routine transthoracic echocardiogram.\n\n      Visit 2.   Following the completion of the echocardiogram, and if selected to take part in\n      the study, subjects will  be schedule for a cardiac MRI test within a 3 months period.\n\n      When subjects come in for Visit 2, they will receive a 12 lead electrocardiograph (ECG)\n      before the cardiac 3D MRI.\n\n      All females who are capable of becoming pregnant, except those who are age 11 and under,\n      will then undergo urine pregnancy testing.  If it is found that you are pregnant you will\n      not be allowed to be in the study.  If the female is under 18 and a positive pregnancy test\n      result is obtained, we will inform both the participant and her parent/guardian.\n\n      Subjects may then be placed in a \"simulated\" MRI to teach them what it will be like to enter\n      the scanner and also train them on how to breathe calmly and regularly during the scan.\n\n      Training will involve the use of a PrimeSense 3D sensor, similar to the cameras used in\n      active videogame systems such as the Xbox Kinect, which will generate a 3D picture of their\n      chest as they breathe.   Following this training session, subjects will then undergo cardiac\n      3D MRI.   Study participations will end after this visit."
