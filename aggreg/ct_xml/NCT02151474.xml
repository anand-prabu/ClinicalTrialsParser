  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 4 parallel treatment groups.
      Subjects will be screened for up to 28 days before study drug administration to ensure that
      all eligibility criteria are met.  On Day 1, subjects will be randomized to 1 of 4 dose
      groups of 15 subjects each (INCB047986 4 mg, 8 mg, 12 mg, or placebo QD).  Study drug will
      be self administered on Days 1 through 28.  A follow-up telephone call to the subject to
      assess safety will occur at Day 42.  A final safety and efficacy evaluation will be
      performed at the Day 58 visit.
