  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Beachchair position is used by many orthopaedic surgeons for shoulder surgery. Most patients
      undergoing surgery in this position have no complications.  However, reported  cases of
      postoperative neurological deficits have highlighted the risk of cerebral and spinal cord
      ischemia. The etiology of such complications remains unclear.  The most plausible
      explanation for these events would be intraoperative hypotension followed by cerebral
      hypoperfusion.

      General anesthesia is commonly used for shoulder surgery in conjunction with interscalene
      brachial plexus blockade. During the block, local anesthetic's spread is frequently observed
      leading to a block of sympathetic fibres. Since all nerves located in the head and neck area
      go through the stellate ganglion, its block will cause a sympathetic denervation and a
      decrease of the peripheral vascular resistance, thus increasing the circulation in cerebral
      blood vessels. In normal situations, there is a vasoconstriction of the cerebral blood
      vessels in response to a sympathetic stimulation and a vasodilation if sympathetic fibres
      are blocked.

      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) is a non-invasive examination that provides a reliable evaluation
      of intracranial blood flow in real-time. It can help to detect sudden changes in perfusion
      and identify potential embolic events. Some studies using TCD have shown an increased
      ipsilateral cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to a reduced vascular tone associated with a
      stellate ganglion block. Others have shown a reduction of contralateral CBF that could
      theoretically increase the risk of ischemia in the affected area.

      This study will assess the role of interscalene nerve blockade in the protection of cerebral
      ischemia and preservation of cerebral autoregulation. This study will also aim to identify
      changes in contralateral CBF.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        1. Interscalene nerve block will increase CBF

        2. Interscalene nerve block will not decrease contralateral CBF

        3. Cerebral autoregulation will be preserved under general anesthesia in conjunction with
           an interscalene nerve block in this setting.

      Prior to surgery, each patient will undergo a baseline bilateral TCD examination in supine
      position. If the Doppler's results are satisfactory, the patient will then be randomized and
      proceed to the next step.  In case of inadequate results, the patient's participation to the
      study will be terminated.

      The interscalene nerve block will be performed or simulated according to randomization. In
      the interscalene nerve block group, the attending anaesthesiologist will assess the success
      of the block and record the presence or absence of Horner's syndrome. The transcranial
      Doppler operator will be blinded to these observations.  Following a real or simulated
      interscalene block, the patient will undergo a second bilateral TCD in supine position
      before induction of anesthesia.

      The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized.  After the induction of
      anesthesia, a bilateral TCD will be performed with the patient in supine position.  Another
      examination will be performed under general anesthesia immediately after and 30 minutes
      following the installation of the patient in the beachchair position.  A last TCD will be
      performed after a reduction of end-tidal carbon dioxide at 30 mm Hg.

      For each examination, the arterial blood pressure must be stabilized for at least 5 minutes
      before the Doppler can be initiated. Arterial blood pressure will be measured during each
      examination. Type, duration of surgery and beachchair position will be recorded.
      Vasopressor therapy will be noted.  Body temperature, end-tidal carbon dioxide and minimum
      alveolar concentration of desflurane will be collected during each examination performed
      under general anesthesia.

    <description>Cerebral blood flow will be assessed using the transcranial Doppler. Because the bones of the skull block the transmission of ultrasound, region with thinner walls must be used for analyzing.
