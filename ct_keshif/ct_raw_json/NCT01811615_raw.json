At baseline, Quigley-Hein plaque index\n      (QHI), the modified proximal plaque index (MPPI), and PBI were recorded. All subjects were\n      advised to brush their teeth as usual during the eight weeks study period. Additionally,\n      groups 1-3 were instructed to rinse twice daily (30 sec. each). All participants used Dr.\n      Best multi aktiv toothpaste and Dr. Best plus toothbrush (medium stiffness). Eight weeks\n      after baseline, indices were recorded again. Anova with Bonferroni adjustment was used for\n      statistical analysis."
