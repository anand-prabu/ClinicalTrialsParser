      This clinical trial studies fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)
      and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE)-magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in predicting response
      to treatment in patients with breast cancer. Comparing results of diagnostic procedures done
      before, during, and after chemotherapy may help doctors predict a patient's response to
      treatment and help plan the best treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether detailed kinetic analysis of FDG PET and magnetic resonance (MR)
      imaging studies for measures of tumor metabolism and blood perfusion can predict response
      and outcome for breast cancer patients undergoing neo-adjuvant therapy.

      II. To compare the in vivo tumor biology associated with responsive and resistant tumors as
      measured by kinetic changes in FDG PET and MR imaging parameters to tumor subtypes analyzed
      from assay of pre-therapy biopsy and post-therapy surgical tissue.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo FDG PET and DCE-MRI 1-2 weeks before prior to chemotherapy initiation,
      between 1-12 weeks after initiation of the first course of chemotherapy, and after the
      completion of chemotherapy (within 4 weeks prior to surgery).
