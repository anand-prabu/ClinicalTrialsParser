        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with Medtronic Deep Brain Stimulation therapy for idiopathic levodopa
             responsive Parkinson's Disease

          -  Patient who has had lead placement in the Subthalamic nucleus

          -  Patient with pre-op MRI available

          -  Patient with post-op CT scan available showing placement of the lead

          -  Patient who has documented improvement of at least 35% on UPDRS III scores from
             baseline preoperative off medication state compared to post DBS implant stimulation
             on/medications off

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who has had clinically significant persistent stimulation related adverse
             effects

          -  Patient who has evidence of lead migration without lead revision

          -  Patient with other brain malformations that would make it difficult to process images
             (ablative surgery in the basal ganglia, resective surgery, brain tumor)
