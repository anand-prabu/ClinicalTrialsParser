Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered on days 6-14. Treatment repeats\n      every 21 days for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
