Although various trials using IFN-alpha in combination\n      with the nucleoside analogue zidovudine have demonstrated a high degree of antitumor\n      activity and evidence of HIV suppression, the overlapping toxicity (primarily neutropenia)\n      of these two agents has proven dose-limiting. The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this\n      drug may be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha."

The toxicity profile of ddI suggests that this\n      drug may be better tolerated than zidovudine when combined with IFN-alpha.\n\n      Up to 90 patients are randomized to receive either low or high doses of IFN-alpha (1 or 10\n      million Units/day) in combination with a fixed dose of ddI. Fourteen patients are initially\n      entered at each dose level. If no objective antitumor responses are observed among the first\n      14 patients at a given dose, no further patients are entered on that treatment arm. If one\n      or more antitumor responses are seen at a given dose, up to 45 patients may be entered on\n      that treatment arm.  Patients must complete at least 4 weeks of study therapy to be\n      considered evaluable for tumor response. Treatment is continued until tumor progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity occurs. PER AMENDMENT 9/19/96: NOTE - After 16 weeks of treatment\n      subjects may receive any FDA  approved antiretroviral drug regimen in addition to or in\n      place of ddI."
