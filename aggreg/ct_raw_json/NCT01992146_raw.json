This suggests latent sensitization.\n\n      In the present study, investigators hypothesize that naloxone (2 mg/kg) can reinstate pain\n      and hyperalgesia following 6-8 weeks after a unilateral herniotomy procedure. Investigators\n      aim to show that latent sensitization is present in humans and is modulated by endogenous\n      opioids."
