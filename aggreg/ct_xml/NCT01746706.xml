  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Reliable diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) at the predementia stage is currently
      considered to be a priority for research, as disease modifying therapies are being
      evaluated. Many studies focus on the functional and morphological assessment of the
      hippocampal formation. However, neurofibrillary tangles, associated with cognitive deficits,
      initially affect the anterior subhippocampal cortex (transentorhinal, entorhinal and
      perirhinal cortex) before reaching the hippocampus.  Studies from our group have tried to
      investigate if the assessment of subhippocampal regions using cognitive tools and
      neuroimaging techniques could contribute to the diagnosis of AD at a very early stage.

      In a previous project, the investigators included 40 patients with single domain amnestic
      MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment), known to be at high risk for AD and demonstrated that aMCI
      patients with a profile of subhippocampal dysfunction (impaired performance on a visual
      recognition memory task) display other clinical as well as imaging profiles of patients with
      early AD using MRI and SPECT. Longitudinal follow-up data in these patients is currently
      under way. Preliminary data indicates that evaluating the subhippocampal region using visual
      recognition tasks is highly predictive of AD over 6 years.

      The aim of this project is to obtain additional diagnostic data using a PET amyloid tracer
      (Florbetapir F18 AV45 F18), an in-vivo marker of one of the neuropathological lesions that
      define AD, of in order to enhance diagnostic accuracy AD in these patients. This approach
      will validate the hypothesis as to whether the assessment of subhippocampal dysfunction can
      contribute to the early diagnosis of AD.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        patients:

          -  - A score in the MMS (Folstein and al ., on 1975, French version subjected to
             consensus of Greco). 24 for the level subjects I (less than 5 years of study), 26 and
             more for the others, the autonomy in the everyday life,

          -  A lower normal IADL &lt; = 1/4 (Lawton and Brody, on 1969, version 4 items),

          -  A complaint mnemonic of the patient

          -  A lower performance of 1,5 standard deviation in the standard in the
             reminder(abseiling) postponed from the sub-test of logical memory(report) of the
             WMS-III and/or in the free reminder(abseiling) postponed from the test(event) of the
             California Verbal Learning Test.

        volunteers:

          -  50-80-year-old and presented an educational level sailed in that of the patients,

          -  a MMS upper to 24 for the level subjects I (5 years of study), 26 and more for the
             levels 2 and 3,

          -  an Autonomy of the everyday life,

          -  normal IADL = 0/4

          -  did not present mnemonic complaint,

          -  a performance normal for the reminder postponed from the subtest of logical memory of
             the WMS-III and for the free reminder(abseiling) postponed from the test(event) of
             the California Verbal Learning Test.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Incapacitated to realize the examination by FART because of medical intercurrent
             affections. There are this day no contraindications in the product Florbetapir used
             for the TEPscan.

          -  The persons under protection of justice cannot be included, because the law forbids
             their participation biomedical researches.
