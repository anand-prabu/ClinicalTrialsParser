To define whether stimulation of ATGL and suppression of G0/G1 switch gene occur in the\n           initial phases of diabetic ketoacidosis and thus can be identified as the primary\n           mechanisms behind this life threatening condition.\n\n        2. Make a human model for studying ketoacidosis.\n\n      The investigators plan to reduce in their regular insulin over night. In the morning we\n      administer endotoxin, which together with a relative lack of insulin will initiate\n      ketogenesis - a state of ketoacidosis. On another occasion strict glycemic control is\n      imposed by means of intravenous insulin. The testing is done two separate days with at least\n      3 weeks in between and patients are admitted to hospital the evening before the day of\n      testing. The investigators use isotopic tracers to determine metabolic fluxes and analyse\n      fat (ATGL, G0/G1 switch gene) and muscle biopsies."
