  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of conducting a medical
      intervention trial in childhood cancer survivors with early echocardiographic evidence of
      cardiac remodeling.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline cardiotoxicity is characterized by ventricular remodeling and progressive
      cardiac dysfunction.  Since ventricular remodeling in other types of heart failure can be
      treated effectively with an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi), these agents
      would appear a logical therapy in children with anthracycline-induced heart failure.
      Previous experience with ACEi in childhood cancer survivors has shown mixed results,
      possibly due to the fact that treatment is initiated too late in the natural history of the
      disease.  Providing treatment in childhood cancer survivors with early signs of cardiac
      remodeling may be more effective than treating children who have global dysfunction.  The
      benefits of early intervention are unclear, so it is unclear whether CCS and their parents
      will be willing to receive treatment where the target outcome (prevention of decreased
      global function or congestive heart failure) may not occur for years after the intervention.
       Assessing the feasibility of this pre-emptive approach is the primary aim of the study.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Enrolled in the Survivor Cohort of the PCS2 study at The Hospital for Sick Children
             at the time of enrolment..

          2. Aged &lt; 20 years at enrolment.

          3. Weight â‰¥ 25kg at enrolment

          4. LVPW Z-score &lt; -2.0 at any of the 0, 12 or 24 month PCS2 echocardiography
             assessments, or Z-score &lt;-1.0 and decreased from previous study (previous study
             echocardiogram as per the PCS2 study or previous clinical echocardiogram in the 12
             months prior to enrolment)

          5. EF greater than 50% at enrolment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Active malignancy detected within last 2 years (i.e. must be at least 2 years in
             remission)

          2. Prior radiation therapy to a field that involved the heart

          3. Prior symptomatic heart failure, or prior reduction in EF below 50% detected on
             surveillance echocardiography.

          4. Use of any cardioactive medications including diuretics within the last 6 months

          5. Concurrent serious or life threatening disease or extracardiac organ compromise which
             would limit participation in the trial or potentially have secondary effects on
             cardiac function, as determined by the treating physician.

          6. Renal dysfunction precluding ACEi therapy, defined serum creatinine greater than the
             95th percentile for age prior to recruitment to the interventional trial (within 30
             days of recruitment date)

          7. Hypertension requiring treatment.

          8. History of angioedema or ACEi hypersensitivity

          9. Patients with hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, glucose-galactose
             malabsorption, or the Lapp lactase deficiency.

         10. Upper airway obstructive lesions

         11. Pregnancy.

         12. Breast-feeding.
