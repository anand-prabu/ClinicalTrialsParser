These effects, as well as neuroprotective properties in\n      experimental studies would be ideal in neuroanaesthesia and in neurocritical care. Poor\n      grade SAH patients are treated in intensive care units (ICU).  These patients are sedated\n      often with propofol. However, to assess the patient's neurology, the propofol sedation must\n      be stopped and the wakening of the patient may take time. Dexmedetomidine would be more\n      advantageous, allowing wakening during the infusion. However, the effects of dexmedetomidine\n      on cerebral autoregulation are unknown in SAH patients.\n\n      15 SAH patients requiring sedation, mechanical ventilation and ICP monitoring will be rolled\n      in to the study."

Dexmedetomidine infusion is commenced with a dose of 0.7 \u03bcg/kg/h and propofol infusion is stopped concomitantly.  After 2 hours dexmedetomidine infusion, the static and dynamic autoregulation are assessed. If there are no signs of worsening of autoregulation, then the dexmedetomidine infusion is increased to 1 \u03bcg/kg/h and after 2 hours the static and dynamic autoregulation are assessed again. However, if autoregulation worsens during dexmedetomidine infusion, it will be stopped and further testing with dexmedetomidine will not be carried out. If autoregulation does not worsen with the 1 \u03bcg/kg/h dose then the dose will be increased to 1.4 \u03bcg/kg/h. After 2 hours infusion the dynamic and static autoregulation are assessed again.\nBlood samples for determining dexmedetomidine plasma concentration are collected alongside with the autoregulation assessments",
