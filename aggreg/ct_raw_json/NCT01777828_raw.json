Aortic valve replacement surgery is currently the\n      treatment of choice. It is done by surgery with sternotomy and extracorporeal circulation.\n      However, despite the considerable improvement of the conditions of care per and post\n      operative, this procedure is sometimes burdened with high mortality, especially in the\n      population with severe co-morbidities and / or many. For this reason, some patients are\n      considered against the indicated surgery or high surgical risk.\n\n      The recent development of aortic valve bioprostheses implanted with new approaches (pressure\n      or transapical) can be considered for aortic valve replacement in a population that was\n      previously excluded.\n\n      Based on very thorough evaluation of these valves test benches and animal as well as human\n      settlements achieved through multiple studies and registries mono or multi patients\n      challenged by cardiac surgeons or considered at high surgical risk, it is clear that the\n      implementation of these valves could allow, under conditions of optimal implementation and\n      monitoring, improve short-and long-term clinical status, quality of life and prognosis of\n      patients.\n\n      FRANCE 2 registry, established in 2010, and whose inclusions ended 30 June 2012 has allowed\n      an initial assessment of aortic valve bioprostheses implanted catheter The following\n      registry France 2 has been requested by the highest authorities of health, FRANCE register\n      TAVI is performed in continuity FRANCE 2.
