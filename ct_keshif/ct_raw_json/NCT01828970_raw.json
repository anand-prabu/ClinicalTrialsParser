CGM was used to analyze blood glucose excursions at baseline and 1 and 3 months of\n      treatment. It was started during the first dialysis session and then continued for the next\n      two days at home under ambulatory conditions. The CGM was continued during the next dialysis\n      session. Therefore, in total, CGM (Navigator\u00ae; Abbott, Rungis, France) was performed for 54\n      hours, including two consecutive hemodialysis sessions and at 0, 1, and 3 months of\n      treatment. The probe for the system was subcutaneously inserted at the beginning of the\n      first dialysis session to analyze interstitial glucose, and it was removed at the end of the\n      second dialysis session. Due to the time required for CGM calibration, plasma glucose levels\n      were only partially recorded during the first dialysis session."
