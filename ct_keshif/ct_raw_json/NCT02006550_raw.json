            "textblock": "Cancer results when undifferentiated cells grow in an uncontrolled manner, crowding out\n      normal cells, causing morbidity and ultimately mortality. The cancer stem cell theory\n      suggests that most tumors undergo a process of differentiation through which a relatively\n      rare cancer stem or progenitor cell (CSC) gives rise to more differentiated populations of\n      cells (including transiently amplifying cells) comprising the bulk of the tumor. As a result\n      of this cellular diversity, one or more cells within the tumor are likely to be resistant to\n      therapy. Among cells resistant to a given therapy, only CSCs can repopulate the tumor. A key\n      feature of this resistant subset of CSCs is that they repopulate a tumor resistant to the\n      original intervention. The cellular programs driving the uncontrolled proliferation of many\n      solid tumors result from aberrant activity of Wnt, Shh, and/or Notch signaling pathways in\n      CSC. Thus, therapies that down-regulate the activity of these fundamental pathways in CSCs\n      will be effective in the treatment of cancer. The investigators' research program focuses on\n      the elucidation of signaling mechanisms, control of cellular processes and discovery of\n      small molecules that selectively target Wnt, Shh, and Notch signaling pathways that are\n      fundamental to CSCs. Our preliminary results identified a novel Notch associated protein\n      NACK that functions as a transcriptional co-activator of Notch. Moreover, Nack is expressed\n      in human solid tumors and is required for cell survival and tumor growth in notch -dependent\n      tumor cells. The investigators' aim is to further interrogate the link between Notch and\n      Nack."
