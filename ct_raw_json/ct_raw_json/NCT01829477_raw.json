This multi-center trial will be conducted in North America and Europe. The overall\n      time to participate in this study is up to 44 weeks and participants will make up to 17\n      visits to the clinic.\n\n      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients\n      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.\n\n      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for\n      fasiglifam."
