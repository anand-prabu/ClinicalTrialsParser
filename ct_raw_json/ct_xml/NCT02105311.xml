  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conduct this study to access the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty
      on 24-hour circadian tension curves of patients with open-angle glaucoma, normal tension
      glaucoma and ocular hypertension. This treatment effect is compared with that of the
      prostaglandin analogue, travoprost.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Selective laser trabeculoplasty is an effective treatment for lowering intraocular pressure
      in patients with open-angle glaucoma. Clinical evaluations of its effectiveness in
      individual patients usually are derived from baseline and post-laser measurements of
      intraocular pressure during office hours in the sitting position. Only a few studies have
      examined the efficacy of laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hours. Although the 24-hour
      effect of laser trabeculoplasty has been studied ,the study was conducted before the use of
      these new and more potent intraocular pressure lowering drugs. So it doesn't have any study
      to determine the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and travoprost to reduce the
      diurnal and nocturnal variation of Iintraocular pressure.
