      Study Design:

      Patients are eligible if (1) enrolled to TCOG 3207(2) received surgery or biopsy for
      pancreatic cancer; (3) willing to sign informed consent.

      The pancreatic tumor, tissue specimen and blood sample before or after treatment will be
      collected from department of pathology, surgery or diagnostic medicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We expect to collect tissue samples from 270 pancreatic cancer patients of any stages. Since
      the enrollment criteria are not limited to new patients, we expect to enroll 67 patients a
      year. The patient enrollment will be completed in 4 years. Clinical follow-up will be
      completed in another one year. Data analysis and correlation study may be finished in the
      end of 5th year of this study.
