      Background:

      - Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) can affect how the body   s immune system functions.
      People with IEM also have special dietary restrictions that may affect the function of their
      immune system. Researchers want to better understand how having an IEM may affect immune
      system function.

      Objectives:

      - To study the how having an IEM may affect immune system functioning.

      Eligibility:

        -  Individuals at least 2 years of age who have an IEM.

        -  Healthy volunteers at least 2 years of age.

      Design:

        -  Participants will come to the NIH Clinical Center for at least 1 evaluation. Depending
           on the level of participation, participants may return for additional visits. All
           participants (or their parents) must keep a detailed food diary for 3 days before the
           initial visit.

        -  At the study visit, participants will provide blood samples. Females of childbearing
           age will provide a urine sample.

        -  Participants will be offered the hepatitis A vaccination if not already given. If the
           visit occurs during flu season (roughly September through March), they will be offered
           a seasonal/H1N1 influenza vaccine.

        -  Children between 2 and 8 years of age may require booster shots depending on their
           history of vaccination.

        -  At a follow-up visit(s), participants will provide additional blood samples.

        -  Participants may return yearly for their flu vaccine.

    <textblock>
      The biochemical perturbations in children with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) may affect
      their immune response. As a result, this will not only increase risk for infection but also
      hamper their ability to develop protective immunity after vaccination. Characterizing
      perturbations in immunity and the ability of vaccines to provide protective immunity in IEM
      is critical. Immune deficiencies and the immunogenicity of vaccines have not been well
      characterized in IEM.

      Viral infections play a significant role in precipitating life-threatening acute
      decompensations in various IEM. Seasonal variation of respiratory and gastrointestinal
      viruses places this vulnerable population at significant risk. The standard of care for
      these patients is routine childhood vaccination as well as vaccination for seasonal
      influenza viruses. However, nutritional deficiencies and their underlying IEM enzymopathies
      may affect the efficacy of vaccination.

      Dietary management of IEM includes dietary modifications with restriction of macronutrients.
      Protein energy malnutrition, essential fatty acid deficiencies and micronutrient
      deficiencies due to restrictive dietary management have been reported in various inborn
      errors of metabolism. In general, dietary deficiencies and their effect on immune function
      are well documented.

      In this protocol, we will clinically evaluate the nutritional/metabolic and immunologic
      states of patients with IEM. Routine inpatient admissions will last 2-3 days and involve
      urine collection, stool collection, blood drawing, radiological procedures, nutrition
      assessment and biometrics. Immune challenge will be performed using vaccinations for
      seasonal influenza and Hepatitis A. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled at the end of
      the study period.

      The study objectives will be to describe the nutritional and immune deficiencies seen, query
      for nutrition/enzymatic/immunologic correlations in this patient population, and describe
      vaccine seroconversion in this patient population. The population will consist of patients
      previously evaluated at NIH, physician referrals, and families directed to the study from
      clinicaltrials.gov as well as the patient advocacy groups. All patients will be evaluated at
      the NIH Clinical Center.

        -  INCLUSION and EXCLUSION CRITERIA

        Patients of any gender and ethnicity age 2 years and older are eligible to enroll in this
        protocol. Patients will be diagnosed based on a determination of several parameters that
        may include: plasma ammonia, acylcarnitine profile, amino acid and/or organic acid
        patterns. Some will have their DNA mutation or enzyme analysis known or pending.
        Participants need to be medically and/or nutritionally managed by a local metabolic
        provider. We will obtain written consent from the patient to review medical records from
        their home physician to confirm eligibility.

        Healthy volunteers of any gender and ethnicity 2 years and older will also be eligible to
        enroll in the vaccination arm of the protocol. These individuals will be vaccinated and
        have blood collected in an outpatient setting on visits 1 and 2. Influenza vaccination is
        normally offered seasonally to the public. Hepatitis A vaccination is currently part of
        the pediatric vaccination schedule. Volunteers will be compensated for their participation
        in the study. Healthy volunteers may be from the local community, or family members of
        patients with IEM.

        Patient and healthy volunteer exclusion criteria include: less than 2 years of age,
        inability to travel to NIH because of their medical condition, recent vaccination, severe
        reactions to eggs, latex, severe reactions to previous immunizations. The Principal
        Investigator may decline to enroll a patient for other reasons based on clinical judgment.
        Other criteria that may lead to exclusion include, for example, residing in a hospital,
        any patient who is being treated for an intercurrent infection with antibiotics or has
        evidence of an acute infection. Furthermore for IEM patients, any patient who does not
        have a regular/local metabolic, genetic or endocrine physician and/or a family physician,
        pediatrician, or internist will also be excluded. For IEM patients, Dr. McGuire will
        contact each potential patient   s local metabolic physician to discuss the patient   s
        past medical history, details of their last visit, and their current metabolic status to
        determine whether the patient is an appropriate candidate for this protocol. Closer to a
        scheduled visit, Dr. McGuire will confirm the details of the patient   s formula recipe
        and medications. Lastly, each family will be contacted by Dr. McGuire or a member of the
        study staff one week prior to a pending inpatient admission to confirm that the patient is
        metabolically stable and ready to visit

        the NIH in a state of relative health, with an adequate supply of special formulas,
        medications and supplements.
