            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - The immune system protects the body from infection. But it can also cause harm. For\n      example, the clotting system makes blood clot and protects from bleeding. But blood clots\n      are sometimes harmful. People with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have\n      increased inflammation and clotting. This may increase their risk for diseases like stroke\n      or heart attack. Researchers want to know how aspirin or HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors\n      (so-called    statin    medications) affect the immune and clotting systems of people with\n      HIV. Aspirin is a medicine to decrease clotting. Statins are medications given to lower\n      cholesterol and decrease inflammation.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To see how aspirin or statins change immune and clotting systems in people with HIV.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 18 and older with HIV and a low viral load, not on aspirin or a statin medication.\n      They must also have either: (1) never taken anti-HIV medications (ARVs), have a suppressed\n      viral load, have stable CD4 counts, and never had an opportunistic infection; or (2) been\n      taking ARVs for 5 continuous years and have a suppressed viral load for more than 3 years.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with medical history, physical exam, and blood and lab\n           tests.\n\n        -  Participants will repeat screening tests and have an MRI. An MRI is a way to visualize\n           blood vessels in the neck and head.  Participants will lie on a table that slides in\n           and out of a cylinder surrounded by a magnetic field.\n\n        -  Participants will take either study drug once daily for 9 months.\n\n        -  Participants will have a blood procedure twice. Blood will be removed through a needle\n           in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood cells. The blood,\n           minus white blood cells, is returned through a needle in the other arm.\n\n        -  All participants will be observed for 3 months before and after treatment."

            "textblock": "Despite dramatic improvements in mortality with antiretroviral therapy (ART), HIV-infected\n      persons remain at risk of developing non-infectious complications, including cardiovascular,\n      renal, and neurological disease. A small subset of the HIV-infected population achieve\n      durable control of HIV virus in the absence of ART. These individuals, termed elite\n      controllers (ECs), remain ART na(SqrRoot) ve, have stable CD4 T cell counts for many years\n      and have no history of opportunistic infections. Despite the lack of AIDS complications,\n      recent evidence suggests ECs may exhibit heightened immune activation that may contribute to\n      a potentially increased risk for non-infectious complications, similar to successfully\n      treated progressors.\n\n      In the current 2 group, randomized, open label trial, we intend to study the effects of a\n      lipid lowering agent vs aspirin (ASA) on immune activation in HIV-1 infected participants.\n      One group will consist of ECs who are HIV-1 infected, maintain HIV-RNA levels of less than\n      the LLD of commercially available assays in the absence of ART, have no history of ART or\n      opportunistic infections (OIs) and have stable CD4 T cell counts for greater than 5 years.\n      The second group will enroll HIV-1 infected Treated Progressors (henceforth referred to as\n      ART < 50) who have maintained HIV-RNA below the limit of detection in commercially available\n      assays (< 40, < 48, or < 50 copies/mL) for greater than 3 years on ART (treatment duration\n      greater than 5 years). The EC and ART < 50 groups will be matched for age and smoking\n      status. Two days to 2 months after screening, each group will enter a 3 month observation\n      period (to establish baseline values for biomarkers/cellular markers). After 3 months,\n      participants from each group will be randomized to either ASA, 81 mg PO daily, or\n      atorvastatin (ATV), 40 mg (dose adjusted for subjects on antiretroviral regimens with\n      significant interactions, and will be treated for 9 months, followed by 3 months of a wash\n      out period (see Figure 1). The primary end point will be change of sCD14 after 9 months of\n      study intervention from Month 3 to Month 12 in each treatment arm, with groups combined (EC\n      and ART < 50). Secondary objectives will be to compare changes in soluble biomarkers (sCD14,\n      IL-6, D-dimer, hsCRP, sTF, sCD163 and other relevad treatment arms (ASA vs statin and EC vs\n      ART< 50 and with groups combined), to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) disease prevalence in EC\n      vs ART< 50 and with groups combined), to evaluate cardiovascular (CV) disease prevalence in\n      EC vs ART < 50 by MR imaging of carotids, to determine MR measurements and correlations with\n      biomarkers and cellular activation markers, and to investigate changes in plasma viremia as\n      measured by single copy assay over time."
