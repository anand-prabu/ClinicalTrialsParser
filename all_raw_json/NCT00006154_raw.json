PIs are anti-HIV drugs that\n      decrease viral load (level of HIV in the blood). However, PIs can cause serious side effects\n      in some patients. Doctors would like to know if a drug combination that does not contain a\n      PI is just as good as one that contains PIs."

This provides an alternative treatment to that of the more toxic\n      PI-containing regimen. This trial examines whether a nonPI regimen with EFV is more\n      beneficial than a PI-containing regimen when each is used in combination with the same two\n      nucleoside analogues. A second part of the study looks at whether the addition of IL-2 may\n      offer immunologic benefits as a co-administered drug.\n\n      Patients are randomized to initiate antiretroviral therapy of a PI-based\n      (stavudine/didanosine/ritonavir [RTV]/indinavir [IDV]) or nonPI-based\n      (stavudine/didanosine/EFV) regimen. Within these treatment arms, they are stratified\n      according to a positive or negative p24 antigen result. At Week 16, patients not achieving\n      maximal viral suppression (lower than 50 copies/ml) have the option to add abacavir (ABC) or\n      other drugs as intensification therapy. Those achieving virologic suppression (less than 50\n      copies/ml) are randomized either to receive IL-2 or not. At study entry, and after 12\n      months, tissue samples of CSF, lymph node, and genital secretions are obtained, with\n      permission. Patients have physical exams, women of child-bearing potential have pregnancy\n      tests, and blood samples are drawn at clinic visits 12-16 times a year over 3 years so that\n      virologic and immunologic evaluations may be performed. Compensation for time and\n      transportation is given."
