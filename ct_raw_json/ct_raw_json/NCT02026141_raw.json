A third anesthetist not involved in the project\n      will mix up the syringe based on instructions in an opaque envelope, and provide the syringe\n      to the attending anesthetist.\n\n      The current standard of care entails patients receiving a midazolam bolus for sedation\n      during the operation. The investigators propose to substitute a syringe of dexmedetomidine\n      or saline to be run as an infusion throughout the case for sedation.  A midazolam bolus will\n      be available at anesthetist discretion to achieve a moderate sedation score as defined by\n      the American Society of Anesthesia.\n\n      Standardized Medication Protocol\n\n      Pre-op:\n\n      Tylenol and Naproxen\n\n      Spinal:\n\n      Marcaine .75%, 1.7cc (12.75mg) Fentanyl 10 micrograms\n\n      Sedation\n\n        1. st arm- Dexmedetomidine, drawn up into a 50cc syringe of saline, thereby making it\n           5ug/ml.\n\n        2. nd arm- Receives Normal Saline syringe\n\n      Plan for bolus of 0.5micrgram/kg over 10 minutes, and then infusion of 0.5 microgram/kg/hr\n      (Can be titrated from 0.2-0.7 microgram per kg per hr to achieve moderate sedation as\n      defined by the ASA\n\n      Both groups will have a midazolam 0.5mg prn q 5minutes to be used as a rescue to achieve\n      moderate sedation.\n\n      Post op- Initial setting of patient-controlled-analgesia pump to be set at morphine 1 mg,\n      lockout of 8 minutes, to be increased to 1.5 mg with lockout of 6 minutes if pain not\n      controlled.

To minimize the risks to participants, an anesthesiologist will\n      always be present in the room while the infusion is running, will monitor the patient, and\n      will be allowed to treat as they see fit any of these risks.\n\n      Data Collection Data collection will be performed primarily by Ian Chan, anesthesiology\n      resident.\n\n      Primary Outcome:\n\n      Total morphine consumption in the first 24 hours"
