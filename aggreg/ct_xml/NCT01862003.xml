    <textblock>
      In phase I, the aim of the study is to determine the recommended phase II dose of AZD8931 in
      combination with standard chemotherapy, FOLFIRI, by assessing the safety and tolerability of
      the combination treatment.

      In phase II, the combination of AZD8931 and FOLFIRI will be compared to FOLFIRI alone, to
      determine the efficacy of the treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PANTHER is a registered phase I/randomised phase II trial in patients with recurrent or
      metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients are recruited to received AZD8931 (an EGFR/ERBB
      inhibitor) in combination with FOLinic acid, Fluorouracil and IRInotecan (FOLFIRI). AZD8931
      and FOLFIRI will be given in two-weekly cycles. The Phase I trial will aim to determine the
      recommended Phase II dose of AZD8931 (either 20, 40, 80 or 160mg bd, on days 1-4 of each
      2-weekly cycle) - the dose of AZD8931 that patients will receive will depend on the dose
      under investigation at the time of registration.

      The AZD8931 dose will be determined by the Modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).
      mCRM is a dose-toxicity model which describes the probability of a toxicity occurring at
      each dose level, which is based on clinical judgment and any available toxicity data.

      The recommended AZD8931 dose in combination with FOLFIRI, determined from the phase I trial,
      will become one of the treatment groups in the randomised Phase II - the other treatment
      group will be FOLFIRI alone (Control group).
