      Project Summary:  One of the challenges facing pediatric researchers is the need to balance
      decreasing funding with the time and human resource costs associated with enrolling
      children.  In order to address this, the Emergency Department (ED) research team developed
      an innovative model for subject enrollment and consent using highly trained and supervised
      undergraduate students. From a human resources perspective, utilizing students is more cost
      effective than the traditional research nurse model.  However, a concern with this method is
      the adequacy of parental understanding of study information for informed consent. The aim of
      this project is to determine if the use of students is at least as good as the more costly
      &quot;gold standard&quot; of experienced research nurses. The validation of this innovative student
      model will enable child health investigators to better meet parent's needs and increase the
      efficiency of pediatric research.

      The primary objective of this study is to measure parental comprehension of informed consent
      information using an innovative undergraduate research assistant program compared to consent
      using the traditional research nurse model. We hypothesize that parental comprehension of
      the informed consent information process when approached by undergraduate students will be
      comparable (or not worse) than when consent is obtained by a research nurse.

    <description>The DICCT is a validated and reliable tool that was developed to assess comprehension of informed consent information among adult study subjects and adapted to measure parental understanding of consent. Parental understanding of the consent process will be measured using a modified Deaconess Informed Consent Comprehension Test (mDICCT), which has previously been used in a pediatric setting. The score on the DICCT will be presented as a mean or median (depending on distribution) with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI's).  The appropriate parametric (t-test) or non-parametric test will be used to compare the score on the DICCT between the intervention (student enrollment) and the control group (traditional nurse enrollment).</description>
