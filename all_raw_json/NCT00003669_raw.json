Determine the objective tumor response rate (complete response and partial\n      response) to arzoxifene hydrochloride in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial\n      cancer. II. Determine the time to progressive disease, time to treatment failure, response\n      duration, and survival in patients with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer receiving\n      arzoxifene hydrochloride. III. Assess the safety of this treatment in these patients. IV.\n      Measure changes in serum estradiol, follicle stimulating hormone, luteinizing hormone, and\n      sex hormone binding globulin during this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral arzoxifene hydrochloride daily at a fixed dose. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified\n\n      National Cancer Institute (NCI) registered this trial with Eli Lilly as sponsor.  NCI did\n      not update the record when the trial completed. In June 2012, NCI transferred the trial to\n      Lilly's clinicaltrials.gov account and Lilly updated the record with the trial completion\n      date.  This trial is not an applicable trial under Food and Drug Administration Amendments\n      Act of 2007 (FDAAA)."
