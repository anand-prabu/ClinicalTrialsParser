Alternative and complementary therapies including therapeutic massage\n      have been used to decrease the mentioned side effects.\n\n      Design: A Triple-blinded Randomized controlled Clinical Trial Methods: All prolonged\n      hospitalized patients and their families (45 patients and 45 family members in each group)\n      were selected consecutively among the patients admitted in ICU. Data collection tool\n      consisted of two parts. The first part included demographic data (age, mar\u00acital status and\n      Body Max Index) and the second part included a checklist to record the patient's vital signs\n      (systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, and pulse rate). All\n      measurements were conducted in same time in both groups as follow: before the intervention\n      (the whole massage therapy), one hour, two hours, three hours, and four hours. Collected\n      data was analyzed using descriptive and analytical statistics utilizing SPSS 11.5 software.\n\n      Keywords: Family member's massage therapy; Vital signs; Glasgow coma scale; Intensive care\n      unit; Randomized controlled Clinical Trial; Iran."

Massage techniques used included static massage, surface tension techniques, stretching massage, superficial lymph unload, transverse friction techniques, and myofacial releasing techniques. All the massage sessions were conducted in the morning shifts. For the control group, there was no intervention and patients just received the routine care of the unit.",
