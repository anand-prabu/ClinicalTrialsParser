  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-ME is a research intervention study designed to address the needs of African American men
      who have sex with men (AAMSM) who are at high risk for HIV. The intent of the intervention
      is to decrease HIV risk behaviors among African American MSM using an intervention developed
      by and for African American MSM.

      The hypothesis guiding this study is: that participants who complete B-ME intervention will
      report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Specific Aims of this study are 1) to further explicate and develop the intervention, 2)
      to evaluate its efficacy in reducing HIV risk behaviors and 3) to expand the limited body of
      research on HIV prevention/risk reduction practices for African American men who have sex
      with men(AAMSM). The study will use a randomized-controlled trial design to compare
      receiving B-ME intervention to receiving basic men's health and wellness messaging (standard
      of care), hypothesizing: hypothesizing: that participants who complete B-ME intervention
      will report greater reductions in sexual risk behaviors than the standard of care comparison
      group. The study will utilize a pre-test/post-test design with participants randomized to
      intervention and comparison groups; have a strategy to retain at least 80% of participants
      through study completion; collect data at baseline, at 3 months post-intervention, and at 6
      months post-intervention; and rigorously measure outcomes that directly impact HIV risk.
      Data will be collected at each assessment point to assess B-ME's ability to improve
      behavioral outcomes that directly impact Black MSM HIV risk: (1) number of unprotected anal
      and vaginal sex events; (2) number of unprotected sex events with persons of unknown HIV
      status; (3) frequency of HIV testing, and (4) increased communication between partners about
      sex and strategies for reducing the risk of HIV infection.
