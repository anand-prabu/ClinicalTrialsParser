      This pilot, phase II trial studies the side effects and how well paclitaxel intravenously
      and carboplatin intraperitoneally followed by radiation therapy work in treating patients
      with stage IIIC or IV serous uterine cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel
      and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing
      the cells or stopping them from dividing. Giving the drugs in different ways may kill more
      tumor cells. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving radiation
      in different ways may kill more tumor cells. Giving radiation therapy after chemotherapy may
      be more effective in treating uterine cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity (as defined by National Cancer Institute [NCI] Common Toxicity
      Criteria v. 4.0) of weekly intravenous (IV) paclitaxel with intraperitoneal (IP) carboplatin
      chemotherapy given every third week, followed by radiation therapy (RT) in patients with
      advanced stage uterine serous cancer (USC).

      II. To determine the feasibility of this regimen in women with advanced stage USC.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study
      treatments.

      II. To describe patient-reported quality of life parameters at specified time points during
      the study using validated questionnaires: European Organization for Research and the
      Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-C30 and QLQ-ovarian cancer
      module (OV)28.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To define patterns of recurrence (e.g. local versus distant) and progression-free
      survival in patients with advanced and recurrent USC treated with dose dense IV paclitaxel
      and IP carboplatin therapy.

      II. To correlate surrogate endpoint biomarkers that is performed in standard histology
      processing (estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor status as well as human epidermal
      growth factor 2 [Her2/neu] status) with progression-free survival and prognosis.

      III. To assess the potential late effects of combined intraperitoneal chemotherapy and
      radiotherapy on the gastrointestinal, genitoureteral, bone marrow and other body systems
      beginning at 6 months post treatment completion during routine office visits.

      OUTLINE:

      CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15 and
      carboplatin IP on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses (weeks 1-18) in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      RADIATION: At provider discretion, patients may undergo 3-dimensional (3D) conformal or
      intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) 5 days a week for 5 weeks (weeks 19-23).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then yearly thereafter for up to 10 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological/cytologically documented primary International Federation of Gynecology
             and Obstetrics (FIGO) stage 3C1, 3C2, stage 4A, and 4B uterine serous carcinoma; in
             addition, certain stage 3A and B disease are also allowed

               -  Residual disease after primary surgery:

                    -  Eligible:

                         -  Stage 3A and B (pelvic, but confined to adnexa or vagina), residual
                            disease present

                         -  Stage 3CI (pelvic node positive)

                         -  Stage 3CII (para-aortic node positive)

                         -  Stage 4A (bladder or pelvic bowel)

                         -  Stage 4B (distant metastases [mets] including abdominal mets),
                            completely resected

                    -  Not eligible

                         -  Stage 3A and B (pelvic, but confined to adnexa or vagina), completely
                            resected

                         -  Stage 4B (distant mets including abdominal mets), residual disease
                            present

          -  All patients must have a procedure for determining diagnosis of high-risk uterine
             cancer (HRUC); minimum surgical intervention required is tissue biopsy (may be from
             endometrium), if significant clinical evidence exists to support a stage 3 or 4
             diagnosis; as per the discretion of the surgeon, complete surgical staging should
             include: total abdominal hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, peritoneal
             washings, omental biopsy and lymph node samplings; this is typically the standard
             unless the disease is bulky or the clinician feels the patient would be best served
             by chemotherapy and radiation therapy after histologic diagnosis is confirmed

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of =&lt; 2

          -  Written voluntary informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Distant metastasis to the lung, bone or brain; typically, most stage 4 uterine
             papillary serous cancer (UPSC) is confined to the abdomen on presentation

          -  Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) and/or serum glutamate pyruvate
             transaminase (SGPT) &gt; 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)

          -  History of abdominal/pelvic radiation therapy

          -  Severe or uncontrolled, concurrent medical disease (e.g. uncontrolled diabetes,
             unstable angina, myocardial infarction within 6 months, congestive heart failure,
             etc.)
