It is believed to be mostly the consequence of a mitochondrial\n      damage caused by oxidative stress.\n\n      Risk factors for accelerated age-related hearing loss are present in many HIV-infected\n      patients :  chronic inflammation, smoking, diabetes, etc.\n\n      The global aim is to measure the prevalence of presbyacusia in a well controlled HIV\n      positive population in France, and to compare it to HIV negative controls matched for age\n      and sex.\n\n      70 HIV positive patients and 70 age- and sex- matched HIV negative controls will undergo a\n      screening for presbyacusia (pure-tone, speech and evoked-response audiometry).\n\n      We expect to find an increased prevalence of presbyacusia in HIV-infected patients, as\n      compared to controls matched for age and sex."
