      This trial investigates the behavioral effects of manualized social skills training
      (KONTAKT) in children´s and adolescents with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder with
      psychiatric comorbidity in a RCT, multicenter study. N = 288 are recruited from 10 child and
      adolescent psychiatric clinics in Stockholm County. The examination of genetic variants as
      predictors for outcome and a qualitative study of KONTAKT complete the trial.

      There are few randomized controlled trials of social skills group training for the
      Children's and adolescents with high functioning autism spectrum disorders (HFA)(1). The
      Objective of this trial is to investigate the behavioral effects of the manualized social
      skills group training KONTAKT (2,3) and the role of genetic variants for training effects.

    <description>KONTAKT is a manual-based social skills group training for children with high functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The program is based on cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) principles and knowledge of social cognition. The group treatment includes exercises in social skills as well as discussions of social cognition, social interaction, self-reflection and description of themselves and others. The children are training to make contact, to understand and follow social rules, to become aware of themselves and others, to perceive verbal and nonverbal signals in a communication, to develop problem solving skills and coping strategies to manage conflict and to enhance their self-confidence. Intervention includes 12 (brief intervention) and 24 (long intervention) sessions. Each group consists of 4-8 children/adolescents ant two group leaders. The treatment are conducted in cooperation with both parents and teachers.</description>
