However, HLA identical donor (sibling or unrelated) is available for\n      50-60% of patients and alternative donors are needed. Haploidentical donors have been used\n      for many years, mostly after extensive T-cell depletion of peripheral stem cell, to avoid\n      Graft Versus Host Disease (GVHD). Recently, promising data have been reported with\n      haploidentical transplantation using T-replete bone marrow (BM) and high-dose\n      cyclophosphamide (Cy) post-transplantation. However, the conditioning regimen did not\n      contain drugs active against hemopathies, enhancing the relapse risk.\n\n      In this study, the investigators want to test the feasibility and efficacy of T-replete BM,\n      infused after a RIC regimen and post-transplantation Cy, in patients with poor prognosis\n      lymphoproliferative diseases.\n\n      The RIC regimen consisted of modified regimen used in different studies conducted in Italy\n      on behalf GITMO."
