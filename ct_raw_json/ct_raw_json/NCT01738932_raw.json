            "textblock": "Endometriosis is a chronic, inflammatory disease, affecting approximately 10% of the female\n      population. The pathogenesis of endometriosis is still unclear, but several studies have\n      indicated that the immune system is involved. It has been suggested that endometriosis\n      should be considered an autoimmune disease, considering the findings of elevated levels of\n      cytokines, decreased cell apoptosis, increased incidence of autoantibodies and a higher\n      frequency of other autoimmune diseases in endometriosis patients. MBL participates in the\n      innate immune defence by activating complement on the surfaces of microorganisms, but\n      several studies have suggested that MBL is also involved in autoimmune diseases. The\n      individual MBL level is highly variable due to a number of polymorphic sites in the\n      structural gene and in the promoter region, and approximately 12 % of the normal population\n      have very low serum MBL levels (<100 ng/ml).\n\n      The possible association between MBL and endometriosis has been investigated in two small\n      studies, in which no association was found. The aim of the present study is to investigate\n      the prevalence of individuals with low serum levels of MBL and with genotypes associated\n      with low MBL production in a larger group of endometriosis patients."
