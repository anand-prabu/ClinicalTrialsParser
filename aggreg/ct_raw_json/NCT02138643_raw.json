In Brazil , the incidence is approximate\n      7-13/100.000 inhabitants .\n\n      Large proportion of patients with symptomatic achalasia require additional tests for\n      diagnosis. Endoscopy ( EDA ) despite being regarded as a major test for initial evaluation\n      of dysphagia , presents serious limitations to evaluate esophageal motility , especially in\n      early stages . Some contrast studies , highlighting the Esophagogram barium ( DSE ) ,\n      provide additional anatomical findings as esophageal shape and size , as well as functional\n      : peristalsis , the LES function and bolus clearance through the esophagogastric junction (\n      TEG ) . Another useful method of diagnosis is the Esophageal manometry , with characteristic\n      (Chicago Classification of Distal Esophageal Motility Disorders ) : aperistalsis the\n      esophageal body and failure to relax the LES , currently best characterized by High\n      Resolution Manometry .\n\n      Idiopathic achalasia is confined to the esophagus and has no established etiology , with\n      agenesis of the myenteric plexus or viral infections , in particular herpes simplex ( HSV -\n      1 ) , the most likely hypothesis . In Brazil , the secondary achalasia caused by Chagas\n      disease predominantly among other etiologies , involves but is expressed primarily systemic\n      disease with esophageal involvement . Infected patients Typanossoma cruzi, the causative\n      agent of Chagas disease , 7-10 % have esophageal involvement, and due to its chronic nature\n      the most common clinical presentation is megaesophagus , to varying degrees .\n\n      There is currently considered curative treatment for achalasia , dysphagia relief being the\n      primary therapeutic target and is forced to relax the LES by endoscopy or surgery . Thus ,\n      the most commonly used endoscopic treatments are forced dilatation of the cardia and\n      botulinum toxin.

With a success rate ranging between 89 and 100 % in recent studies ,\n      provide a more lasting relief of symptoms without the need for additional interventions ,\n      compared to pneumatic dilation .\n\n      In recent years, the possibility of using endoluminal access in the treatment of achalasia\n      patients through the technique originally described as Natural orifices Translumenal\n      Endoscopic Surgery ( NOTES) and continuing advances in the submucosal dissection has enabled\n      the concomitant development of a new approach described as perioral endoscopic myotomy .
