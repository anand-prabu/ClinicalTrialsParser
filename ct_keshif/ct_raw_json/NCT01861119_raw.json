            "textblock": "Hypertrophic or keloid scars develop for about 39% to 68% of patients after surgery. The\n      subjective opinion of the patient regarding the scar will often constitute the standard for\n      judging the success or failure of the procedure. Surgical scars are not only a cosmetic\n      concern but they can also cause pain, itching, discomfort, contracture, and other functional\n      impairment. Various treatment options exists for treating hypertrophic scars and keloids,\n      including intralesional steroid injection, dermabrasion, pressure therapy, surgical\n      excision, radiotherapy, cryotherapy, pulse dye, and carbon dioxide laser ablation. However,\n      these treatments often require multiple visits and have limited success. Therefore,\n      prevention and early recognition of hypertrophic scars and keloids are very important in\n      their management.\n\n      Among preventive treatments available, silicone gel and onion extract gel have been marketed\n      as products to improve the appearance and texture of surgical scars. Despite its popularity,\n      data demonstrating the efficacy of these gels are lacking. Furthermore, there is no\n      comparative study of silicone gel and onion extract gel for preventing postsurgical\n      hypertrophic or keloid scars. The investigators therefore conducted this randomized\n      controlled trial to compare the efficacy of silicone gel and onion extract gel for the\n      prevention of postsurgical hypertrophic scars. The investigators also compared patient\n      compliance and side effect between two topical gels."
