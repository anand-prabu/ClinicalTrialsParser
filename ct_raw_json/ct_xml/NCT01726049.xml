      Aim of the study is to investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a reduction of
      pulmonary artery pressure without decrease of CO and in improvement of exercise capacity in
      HFpEF patients with PH.

      Rationale: Treatment of diastolic left heart failure is a challenging task. Compared to
      systolic left heart failure the level of evidence for known medical treatment regiments is
      low. Sildenafil, a PDE 5 inhibitor and effective therapy for pulmonary arterial hypertension
      acts as a selective pulmonary vasodilator by inhibiting the impaired NO pathway. Reducing
      the pulmonary vascular resistance would be the primary target by treatment of diastolic left
      heart failure with PH. But clinical and hemodynamical studies to evaluatie the role of
      Sildenafil in diastolic heart failure, also called heart failure with preserved ejection
      fraction (HFpEF) with secondary pulmonary hypertension are lacking. Our hypothesis is that
      Sildenafil decreases pulmonary artery pressure in patients with HFpEF and pulmonary
      hypertension.

      Objective: To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a hemodynamic improvement
      and in an improvement of exercise capacity in these patients.

      Study design: single-center, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled study. Study
      population: 52 patients with HFpEF and PH Intervention : One group receives three times
      daily 20 mg Sildenafil for 2 weeks followed by three times daily 60 mg  Sildenafil for 10
      weeks. The other group receives three times daily 20 mg of Placebo, followed by 3 times
      daily 60 mg placebo.

      Main study parameters/endpoints:

      Primary objectives

      1. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a reduction of pulmonary artery
      pressure without decrease of CO in HFpEF patients with PH (investigated invasively by right
      heart catheterisation) .

      Secondary objectives

        1. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in a reduction of wedge pressure in
           HFpEF patients.

        2. To investigate whether Sildenafil treatment results in improvement of exercise capacity
           in these patients ( defined as change in VO2max)
