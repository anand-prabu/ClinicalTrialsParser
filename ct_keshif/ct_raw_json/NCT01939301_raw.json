Patients must have a\n      submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and evidence of right ventricular (RV) heart dysfunction.\n      Investigators hypothesize that the administration of inhaled NO + oxygen to patients with\n      severe submassive PE will improve RV function, reduce RV strain and necrosis and improve\n      dyspnea (difficulty breathing) more than sham oxygen treatment."
