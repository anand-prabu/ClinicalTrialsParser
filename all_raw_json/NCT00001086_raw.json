Patients with greater than 50 CD4 cells/mm3 are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment\n      arms (Arms I, II, III, or IV) and patients with less than or equal to 50 CD4 cells/mm3 are\n      randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms (Arms I and II). All patients will be followed for 48\n      weeks beyond the enrollment of the last patient. The regimens for the treatment arms are as\n      follows: Arm I - indinavir (IDV) plus EFV plus ABC placebo bid, Arm II - IDV (higher dose)\n      plus EFV (lower dose) plus ABC, Arm III -  IDV plus EFV plus ABC placebo, and Arm IV - IDV\n      (higher dose) plus EFV (lower dose) plus ABC. If 15 week data indicates this is a reasonable\n      dosing regimen, the sample size in Arms III and IV will be expanded to include additional\n      patients with a CD4 count greater than 50 cells/mm3 and allow for equal enrollment across\n      all 4 treatment arms. Those patients who roll over from ACTG 320 will be assigned to receive\n      open-label treatment on Arm II and evaluated independently of the 4 treatment arms listed\n      above.\n\n      [AS PER AMENDMENT 8/27/97: Patients with 2 consecutive HIV RNA measurements at least 500\n      copies/ml at week 16 or anytime thereafter are given the option to receive open-label\n      treatment with IDV plus EFV plus ABC, or to seek the best available therapy outside of the\n      study.

The extension applies to subjects currently on blinded Step 1 treatment, on\n      open-labeled Step 2, or on study but off treatment.  Subjects are to be unblinded in their\n      study treatment and followed for the remainder of the extension.  Subjects continue on their\n      current study drug schedule.  Subjects on blinded IDV plus EFV who, upon unblinding (not\n      failure) decide to add prescription ABC to their regimen, will be considered off study\n      treatment and will be followed for the duration of the extension; those already registered\n      on Step 2 will continue their Step 2 therapy.  Any subject who does not wish to continue on\n      the study extension will be unblinded to their original randomized regimen.  Subjects who\n      experience virologic failure during the extension should seek best available treatment\n      following current recommendations to use as many approved, novel antiretroviral agents as\n      possible.
