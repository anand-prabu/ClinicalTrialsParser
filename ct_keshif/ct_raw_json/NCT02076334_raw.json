A familiarization session will then be conducted on a separate day where all\n      participants will practice the strength assessment, eccentric isokinetic protocol, and\n      ultrasound assessments. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups based\n      on their initial maximal isometric strength values using a matched-participants design. The\n      first experimental session will then begin 2-10 days later, where the participants will\n      perform the repeated eccentric exercise protocol (10 sets of 15 eccentric contractions 210\n      deg/sec with 3 min of rest between sets) with the non-dominant leg following a 60 min rest\n      period where they will wear the apparel and perform a 5 min warm-up on a cycle ergometer.\n      Follow-up blood draws and strength and ultrasound assessments will be obtained at 24 and 48\n      hours post-exercise. Each participant will also complete a visual analog scale at baseline,\n      24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise to examine perceived muscle soreness."
