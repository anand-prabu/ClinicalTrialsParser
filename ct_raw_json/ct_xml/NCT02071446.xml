  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deep Brain Stimulation is an FDA approved, and widely used method for treating the motor
      symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET) and Dystonia. Over 100,000
      patients worldwide have now been implanted with DBS devices. The DBS target regions in the
      brain are the Subthalamic nucleus (STN), the Internal Segment of Globus Pallidus (GPi), or
      the Ventral Intermediate Nucleus of the Thalamus (VIM). In order to place the DBS electrode
      in the target location, a combination of two 3D imaging techniques; 3D MRI and CT, are used.
      Data are also collected from individual nerve cells  to help find the best location for the
      DBS electrode in each patient. This electrode recording takes place during the standard
      surgical implantation of the DBS electrode, and is part of the standard clinical technique.
      We plan to collect additional data from populations of neurons during the DBS surgery in an
      effort to further improve the placement of the DBS electrode. We will measure these Local
      Field Potentials, LFPs, representing the activity of the collection of neurons in the brain
      surrounding the tip of the electrode, during surgery for the placement of the DBS electrode.
      The goal of this project is to determine whether this additional data from surrounding
      neurons will help with optimal placement of the DBS electrode.
