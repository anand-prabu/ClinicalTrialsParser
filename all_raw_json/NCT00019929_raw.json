Patients without a suitable gene\n      mutation receive no vaccination. Patients with a suitable p53 gene mutation receive mutant\n      p53 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells IV over 1-2 minutes weekly for 5 weeks.\n      Patients achieving an immune response with no evidence of progressive disease may receive\n      additional vaccinations every 2 months for a maximum of 10 immunizations.\n\n      Patients are followed for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 120 patients (40 on the vaccination arm) will be accrued\n      for this study."
