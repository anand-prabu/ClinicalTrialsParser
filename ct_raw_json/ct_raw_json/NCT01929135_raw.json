However, even if bacteria are required to initiate\n      periodontal disease, the immune response is responsible for most of the destruction of the\n      periodontal tissues. Statins may be used to control the immune response to periodontal\n      pathogens, a factor that has not yet been managed clinically and even less massively.\n\n      Recently it has been reported the pharmacological effectiveness of topically used statins.\n      For periodontal disease, at least four well conducted clinical trials have been published\n      using a topically statin formula for pocket irrigation in adult populations with chronic\n      periodontal disease, observing surprising clinical results in all of them (with clinical and\n      statistical significance) and no adverse reactions.\n\n      The purpose of the present study is to develop statin (atorvastatin 2%) medicated toothpaste\n      and evaluate its effectiveness, as complement to non-surgical conventional periodontal\n      treatment. Clinical as well as molecular examination will be made at the beginning and after\n      one month of treatment."
