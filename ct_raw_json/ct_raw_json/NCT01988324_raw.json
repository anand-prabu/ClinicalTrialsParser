Patients with ER-positive tumors can be treated with\n      anti-oestrogen therapy, which has relatively few side effects compared to chemotherapy.\n      Whole-body tumor ER-expression can be visualized by 18F-fluoroestradiol PET imaging\n      (FES-PET). In addition to ER, the androgen receptor (AR) is a potential new target in breast\n      cancer. PET imaging with 18F-fluorodihydrotestosterone (18F-FDHT) may allow visualization of\n      tumor AR-expression. In the current study we will perform FES-PET and FDHT-PET in metastatic\n      breast cancer patients and evaluate the concordance with concurrent biopsies. Molecular\n      imaging of tumor AR- and ER-expression may well be of value for future treatment\n      decision-making."
