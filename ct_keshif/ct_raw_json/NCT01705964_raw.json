The dose will be 0.2 mg for subjects\n      20-30 kg and 0.3 mg for subjects greater than 30 kg.  This will be injected intramuscularly\n      by an ED nurse into the anterior thigh muscles of the subject using a 1 ml syringe and a 23\n      gauge one inch needle.\n\n      In addition to the study intervention, the standardized treatment pathway based on the\n      current asthma guidelines in use at the investigator's center will be utilized.  This\n      pathway includes nebulized albuterol, ipratropium bromide, and systemic corticosteroids.\n      The duration and dosages of these other interventions will be administered at the discretion\n      of the treating provider."
