            "textblock": "Operations on the liver, bile ducts, and gallbladders are some of the most commonly\n      performed abdominal operations in the United States. Cholecystectomy, removal of the\n      gallbladder, is the most common of these with more than 750,000 performed annually. Injury\n      to the common bile duct (CBD) during these procedures occur infrequently (approximately 0.1%\n      to 0.5%), but it is an important source of patient morbidity. Serious injuries often require\n      at least one surgical repair, and these repairs have variable long-term outcomes. Techniques\n      to allow the visualization of the bile ducts may prevent such an injury, by providing vital\n      information about the presence of gallstones in the CBD and show a surgical road map of the\n      ducts. Near-infrared (NIR) cholangiography has the advantage over standard cholangiography\n      of not exposing patients and healthcare providers to radiation. This technique also allows\n      the superimposition of the cholangiogram onto the normal image.\n\n      This study is being conducted to optimize an imaging technique called PINPOINT. Images will\n      be obtained during clinically necessary operations. The images will be evaluated to\n      determine the best method for locating and outlining the anatomy. The information learned\n      will guide the future use of PINPOINT in laparoscopic procedures."
