Region scans superior and inferior to the sternum may be made at more customary image slices (3-10 mm) at investigator discretion. CT scans should be taken without contrast.\nAll scans should be obtained in the same suspended state of respiration when possible. Scans should be obtained thru the entire area of interest. The field of view should be optimized for each patient.\nDo not use gantry tilt in scanning patients if possible.\nArchive the entire study, preferably in DICOM format, to a removable medium.",
