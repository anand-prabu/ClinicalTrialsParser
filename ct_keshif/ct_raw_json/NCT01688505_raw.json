            "textblock": "Hypertension in midlife is an independent risk factor of late life cognitive dysfunction or\n      dementia. Chronic hypertension cause vascular damage and cerebral ischemia, which ultimately\n      gives rise to the cognitive dysfunction or dementia.\n\n      A recent study showed that high visit-to-visit variability in clinic systolic blood pressure\n      (BP) was a strong independent predictor of stroke. This finding suggests that high clinic\n      systolic BP variability itself as well as chronic hypertension may cause vascular damage and\n      cerebral ischemia. Therefore, high clinic SBP variability may be also an independent risk\n      factor of cognitive dysfunction or dementia.\n\n      Vascular damage leads to the diminished autoregulatory capacities of cerebral arteries. The\n      brain with the reduced autoregulatory capacity may be more vulnerable to BP fluctuation.\n      Therefore, high BP variability may be more harmful in patients with damaged vessels (for\n      example, in patients with cerebral small vessel disease).\n\n      Previous data about BP variability and cognition revealed very controversial. Some studies\n      showed poor cognition in patients with high BP variability, but others did not.\n\n      The previous studies were mostly based on cross-sectional designs, and performed in\n      small-sized heterogeneous population for primary prevention. The harmful effect of high BP\n      variability may be clearer in the population with damaged vascular bed, such as cerebral\n      small vessel disease. The previous studies usually used ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM).\n      However, recent data suggested that variability in BP on ABPM may be a weaker predictor of\n      vascular events than be visit-to-visit variability in clinic BP.\n\n      The investigators sought to find whether high visit-to-visit variability in clinic BP is\n      related with poor cognitive function in patients with cerebral small vessel disease."
