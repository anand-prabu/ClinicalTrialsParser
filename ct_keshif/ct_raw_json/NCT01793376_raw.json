In order to expand this score to the colon, this study will aim\n      to develop the colonic score and later on will be combined with the already established SB\n      score in order to achieve a full CE gut score for Crohn's disease Proposed Design This is a\n      retrospective study in which up to 30 videos of colon Crohn's disease subjects who have\n      undergone the Colon 2 CE procedure will be evaluated.\n\n      These cases will have evidence of large and / or small bowel Crohn's disease The chosen\n      videos will be marked for CD lesions by the site The de-identified marked videos will be\n      scored by 4 independent experienced endoscopists, blinded to the results of the standard\n      workup procedures, according to the colonic and CECDAIic new scores"
