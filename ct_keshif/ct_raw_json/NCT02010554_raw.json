Patients will be assigned to\n      either 5 weekly 20 minute telephone sessions of psychotherapy or a brief education control\n      condition. We hypothesize that patients undergoing phone therapy will be more likely to\n      indicate they are interested in initiating disease modifying medications than patients given\n      brief education and treatment as usual."
