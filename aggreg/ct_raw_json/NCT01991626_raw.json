The investigators want here to investigate the effects\n      of fat on iron absorption with and without the addition of exogenous phytase as a potential\n      iron absorption enhancer in lipid nutrient supplements (LNS) products compared to\n      micronutrient powder(MNP) products.\n\n      Furthermore the investigators will evaluate the effects of Lipids- on iron absorption to\n      induce the ileal brake by ingestion of a fat emulsion prior to a meal. Increasing the\n      caloric density of a meal by increasing its fat content might enhance iron absorption by\n      delaying gastric emptying, gastric acid secretion and increasing Fe stomach residence time."
