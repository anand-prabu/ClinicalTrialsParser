Many studies have examined particle effect\n      on respiratory health in children, mainly by environmental monitoring of coarse and fine\n      particles. Biological assessment   of individual exposure to nano sized particles in\n      correlation to adverse health effect was not previously studied.\n\n      Hypothesis individual exposure to nano sized particles in children is associated with\n      reduction in forced expiratory volume at one second."
