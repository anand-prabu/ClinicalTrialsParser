      The purpose of this study is to assess how glucagon administered as a puff into the nose
      (AMG504-1) works in children and adolescents compared with commercially-available glucagon
      given by injection. In addition, the safety and tolerability of glucagon given as a puff
      into the nose will be evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Glucagon, the treatment of choice for severe hypoglycemia outside of the hospital setting,
      is currently available only as a powder that must be mixed with a diluent immediately prior
      to administration by injection.  Although this is a very simple procedure for insulin-using
      individuals, subjects experiencing severe hypoglycemia cannot inject themselves with
      glucagon because of the disabling effects of severe neuroglycopenia.  For any non-medical
      person who is confronted with an emergency situation in which a patient with diabetes is in
      a hypoglycemic coma or suffering hypoglycemia-related convulsions, reconstitution and
      injection of the current injectable glucagon is a complex and daunting procedure.

      When used at the recommended dose of 1 mg by injection, glucagon often causes a substantial,
      although transient, hyperglycemia that is often accompanied by nausea and vomiting.  The
      data generated to date with AMG504-1 suggest the resulting glucagon pharmacokinetics (PK),
      although less than that observed with injected glucagon, results in a therapeutic blood
      glucose increment with a very low incidence of gastrointestinal adverse effects.

      Caregivers of children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes are called upon to treat
      episodes of severe hypoglycemia and may want to use AMG504-1.  This study is being conducted
      to permit determination of appropriate dose level(s) for pediatric use based on the safety
      observations and results of glucagon and glucose assays.

      Each participant 12.0 to less than 17.0 years of age will undergo two visits in random order
      and receive AMG504-1 during one visit and commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen, Novo
      Nordisk) by IM injection during the other visit. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years
      are randomly assigned to have either 1 visit with commercially available glucagon (GlucaGen,
      Novo Nordisk) by IM injection OR to have 2 visits with a 2.0 mg dose of AMG504-1
      administered during one visit and a 3.0 mg dose of AMG504-1 administered during the other
      visit. For those randomized to complete two research dosing visits, the dose of intranasal
      glucagon given during each visit will be masked to the participant and study personnel.

      Each dosing visit consists of reducing the plasma glucose level to about 80 mg/dL by
      increasing the basal insulin infusion rate on the insulin pump or by an intravenous (IV)
      infusion of regular insulin diluted in normal saline.  The insulin infusion will be stopped
      once the plasma glucose is &lt;80 mg/dL.  Five minutes after stopping the insulin infusion,
      participants will be treated with either glucagon given intranasally (either 2.0 mg or 3.0
      mg for participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years of age or 3.0 mg for those 12.0 to less than
      17.0 years of age) or by intramuscular (IM) injection (1 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting
      solution for those 55 lbs or more and 0.5 mg constituted in 1 mL of diluting solution for
      those who weigh less than 55 lbs) in the quadriceps muscle of the leg.

      Blood glucose levels and adverse events will be carefully monitored for 90 minutes
      post-dosing. After a wash-out period of 7 days or more, participants 12.0 to less than 17.0
      years of age will return to the clinic and the procedure repeated with each participant
      crossed over to the other treatment. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to
      have 2 dosing visits will also return to clinic and repeat the procedure with a different
      dose of intranasal glucagon given. Participants 4.0 to less than 12.0 years assigned to a
      single dosing visit do not return for a second dosing visit.
