      Background:

      - An earlier study on child development focused on the relationship between children and
      their caregivers (usually mothers). It looked at how this relationship influenced children's
      social and mental development. It also studied how these children related with family
      members and friends. Researchers are now interested in expanding the study with the same
      group of children. They want to look at these children, who are now young adults, and focus
      on their current romantic relationships. This new study will look at how child development
      affects the formation of stable, mature romantic relationships in young adulthood. Original
      child study participants and their significant others will be included in the new study.
      Only participants who are living together with a partner will be studied.

      Objectives:

      - To look at romantic partnerships in a childhood study   s original participants and their
      significant others.

      Eligibility:

        -  Participants of the 88-CH-32 study who are at least 18 years of age.

        -  Significant others of the study participants who are at least 18 years of age.

        -  Original participants and significant others must be cohabiting (living together).

      Design:

        -  No screening tests will be required for this study. No study visits will be needed.
           Samples will not be collected.

        -  Original study participants will fill out four online questionnaires. They will be on a
           National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHHD) website. They will
           ask personal questions about relationships with the current romantic partner and other
           important people. The questions will take about 25 minutes to answer.

        -  Significant others will fill out 13 online questionnaires. They will be on a NICHHD
           website. They will ask personal questions about the romantic partner and other
           important people. The questions will take about 1.5 hours to answer.

        -  All participants will receive a small amount of money for completing the study.

      The purpose of this study is to expand our ongoing longitudinal study (study 88-CH-32) by
      gathering information about romantic partnerships from both the longitudinal study   s now
      young adult target children, who were 5 months old when the study began and are now as old
      as 23 years of age, and their significant others.  Because the target children are
      approaching the age when they form lasting romantic relationships, we wish to track these
      partnerships as they form.  With these data, we will be uniquely suited to identify how key
      individual and inter-personal factors at distinct points of development (i.e., childhood,
      adolescence, and young adulthood) influence the formation of stable, emotionally intimate,
      mutually dependent romantic relationships during young adulthood.  In particular, we aim to
      disentangle the influence of childhood and adolescent interpersonal experiences in other
      relational spheres (i.e., relationships with parents and friends) from the influence of
      contemporary characteristics of both members of the romantic dyad.  As part of our
      examination, in addition to relationship quality, we focus on the strength of each dyad
      member   s attachment to his or her parents as well as each other, thereby allowing for the
      examination of attachment transfer, an important yet understudied characteristic of
      successful romantic relationship formation.

      Only cohabiting (whether married or otherwise) young-adult romantic dyads that include a
      target child from our existing longitudinal study (dyad N equals 250; 500 young adults
      overall, all volunteers) will be eligible to participate in this new data collection.  By
      limiting eligibility in this way, we will have data extending back to infancy for one member
      of each young-adult romantic dyad.  All data collected will be collected via a secure,
      password-protected website.

      As part of our on-going longitudinal study, we already collected (or will collect)
      individual information from the young adult target children (mental health, attachment
      style, attachment strength, personality, substance use).  We propose here to collect
      complementary individual information from the significant others of young adult target
      children as well as dyad-level information (relationship satisfaction and household
      functioning) from both members of the cohabiting romantic dyad. Combined with existing data
      from our longitudinal study, these new data will enable us to move beyond most current
      research focused on the developmental antecedents of successful young adult romantic
      relationships and examine how an individual   s past interpersonal experiences interplay
      with the contemporary characteristics of both young-adult romantic dyad members to influence
      the state of the romantic dyad.

        -  INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Among the young adult target children from study 88-CH-32 (N = 250), those with
        significant others are eligible to participate in this study, as are their significant
        others. However if a target child   s significant other is a minor (i.e., under the age of
        18), that significant other will not be eligible to participate.
