(Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)\n\n        -  Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the objective response in patients treated with the established MTD of this\n           regimen.\n\n        -  Determine time to tumor progression and survival of patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients in the phase II portion of the study are\n      stratified according to age (under 60 vs 60 and over), ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2),\n      and extent of resection (total vs subtotal). (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)\n\n      Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by\n      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for a maximum of 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin and irinotecan until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is\n      determined, additional patients are accrued to receive carboplatin and irinotecan at the\n      recommended phase II dose. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)\n\n      After chemotherapy, all patients undergo radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed for 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-107 patients (3-54 for phase I and 21-53 for phase II) will\n      be accrued for this study. (Phase I closed to accrual as of 6/24/02)"
