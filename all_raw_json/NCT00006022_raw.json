Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to\n      kill tumor cells. Combining bryostatin 1 with interleukin-2 may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 plus\n      bryostatin 1 in treating patients who have melanoma or kidney cancer that cannot be removed\n      during surgery."

Patients are randomized to one of three\n      bryostatin 1 dose levels.\n\n      Patients receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily on days 1-5 and bryostatin 1 IV over 1\n      hour on day 1 weekly for 3 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
