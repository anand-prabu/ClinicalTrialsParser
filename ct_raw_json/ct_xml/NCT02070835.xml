    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer is one of the refractory wounds and always poses many challenges in
      clinical practice. This study was conducted to have a prospective, randomised, controlled
      study compare the safety and efficacy of the ReCell® technology with skin graft (experiment
      group) with split-thickness skin graft (STSG, control group) alone on treating diabetic foot
      ulcers.

      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effectiveness and safety of ReCell®
      with skin graft (experiment group) vs. skin graft (control group) for the treatment of
      non-healing diabetic foot ulcers. Our hypothesis is that the methods of experiment group is
      better than the control group.
