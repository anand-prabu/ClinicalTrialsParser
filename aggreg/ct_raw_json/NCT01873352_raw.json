Full systemic anticoagulation will be instituted as per standard hospital procedures to a target ACT of approximately 300 seconds or greater. Intravascular ultrasound may be used to assist in the positioning of study catheters during the procedure. The AF ablation procedure will be performed using a cryoballoon ablation catheter. Complete pulmonary vein isolation will be the goal of the ablation procedure and PV isolation must be confirmed by a multielectrode mapping catheter within each PV. Pulmonary vein isolation is the only intervention. A cavo-tricuspid isthmus line may be placed in patients with either a history of ECG-determined typical flutter or induced typical flutter during the procedure.",
