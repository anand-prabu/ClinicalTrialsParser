            "textblock": "This study is designed to test the safety and effectiveness of a combination of two vaccines\n      for influenza. One of these vaccines will be the seasonal influenza vaccine 'Viroflu'\n      ('Inflexal V'). The second will be an investigational viral vectored vaccine called MVA\n      NP+M1. The rationale for combining these two vaccines is that they work differently and that\n      by combining the two vaccines, stronger and broader immune responses may be produced.\n\n      The MVA NP+M1 vaccine has been evaluated in five previous clinical trials. In total, over 80\n      volunteers have received this vaccine. There have been no vaccine related serious adverse\n      events. Higher doses of MVA NP+M1 are more reactogenic, however at the dose to be used in\n      this study the majority of adverse events are mild.\n\n      20 volunteers will be recruited in this study. They will all be adults over the age of 18.\n      Volunteers will be assigned to one of two groups. Volunteers in group 1 will receive\n      Viroflu, followed by a dose of MVA NP+M1. Volunteers in group 2 will receive Viroflu\n      followed by a placebo injection (saline). Volunteers will be blinded so that they do not\n      know which group they have been allocated to and will be asked to complete diary cards\n      listing any adverse events after vaccination.\n\n      Vaccinations will be administered into the thigh as the deltoid muscle is not normally large\n      enough to accept two intramuscular injections.\n\n      Volunteers will followed up for 6 months in total. Two days after vaccination they will\n      receive a telephone call from one of the clinical team. They will then attend three follow\n      up visits (at weeks 1, 3 and 26). At each visit, volunteers will have blood tests taken and\n      will be questioned about any adverse events they may have experienced."
