  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A major reason for the substantial underuse of pharmacological prevention of migraine is its
      inadequate efficacy, since only ~50% of patients respond to a specific agent. There is
      currently no evidence-based way to identify the patients that will respond to a specific
      preventive treatment. Amitriptyline is one of the commonest agents used for migraine
      prevention, strengthening patient's pain inhibitory capacity. Individual tailoring of
      analgesics according to pain inhibitory capacity has been shown effective by our group for
      painful diabetic neuropathy patients. Specifically, patients with reduced pain inhibition
      capacity gained more from a drug that augment pain inhibition as compared to those with
      efficient inhibitory capacity. The investigators now propose to assess migraineurs for their
      pain inhibition capacity, and examine whether, along similar reasoning, those with reduced
      inhibitory capacity are the ones more likely to respond to amitriptyline. Psychophysical and
      neurophysiological dimensions of pain inhibitory modulation will be assessed in migraineurs,
      who will, subsequently, receive either amitriptyline or placebo for 8 weeks, in a randomized
      two arms parallel double blind design, and followed up for attacks reduction. The
      investigators expect to identify the best predictors for efficacy of migraine prevention by
      the study drug. This approach will promote individualization of migraine therapy.
