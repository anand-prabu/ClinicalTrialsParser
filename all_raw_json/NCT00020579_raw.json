Courses repeat every 2 weeks (every 2-week\n      schedule). Alternatively, patients receive oral MS-275 once on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 (weekly\n      schedule). Courses repeat every 6 weeks. Treatment for both schedules continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-275 on the every 2-week schedule\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. Once the MTD for the every 2-week\n      schedule is determined, patients receive treatment on the weekly schedule as above. The MTD\n      is then determined for the weekly schedule. The MTD for both schedules is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which at least 2 of up to 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Once the MTD is determined for the weekly schedule, up to 3 additional patients\n      are accrued to receive MS-275 at the MTD of the weekly schedule.\n\n      Disease status is assessed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50-75 patients will be accrued for this study."
