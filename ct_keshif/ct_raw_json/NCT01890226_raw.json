            "textblock": "Poor quality of medical care is a major contributor to excess medical morbidity and\n      premature mortality in persons with serious mental illnesses (SMI). To address this problem,\n      community mental health providers are increasingly partnering with safety net medical\n      providers to develop behavioral health homes, integrated clinics in which persons with SMI\n      receive coordinated medical and mental health care. However, behavioral health homes have\n      faced logistical and privacy challenges in integrating electronic medical records across\n      organizations.\n\n      This application proposes to develop and test a mobile Personal Health Record (mPHR) to\n      overcome this problem while more fully engaging patients in their health care.  The study\n      will develop, test, and disseminate the mPHR. The investigators will develop the app\n      building on experience and preliminary data from a PC-based PHR project, and link it to the\n      medical and mental health EHR in a behavioral health home. Next, the investigators will\n      conduct a randomized trial of the mPHR in 300 subjects randomized to the mPHR or usual care."
