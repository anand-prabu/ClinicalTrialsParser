  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in pregnancy (gestational diabetes) is becoming more common.  It can lead to
      problems for both mothers-to-be and their babies such as causing a large baby and difficult
      birth. Gestational diabetes in the mother may also lead to effects on the long term health
      of the baby.

      Most people today use mobile phones. Our research is looking at using a mobile phone app to
      help with  diabetes care in pregnancy. In particular, the investigators are using phones
      which connect to the standard blood glucose monitoring machines given to all women with
      gestational diabetes to see if sending the hospital team blood test results between clinic
      appointments can result in the need for fewer clinic visits.  The investigators are also
      testing to see how acceptable using mobile phones in this way, is to our patients and that
      the control of the blood glucose and outcomes for the mother and baby are at least as good
      as standard care.

      The investigators are planning to recruit 200 women who receive care for their gestational
      diabetes at the Oxford University Hospitals NHS (National Health Service)  Trust. They will
      be randomised so that 100 will receive standard care, and 100 will have a mobile phone &quot;app&quot;
      linked to the blood glucose machines to send blood glucose readings directly to the diabetes
      care team to review.

      Both groups will be asked to test their blood glucose levels at home regularly with a
      glucometer.  All participants will also be given lifestyle advice to reduce the chance they
      will need medication. Blood glucose control will be measured also by the percentage of
      glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at the time of diagnosis of gestational diabetes and before
      delivery.
