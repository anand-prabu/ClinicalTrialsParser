To determine if local control may be improved\n      with increasing doses of SRS. (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the risk of acute and long-term toxicity with increasing dose of SRS. (Phase\n      II) II. To determine if there is increased neurocognitive toxicity with increased dose of\n      SRS.\n\n      III. To determine the rate of radiation necrosis/steroid dependency. IV. To determine if\n      quality of life is affected more by tumor recurrence versus radiation necrosis. This\n      includes assessment of progression free survival, overall survival, local failure, and\n      number of patients who receive bevacizumab, laser interstitial thermal therapy, or surgery\n      for presumed radiation necrosis.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study followed by a phase II study.\n\n      Patients undergo SRS guided by computer tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI).\n\n      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up at 1-2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months,\n      every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 4 months thereafter."
