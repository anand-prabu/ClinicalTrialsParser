  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the project is to investigate the clinical efficacy of management of early
      caries lesions by resin infiltration, which may be imaged through a SFE laser optical device
      comparable to radiographic results.

      Objective: The hypothesis to be tested is that Icon performs similarly to an established
      prevention strategy for early caries (Oral hygiene instruction and topical fluoridation) for
      caries arrest; and caries progression may be imaged through a SFE laser optical device.

      Materials and Methods: The investigators propose a pilot study of Icon vs. control including
      Oral Hygiene Instructions (OHI) and topical fluoridation for early caries arrest in primary
      molars.  Lesion depth will be performed through standard-of care methods, i.e. radiographs
      and visual exams, plus a novel optical device based on scanning fiber endoscope (SFE)
      technology for laser light imaging for early caries detection in pediatric populations.  The
      investigators will utilize SFE laser optical device prototypes developed by the University
      of Washington's Human Photonics Lab (HPL), a device already in human use for other
      applications, including imaging and cancer screening.

      Clinical Significance:  This controlled trial will assess the positive effects of white spot
      infiltration  by ICON and may open a new therapeutic strategy in paediatric dentistry.
      Additionally, this study would be one of the first in vivo dental applications of the SFE
      optical device, and would add a novel early caries visualization technique to the
      armamentarium for detecting caries progression.

    <description>We propose a randomized, blinded, clinical study of Icon vs. Control (Oral Hygiene Instruction [OHI] and topical fluoridation) as early caries interventions for caries arrest in pediatric populations. 50 participants with 2 or more active, non-cavitated early caries lesions, or areas of demineralization, in proximal surfaces of primary molars will be enrolled in this study.  Early caries lesions with demineralization seen on occlusal surfaces will be excluded from participation, along with white spot lesions from hypoplasia or fluorosis.</description>

    <description>Currently no single method for caries detection can be used on all tooth surfaces under all conditions. These diagnostic devices and methods lack sensitivity and specificity; with caries detection at a point when surgical or restorative intervention is required.  Additionally, these optical imaging devices are cumbersome, and often lead to inaccuracy due to user failure. Ultimately, these approaches result in caries lesions diagnoses overlooked at the earliest stages when less invasive measures, including remineralization techniques such as Icon, may be effective. Clinical caries detection sensitive to early lesions would bring about innovations in treatment modalities through medicinal therapeutic and preventive approaches, including chemotherapeutic approaches such as Icon.  An imaging system such as the SFE optical device, specifically designed for dentistry, would be the ideal approach.</description>
