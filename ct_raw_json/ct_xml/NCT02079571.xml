  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), hot- and cold-attribute of food ingredients are a
      major part of dietary therapy. &quot;Eight Principles&quot; including cold/hot, repletion/vacuity,
      yin/yang and exterior/interior are used for diagnose by Chinese medical doctors. From the
      perspective of TCM, all constitutions, diseases, herbal medicine and foods can be divided
      into these two major categories, i.e., cold and hot. Therefore, dietary therapy claims that
      the attributes of foods should be used to oppose our constitutions in order to harmonize
      organ functions and maintain human vitality. The true benefit of dietary therapy is
      considered to be the reestablishment of a harmonious balance between cold and hot, or
      repletion and vacuity, within the human body.

      Previous studies reported that the capillary red blood cell (RBC) velocity in nail fold
      microcirculation (NFM) of the subjects with hot constitution accelerated significantly after
      taking the hot attribute aged ginger tea, which might be the result of elevated vagal
      activity leading to arteriole dilation in these subjects. In contrast, in subjects with cold
      constitution, capillary RBC velocity decelerated significantly and skin temperature
      decreased markedly after taking the cold-attribute coconut water, which might have been
      induced by sympathetic nerve activation causing the arteriole to be constricted. As a
      result, the use of capillary RBC velocity of NFM measured by laser Doppler anemometer may be
      a promising way to classify attributes of food ingredients commonly used in Chinese medicine
      dietary therapy in accordance with different personal constitutions.

      Accordingly, it will be a worthwhile task to establish a modern scientific methodology to
      define the attributes of food ingredients. The aim of this project is to investigate the
      relationship between food attributes and the physiological signals produced in healthy young
      subjects with different constitutions. In the first year of this project, investigators are
      starting to determine the pulse waves produced in healthy subjects with different
      constitutions by a Smart Pulse Wave Health Evaluation System (S-PULSE). Then, investigators
      will investigate the relationship between food attributes, channel entries and the
      physiological signals. Hopefully, the results will have a leverage on the powerful
      integration capacity within National Taiwan University (NTU) campus to build a hub for
      global TCM cloud.
