    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that repository corticotropin injection in combination with other
      biologic agents will be able to provide relief of both rheumatoid arthritis and acute
      exacerbations of rheumatoid arthritis for patients with disease that had inadequately
      responded to biologics previously.

    <textblock>
      Although there are many types of treatment for rheumatoid arthritis (RA) currently
      available, some patients have disease that is refractory to treatment and cannot achieve
      remission. The objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of subcutaneous
      injections of repository corticotropin as an adjunct therapy in patients with active RA who
      have had an inadequate response to at least two biologic agents as well as a third agent
      they are currently receiving.
