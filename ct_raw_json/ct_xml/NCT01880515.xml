  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      1. Advanced NSCLC have a poor prognosis and the positive impact of chemotherapy is limited
           by the development of intrinsic and acquired resistance.

        2. Over the past decade, less toxic agents such as the innovative targeted therapies, i.e.
           erlotinib or gefitinib, have the potential to improve the effectiveness and keep a good
           quality of life with a low toxicity

        3. BIBW 2992, an aniline-quinazoline, is an EGFR and HER-2 irreversible inhibitor, and it
           has activity against erlotinib-resistant isoforms having mutations in EGFR and HER-2

        4. This molecule have shown benefits as a single agent in pre-treated patients who have
           progressed despite platinum-based chemotherapy, with a minimal toxicity compared to
           chemotherapy

        5. BIBW 2992 is associated with adverse effects similar to those for erlotinib and
           gefitinib, such as rash and diarrhea. These symptoms can reduce the quality of life in
           patients and lead to inconsistent EGFR inhibitor dose administration

        6. There is no a standard treatment for rash, but case reports have tried to demonstrate
           the benefit obtained with alcohol-free emollients, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or
           antibiotic (topic or oral) treatment such as clindamycin or doxycycline,
           anti-inflammatory drugs such as steroids and isotretinoin in the treatment of these
           cutaneous injuries.

        7. In order to reduce the incidence and severity of cutaneous toxicities, we will compare
           the prophylactic antibiotic treatment using tetracycline and general dermatological
           recommendations versus using only dermatological recommendations, in patients
           initiating the treatment with BIBW 2992

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Case reports have tried to demonstrate the benefit obtained with alcohol-free emollients
      used 2-3 times daily, sunscreen with titanium dioxide or zinc oxide with a SPF greater than
      15, antibiotic (topic or oral) treatment (such as clindamycin, metronidazole, tetracyclines)
      secondary to infection and steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (betamethasone, triamcinolone)
      and isotretinoin in the treatment of these cutaneous injuries.

      The objective for this project is to evaluate whether prophylactic treatment with
      tetracycline can reduce dermatological occurrences such as rash, induced by EGFR and HER-2
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor BIBW 2992 in patients with non-small cell lung cancer, and improve
      the patient's quality of life.
