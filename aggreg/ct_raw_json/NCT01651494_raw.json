The secondary objective is to\n      investigate the pharmacokinetic and immunologic profile of DAS181 encapsulated dry powder\n      dose to dose and compared to placebo when administered by oral inhalation using a DPI in\n      healthy adults. A total of 9 subjects, healthy male and female subjects, ages 18 to 45 years\n      will be enrolled. Subjects will be randomized 2:1 ratio, wherein 6 subjects will receive the\n      active drug and 3 subjects will receive placebo. Subjects may be replaced if a subject\n      withdraws within 7 days (Day 9) after receipt of the final study drug dose."
