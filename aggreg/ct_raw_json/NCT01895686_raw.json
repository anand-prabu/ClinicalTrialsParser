Patient information was not available to doctor during\n      gonioscopy. One eye of each patient was imaged using both Visante and Cirrus OCT. Imaging\n      was performed under scotopic and photopic conditions and obtained from horizontal (3:00 and\n      9:00 o'clock) and vertical (6:00 and 12:00 o'clock) meridians. The same experienced\n      independent examiner performed all Cirrus measurements.  Visante was performed by 3 trained\n      technicians using same protocol.\n\n      OCT images were exported and masked to be evaluated for presence of open or closed anterior\n      chamber angle. Masked images were presented with no other patient information available to\n      two examiners with glaucoma training working together to score on basis of iridocorneal\n      angle as, closed (0 degree), high possibility (10 degree), medium risk (20 degree), and low\n      or no risk (> 30 degree)."
