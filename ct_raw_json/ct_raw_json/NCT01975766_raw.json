This diet begins 2 days before chemoradiation and continues\n           through at least 5 weeks of chemoradiation.\n\n        -  Have blood drawn for research purposes weekly to determine measurements of oxidative\n           stress\n\n        -  Have urine collected sporadically through the study to determine measurements of\n           oxidative stress\n\n        -  Keep a diary of concomitant medications, side effects, and blood sugars\n\n        -  Have follow-up to monitor for outcomes and overall survival"
