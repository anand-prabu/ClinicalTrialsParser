Radial artery injury will be quantified pre- and post-\n      angiography using Optical Coherence Tomography. The participants will also have radial\n      endothelial function assessed using flow-mediated dilatation at baseline, 24 hours, one\n      week, one month and three months post- angiography. Blood will be taken pre and 24 hours\n      post angiography for characterisation of endothelial progenitor cell numbers and function.\n      The hypothesis is that trans-radial catheterisation will cause a reduction in flow-mediated\n      dilatation which peaks at 24 hours and recovers at three months. The investigators hope to\n      correlate the rate of this recovery with peri-procedural progenitor cell numbers."
