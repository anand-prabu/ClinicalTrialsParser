For study chemotherapy, patients will be randomized between cisplatin or the\n      combination of docetaxel and cetuximab. Subjects will be stratified depending on HPV status\n      and the presence of ERCC-1 [4F9] in the tumor prior to randomization.  The study will\n      evaluate cisplatin vs. docetaxel-cetuximab in the overall population, and test which\n      radiation and chemotherapy combination works best in relationship to how much ERCC-1 [4F9]\n      is expressed in a tumor."
