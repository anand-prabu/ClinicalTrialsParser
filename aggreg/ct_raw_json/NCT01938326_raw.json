Furthermore, the report on early\n      experience of SIDG, which has no incision except umbilicus port, is going to be published.\n\n      However, there've been no objective reports and data on real minimal invasiveness and\n      benefits between 2 procedures. In this study, I would like to find out the benefits of the\n      reducing port and wound size by comparing the above 2 procedures' immune response and\n      postoperative complications.\n\n      This study is planned as a phase II study.\n\n      There are no references on this subject, so the investigators set the numbers of each groups\n      into 30, which is minimal requirement for the parametric comparisons."
