Unfortunately, treatment favors\n      certain complications, including infectious and neoplastic. These represent a major cause of\n      mortality in these patients. If the frequency of skin cancer is greatly increased in this\n      population, that of solid tumors remains a concern. Approximately 20% of patients develop\n      cancer after 10 years of graft , half non- skin cancers, the main risk factor is\n      immunosuppressive therapy .\n\n      The aim of the study is to evaluate, in a large population of patients treated in 4 regions\n      ( the Nord-Pas de Calais, the Upper and Lower Normandy and Picardy) risk factors (in\n      particular the nature of the immunosuppressive treatment) of developing a neoplastic\n      complication, skin cancers and solid tumors, after renal transplantation."
