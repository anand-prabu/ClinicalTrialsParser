            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) is a major cause of genital herpes. It can also cause\n      serious infection in newborns and in people with weakened immune systems. It increases the\n      risk of getting an HIV infection and of spreading HIV to someone else. Therefore, a vaccine\n      that could prevent genital herpes could improve the general health of the world   s\n      population. Researchers want to study whether a new vaccine, HSV529, which may be used in\n      the future to prevent herpes infections, is safe.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test whether a new herpes vaccine is safe.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Healthy adults 18   40 years old.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have 3 vaccination visits, 7 follow-up visits, and 3 follow-up phone\n           calls over 1 year.\n\n        -  Each vaccination visit will last about 4 hours.\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam.\n\n        -  Participants will have a blood sample taken.\n\n        -  Participants will be given the vaccine or a placebo, by injection from a needle. They\n           will be monitored for 30 minutes to check for any allergic reaction.\n\n        -  Participants will be given a diary card to record any symptoms they may feel later.\n\n        -  At follow-up visits, participants will give a blood sample and answer health questions.\n\n        -  In the phone calls, participants will answer health questions."

We will study a\n      replication-defective HSV-2 vaccine, HSV529, that is deleted for 2 essential viral proteins,\n      that can infect, but not replicate in normal cells. The goals of the study are to determine\n      (a) the safety of HSV529 vaccine in persons with or without HSV infection, and (b) the\n      ability of the vaccine to elicit immune responses to HSV-2 including virus-specific\n      antibodies and T cell responses to the virus. Three groups of 20 subjects each will be\n      randomized and will receive 3 doses of HSV529 (15 subjects per group) or saline placebo\n      injection (5 subjects per group). Each subject will be followed for 6 months after the last\n      dose of vaccine. The 3 groups will be (a) subjects who were infected with HSV-2 in the past\n      but may or may not have been infected with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/-/HSV-2+), (b) subjects who have\n      been infected only with HSV-1 (HSV-1+/HSV-2-), and (c) subjects who have not been infected\n      with HSV-1 or HSV-2 (HSV-1-/HSV-2-). Vaccine or placebo will be administered on Day 0 and\n      approximately 1 month and 6 months after enrollment."

Persons who have close contact with infants or immunocompromised individuals agree to\n             avoid such contact for 3 days after each injection.\n\n         12. Subject must be either HSV-1 IgG antibody positive or negative and HSV-2 IgG antibody\n             positive, HSV-1 IgG antibody positive /HSV-2 IgG antibody negative, or HSV-1/HSV-2\n             IgG antibody negative as determined by an available commercial immunoassay.\n\n         13. Subject must be willing to allow storage of blood, swabs of skin or mucosa, biopsies\n             of skin lesions, or, for female subjects, cervicovaginal secretions for future\n             research.\n\n        Participation of Women:\n\n        Contraception: The effects of HSV529 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this\n        reason, females subjects must be of non-childbearing potential i.e. either surgically\n        sterilized (bilateral tubal ligation, hysterectomy) or, if of child-bearing potential and\n        sexually active with a male partner, she must be willing to use a highly effective method\n        of contraception (e.g., intrauterine device (IUD); oral contraceptives diaphragm or condom\n        in combination with contraceptive foam, jelly or cream; Norplant, DepoProvera,\n        contraceptive skin patch or cervical ring) for at least 30 days prior to vaccination and\n        until 1 month after final vaccination or be in a monogamous relationship with a male\n        partner who has undergone a vasectomy at least 6 months prior to first dose of study\n        agent.

Study staff should\n        be notified of co-enrollment as it may require the approval by the Principal Investigator.\n\n        An individual fulfilling any of the following criteria is to be excluded from trial\n        enrollment:\n\n          1. Subject is pregnant or lactating OR planning to become pregnant timeframe that begins\n             30 days prior to the first vaccination and ends 30 days after the third vaccination.\n\n          2. Body Mass Index greater than 40.\n\n          3. Participation or planned participation in another clinical trial investigating a\n             vaccine, drug, medical device, or medical procedure in the 4 weeks preceding the\n             first trial vaccination or during the study period up to 6 months after the last dose\n             of vaccine or placebo. The non-interventional follow-up for an earlier study (e.g.,\n             long-term surveillance) will be allowed.\n\n          4. Severe active infection or serious HSV-2 related or unrelated medical conditions\n             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would prevent study completion.\n\n          5.

A history of herpes gladiatorum, herpetic whitlow or eczema herpeticum.\n\n          8. A history of lesions caused by HSV on either arm.\n\n          9. A history of herpes-associated erythema multiforme.\n\n         10. A history of a clinically significant autoimmune disorder.\n\n         11. Known or suspected congenital or acquired immunodeficiency\n\n         12. Receipt of anti-cancer chemotherapy or radiation therapy within the preceding 6\n             months.\n\n         13.

An\n             immunosuppressive dose of corticosteroids is defined as greater than or equal to 10\n             mg prednisone equivalent per day for greater than or equal to 14 days.\n\n         14. Subjects without a spleen.\n\n         15. Subjects receiving immunoglobulin within the past 6 months or anticipated receipt of\n             immunoglobulin during the 28 days following vaccination.\n\n         16. Bleeding disorder, or receipt of anticoagulants that, in the opinion of the\n             Investigator, would interfere with the subject   s participation in the trial.\n\n         17. Prior vaccination against herpes simplex virus.\n\n         18. Known allergy or intolerance to vaccine components [e.g., potassium glutamate\n             (possible cross-reaction to monosodium glutamate), sucrose] or to a vaccine\n             containing any of the same substances.\n\n         19. Deprived of freedom by an administrative or court order, or in an emergency setting,\n             or hospitalized involuntarily.\n\n         20. Current alcohol abuse or illicit drug use or addiction.\n\n         21. Chronic illness that, in the opinion of the Investigator, is at a stage where it\n             might interfere with trial conduct or completion.\n\n         22. Employee of the NIH or contractors working at the NIH, with direct involvement in the\n             proposed study or other studies under the direction of the Accountable Investigator\n             (Dr. Jeffrey Cohen) or of the PI (Dr. Lesia Dropulic), as well as family members\n             (i.e. immediate, husband, wife and their children, adopted or natural) of the\n             employee or of the investigators of this study.\n\n         23. A temperature greater than or equal to 38.0 (Infinite)C (greater than or equal to\n             100.4 (Infinite)F ) or a significant illness on the day of vaccination.\n\n         24. Any condition that the PI thinks might compromise the person   s ability to comply\n             with the requirements of the study.\n\n        Justification for Exclusion of Women and Children:\n\n        Exclusion of Women:\n\n          -  Pregnancy: Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of HSV529\n             on the developing human fetus are unknown with the potential for teratogenic or\n             abortifacient effects.\n\n          -  Breast-feeding: Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in\n             nursing infants secondary to vaccination of the mother with HSV529, breastfeeding\n             should be discontinued if the mother will be vaccinated with HSV529.\n\n        Exclusion of Children:\n\n        Because there are insufficient data regarding dosing or adverse events available in adults\n        to judge the potential risk in children, children are excluded from this study."
