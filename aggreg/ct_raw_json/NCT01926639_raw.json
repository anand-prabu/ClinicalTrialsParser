To mimic the environment in infected tissue, selected\n      tumor-affected lymph nodes are treated locally with a single dose of 8 Gy radiotherapy and\n      injected with therapeutic antibody (anti-CD20/Rituximab). Later, dendritic cells (DC) are\n      injected into the damaged tumor tissue together with a stimulatory cytokine (GM-CSF) to\n      initiate an immune response. Patients with untreated or relapsed stage III/IV follicular\n      lymphoma not in need of standard therapy receive intra-tumoral injections of low-dose\n      anti-CD20 antibodies (5 mg) on days 1 and 3 and local radiotherapy on day 2.  On days 4 and\n      5, dendritic cells generated from monocytes isolated from the patients blood are injected\n      into the site together with the stimulatory cytokine GM-CSF administered subcutaneously.\n      Additional lymph nodes are treated similarly after 2 and 4 weeks. The treatment is thus\n      performed three times, targeting different lymphoma nodes. The primary aims are to induce\n      tumor-specific immune responses and clinical responses."
