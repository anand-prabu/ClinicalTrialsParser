    <textblock>
      The immunostimulatory properties of mushrooms have been recognized for centuries, and
      &quot;medicinal&quot; mushrooms are still widely used in alternative medicine all over the world.
      Although a number of fungal components have been implicated in these properties,
      Beta-glucans have attracted the most attention. However, although Beta-glucans are widely
      used as a health food supplement, their immunomodulatory effects after administration in
      humans have not yet been determined.

    <description>The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the systemic effects of orally administered Beta-glucan on innate immune responses of leukocytes. The effects of Beta-glucan will be determined by measuring the ex vivo responsiveness of leukocytes to various inflammatory stimuli as a surrogate marker of the antimicrobial response</description>
