            "textblock": "The broad, long-term objective of our proposed research is to understand the oral health\n      status, oral health-related behaviors, and quality of life in the US population of patients\n      with systemic sclerosis (scleroderma or SSc). SSc is a rare, progressive connective tissue\n      disease that affects predominately women (3.8:1) with a higher risk of the severe form among\n      African-Americans. SSc adults experience manifestations of the systemic disease that include\n      microstomia, xerostomia, and impaired manual dexterity. The two specific aims of this study\n      are: 1) to characterize the oral health status of adults with SSc, and 2) to determine the\n      SSc disease specific manifestations (microstomia, xerostomia, and manual dexterity\n      impairments) that are associated with the severity of oral health problems and oral\n      health-related quality of life among adults with SSc. This first study of US adults with SSc\n      is a cross-sectional survey of 250 adults with SSc in South Carolina. This population is 25%\n      African-American which is similar to the racial distribution of SSc in the US adult\n      population. Data collection includes information on: oral health status (periodontal,\n      dental, mucosal and microbial), oral manifestations of SSc (size of oral aperture, severity\n      of oral dryness, and manual dexterity for oral hygiene), and oral health-related behaviors\n      and quality of life. The oral health status of the South Carolina SSc population will be\n      compared to that of the adult US population based on an analysis of corresponding measures\n      using the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2002 data. Multivariable\n      regression modeling will be used to evaluate hypothesized risk and protective factors that\n      are associated with oral health status in adults with SSc. Results of this study in South\n      Carolina will be used in regional efforts for the development of interventions for improved\n      oral health status of adults with SSc. Second, these results will provide the basis for a\n      larger US study of oral health problems of adults with SSc."
