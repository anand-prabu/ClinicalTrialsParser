            "textblock": "1. The first aim of this Database Registry is to maintain a prospective multicenter series\n           of patients treated surgically for adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. Patients from\n           multiple scoliosis centers around the U.S., as well as a center in Germany, will be\n           enrolled with comprehensive analysis of the curve pattern being treated, as well as the\n           type of surgery performed. The outcome of each surgical treatment will be analyzed.\n           This will allow the frequency of various curve types to be determined, as well as the\n           frequency of various surgical approaches utilized for each curve pattern.\n\n        2. The second aim is to determine if operative outcomes vary based on the surgical\n           approach utilized in scoliosis correction. In this analysis, it is anticipated that\n           specific approaches can be identified to be most appropriate for given scoliotic curve\n           patterns. In addition, the variations within individual curve patterns will be\n           analyzed, as will specific variations in the surgical approach (e.g., distal level of\n           instrumentation, hooks versus screws, hook patterns, etc).\n\n        3. The third aim is to develop an algorithm to guide surgical decision making based on a\n           scoliosis curve classification scheme that will allow the surgeon to provide the best\n           overall outcome (radiographic, functional, cosmetic) for a given patient with\n           idiopathic scoliosis.\n\n        4. The fourth aim is to evaluate the long-term outcomes of surgical intervention in this\n           patient population.\n\n        5. The final aim is to maintain a prospective multi-center series of patients with\n           idiopathic scoliosis who have not undergone surgical correction of their deformity. The\n           long-term outcome of this patient population will be compared with the surgical patient\n           population."
