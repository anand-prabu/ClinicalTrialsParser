            "textblock": "Irritable larynx syndrome (ILS) is a hyperkinetic laryngeal dysfunction that is\n      characterized by a persistent cough, voice changes, or breathing difficulties, which are\n      often triggered by an irritant. Diagnosis of ILS is difficult and typically made via a\n      thorough review of the clinical history and, occasionally, the patient's reaction to an\n      odor-provocation test. Standard treatment for ILS is behavioural therapy with a speech\n      language pathologist (SLP), which provides symptom improvement for most patients. However,\n      currently, there are no objective measures of the upper airway hyper-responsiveness in this\n      condition to assist in diagnosing and monitoring disease severity.\n\n      Since the cough is irritant-based, it is anticipated that patients with ILS will have a\n      hypersensitivity to the irritant capsaicin. Capsaicin is the active component of chili\n      peppers and is what makes them hot. The capsaicin cough challenge is a well recognized test\n      that involves inhaling different concentrations of capsaicin solutions to determine a cough\n      reflex sensitivity.\n\n      The purpose of this research study is to confirm that ILS patients have a hypersensitivity\n      to capsaicin compared to healthy volunteers. If a hypersensitivity is observed in ILS\n      patients, the second objective of this study will be to see if behavioural therapy improves\n      the cough reflex sensitivity in this patient population."
