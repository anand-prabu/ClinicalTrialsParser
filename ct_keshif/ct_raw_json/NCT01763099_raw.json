            "textblock": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (auto-HSCT) are considered the standard\n      of care for many malignancies, such as lymphoma, myeloma and some leukemias, and so on.\n      Graft failure after auto-HSCT is a formidable complication. It occurs in 2-9.5% of patients\n      and is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality related to infections and\n      hemorrhagic complications. There are various options for the management of graft failure.\n      The most common treatment of graft failure is growth factors such as granulocyte\n      colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF)and recombinant erythropoietin,but it usually effective in\n      the short term and no effect on platelet counts.\n\n      Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are a form of multipotent adult stem cells that can be\n      isolated from bone marrow (BM), adipose tissue, and cord blood. Clinical applications of\n      human MSCs are evolving rapidly with goals of improving hematopoietic engraftment,\n      preventing and treating graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after allogeneic hematopoietic stem\n      cell transplantation and so on.As an important source of hematopoietic stem cell, cord blood\n      has been widely used in clinical practice. It is reported that cord blood combined with MSCs\n      can increase engraftment after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.  However,\n      to our knowledge, the report about efficacy of treatment of graft that develops after\n      auto-HSCT using expanded BM-derived MSCs from a third-party donor combined with cord blood\n      is absent.If such treatment could be shown to be effective and safe, BM-derived MSCs could\n      potentially be used as an universal donor material. This would have a major impact because\n      the generation of donor-specific MSCs is time-consuming, costly, and often impractical if\n      the clinical status of a patient is urgent.\n\n      In the present study, the investigators will prospectively evaluate the efficacy and safety\n      of ex-vivo-expanded BM-derived MSCs from third-party donors or MSCs combined with cord blood\n      in treating patients with graft failure after auto-HSCT."
