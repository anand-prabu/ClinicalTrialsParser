Dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) during the first 4 weeks of treatment (cycle 1).\n\n      II. Maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BYL719 (PI3K inhibitor BYL719) given in combination with\n      letrozole.\n\n      III. Highest tolerated dose - ability to tolerate BYL719 with letrozole for a total of 8\n      weeks without development of:\n\n        -  Hyperglycemia (fasting glucose > 200 mg/dL) for more than 2 weeks in a row despite\n           optimal medical treatment\n\n        -  CTC Grade 3 or > rash for more than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical treatment\n\n        -  CTC Grade 2 or > GI toxicity for more than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical\n           treatment\n\n        -  CTC Grade 2 or > serum creatinine, bilirubin, AST, ALT elevation from baseline for more\n           than 2 weeks in a row despite optimal medical treatment\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: To determine the anti-tumor effect of the combinations of endocrine\n      therapy with BYL719 in post-menopausal patients with hormone receptor-positive metastatic\n      breast cancer by assessing:\n\n      I. Progression free survival (PFS). II. Objective response rate (ORR). III. Clinical benefit\n      rate (complete response [CR]+partial response [PR]+stable disease [SD] >= 6 months).\n\n      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Pharmacokinetics of BYL719 in combination with letrozole: Plasma concentration-time\n      profiles and derived basic pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of BYL719 and letrozole,\n      including but not limited to area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero\n      to the last measurable concentration (AUC0-tlast), AUC curve to infinite time (AUC0-inf),\n      maximum observed concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (Tmax), clearance over\n      bioavailability (CL/F), apparent volume of distribution (Vz/F) and the terminal half-life\n      (t1/2) and other PK parameters if deemed appropriate.\n\n      II. Correlation of response with alterations of the PI3K pathway: Mutational analysis of\n      PIK3CA (exons 9 and 20), phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN), and AKT1 in formalin-fixed\n      paraffin blocks (FFPB) from previous surgeries or fresh-frozen biopsies (if available) on\n      all patients enrolled in the trial.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label phase Ib dose-escalation study of the PI3K inhibitor BYL719\n      in combination with letrozole in post-menopausal patients with ER+ metastatic breast cancer.\n\n      Patients receive BYL719 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and letrozole PO QD. Courses repeat\n      every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."
