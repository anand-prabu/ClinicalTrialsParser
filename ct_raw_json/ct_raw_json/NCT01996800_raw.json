These articulations in the spine that are amenable to spinal manipulative therapy include the z-joints, the atlanto-occipital, atlanto-axial, lumbosacral, sacroiliac, costotransverse and costovertebral joints.\nA neuromuscular re-education program will consist of repetitive movements, posturing, and stimulation designed to reinforce nerve signals for functional movements.  It is theorized that when the nerve signals are \"retrained\" and appropriate muscle movements are repeated, movement patterns become automatic again.  Neuromuscular re-education is usually done along with other types of treatment to promote functional muscle movement."

Spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) in conjunction with neuromuscular reeducation will\n           reduce the presentation of autistic symptoms in children.\n\n        3.
