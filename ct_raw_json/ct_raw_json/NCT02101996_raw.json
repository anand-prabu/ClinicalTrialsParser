Saturated fats can be\n      cleared and used in skeletal muscle, but in obese individuals, biomarkers of saturated fat\n      are found in the blood, along with markers of poor muscle metabolism.\n\n      Both fats and amino acids are processed by the same metabolic pathways in muscle, and the\n      investigators hypothesize that meals with greater amounts of saturated fat slow muscle\n      metabolism. A better understanding of the interaction of these to metabolites will allow for\n      the development of future medications to treat muscle loss in sick individuals and the\n      elderly."

Overweight/obese insulin resistant (n=10, BMI 26-35 and glucose infusion < 4.0\n             mg/min)\n\n          3. 30-50 years of age\n\n          4. Men and pre-menopausal women\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Insulin resistance is defined by insulin clamp as the rate of glucose infusion \u2264 4.0\n             mg/min.\n\n          2. BMI over 35 kg/m2\n\n          3. Abnormal thyroid function, kidney or liver disease\n\n          4. Uncontrolled hypertension, or occasional or regular smoker, use of medications or\n             supplements that interfere with lipid, protein, or carbohydrate metabolism\n\n          5. Pregnancy (urine test), breast feeding an infant, or anemia\n\n          6. Alcohol intake:  Males >140 g/week, Females > 70 g/week.\n\n          7. Fasting plasma triglycerides >300 mg/dL.  Extreme hypertriglyceridemia could be due\n             to either elevations in very low-density lipoproteins or chylomicrons, either of\n             which would impair our ability to resolve dietary metabolic processes.\n\n          8.
