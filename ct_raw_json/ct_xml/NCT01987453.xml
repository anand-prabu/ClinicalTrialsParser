      This study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
      fixed-dose combination (LDV/SOF FDC) with or without ribavirin (RBV) in participants with
      chronic genotype 1 hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection who have participated in a prior
      Gilead-sponsored HCV treatment study, and who did not achieve sustained virologic response
      (SVR24), defined as HCV RNA &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 24 weeks after last dose
      of study drug.
