The sample size is limited by the number of pedal desks being built\n      for this pilot study and the need for timely data generation. Although the investigators can\n      stagger starts as needed, all participants must intend to be on campus for the subsequent 6\n      weeks after they start the intervention. Two cohorts of 10 participants will complete the\n      three 2-week conditions in the following order: 1) SELF-DIRECTED use where participants have\n      access to their daily recorded data but will not have any other form of feedback or\n      goal-setting; 2) FACILITATED use where participants are provided with their daily recorded\n      pedal desk data and additional daily behavioral support from an interventionist (e.g.,\n      feedback and goal-setting) to increase their use of the pedal desk by an individually\n      negotiated and agreed upon amount; 3) FACILITATED use with PEDOMETER where participants will\n      be provided with their daily recorded pedal desk and step count data and additional daily\n      behavioral support from an interventionist (e.g., feedback and goal-setting) to increase\n      their use of the pedal desk by an individually negotiated and agreed upon amount and\n      increase their step count by 3,000 steps/day compared to baseline. Participants will be\n      asked to pedal at a sustainable and self-selected pace while using the pedal desk."
