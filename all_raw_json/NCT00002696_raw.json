Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil (5-FU) IV on days 1 and 8 and doxorubicin IV and\n           cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV on day 1 (FAC). Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 3\n           courses in the absence of disease progression.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive CTX IV, methotrexate IV, and 5-FU IV on days 1 and 8 (CMF).\n           Treatment continues every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression.\n\n      Patients on both arms with resectable disease after the third course of chemotherapy undergo\n      quadrantectomy with axillary node dissection (preferred) or modified radical mastectomy,\n      followed by 6 additional courses of chemotherapy on the arm to which they were randomized\n      initially. Those patients without distant metastasis undergo locoregional radiotherapy\n      beginning concurrently with the initiation of postoperative chemotherapy. Patients on both\n      arms with unresectable disease after the initial 3 courses of chemotherapy undergo\n      locoregional radiotherapy and then surgical resection (if feasible).\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then monthly thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3-4 months for 2 years, every 4-6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
