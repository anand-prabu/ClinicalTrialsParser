In this study, doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg, or 100mg are planned\n      and will be given orally every 12 hours for 10 days.  Therefore, there is a possibility of\n      clinically significant absorption of study drug.  If any significant safety signals (See\n      Section 8.5.3 Halting Rules) are encountered, the investigators will notify DMID who will\n      determine the need for an ad hoc SMC review.  For the purposes of this study, \"Ad hoc\"\n      simply means unscheduled which may be held at any time throughout the study per DMID's\n      discretion.  If deemed appropriate by halting rules and/or DMID's discretion enrollment will\n      be halted for an ad hoc SMC meeting.  Decision to resume the study after halting will be\n      determined by DMID in consideration of the SMC recommendations.   The dose for Cohort B and\n      study progression and dose escalation to Cohorts B and C will require a full (planned) SMC\n      review of all safety data obtained through Day 18.  Should safety data review of the 200 mg\n      dose result in an unfavorable safety profile, the study design allows for reduction in dose\n      to 100 mg to be given in Cohort B.  If this is the case, there will be no Cohort C.  Each\n      subject will receive oral doses of CRS3123 or placebo. Up to 30 healthy male and female\n      subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive. The primary objective: of the study is to determine the\n      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration of\n      multiple doses to healthy adults.
