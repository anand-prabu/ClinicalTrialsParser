The annual mortality\n      of dialysis patients is ~ 23% compared to <0.1% in the U.S. general population (1) . Even\n      kidney transplant recipients have a substantially higher mortality (~7%) compared to the\n      general population. Consequently, the life-expectancy of dialysis and transplant populations\n      is much lower than that of the general population. Cardiovascular events are the leading\n      cause of death in dialysis patients and malnutrition is also a strong risk factor for death\n      (2). In the current proposal, we are planning to develop a prospective registry of incident\n      dialysis patients at the University of Utah dialysis program to examine cardiovascular and\n      nutritional factors in dialysis patients. This registry will include clinical and\n      administrative data. In addition, we plan to store blood samples for future analyses."
