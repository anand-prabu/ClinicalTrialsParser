However, these devices do not take account of the\n      compression of the mattress, which results in overestimation of CC depth. This study is the\n      validation study to demonstrate that a new method using one  accelerometer(U-cpr) is useful\n      to overcome this limitation and thus measure compression depth more accurately when\n      performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on patients."
