Determine the maximum tolerated dose and toxicities of intraperitoneal\n      adenoviral p53 gene therapy in patients with advanced, recurrent, or persistent ovarian\n      carcinoma. II. Evaluate the vector pharmacokinetics and biologic efficacy of gene transfer,\n      gene expression, and cell death in these patients. III. Determine the immunologic response\n      to therapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of adenoviral p53 gene therapy. Patients undergo\n      removal of ascites, if present, from the peritoneal cavity followed by a bolus infusion of\n      adenovirus p53 once a week for 3 consecutive weeks, followed by a 2 week rest. Treatment\n      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients who experience palliative results with at least stable disease may continue\n      treatment weekly without the rest period. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each level\n      of adenovirus p53. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose level below that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients who receive the MTD\n      without unacceptable toxicity may continue to receive treatment on a weekly basis.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-20 patients will be accrued over 16-18 months for this\n      study."
