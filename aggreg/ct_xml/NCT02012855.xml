  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The increase in fat (i.e. triglyceride) in the blood after a meal is a well-established risk
      factor for heart disease (Nordestgaard et al. 2007). Endurance exercise is beneficial for
      improving the blood lipid response to a subsequent meal; that is, the appearance of fat
      (triglyceride) in the blood is less after a meal if endurance exercise was performed shortly
      before (i.e. within half a day) of the meal (Petit et al. 2003). This benefit of exercise is
      unfortunately negated if the after-exercise food choice to replace the calories expended
      during exercise is one containing high glycemic index carbohydrates. For example, if a high
      glycemic index carbohydrate is consumed after an evening exercise session, the exercise no
      longer has an effect of lowering triglyceride in the blood after a meal consumed the next
      morning (Harrison et al. 2009; Burton et al. 2008). Very rarely do people perform an
      exercise session and then fast until their next meal hours later. The more common practice
      is to consume food immediately after the exercise to enhance recovery and because hunger is
      stimulated with exercise. Consuming carbohydrate with a low glycemic index has been shown to
      reduce the level of fat in the blood following a subsequent meal (Gruendel et al. 2007). To
      date, no studies have examined the effects of consuming a low-glycemic index meal after
      exercise on the blood fat response to a subsequent meal. The specific objective of our
      research is to determine the effect of consuming low glycemic index lentils after an
      endurance exercise session on the blood fat (triglyceride) response to a subsequent meal.
      Twenty-five overweight or obese men will have their blood triglycerides measured four times
      over six hours after a high-fat morning meal following four different conditions, in a
      randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over design (i.e. the 25 subjects will each participate
      in all four conditions, where the order of conditions for each person is randomized): 1)
      After exercise (90 minutes of moderate intensity walking) is performed the evening before,
      followed by caloric replacement with a high-glycemic index meal (i.e. white bread and
      instant mashed potatoes); 2) After the same exercise is performed the evening before,
      followed by caloric replacement with a lentil-based meal; 3) After the same exercise is
      performed the evening before, followed by fasting; 4) After a no exercise/ no meal condition
      (i.e. control condition). In addition to measuring blood triglycerides we will measure blood
      insulin, free fatty acid, high density lipoproteins, low density lipoproteins, and glucose
      levels as these are also related to cardiovascular disease risk and may be altered with
      exercise and lentil consumption. We will also measure the muscle's ability to burn fat (i.e.
      fat oxidation) by assessing respiratory gases (oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide output)
      after the high-fat meal because we expect exercise and lentils to increase fat oxidation.
      Our expected results are that consuming lentils after endurance exercise will lower the
      blood triglyceride response to a subsequent meal compared to exercise alone or when
      high-glycemic index carbohydrates are consumed after the exercise.
