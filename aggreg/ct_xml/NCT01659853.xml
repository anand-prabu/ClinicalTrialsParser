    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and assess the safety of CD07805/47 gel
      0.5% applied topically once daily versus azelaic acid gel 15% applied topically twice daily
      in subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult subjects with moderate to severe facial erythema of rosacea who meet
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized at Baseline/Visit 1 in a 1:1 ratio to
      receive either CD07805/47 gel 0.5% once daily or azelaic acid gel 15% twice daily for 15
      days. Following an appropriate washout period, subjects will then switch treatments and use
      the second investigational product as instructed for 15 days (according to the subject's
      randomization scheme). Subjects will re-qualify based upon inclusion/exclusion prior to
      Period 2 treatment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is male or female aged 18 years or older.

          2. Subject has a clinical diagnosis of facial rosacea.

          3. Subject has a clinician's assessment score of moderate to severe erythema prior to
             enrollment.

          4. Subject has a self assessment score of moderate to severe redness prior to
             enrollment.

          5. Subjects with none to mild facial inflammatory lesions of rosacea prior to
             enrollment.

          2. Subjects with a condition or who are in a situation, which in the Investigator's
             opinion may put a subject at risk, may confound study results, or may interfere with
             a subject's participation in the study.

          3. Subjects with conditions causing facial erythema which would confound the assessment
             of treatment.

          4. Subjects who are taking or have recently taken medications known to have interactions
             with α2-adrenergic agonists.
