Most authors recommend surgical treatment for patients whose fracture shows signs\n      of instability: 50% loss of vertebral body height, kyphosis with more than 30 degrees,\n      involvement of more than 50% of the spinal canal. The authors advocate that this type of\n      treatment uses the shorter hospital stay, early patient mobility, better kyphosis\n      correction, the possibility of spinal canal decompression and prevention of neurological\n      deterioration, as arguments in its favor.However, observational studies in patients without\n      neurological deficit, showed no difference in long-term functional outcomes in patients with\n      this type of injury, regardless of the type of treatment used (surgical or conservative).\n      This study will express the clinical results and morphological changes of the thoracic and\n      lumbar spine, at a minimum follow-up of 24 months, comparing the findings of the patients\n      undergoing surgical treatment with those found in undergoing conservative treatment."
