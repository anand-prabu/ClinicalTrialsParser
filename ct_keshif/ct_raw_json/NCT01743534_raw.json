To prevent the lack of therapeutic solutions, for these\n      evolutionary diseases, the new plan Alzheimer 2008-2012 encourages the research.\n\n      The insanities deprive gradually the individual of their autonomy, their personality and\n      their identity. The help of an institution is sometimes inevitable. In the middle of this\n      stressful environment, the patient affected by severe insanity, need marks.\n\n      The aspect of their old objects, significant for them, has to be prioritized because the\n      institutional universe, often depersonalized doesn't mean anything for them. In front of\n      repeated failures, they're hurt in their self respect.\n\n      The prevention of the undernutrition, comes by a preservation of praxis and pleasure at\n      table. The institutional plate used in certain hospital sectors, is unpersonal (rectangular,\n      divided) and can be destabilizing for the mentally ill person."
