      1. The number of MSM who are tested for HIV in the 4 study clinics over 12 months will
           increase  compared with historical data from the same 4 clinics over the past 12 months
           prior to the intervention.

        2. Persons diagnosed with HIV over the duration of 12 months will have higher CD4 counts
           at diagnosis than persons diagnosed with HIV over the past 12 months prior to the
           intervention

    <measure>(Primary) phase I: The number of MSM who are tested for HIV in 4 study clinics over 12 months will increase significantly compared with historical data from the same 4 clinics over the past 12 months prior to the intervention</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The effect of intervention on the monthly number of MSM who receive HIV testing prior to and after intervention at 4 clinics will be evaluated using a generalized estimating equation (GEE) model with robust variance estimates to account for correlation in outcomes within a clinic</description>

    <measure>Phase II: A higher proportion of participants in the intervention arm will obtain their CD4 results and ART eligibility assessment in a CDC clinic within 1 month of being diagnosed with HIV than in the comparison arm experienced a local standard of care.</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The proportion of participants randomized to the intervention arm who obtain their CD4 count results within 1 month of randomization will be compared to the same proportion in the comparison arm using logistic regression. The primary analysis will adjust for the following baseline covariates: clinic, CD4 count, ART eligibility, self-reported drug abuse, self-reported alcohol abuse, and age.</description>

    <measure>Phase I: Persons diagnosed with HIV over the duration of 12 months will have higher CD4 counts at diagnosis than persons diagnosed with HIV over the past 12 months prior to the intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We will compare the distribution of CD4 counts immediately after HIV diagnosis for all MSM diagnosed with HIV at one of the 4 clinics for the 12 months during the intervention period versus the 12 months prior to the intervention using a Wilcoxon rank sum test</description>

    <measure>Phase II:A higher proportion of ART eligible participants in the intervention arm will receive their first HIV medical care within 3 months of diagnosis than in the comparison arm.</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A logistic regression analysis will be performed to assess the association between intervention and timely receipt of first HIV medical care among those who are ART eligible (CD4&lt;350). The analysis will adjust for the following baseline covariates: clinic, CD4 count, self-reported drug abuse, self-reported alcohol abuse, and age.</description>

      HIV RNA will be extracted from plasma and the HIV PR and RT genes will be amplified by a
      one-step RT-PCR using TaKaRa One Step RNA PCR Kit . The quality of sequences will be
      evaluated using Sequence Scanner v1.0, and the sequences will be cleaned and assembled by
      Sequencher (Gene Codes Corporation, Ann Arbor, MI,USA).

        Inclusion Criteria:• Men who had sex with another man in the last 12 months based on
        self-reporting (sex can be defined as oral, anal, or mutual masturbation)(including

          -  Living and/or working in the defined districts of municipal Beijing;

          -  Able and willing to adequately grant informed consent. For the purposes of this
             activity participants must consent to questionnaire surveys, receipt of phone
             messages, and serological testing;

          -  Having not previously participated in HIV testing in this study.

        Besides these criteria, additional criteria for the HIV Linkage and Care pilot Research
        Clinical Trial are:

          -  Men who are being identified as HIV positive during the testing campaign in Phase I
             of the study;

          -  No plan to leave Beijing in the next 12 months.

          -  Willing to comply with study procedures.

          -  Having a cell phone and willing to receive study related SMS texts

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Having previously been found to be HIV positive based on self-reporting during eligibility
        screening;

          -  Serious psychological disturbance or cognitive impairment interfering with the
             participant's ability to comply with the study visit schedule and procedures, as
             judged by the local study clinician;

          -  Any other medical or psychiatric condition that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             would make participation in the study unsafe, or otherwise interfere substantially
             with the study objectives or interpretation.
