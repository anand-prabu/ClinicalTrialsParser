  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PBD are a rare group of inherited disorders due to the failure to form functional
      cellular peroxisomes. Most patients have progressive hearing and visual loss, leading to
      deafness and blindness, as well as neurological deterioration. There are no therapies for
      this disorder. A misfolded protein with residual function, PEX1-Gly843Asp, represents one
      third of all mutant alleles. Using patient cell lines with this mutation, we reported the
      recovery of peroxisome functions by treatment with Betaine, acting as a nonspecific chemical
      chaperone for the misfolded PEX1 protein. Betaine, or trimethylglycine, is a Health Canada
      and FDA approved orphan drug for the treatment of homocystinuria and is used by us safely
      and regularly in genetic medicine. We will perform a 6 month pilot study with 12 patients to
      test the hypothesis that Betaine, at recommended doses, can recover peroxisome biochemical
      functions in blood.

    <textblock>
      Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are a group of inherited conditions caused by faulty
      assembly of peroxisomes, structures located  inside cells that regulate levels of important
      fats and lipids in the body. When there is faulty peroxisome assembly, as in PBD, these
      important fats and lipids either accumulate or are not made. These changes result in
      abnormalities of organ formation that a child is born with, such as changes in bone, brain
      and eye formation. There is no specific treatment for these disorders, and management is
      supportive. In order to complement existing supportive therapies, physicians and researchers
      are still actively looking for new treatments acting on the root cause of PBD: the
      peroxisome function. To identify drugs that help recover peroxisome function a group of
      scientists have developed a test to be used in laboratories, aiming at reviewing the
      activity of the large number of potential treatments.

      Using this test, they have uncovered that Betaine can improve the function of the
      peroxisome, when the defect is caused by a PEX1-Gly843Asp mutation, and as such may improve
      the overall health of child suffering from PBD.

      Betaine is a medication already available as a powder for oral solution, for another rare
      disease. It is approved in many countries, including Health Canada for Canada and the Food
      and Drug Administration for the USA. Paediatric genetic physicians are used to prescribing
      this medication and know it well.

      At the current stage of scientific knowledge, it is a critical next step to evaluate the
      benefit of betaine in children having a PBD due to a PEX1-Gly843Asp mutation, to ensure that
      the medication is safe and to measure the level of improvement of the function of the
      peroxisome.

      Thus, the principal objective of the study is to determine the improvement in the key
      peroxisome functions (plasma very long chain fatty acid profiles red cell plasmalogen
      levels, plasma pipecolic acid levels and plasma bile acid profiles). Another objective is to
      measure the growth of your child and his / her development.
