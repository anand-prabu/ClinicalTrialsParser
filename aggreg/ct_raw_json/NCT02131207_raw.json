MRI is a procedure in which radio waves\n      and a powerful magnet linked to a computer are used to create detailed pictures of areas\n      inside the body. This diagnostic procedure may aid in identifying lesions in the prostate\n      which may have cancer. The lesions can then be targeted during the prostate biopsy to\n      improve the accuracy of identifying prostate cancer."

Identification of one of more lesions suspicious for prostate cancer using a novel MRI\n      protocol, not identified by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) alone and to determine if the\n      lesions identified by MRI demonstrate clinically significant prostate cancer based on\n      pathologic findings (ie. Gleason >= 7 or percentage of core involved with cancer > 50%).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Average time for MRI scan per patient. II. Correlation of lesions on MRI to radical\n      prostatectomy specimens. III. To determine whether MRI 3 dimensional (3D) T2 half-Fourier\n      acquired single turbo spin-echo (HASTE) or sampling perfection with application optimized\n      contrast using different flip angle evolutions (SPACE) protocols provide improved rates of\n      prostate cancer detection.\n\n      IV. Yield of additional clinically significant prostate cancer diagnoses based on MRI\n      targeted lesions on biopsy.\n\n      V. Rate of benign pathology identified by MRI (i.e. false positives). VI. To compare costs\n      associated with the use of MRI over TRUS biopsy alone.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Participants undergo pelvic MRI. Within 1-2 weeks, patients undergo scheduled prostate\n      biopsy."
