In Denmark, Centors criteria and the Streptococcal antigen test\n      (Strep. A-test) are gold standard in the diagnostic process of streptococcal acute\n      tonsillitis. Although the sensitivity and specificity of the Strep. A-test is biochemically\n      high, its clinical reliability is reduced due to several influential factors. Moreover,\n      studies suggest that 4-10% of patients are tested false-negative based on clinical criteria\n      and the Strep A-test.\n\n      Fusobacterium necrophorum are suspected to be the cause of acute tonsillitis in teenagers\n      and young adults (5-15%). However, there is no rapid test available for this bacterium.\n      Since tonsillar surface swab is not included in the  diagnostic standard, family physicians\n      get no information about infection due to Fusobacterium necrophorum or other pathogens.\n\n      C-reactive protein, leukocyte count and absolute neutrophil count as diagnostic markers are\n      examined with variable results. Procalcitonin is a relatively new marker of bacterial\n      infection, which has the advantage of more rapid and specific induction compared to the\n      other markers."
