            "textblock": "Despite advances in medications, allergic diseases, including allergic asthma continue to\n      rise in prevalence.  For this reason, there is a need for a better understanding of the\n      mechanisms of allergic diseases and novel insights into modulating allergic inflammation.\n      The investigators hypothesize that much remains to be learned about the behavior of T\n      effector and T regulatory cells in allergic disease.  Furthermore, the investigators\n      hypothesize that novel mechanisms of allergic tolerance may exist, and elucidation of these\n      mechanisms may provide insights into novel therapeutic strategies to control allergic\n      diseases.  The investigators will investigate the capacity for T cell tolerance induction in\n      allergic subjects by a novel type of immune tolerizing dendritic cell (it-DC).  The\n      investigators will assess whether in vitro generated it-DCs have the capacity to induce\n      antigen-specific T regulatory cells and suppress allergen-specific T effector cell function\n      in vitro.\n\n      Standardized Cat Allergen extract and Dust Mite Allergens will be used to generate changes\n      in the airways that occur during exposure to allergen.  For this investigation, the route of\n      administration will be topical application of the titrated allergen to a bronchoscopically\n      isolated subsegment of one lobe of one lung.  The dose of biologic will be determined from\n      prior skin-prick testing."

            "textblock": "This is a single-center, open-label, controlled mechanistic study before-and-after allergen\n      instillation study that uses each subject as his/her own control.  Reliability of study\n      measurements of expression is accomplished by comparing repeated measurements.  Additional\n      controls are provided by measuring the expression of markers known to have stable\n      expression, including cell structural proteins and chemokine markers that the investigators\n      know are induced in this experimental paradigm from our previous studies.  This is an\n      investigational study.  Subjects will receive an investigational product, either\n      Standardized Cat Allergen Extract or Standardized Dust Mite Allergen (Dermatophagoides\n      farinae or D. pteronyssinus).   No subject will be given a placebo.  There are 2 cohorts,\n      allergic asthmatics (AA) and healthy controls (HC).  The main comparisons will be\n      measurement of primary and secondary outcome measures in: (1) diluent versus\n      allergen-challenged segments of the lung in each asthmatic subject and (2) comparison of\n      these responses in allergic asthmatics (AA) and healthy controls (HC).\n\n      The investigators will enroll 10 AA subjects and 5 HC subjects.  There will be no\n      randomization.  The choice of allergen will be determined by allergy skin testing.  When a\n      subject is allergic to both cat and dust mite, one will be selected with a goal of having a\n      representative sample of cat and dust mite challenges in each cohort. The 10 allergic\n      asthmatic (AA) subjects will undergo SAC with either standardized cat or mite allergen.\n      These subjects will also donate 200 ml of blood on two occasions separated by a minimum of 8\n      weeks and not more than 12 weeks.   The HC subjects will undergo preliminary screening tests\n      and provide 200 ml of blood for DC and T cell studies on two occasions separated by a\n      minimum of 8 weeks and not more than 12 weeks.  The HC subjects will not undergo\n      bronchoscopy, bronchoalveolar lavage, or segmental allergen challenge."
