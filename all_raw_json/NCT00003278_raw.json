Courses repeat\n      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month after radiotherapy, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6\n      months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years."
