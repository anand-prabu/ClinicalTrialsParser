      The purpose of this study is to evaluate quality of life, degree of disability, treatment
      patterns and economic impact of hand and knee Osteoarthritis and Rheumatoid Arthritis in
      Mexico.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative disease of multifactorial etiology,
      characterized by the gradual loss of the cartilage to articulate. It is a question of one of
      the most common rheumatic disorders in the population, is the most habitual reason of pain
      and disability in the major adults and the first reason of surgeries of replacement to
      articulate. In Mexico, in a study of national area, the prevalence of locomotives
      manifestations was 26 %, with predominance in the women. Nowadays criteria exist for the
      classification of the OA, based on epidemiological studies, for the knee, the hip and the
      hand. Basically they have been established to homogenize studies of clinical epidemiological
      type. In other hand, the Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, chronic, systemic
      disease that has more prominent manifestations in the diartrodiales joints. The disease have
      a wide range of characteristics, from the progressively chronic disease with variable
      degrees of destruction to articulate up to the extra-articular manifestations clinically
      evident. Demographically, the RA is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and
      affects approximately 0.5 to 1 % of the world population, with an economic impact comparable
      with arterial coronary disease. The National Institute of Geographical Statistics (INEGI)
      thinks that in Mexico the population of major adults will double in the next decades, for
      what the impact of these rheumatic disorders will be serious and will turn into a problem of
      public health.

      Based in the previous information, the Mexican Initiative of Patients with OA and RA
      (IMPACTAR), will on patient interview to increase the knowledge regarding the number of
      affected adults and the current treatment strategies.

      This will be the first Mexican  Registry related with Osteoarticular diseases.

        The Registry will include male and female patients older than 18 years with knee and/or
        hand OA and/or RA diagnosis according with the American College of Rheumatology criteria.
        It will include consecutive outpatients that are treated in any of the participant
        specialties of the study (orthopedics, rheumatology, internal medicine, rehabilitation
        medicine).
