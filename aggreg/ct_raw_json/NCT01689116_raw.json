Screening ECG renders measurement of QT interval in lead II imprecise (for example:\n             flat T waves, arrhythmias);\n\n         10. Subjects who have a screening supine blood pressure (BP) outside 90\u2212145 mm Hg\n             systolic or 45\u221295 mm Hg diastolic (measured following at least a 10-minute rest).\n             Blood pressure may be re-tested twice in the supine position at intervals of 5\n             minutes. The pressure elevation is considered sustained if either the systolic or the\n             diastolic pressure exceeds the stated limits after three assessments and the subject\n             may not be randomized;\n\n         11.

Positive test results for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 or 2 antibody at\n             screening;\n\n         16. Any condition possibly affecting absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of\n             drugs that may confound the analyses conducted in this study (for example: previous\n             surgery on the gastrointestinal tract that includes removal of parts of stomach,\n             bowel, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, venocaval shunts, or transjugular intrahepatic\n             portosystemic shunts]);\n\n         17.

Evidence of hepatic or biliary dysfunction including elevation of total bilirubin,\n             direct bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT),\n             gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), or alkaline\n             phosphatase levels to greater than the upper limit of normal (ULN) at screening;\n\n         19. Abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including neutrophil count < 1500\n             cells/mm3, Hgb < 11 g/dL in females or < 12 g/dL in males, platelet count < 90,000\n             cells/mm3, creatinine \u2265 1.5 X ULN, albumin \u2264 3 g/dL, serum amylase or lipase \u2265 1.5X\n             ULN at screening;\n\n         20. Positive test results for hepatitis B virus antibody, or hepatitis C virus antibody\n             at screening;\n\n         21. Use of or need for any prescription or non-prescription systemic drug(s) including\n             vitamins or herbal preparations other than drugs used for contraception, aspirin,\n             acetaminophen, or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, within 10 days before\n             Study Day -1 or during the study;\n\n         22. Use of aspirin, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents, or acetaminophen within 5\n             days prior to Study Day -1;\n\n         23. Consumption of alcohol- or caffeine-containing compounds within 24 hours before Day\n             -2 visit;\n\n         24. Consumption of citrus juice within the 7 days before Day -2 visit."
