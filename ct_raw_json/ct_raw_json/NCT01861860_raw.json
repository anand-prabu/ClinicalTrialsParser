            "textblock": "Rationale IVUS has shown to be efficient for bare metal stent deployment, but has not been\n      specifically studied for Drug Eluting Stents. The angiographically versus IVUS optimization\n      (AVIO) study was performed with (medical device's type )Promus stent, results are promising,\n      but the study was not designed for clinical endpoint.\n\n      There is no consensus on IVUS criteria for stent deployment. The MUSIC criteria were widely\n      used in the early 2000, but have limitations for complex long lesions. The AVIO criteria\n      were recently proposed for complex lesions, but these criteria also have some issues and the\n      complexity make their routine use challenging.\n\n      We performed a pilot study for long complex lesion analysis using IVUS, in order to define\n      easy to use criteria, applicable for complex lesions in drug eluting stents (DES) era. The\n      new criteria (OPERA) are an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria.\n\n      OTELLO study is an ongoing trial sponsored by Boston Scientific Inc, to determine Major\n      Adverse Cardiac Event with the new TAXUS Element stent. 500 patients will be enrolled in the\n      study.\n\n      Main question Is IVUS using simplified new criteria beneficial for long (>28mm) TAXUS\n      element stent deployment?\n\n      Study design This study will consist to prospectively include consecutive patients with>28mm\n       taxus element stent using IVUS. OPERA Criteria for stent deployment will be the objectives\n      to reach. OPERA is an adaptation of the MUSIC criteria for long complex lesion. The patients\n      from the OTELLO study, with the same inclusion criteria,  will composed the control group .\n      Population will be matched using the propensity score.\n\n      20 to 30 French centers involved in OTELLO study will be contacted for participating in\n      OPERA.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      Long lesion percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI) have specific characteristics like\n      Diffuse old atheroma Calcifications Discrepancies between prox and distal diameter\n      Infiltration longer than the target lesion Bifurcations Inhomogeneous strength due to the\n      balloon (Laplace law) Primary hypothesis Long Taxus element deployed using IVUS and OPERA\n      criteria have better outcomes than without IVUS\n\n      Primary Objectives 38% MACE (SAT, target lesion revascularization (TLR), myocardial\n      infarction (MI), Death) reduction  using IVUS and OPERA criteria for Taxus element \u2265 28 mm\n      implantation\n\n      Secondary endpoint\n\n        1.
