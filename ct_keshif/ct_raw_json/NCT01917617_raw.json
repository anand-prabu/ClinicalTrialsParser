In many institutions in Japan, GC therapy is performed over 3 hours or more,\n      longer than original method in the ABC-002 trial. Oral rehydration therapy is a therapy that\n      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration\n      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good\n      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Oral rehydration therapy (ORT) is a therapy that\n      performs prevention or treatment of dehydration by the ingestion of oral rehydration\n      solution, which is adjusted the concentration of the electrolyte and glucose to absorb good\n      efficiency from the gastrointestinal tract. Many reports suggest ORT may substitute for\n      infusion therapy. Herein, the investigators planned the study to examine the safety of\n      replacing the fluid infusion by oral rehydration expecting to shorten the time to drip."
