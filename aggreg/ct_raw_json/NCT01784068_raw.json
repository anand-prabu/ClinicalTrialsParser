Patients with Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) at the end of this phase will enter the Treatment-Free Remission (TFR) phase where no treatment is given. Non eligible patients will enter the continuation phase of the study. Patients with MRD at the end of the continuation phase will enter the TFR-2 phase of the study where no treatment is given. Non eligible patients will enter the prolonged continuation phase of the study. If at any time during TFR or TFR-2 the patient loses MMR, nilotinib treatment will be immediately re-initiated (nilotinib 300 mg BID)."
