  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
      This increased risk is thought to be driven by inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction,
      an initial step in atherogenesis. Treatment with TNFalpha inhibitors (TNFi) improve
      endothelial function in patients with RA. Discontinuation of  TNFi could therefore worsen
      endothelial function even in the absence of recurrence of  systemic inflammation or
      reactivation of arthritis. If stopping TNFi results in worsening of endothelial function
      this would strongly suggest  a higher cardiovascular risk in association with TNFi-wthdrawal

      Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
      This increased risk is thought to be driven by inflammation-induced endothelial dysfunction,
      an initial step in atherogenesis. Both systemic as well as local (intra-arterial) treatment
      with  anti-TNF-antibody  therapy improves endothelial function in patients with vasculitis
      or RA as reflected by the vasodilator response to intra-arterially infused acetylcholine.
      Also other vascular functions that are (at least partially) endothelium-dependent such as
      flow-mediated dilation of the brachial artery and pulse wave velocity are improved when
      active RA patients are being treated with methotrexate plus TNFi, i.e. infliximab or
      etanercept. ( Therefore one may hypothesize that when TNFi therapy is stopped, endothelial
      function may worsen even in the absence of recurrence of  systemic inflammation or
      reactivation of arthritis.  Endothelial function tests are a marker of long-term
      cardiovascular mortality. If stopping TNFi results in worsening of endothelial function this
      would strongly suggest  a higher cardiovascular risk in association with TNFi-wthdrawal.
      These findings would indicate an important drawback for stopping TNFi in RA patients.

      To date it is unclear whether the worsening of endothelial function occurs within half a
      year following the (successful) cessation of TNFi, whether this decline occurs
      simultaneously, or prior to RA exacerbation and whether this deterioration process is
      delayed by additional use of statin and/or ACEi.

      To improve cardiovascular prognosis in RA significantly it is important to increase our
      knowledge regarding these processes.
