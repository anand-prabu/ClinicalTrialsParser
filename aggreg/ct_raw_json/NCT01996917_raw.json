For each patient,\n      the final skin layer of one breast will be closed with subcuticular suture while the other\n      breast will be closed with Prineo\u2122. The treatment will be randomized to left or right\n      breast. Therefore, the investigators will have 20 breasts in the suture group and 20 in the\n      Prineo\u2122 group, with each patient serving as her own control.  For this study, the resident\n      will close one side with suture and Dr. Rohde will apply the Prineo. The investigators will\n      perform this study of incision closure under conditions as similar to normal conditions of\n      closure."

            "textblock": "Wound closure with dermal sutures is time consuming and may increase risk of infection and\n      inflammation. Moreover, appearance of the resulting scar depends largely on surgeon\n      technique. Use of the Prineo\u2122 wound closure system may decrease operative time, decrease\n      incidence of infection and inflammation, and improve aesthetics of the resulting scar.\n      Prineo\u2122 has been shown to hold as well as sutures for the first 12-25 days and may reduce\n      closure time of the final skin layer up to 75% in abdominoplasty and breast procedures. The\n      system provides excellent coverage of the wound edge, protecting the incision with a\n      microbial barrier. Cosmetic results in abdominoplasty and breast procedures appear to be\n      equivalent to sutures.\n\n      The main endpoints will be operative time to closure of the final skin layer and\n      patient-rated and blinded observer-rated scar quality. The investigators hypothesize that\n      operative time to closure of the final skin layer using Prineo\u2122 will be faster than\n      operative time to closure using subcuticular suture.  The investigators also hypothesize\n      that subjective and objective scar quality of incisions closed with Prineo\u2122 will be better\n      than those closed with subcuticular suture."
