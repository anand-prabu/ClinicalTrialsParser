            "textblock": "Environmental stress, such as low oxygen availability (hypoxia), has been associated with\n      impaired neuromuscular performance; however, the mechanisms associated with these\n      performance decrements remain unclear. While the majority of research suggests that the\n      observed fatigue is related to the central nervous system, the influence of changes in\n      cerebral blood flow (CBF) and associated changes in cerebral pH (partial pressure of carbon\n      dioxide; PCO2) remains unexamined. In response to hypoxic stress, humans hyperventilate to\n      maintain oxygen consumption, resulting in a hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF and cerebral\n      alkalosis (decreased PCO2). Previous research suggests that hyperventilation induces changes\n      in neural excitability and synaptic transmission; however, it remains unclear if these\n      changes are related to hypocapnia mediated decrease in CBF or cerebral alkalosis or both.\n\n      The purpose of the proposed research program is to examine the influence of changes in CBF\n      and cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function during environmental stress. The research\n      program will consist of 2 separate projects, summarized below in a table outlining the\n      proposed protocols and resultant physiological manipulations. During each manipulation,\n      neuromuscular function will be evaluated and compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions\n      using a repeated measures design.\n\n      The research program will consist of 2 separate projects. Project 1 will examine the changes\n      in CBF and alkalosis by using (a) indomethacin (decrease CBF; no change PCO2) and (b)\n      hypocapnia (decrease CBF; decrease PCO2). Using a similar experimental design, Project 2\n      will examine the change in CBF and alkalosis during hypoxia by using (a) poikilocapnic\n      hypoxia (decrease PO2; decrease CBF; decrease PCO2), (b) isocapnic hypoxia (decrease PO2; no\n      change CBF; no change PCO2) and (c) isocapnic hypoxia + indomethacin (decrease PO2; decrease\n      CBF; no change PCO2). During each manipulation, neuromuscular function will be evaluated and\n      compared to baseline (normoxic) conditions using a repeated measures design.\n\n      Therefore, Project 1 will examine the separate and combined effect of changes in CBF and\n      cerebral alkalosis on neuromuscular function independent of environmental manipulations.\n      Subsequently, Project 2 will examine neuromuscular function during hypoxia while controlling\n      CBF and cerebral alkalosis. It is hypothesized that changes in PCO2 and therefore, changes\n      in cerebral alkalosis will contribute to neuromuscular fatigue independent of changes in CBF\n      and oxygen availability."
