            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  Compare the disease-free survival and overall survival in patients with node-positive\n           or high-risk node-negative operable stage II or IIIA breast cancer treated with\n           docetaxel or paclitaxel after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.\n\n        -  Determine whether the weekly administration of paclitaxel or docetaxel for 12 weeks\n           improves disease-free survival and overall survival when compared with the conventional\n           schedule of every 3 weeks for 4 courses after doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide in this\n           patient population.\n\n        -  Compare the toxic effects of docetaxel and paclitaxel when administered weekly for 12\n           weeks versus every 3 weeks for 4 courses in these patients.\n\n        -  Compare the toxicity of paclitaxel administered every 3 weeks for 4 courses or weekly\n           for 12 weeks to that of docetaxel administered on the same schedules in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      estrogen receptor status (positive vs negative vs unknown), nodal status (0 positive nodes\n      vs 1-3 positive nodes vs 4-9 positive nodes vs at least 10 positive nodes), tumor size (no\n      more than 5 cm vs more than 5 cm vs unknown), and type of prior surgery (mastectomy vs\n      breast conservation surgery). Patients are randomized to one of four treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV every 3 weeks for 4\n           courses (weeks 1-12). Beginning at week 13, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours\n           every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Beginning at\n           week 13, patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Beginning at\n           week 13, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide as in arm I. Beginning at\n           week 13, patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.\n\n      Within 4 weeks after completion of chemotherapy, patients with estrogen and/or progesterone\n      receptor positive tumors receive oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years.\n\n      After completion of all chemotherapy, patients with prior segmental mastectomy receive\n      radiotherapy once daily 5 days per week for 5-6 weeks. Patients with prior modified radical\n      mastectomy may receive radiotherapy after chemotherapy completion at the investigator's\n      discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.27\n      years."
