Test the comparative-effectiveness of the interventions (i.e., website +/- navigator or\n      genetic counseling +/- navigator) in a randomized controlled trial, using colorectal cancer\n      (CRC) cases as the unit of randomization/analysis on adherence to individualized CRC\n      screening recommendations.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Examine the cost effectiveness of the interventions, assessing the effect of the\n      interventions on subgroups (i.e., Lynch syndrome [LS] positive vs. LS negative; probands vs.\n      relatives; older vs. younger patients, etc), and barriers to adherence, as well as how the\n      navigators resolve barriers.\n\n      II. Overscreening will be explored.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 study components based on LS status. Within\n      each component, participants are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      COMPONENT #1 (Lynch Negative Proband and their first degree relatives (FDRs):\n\n      ARM I: Participants access a website to deliver a \"personalized prescription for CRC\n      prevention\" based on age, LS status, cancer history, age of 1st degree relative with CRC,\n      and personal CRC screening history.\n\n      ARM II: Participants access a website as in Arm I and receive the services of a patient\n      navigator to address individual barriers to adhering to the \"personal prescription\" within 1\n      month.\n\n      COMPONENT #2 (Lynch Positive Proband and their FDRs):\n\n      ARM III (Lynch positive proband): Participants use genetic counseling to discuss medical and\n      family history and genetic risk of CRC, including genetic factors such as deoxyribonucleic\n      acid (DNA) mismatch repair genes, autosomal dominant inheritance, cancer risks associated\n      with LS, screening recommendations, and genetic testing.\n\n      ARM IV (Lynch positive proband): Participants use genetic counseling as in Arm III and\n      receive the services of a patient navigator to address individual barriers to adhering to\n      the CRC screening recommendations within 1 month.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 12-14 months."
