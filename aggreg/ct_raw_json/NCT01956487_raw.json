Approximately 36 subjects will receive a 3 single doses\n      of propafenone hydrochloride 425mg, each administered separately, in the fasted state with a\n      7 day washout period between doses.  Propafenone hydrochloride is an antiarrhythmic\n      indicated to prolong the time to recurrence of symptomatic atrial fibrillation in patients\n      with episodic (most likely paroxysmal or persistent) atrial fibrillation who do not have\n      structural heart disease.  A follow-up visit will occur 7-10 days after the final dose of\n      study drug."
