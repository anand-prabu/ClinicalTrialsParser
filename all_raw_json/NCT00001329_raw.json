            "textblock": "Brain and nerve cells communicate with each other by releasing and picking up chemicals\n      called neurotransmitters.  Norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter used by part of the nervous\n      system activated during stress called the sympathetic nervous system.  The sympathetic\n      nervous system is involved with regulating blood pressure and pulse rate.  Researchers\n      believe the level norepinephrine in the blood can be used to measure activity of the\n      sympathetic nervous system.\n\n      This study is designed to answer important questions about rates of release of\n      norepinephrine into the blood stream, removal of released norepinephrine, and the\n      sympathetic nervous system response to stress.\n\n      Researchers will attempt to measure levels of norepinephrine and activity of the sympathetic\n      nervous system in patients with high blood pressure, normal patients with family histories\n      of high blood pressure, patients taking drugs that can effect levels of norepinephrine, and\n      patients with diseases or conditions directly affecting the sympathetic nervous system."
