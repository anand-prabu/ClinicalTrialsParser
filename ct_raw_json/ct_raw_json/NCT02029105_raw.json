The patient data,\n      including epidemiological characteristics, smoking status, history of other diseases and\n      co-morbid conditions, previous asbestos exposure, medications and additional physical and\n      radiological examination findings, including computed tomography scans, both serum and\n      pleural fluid laboratory investigational data and indications of invasive procedures, were\n      recorded in the database mentioned above. The methods employed in the diagnosis of patients;\n      any complications; characteristics such as the stages of diseases, treatments, and course of\n      treatments; and results were also recorded in the database. From the date of the first\n      database establishment, a \"tissue, blood, serum, and fluid specimen bank\" was constructed;\n      tissue, blood, serum and pleural fluid samples of patients, which had been taken at the\n      beginning of diagnosis process, were stored in this bank at -80\u00b0C. The blood, serum, and\n      pleural fluid samples of patients were stored during the diagnosis process, and if\n      conducted, pleural tissue samples taken during invasive procedures were also stocked."
