To adress this matter the aim of this study is\n      gathering experience with intubation with mcgrath videolaryngoscope and a blade-shape\n      intubation foreceps (Boedeker intubation foreceps, Karl Storz, Germany).\n\n      The hypothesis is that intubation with this combination is easy and can be a good\n      alternative when using the McGrath videolaryngoscope in patients with predictors of\n      difficult airway."
