      The purpose of this research study is to measure the clinical effectiveness of two different
      polypropylene meshes used for laparoscopic inguinal hernias by evaluating subjects' length
      of hospital stay, perioperative complications, recurrence rate, pain score, comfort level
      and postoperative quality of life. A secondary goal of the study is to evaluate the ease of
      use and time it takes surgical residents to place the mesh and perform the surgery using
      these two different meshes.

    <textblock>
      Inguinal hernia repair is one of the most common operations performed by general surgeons in
      the world. There are two main ways to repair an inguinal hernia, open or laparoscopic. Open
      compared to laparoscopic, is more invasive and leads to more scarring and longer recovery
      periods. Laparoscopic repair is done by making a small cut in or just below the umbilicus
      and has become an accepted standard for inguinal hernia repair and has become the technique
      of choice for recurrent inguinal hernias.

      During laparoscopic repair, the placement of a prosthetic mesh aids in reinforcing the
      abdominal wall and allowing for tension free repair. Meshes also helps to lower the
      recurrence rate. The most safe and effective type of mesh prosthesis currently being used in
      laparoscopic inguinal hernia repairs are polypropylene meshes. There is some emerging
      evidence that &quot;lighter weight&quot; forms of  polypropylene meshes may improve quality of life
      outcomes following surgery for inguinal hernias. Further evaluation is needed to support
      this evidence.

    <description>The primary purpose of this research study is to evaluate the clinical effectiveness and/or to provide evidence of whether or not one polypropylene mesh is more effective than the other. This will be done by measuring whether or not a &quot;lighter weight&quot; form of a polypropylene mesh may improve a patient's quality of life outcomes following laparoscopic inguinal hernia surgery.</description>

    <description>This information may make it possible to determine if one mesh is easier for residents to use during surgery and therefore take them less time to perform the surgical procedure. This information may aid in lessening the amount of time the patient spends in the operating room thus lowering medical costs as well as improving patient outcomes.</description>
