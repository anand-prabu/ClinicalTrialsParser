  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to examine the effects of 4-weeks of physical
      fitness training in patients with subacute ischemic stroke on cerebral imaging and
      blood-derived biomarkers.

  <detailed_description>

      This biomarker-driven study uses an observational design to examine a subgroup of patients
      in the randomized, controlled trial &quot;Physical Fitness Training in Subacute Stroke&quot;
      (PHYS-STROKE). In PHYS-STROKE, 215 patients with subacute stroke (hemorrhagic and ischemic)
      receive either 4-weeks of physical training (aerobic training, 5 times a week, for 50
      minutes) or 4-weeks of relaxation sessions (5 times a week, for 50 minutes). A convenience
      sample of 100 of these patients with ischemic stroke will be included in BAPTISe and will
      receive magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and blood tests before and after the
      PHYS-STROKE intervention. Imaging scans will address parameters of cerebral perfusion and
      vessel size imaging. Blood tests will determine several parameters such as immunity,
      inflammation, and endothelial function. Additionally, we will assess the association between
      functional outcomes (co-primary outcome measures of PHYS-STROKE) and biomarkers including
      imaging results.
