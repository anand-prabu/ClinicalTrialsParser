Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of capecitabine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 106 patients will be accrued for this study within 36 months."
