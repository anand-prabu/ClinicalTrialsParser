Transcranial direct current stimulation is a new non-invasive\n      technique that applies weak electrical currents through the skull and has been shown to\n      alter the excitability of certain brain areas. It is currently being tried in disorders\n      where there is abnormal brain excitability, such as epilepsy and depression. A few studies\n      have also been able to diminish drug craving, suggesting that brain excitability might also\n      be altered in drug addiction.\n\n      This study aims at non-invasively changing the excitability of certain brain areas-a\n      procedure called neuromodulation- in order to help smokers quit smoking more easily."
