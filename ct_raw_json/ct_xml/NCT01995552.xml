      The purpose of the INSPIRE-ELR study is to characterize arrhythmias in post MI low EF (≤35%)
      patients in the acute phase (at discharge from hospital after index MI) and chronic phase
      (at 8-10 weeks after index MI) and to correlate with patients at high risk of all-cause
      mortality or sudden cardiac death (SCD) at 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must provide written informed consent/data release consent to participate in
             the study.

          2. Acute Myocardial Infarction (STEMI or non-STEMI) within the last 10 days based on
             ESC/ACC/AHA/WHF criteria (Thygesen, 2012) matching the following criteria:

             Rise and/or fall of cardiac biomarker values [preferably cardiac troponin (cTn)] with
             at least one value above the 99th percentile upper reference limit (URL) and with at
             least one of the following:

               1. Symptoms of ischaemia.

               2. New or presumed new significant ST-segment-T wave (ST-T) changes or new left
                  bundle branch block (LBBB).

               3. Development of pathological Q waves in the ECG.

               4. Imaging evidence of new loss of viable myocardium or new regional wall motion
                  abnormality.

               5. Identification of an intracoronary thrombus by angiography.

          3. LVEF ≤35% as measured by echocardiography (Simpson's method, biplane) one day before
             or on the day of hospital discharge

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who cannot be discharged from the hospital within14 days after index
             Myocardial Infarction event

          2. Age &lt; 18 years

          3. Psychologically incapacitated

          4. Patient is pregnant, or is expecting to become pregnant during the course of the
             trial per Investigator discretion.

          5. Patients contraindicated for NUVANT system

          6. Comorbidities  likely to limit survival to less than the minimal study duration (12
             months)

          7. Participation in an investigational study with known or suspected cardiac effect
             expected to confound the results of this study (e.g. stem cell trials, stent trials,
             cardiac intervention trials, drug trials)

          8. Patients with an existing pacemaker or ICD implanted.

          9. Patients that are dialysis dependent at discharge
