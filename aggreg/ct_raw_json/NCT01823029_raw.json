            "textblock": "Anemia is one of the commonest extra-intestinal manifestations of Crohn's disease (CD) with\n      a prevalence ranging from 6.2% up to 73.7%.Compared with other complications,it has been\n      subestimated and received less attention from gastroenterologists, although,which is\n      frequently associated with a reduced quality of life.What's more,there were not appropriate\n      strategies for the adequate treatment of anaemia in CD either.\n\n      The anaemia in CD is caused by several factors, such as iron, folic acid or B12 deficiency,\n      treatment with immunosuppressive drugs or sulfasalazine-induced hemolysis, and anemia of\n      chronic disease, of which iron deficiency was one of the most important mechanisms.\n      Additionally, erythropoietin(EPO) levels in chronic disease anemia are generally higher than\n      in normal subjects.However, in CD anemic patients this EPO increase is inadequate in\n      relation to the degree of anemia.Thus, in the treatment of iron deficiency anemia (IDA) in\n      CD,EPO and iron supplementation are very common.Because intravenous(IV) iron is more\n      effective and better tolerated than oral iron and is to be considered in patients with\n      severe anemia (Hb\uff1c10.0 g/dL), with intolerance or inadequate response to oral iron and/or\n      those with active IBD. Intravenous iron administration is the route of choice when\n      simultaneous treatment with erythropoiesis stimulat-ing agents (ESA) is considered.\n\n      But parenteral iron formulations have potential toxic effects such as triggering oxidative\n      reactions and inflammatory reactions that may be very disadvantageous to CD patients. Free\n      iron may provoke formation of free oxygen radicals. Although complex carbohydrate structures\n      that cover free iron may alleviate this oxidative and inflammatory potential,it cannot be\n      completely blocked. These suggest that parenteral iron could be a \"double-edged sword\" with\n      the hematologic bene\ufb01ts (increase in hemoglobin [Hb]) on the one hand, and with the risk of\n      enhancement of systemic in\ufb02ammation and oxidative stress on the other.\n\n      Although the oxidative potential of intravenous iron (IVI) has been studied\n      extensively,there have been no studies about the effects of parenteral iron therapy on\n      oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in the CD population. In this study, we compared\n      different types and schedules of iron compounds for their effects on serum\n      inflammatory-oxidative stress indices."
