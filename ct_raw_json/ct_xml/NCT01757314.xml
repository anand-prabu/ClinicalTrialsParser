  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When surgery is performed under general anesthesia, a catheter is placed in a vein to
      administer drugs and saline.  During major operations, an additional catheter is placed in
      an artery in order to measure the blood pressure closely and withdraw blood samples at
      frequent intervals for various laboratory tests.  This arterial catheter is usually placed
      by feeling the patient's artery at the wrist and inserting the guide-needle in a blind
      fashion.  This procedure, at times, leads to delays and failures due to an inability to feel
      the arterial pulsation well either due to the patients' anatomy or the anesthetic effect.
      This study will determine whether training Anesthesiology Residents in the use of ultrasound
      technology and its application in identifying an artery can prevent the problems associated
      with the conventional palpation technique. Our finding will lead to better and safer
      anesthetic management of patients presenting for a major surgical procedure.  Furthermore,
      the finding will help us in introducing the education and training of ultrasound-guided
      arterial catheter placement in our Residency Program.

      The investigators propose to follow anesthesia residents over a course of 3 years assessing
      their skill level for both palpation and ultrasound technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an updated study on a previous IRB-approved research  (0120070296) which was
      terminated prior to conclusion as the principal investigator terminated his employment at
      the UNDNJ.  An arterial catheter is routinely placed immediately following induction of
      anesthesia, in major operative procedures, in order to measure blood pressure continuously,
      perform frequent blood-gas analysis and withdraw blood for repeated laboratory testing.  The
      arterial catheter is traditionally placed blindly by palpating the radial artery of the
      patient.  This way of placing a radial artery catheter can encounter delay or failure due to
      conditions such as obesity, arteriosclerosis, arterial spasm and anesthesia-induced
      hypotension.  Our study will compare the performance of Anesthesiology Residents in placing
      an arterial catheter by the traditional palpation-guided technique and by the
      ultrasound-guided technique after training in ultrasound usage.  The comparison will utilize
      the following parameters:

        -  Time taken to successfully place a catheter

        -  Number of attempts needed to place a catheter

        -  Number of puncture site changes encountered

        -  Failure rate of the resident with each technique

        -  The need for replacement of the catheter during surgery The data collection will be
           done by an independent observer, who is not a member of the anesthesia care team or
           research team. The Residents performing the catheter placement will not be members of
           the research team and will not have access to the data.  If the Resident fails to place
           the catheter, the attending anesthesiologist will rescue by placing the arterial
           catheter himself by a method of his choice. In the previous study, there was a trend
           toward a reduced failure rate and a decreased time for insertion with the ultrasound
           technique. In this study, the investigators will introduce the research to the
           first-year Residents and repeat the exercise during their second and third year of
           training in a longitudinal fashion to assess the progress during anesthesia training.
           The investigators plan to enroll eight residents from the first-year class.  Each
           resident will perform eight arterial catheter placements with each technique.  In
           addition, compared to the previous study, a more advanced ultrasound machine will be
           used which will provide better visualization of the radial artery.
