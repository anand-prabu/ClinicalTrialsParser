            "textblock": "In 2008, the Prospect Working Group, a multidisciplinary expert panel, published their\n      consensus guidelines on the relative merits of different anaesthetic and analgesic\n      techniques for TKA based on a review of the available published literature up to 2005. These\n      guidelines supported the use of general anaesthesia combined with a femoral nerve block for\n      surgery and postoperative analgesia, or alternatively spinal anaesthesia with local\n      anaesthetic combined with spinal morphine. The preference for femoral nerve block in favour\n      of intrathecal opiates was as a consequence of the greater potential for side effects with\n      the latter technique. The authors conceded that there were a lack of well-conducted studies\n      on this subject, graded their recommendations as level D (expert opinion), and concluded\n      further research was needed.  Consequently there has been debate around the conclusions\n      drawn and clinicians have not universally accepted the recommendations.\n\n      Most researchers to date have focused on short-term outcomes such as static pain scores\n      and/or opiate consumption. It is also important however to investigate dynamic pain scores,\n      patient reported outcomes, the attainment of rehabilitation goals, length of stay and longer\n      term functional outcomes. In addition, the use of the total pain relief score (TOTPAR) as\n      described by Cooper and Beaver, assesses the cumulative response to treatment. This is a\n      well validated area under the time-analgesic effect curve (AUC) derivation for pain relief\n      which is commonly used by meta-analyses of analgesic interventions. The aim of this study is\n      to investigate all these endpoints in patients receiving a single-shot femoral nerve block\n      (FNB) for TKA as compared to intrathecal diamorphine (ID), a more commonly used spinal\n      opiate in United Kingdom anaesthetic practice."
