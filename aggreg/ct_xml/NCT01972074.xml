  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 12-week randomized-controlled trial of memantine hydrochloride (Namenda) for
      the treatment for social impairment in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The
      investigators will also conduct pre- and post-treatment neuroimaging (fMRI and HMRS) to
      assess neural functional deficits in adolescents in ASD compared to healthy volunteer
      adolescents and to assess any effects of memantine therapy on neural function in adolescents
      with ASD. The investigators hypothesize that short-term memantine monotherapy will be safe,
      well-tolerated, and effective in improving the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders in
      adolescents with ASD. Additionally, the investigators hypothesize that following memantine
      therapy, ASD subjects will exhibit a decrease in glutamate (Glu) concentration in the
      anterior-cingulate cortex (ACC) and a change towards normalization in altered functional
      connectivity of the ACC and medial temporal lobes, consistent with improvement in social
      impairments in ASD. The investigators hypothesize that compared to healthy volunteer
      subjects, ASD subjects will significantly differ on neuroimaging measures at baseline but
      that following memantine therapy, the difference between ASD and healthy volunteer
      neuroimaging data will decrease.
