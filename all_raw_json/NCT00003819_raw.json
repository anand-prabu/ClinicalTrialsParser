II. Determine the safety of the TF(c)-KLH conjugate prepared using an\n      MBS heterobifunctional linker plus QS21. III. Assess postimmunization changes in prostate\n      specific antigen levels and other objective parameters of disease in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TF(c)-KLH conjugate with adjuvant\n      QS21 subcutaneously weekly for 3 weeks, then once during weeks 7 and 19.
