This\n      trial had never been tested on a large scale using a more scientifically sound study design.\n      We developed a large school-based randomized trial to overcome that limitation and test the\n      hypothesis that that a school-based peer-led healthy living program would reduce adiposity\n      and increase physical activity among children 6-12yrs old."
