The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS\n      include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella)\n      catarrhalis. These three bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less\n      than or equal to 5 years of age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin\n      (AMPC) produces higher antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The\n      present study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and\n      safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14) administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years\n      with ABRS. It is an open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a\n      post-treatment follow-up phase for 7 to 14 days."
