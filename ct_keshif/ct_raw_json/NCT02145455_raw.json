Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups.\n      Tests to determine knee function will be conducted pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months,\n      6 months and 12 months.  In addition, a CT scan will be completed pre-operatively and at 6\n      weeks to assess changes in alignment."
