The investigators will be testing for hepatitis B\n      virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  Testing will\n      be proposed to all persons seeking care at the Centre d'Accueil, de Soins et d'Orientation\n      from the organization M\u00e9decin du Monde (CASO, MDM).\n\n      Infection status of participants will be determined by either the standard test (ELISA) or\n      rapid test.  The choice between tests will be determined randomly.\n\n      The overall goal is to determine the general acceptability and feasibility of rapid tests\n      and to see if they can help individuals increase their awareness of infection status when\n      compared to longer, routine methods of testing.  In addition, results from these tests will\n      allow the medical doctor to guide participants to appropriate care.  All positive tests will\n      be confirmed at a specialized hospital (H\u00f4ptial Saint-Antoine, Paris, France) and\n      health-specific information will be obtained four months after testing."
