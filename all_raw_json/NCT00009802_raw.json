Calcitriol may increase the effectiveness of paclitaxel by\n      making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining calcitriol with paclitaxel in\n      treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

During course 2 and\n      subsequent courses, patients receive oral calcitriol daily on days 1-3 and paclitaxel IV\n      over 1 hour on day 3 of weeks 1-6. Treatment continues every 8 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of calcitriol until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the highest dose giving an estimated\n      probability of dose-limiting toxicity of no more than 0.30.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study."
