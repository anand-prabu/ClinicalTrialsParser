  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since 20 years, the techniques of direct measurement of cardiac stiffness in the diagnosis
      of myocardial diseases do not exist.

      We propose a human study evaluating the direct measurement of cardiac ultrasound stiffness
      by elastography.

      This study will include 30 patients with cardiac disease whose rigidity varies with
      underlying disease.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the stiffness during open heart surgery.

    <description>Ultrasound acquisition will be completed in epicardial vue using a linear probe SuperLinear 15-4 ™ connected to an ultrasound (AixplorerTM ® from Supersonic Imagine). The acquisitions will be completed in mode B + Elastrography Shear Wave ™ (SWE). A sterile gel is deposited in the bottom of the pouch of sterile protection of the probe. Many measurements will be done on accessible left and right ventricle areas.
