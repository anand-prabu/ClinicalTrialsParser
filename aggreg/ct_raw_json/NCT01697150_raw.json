DiAs Diabetes Assistant Wearable Artificial Pancreas Platform is composed of an Android-based cell phone platform operating with a DexCom sensor, OmniPod Insulin Management System and an Insulet iDex remote controller. Communication runs on a tablet. The Control to Range software will be capable of transmitting patient state data to a remote monitoring device. The subject will be trained on the open loop features of the cell phone platform user interface: DexCom displays, Insulin injection history display, bolus function.

            "textblock": "Automated closed-loop control (CLC) of blood glucose, known as \"artificial pancreas\" (AP)\n      can have tremendous impact on the health and lives of people with type 1 diabetes (T1DM).\n      The investigators inter-institutional and international research team has been on the\n      forefront of CLC developments since the beginning of the JDRF Artificial Pancreas initiative\n      in 2006. Thus far, the investigators have conducted three closed-loop control clinical\n      trials (totaling 60 subjects with T1DM), which demonstrated significantly more time in an\n      acceptable \"target\" blood glucose range during CLC, and significantly fewer hypoglycemic\n      events during CLC compared to open loop. The investigators overall objective is to\n      sequentially test, validate, obtain regulatory approval for, and deploy at home, a\n      closed-loop Control-to-Range (CTR) system comprised of two algorithmic components: a Safety\n      Supervision Module (SSM) and a Hypoglycemia Mitigation Module (HMM). The SSM will monitor\n      the safety of the subject's continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion pump (CSII) to prevent\n      hypoglycemia and will also monitor the integrity of continuous glucose monitor (CGM) data\n      for signal sensor deviations or loss of sensitivity. The HMM will be responsible for the\n      optimal regulation of postprandial hyperglycemic excursions through correction boluses.\n\n      This study will test the ability of AP Platform to (1) run CTR in an outpatient setting, and\n      (2) be remotely monitored. Specifically, this study involves studying adults with T1DM who\n      are experienced insulin pump users. Subjects will spend two nights (-42 hours) in a local\n      hotel, during which the AP Platform will be remotely monitored in an adjacent hotel room for\n      validation that remote system monitoring can successfully occur. During the study, study\n      subject will be responsible for. operating the CTR system with nursing and technicians\n      available"

Primary objective The purpose of this pilot study is to test a closed-loop\n           Control-to-Range (CTR) system in a semi-controlled environment and especially to\n           evaluate if the system can accurately collect data coming from patient inputs, insulin\n           pump, and continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) device with more than 80% of time of use.\n\n        2. Secondary objectives\n\n      This pilot study will use a Artificial Pancreas Platform (AP Platform) cell\n      phone/phone-based system to test an outpatient controller and remote monitoring as follows:\n\n        -  test that the CTR system can be remotely monitored by nurses/physicians/ technicians to\n           confirm appropriate functioning outside of the hospital setting\n\n        -  test that the CTR system can be deployed, with appropriate subject response, outside of\n           the hospital setting\n\n      I.B. STUDY DESIGN\n\n      This study is an early feasibility pilot trial with the principal goal is to validate an\n      initial outpatient ready CTR system and its remote-monitoring capability. Therefore, this is\n      an unblinded pilot study and no control group will be used."
