The\n      first 7 days will consist of a dietary restriction to lower the polyphenols intake. Then\n      subjects will drink at random one of the three treatments for 14 days (4 cups/day). Blood\n      and urine samples will be collected throughout the study to evaluate in vivo effects on\n      oxidative biomarkers. Furthermore, at day 21, subjects will undergo a physical regimen to\n      increase acutely and transiently their oxidative damage. Blood and urine samples collected\n      throughout this challenge will allow us to evaluate the effect of coffee intake in reducing\n      oxidative damage created by exercise compared to placebo."
