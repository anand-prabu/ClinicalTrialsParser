These patients are likely to have high\n      levels of the decay causing bacteria, mutans streptococci.\n\n      The purpose of this research is to test the ability of a novel xylitol delivery vehicle to\n      reduce mutans streptococci in patients with dry mouth over a two week period.  The delivery\n      vehicle is a slowly dissolving xylitol disk (lozenge) that adheres to soft tissues inside\n      the mouth.  Participants will place disks on both sides of the mouth three times a day."
