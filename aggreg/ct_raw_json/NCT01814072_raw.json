MOST involves highly efficient randomized experimentation to assess the\n      effects of individual treatment components, and thereby identify which components and\n      component levels make important contributions to the overall program effect on weight loss.\n      This information then guides assembly of an optimized treatment package that achieves target\n      outcomes with least resource consumption and participant burden. Because the intervention\n      strategies being tested minimize in-person coaching and leverage technology that\n      participants already own, the new optimized intervention, to be called Opt-IN, will be more\n      scalable than traditional INLIs. Opt-IN will thus enjoy greatly increased reach, and enable\n      significant progress in the fight against obesity."

All intervention components to be examined\n      were selected based on the Opt-IN model's prediction that they enhance behavioral adherence\n      to weight regulation via the designated pathways.  The five components to be tested will be:\n      (1) coaching intensity (12 vs. 24 phone sessions), (2) text messaging (No vs. Yes), (3)\n      progress report to participant's primary care provider (No vs. Yes), (4) recommendation to\n      use meal replacements (No vs. Yes), (5) training participants' self-selected buddies to be\n      supportive (No vs. Yes)."
