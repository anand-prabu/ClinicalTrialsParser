  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to determine the effects of renal sympathetic
      denervation on the insulin resistance, muscle sympathetic nerve activity and blood pressure
      in patients with metabolic syndrome and associated uncontrolled hypertension.
