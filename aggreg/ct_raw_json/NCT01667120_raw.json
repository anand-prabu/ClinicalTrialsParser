Ketorolac 0.5mg/kg\n      intravenously every 8 hrs for 72hrs will be administered versus an equivalent volume of 0.9%\n      normal saline as placebo.\n\n      Primary: The primary purpose of this study is to compare bleeding events in neonates who\n      receive ketorolac and those who do not receive ketorolac. The investigators hypothesize that\n      ketorolac is safe and effective in infants > 37wks gestation and at least one week of age.\n\n      Secondary: The investigators intend to evaluate daily creatinine levels, pain scores, urine\n      output per shift, platelet counts, hemoglobin levels, number of days on the ventilator,\n      amount of narcotic administered, blood pressure, and reintubation events on all patients in\n      this study as secondary study points."
