Currently, urine\n      reflux is detected using either voiding cystourethrogram or other procedures.  A new\n      technique called ultrasound-based Acoustic Radiation Force Impulse (ARFI), or shear wave\n      velocity imaging SVI) is performed using standard approved ultrasound machines and\n      transducers bu the sound waves/impulses are produced in a different pattern.  We hope to\n      evaluate the usefulness of ARFI in diagnosing possible kidney damage caused from urine\n      reflux (urine backing up into the kidneys)."
