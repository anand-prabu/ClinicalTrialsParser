    <textblock>
      The trial that the investigators are proposing is a pilot study to determine the effect of
      the new WHO-yaws eradication strategy in Lihir Island (population 18,000), Papua New Guinea.
      New treatment policies were developed by WHO in 2012 to replace those of the 1950s. The
      recommended practice is to offer an initial MDA with azithromycin to the entire population,
      followed by resurveys every 6 months to detect and treat remaining cases.We will use
      serology surveys, clinical surveys and ulcer aetiology studies to measure the effect of mass
      azithromycin treatment on the community burden of yaws infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Yaws is a re-emerging endemic treponemal infection caused by Treponema pallidum subp
      pertenue. This bacterium causes a chronic relapsing disease, characterized by highly
      contagious primary and secondary cutaneous lesions and non-contagious tertiary late
      destructive lesions. The Pacific Islands are believed to be a major focus of yaws worldwide,
      though population-based data on prevalence are lacking for many countries.

      Azithromycin (30mg/kg) has recently been shown to be effective in the treatment of yaws and
      is now central to WHO's yaws eradication strategy. Substituting a single dose of an oral
      antibiotic for a painful penicillin injection is a significant advantage because infection
      control measures required for injection of penicillin will no longer be required and
      treatment will be more acceptable to communities who need it.

      Previous attempts to eradicate yaws by mass treatment of active cases with injectable drugs
      yielded unsuccessful results.  A major campaign to eradicate yaws in the 1950s and 1960s
      with longacting, injectable penicillin greatly reduced the number of cases of the disease
      worldwide but incubating and latent cases that were not treated developed relapses with
      infectious yaws lesions, thereby becoming a source of reinfection.

      While the earlier strategy in the 1950s, targeted just those people who were visibly
      infected, the new WHO-plan calls for blanket coverage of at least 90% of the population. The
      ratio of clinically apparent to latent cases with no symptoms is estimated as high as 1:6
      and mass drug administration (MDA) of the entire population is the best approach to ensure
      that incubating and latent infections are adequately dealt with.

      The currently recommended treatment for eradication is one dose of oral azithromycin (30
      mg/Kg; maximum 2g) to be given to entire populations in areas known to harbor yaws. For the
      MDA to be effective, it is required to have substantial coverage in the first round. The
      initial mass treatment should be followed by resurveys every 6 months to detect and treat
      remaining cases.

      Because of the potential bacterial resistance appearance treatment failure needs to be
      monitored. Macrolide resistance is associated with point mutations at positions A2058 and
      A2059 of the 23S ribosomal RNA gene and molecular analysis need to be done in clinical
      specimens from patients who do not respond to treatment.

Women who tell the investigators they are pregnant and people with known allergy to macrolides will be offered benzathine benzylpenicillin.
This will be a single arm study. Study participants who met the inclusion criteria and agree to sign the consent form will be managed with proposed drug and systematically observed to measure outcomes of interest.</description>

    <description>Investigators will do a baseline survey of every children from 5 to 15 years in the village. To detect yaws infection, investigators will collect a blood specimen for serology (qualitative and quantitative RPR testing and TPHA assay).
Investigators will identify yaws-like ulcers by means of dermatological examination. Investigators will swab papilloma and ulcers and specimens will be flown to University of Washington (Seattle). PCR methods will consist of primary screening for the presence or absence of T. p. pertenue DNA, Haemophilus ducreyi DNA and detection of the A2058G and A2059G mutations associated with azithromycin resistance.
Investigators will begin treatment with antibiotics immediately after completion of the baseline survey. Everyone in the villages will be offered azithromycin, subsequently a field team will treat all active clinical cases and their contacts 6 monthly.
For all subjects, follow-up examination will be performed at 6, and 12 months</description>
