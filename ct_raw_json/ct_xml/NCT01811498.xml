  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), comprise the majority
      of all primary brain tumors in adults.  This group of tumors also exhibits the most
      aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival of only 9-12 months. Initial
      therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation, or both.  All
      patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both
      first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging
      survival.  It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood
      brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Superselective
      Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective
      in the treatment of recurrent GBM.  Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an
      extension of that trial in that we seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of
      intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed
      malignant glioma.  By achieving the aims of this study we will also determine if repeated
      intra-arterial Bevacizumab improves progression free and overall survival in newly diagnosed
      patients.  We expect that this project will provide important information regarding the
      utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way
      these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future.

      The experimental aspects of this experimental plan will include:

        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol
           20%; delivered IA, 12.5 mL over 2 minutes) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier.
            This technique has been used in several thousand subjects in previous studies for the
           IA delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.

        2. Subjects will then be treated with repeated intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of
           Bevacizumab.  Each subject will receive one dose of IA Bevacizumab on day 30, followed
           by chemoradiation. SIACI of Bevacizumab will be repeated every three months for a total
           of 3 infusions.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects greater than or equal to 18 years of age. Subjects with
             documented histologic diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme (newly diagnosed) Subjects
             must have at least one confirmed and evaluable tumor site.*A confirmed tumor site is
             one which is biopsy-proven. NOTE: Radiographic procedures (e.g., Gd-enhanced MRI or
             CT scans) documenting existing lesions must have been performed within three weeks of
             treatment on this research study. Subjects must have a Karnofsky performance status
             of at least 70% (or the equivalent ECOG level of 0-2) and an expected survival of at
             least three months. Subjects must agree to use a medically effective method of
             contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. A
             pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing
             potential immediately prior to entry into the research study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Previous treatment with Bevacizumab. Women who are pregnant or lactating. Women of
             childbearing potential and fertile men who decline to use effective contraception
             during and for a period of three months after the treatment period. Subjects with
             significant intercurrent medical or psychiatric conditions that would place them at
             increased risk or affect their ability to receive or comply with treatment or
             post-treatment clinical monitoring
