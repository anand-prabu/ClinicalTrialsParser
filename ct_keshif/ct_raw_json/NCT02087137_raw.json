            "textblock": "Normal aging is associated with decline in some aspects of memory, and this can be a risk\n      factor for reductions in everyday functioning. The Baycrest Memory and Aging Program teaches\n      positive adaptation to age-related memory changes, including strategies for minimizing the\n      everyday impact of normal memory change and positive lifestyle change to maximize brain\n      health. Prior research has shown that the Memory and Aging program is effective in\n      increasing participants' knowledge about memory, use of memory strategies, and confidence in\n      memory function, as well as adoption of healthier lifestyle practices and reduction in\n      intention to use unneeded health care resources.\n\n      Although not one of the stated goals of the program, informal feedback from participants\n      suggests that the educational content and skills training in the Memory and Aging Program\n      has led some participants to change behaviours in ways that lead to significant improvements\n      in their everyday functioning. For example, graduating participants often volunteer examples\n      of how they have applied what they have learned to succeed in everyday memory tasks such as\n      learning a new name or keeping track of future plans.  Based on this participant feedback,\n      it is hypothesized that the knowledge, skills, and confidence gained by Memory and Aging\n      Program participants may lead to positive behaviour changes that, in turn, lead to improved\n      everyday functioning.  The present study will test this hypothesis using a randomized\n      controlled pretest-posttest design."
