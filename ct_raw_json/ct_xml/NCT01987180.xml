    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to develop and pilot the NICU-2-Home service, a health
      information technology (IT) concept centered on a smart phone app. NICU-2-Home will provide
      support to parents of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants as they transition from the NICU
      to their homes and eventually establish a medical home with the infant's pediatrician. Once
      the app is developed, we will conduct a feasibility study with randomization to pilot test
      the ability of NICU-2-Home app to (a) improve parent's self-efficacy and confidence in
      caring for their VLBW infant, (b) decrease parental stress, and (c) enhance involvement with
      their VLBW infants compared to controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After 2-3 months in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), mothers and fathers of Very Low
      Birth Weight (VLBW) infants face discharge home with trepidation. Having a VLBW infant that
      has survived to discharge, these parents now must perform a myriad of health care tasks once
      at home, yet parents often feel ill-prepared, uninformed, and unskilled to provide this
      care. The goal of this exploratory research is to develop and pilot the NICU-2-Home service,
      a health information technology (IT) concept centered on the smart phone that will be
      created with researchers at Motorola. NICU-2-Home will provide support to parents of VLBW
      infants as they transition from the NICU to their homes and eventually establish a medical
      home with the infant's pediatrician. Phase 1 of this research uses qualitative methods and
      an iterative process to design the NICU-2-Home content service that will support parents as
      they transition to home from the NICU through interviews with the major stakeholders:
      parents, neonatal physicians, neonatal staff, and community pediatricians. Phase 2 evaluates
      NICU-2-Home as parents are transitioning to home and includes a feasibility study with
      randomization to pilot test the ability of NICU-2-Home to (a) improve parent's self-efficacy
      and confidence in caring for their VLBW infant, (b) decrease parental stress, and (c)
      enhance involvement with their VLBW infants compared to controls.

    <description>Parents will be asked to provide saliva samples at four different days (the day prior to discharge, the day after discharge, five days after discharge, and 2 weeks after discharge) at the following three times each day: when they wake up, 30 minutes later, and at bedtime.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Parents will be asked to complete a particular set of surveys depending on which study day they are on.  The study days include: 2 weeks prior to discharge (baseline), the day prior to discharge, the day after discharge, five days after discharge, and 2 weeks after discharge. Parents will complete the surveys independently without consulting their partner.
The survey includes parenting sense of competence scale (PSOC), revised dyadic adjustment scale (RDAS), edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS),perceived stress scale (PSS)</description>

    <description>Parents will be provided with the usual standard of care in the NICU.  Discharge information will be provided to parents as is typically done in the NICU for VLBW infants getting ready to go home. Typical handouts are given to parents that describe their child's care and needs specifically as well as general guidelines. The project coordinator for the research study will verify that parents received information prior to discharge from the NICU staff.  Parents will determine how you use this information.</description>

    <arm_group_label>NICU-2-Home mobile app user</arm_group_label>
    <description>Parents will receive smartphone and unique NICU-2-Home app for their use.  A pair of parents will be given two smartphones and will be asked to use the devices in their preferred way. Within the given app there is a baby tracking tool (baby-connect.com) that enables parents to keep track of the baby's feeding, diapers, sleep, health, medicines, vaccines, photos, etc. The objective in doing this is not to monitor the growth and development of the child; rather, it is to observe what tools within the app parents use and how frequently they use them.</description>
