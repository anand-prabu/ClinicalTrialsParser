Patients with a prior history of lower stage\n        contralateral breast cancer, treated with surgery, and/or radiation, but not chemotherapy,\n        are eligible for this study.\n\n        Performance status (Karnofsky scale) must be greater than 70; ECOG 0 to 2.\n\n        Absolute granulocyte count greater than 1500 per microliter and platelet count greater\n        than 100,000 per mm(3).\n\n        Liver function tests (SGOT, and total bilirubin) should be less than 2X upper limits of\n        normal.
