  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized trial to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 levels
      of recommended energy expenditure of exercise (EEEx) in initially overweight and obese
      sedentary men and women on the prevention of weight regain. Participants will complete a 3
      mo. weight loss intervention of decreased energy intake (EI) and increased EEEx (1,000
      kcal/wk.), a level of exercise consistent with Health and Human Services (HHS)
      recommendations. Participants achieving clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 5% of initial
      weight), will be randomly assigned to 12 mos. of  exercise at levels of EEEx recommended by:
      1.) HHS, ~1,000 kcal/wk., 2.) American College of Sports Medicine( ACSM),~ 2,000 kcal/wk.,
      3.) Institute of Medicine (IOM), ~3,000 kcal/wk. Major outcome assessments will occur prior
      to weight loss (-3 mos.), at completion of weight loss (0 mos.), at the midpoint (6 mos.),
      and completion of weight maintenance (12 mos).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomized trial in 287 overweight and obese, sedentary adults
      (at least 50% women). Participants achieving clinically significant weight loss (â‰¥5%)
      following a 3 mo. reduced energy diet and a program of PA (1,000 kcal/wk.) will be randomly
      assigned to either maintain exercise at 1,000 kcal/wk. or increase exercise to 2,000 or
      3,000 kcal/wk. while consuming a weight gain prevention diet over a 12 mo. period. Exercise
      will be verified (combination of on-site and HR monitor) and  EEEx will be measured at 3 mo.
      intervals beginning at mo. 0 (the end of weight loss). In-person behaviorally based clinic
      meetings will be conducted weekly during the 3 mo. weight loss period (-3 to 0 mos.) and
      during the first 3 mos. of the weight regain prevention period. During the final 9 mos. of
      weight regain prevention, clinics will be held bi-monthly using group conference calls. We
      have not proposed to randomize participants to a true control group (i.e. no exercise or
      diet) following the 3 mo. weight loss program as published data indicates significant weight
      regain in individuals receiving no follow-up treatment after weight loss.

    <description>To compare the effectiveness of 3 exercise recommendations on the prevention of weight regain over 12 mos. subsequent to clinically significant weight loss (&gt; 5%). We expect participants will regain weight in a dose-response manner, i.e. greatest, intermediate and least weight regain for the 1,000, 2,000 and 3,000 kcal/wk. groups, respectively.</description>
