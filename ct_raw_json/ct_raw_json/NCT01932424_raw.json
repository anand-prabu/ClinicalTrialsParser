            "description": "The intervention in this study involves taking blood sample from an existing arterial line for measurement of blood propofol levels. The drug in evaluation is Propofol 2% (Diprivan 2%, Astra Zeneca UK) administered as a target controlled infusion using the commercially available paediatric TCI models (Paedfusor and Marsh models). The dose range is usually between a target concentration of 3-8 mcg/ml. However the anaesthetic management is not changed for the study. The blood concentrations of propofol will be measured using Pelorus 1500 (Sphere Medical, UK), a CE marked device. The anaesthetist will be blinded from the measurements, unless the measured value was outside the safe limit ( < 3 mcg/ml or > 10mcg/ml)."

            "textblock": "During major spinal surgery evoked potential monitoring is performed to detect spinal cord\n      damage. Intra-venous anaesthesia is the preferred anaesthetic technique because volatile\n      anaesthetic agents supress the evoked potentials.  Total Intra-Venous Anaesthesia (TIVA)\n      with propofol is commonly administered as a Target Controlled Infusion (TCI). The TCI is an\n      automated drug delivery system which  administers propofol to achieve a desired blood\n      concentration, based on an in built pharmaco-kinetic data (TCI model) derived from previous\n      studies. The TCI model also provides a real time predicted blood concentration to facilitate\n      the anaesthetist to adjust the target concentration of propofol.\n\n      The TCI algorithm is based on pharmaco-kinetic data derived from previous studies in a\n      relatively small number of patients, by a \"best fit\" relationship between blood levels,\n      infusion rates and other factors (such as age and weight). Several factors make it possible\n      for a wide discrepancy between the predicted and the true blood concentrations. This\n      difference can be higher in children compared to adults. Also blood loss and administration\n      of large volumes of intravenous fluids can affect the blood concentrations. This study aims\n      to identify the difference between the predicted and true blood concentrations by using\n      Pelorus 1500, a bedside blood propofol measurement device, in children undergoing major\n      spinal surgery under TIVA."
