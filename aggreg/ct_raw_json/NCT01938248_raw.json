            "textblock": "There are over sixty thousand Canadians with pacemakers or implanted defibrillators. More\n      than 40% of these patients will develop sub-clinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF), which is a\n      short-lasting, typically asymptomatic arrhythmia that would not be detected by means other\n      than a modern, dual-chamber pacemaker. Only 15% of patients with SCAF also have clinical\n      atrial fibrillation (AF) and until recently, the significance of isolated SCAF was debated.\n      However; our group published the ASSERT trial, which demonstrated that in patients with\n      hypertension, but without clinical AF, SCAF \u2265 6 minutes in duration was associated with a\n      2.5-fold increased risk of stroke; which among patients with CHA2DS2-VASC score > 3 was\n      associated with a stroke risk of 2.75% per year. However; the optimal approach to stroke\n      prevention for patients with SCAF is controversial and oral anticoagulation (OAC) is usually\n      not employed. As OAC can prevent 60-80% of ischemic strokes in patients with clinical AF, it\n      is critical that we determine its roll in patients with SCAF.\n\n      Many patients with pacemakers and implanted defibrillators are followed semi-annually by\n      cardiologists and nurses in device clinics and many of them have a CHA2DS2-VASC score > 3.\n      They represent a large, high-risk and easily identifiable group of patients who are highly\n      compliant with follow-up. ARTESiA will enroll 3,719 patients with a pacemaker or implanted\n      defibrillator, a CHA2DS2-VASC score > 3 and at least one episode of SCAF \u2265 6 minutes who do\n      not have a history of clinical AF and who do not have a contra-indication to oral\n      anticoagulation. Patients will be randomized to receive either the oral anticoagulant\n      apixaban or aspirin, in a double-blind, double-dummy fashion and will be followed for the\n      primary outcome of ischemic stroke or systemic embolism.\n\n      ARTESiA will help define the role of OAC in patients with pacemakers and defibrillations who\n      have SCAF; providing clinicians with important guidance for this common problem. However;\n      the implications of ARTESiA go beyond the pacemaker population. New cardiac rhythm\n      monitoring technologies are increasingly being used in clinical practice and suggest a high\n      prevalence of SCAF among older individuals without pacemakers, but with cardiovascular risk\n      factors. The results of ARTESiA will give insights for this much larger and rapidly growing\n      group of patients."
