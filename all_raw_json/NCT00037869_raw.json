If no MIBG accumulation can be found within\n      tumor sites, the patient will not be able to continue on this study.  Patients will also\n      have CT scans and urine and blood tests.  Women able to have children will have a pregnancy\n      test.\n\n      If tumor sites are found and patients are fully eligible, they will receive a therapeutic\n      (treatment) dose of  I-131 MIBG by vein over 120 minutes. Some patients may have to receive\n      a lower dose of MIBG. Patients will require hospitalization for treatment and will remain\n      hospitalized for about 3-6 days."
