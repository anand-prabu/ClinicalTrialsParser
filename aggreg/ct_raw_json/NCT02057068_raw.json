            "textblock": "Objective:  The primary objective of this study to develop and field test\n      non-pharmacological, technology based, psycho-educational, cognitive behavior therapy and\n      compassion meditation interventions to improve sleep in Veteran/caregiver dyads.\n\n      Research Plan: The specific objectives will be accomplished through the execution of a three\n      phase strategy: 1) an evaluation phase, 2) a development and preliminary intervention field\n      testing phase, and 3) an intervention refinement, revision and re-testing phase.  All\n      studies will use samples of Veteran care receivers (CR s) over the age of 60 who require\n      assistance from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG).  A sub-study will include the same\n      collection of data, however using non-Veteran care receivers (CR) over the age of 60 who\n      require assistance from a spousal or cohabitating caregiver (CG).\n\n      Study 1 is a cross-sectional study which focuses on the Sleep Evaluation of 124 CG/CR Dyads.\n       In SLEEP-E Dyads 1 actigraphy will be used to objectively and contemporaneously measure\n      dyadic sleep.   Daily journals will be used to collect CG/CR self-reported sleep quality,\n      daytime mood and behavior and to identify the nature and types of sleep disturbance.\n      Electronic Tablets (E-Tabs) will be introduced, evaluated and validated with half the dyads.\n       Pre and post journal video greetings will be tested and evaluated during this phase. Data\n      from SLEEP-E Dyads 1 will be analyzed and inform the developmental tasks and activities for\n      the next phase of the study. An additional sub-sample of caregiving dyads (non-Veterans)\n      will be recruited to implement the same study design and to compare data to Veteran\n      caregiving dyad data.\n\n      The focus of SLEEP-E Dyads 2 is on Sleep Enhancement for CG/CR Dyads. This phase involves\n      the adaptation, implementation and field testing of interventions with proven efficacy in\n      other populations for use with Veteran dyads and the development of new interventions using\n      selected components from evidence based sleep interventions. The intervention will be tested\n      on 12 dyads stratified by dementia status. The tele-health device will be used to collect\n      daily diary information during this phase and to deliver the sleep hygiene educational and\n      cognitive behavior therapy components of the intervention.\n\n      In SLEEP-E Dyads 3 feedback from the CGs regarding the acceptability of the intervention\n      will be processed and analyzed in addition to preliminary outcome data. The intervention\n      will be refined accordingly and the revised intervention will be tested with 44 dyads\n      stratified by dementia status.\n\n      Methods: All study phases involve comprehensive assessments of sleep and daytime\n      functioning, mood and behavior using standardized validated instruments in addition to\n      subjective data from the dyad as well as objective sleep evaluations with contemporaneous\n      wrist actigraphy measured over seven days.\n\n      Clinical Relevance:  This study addresses the neglected topic of sleep disturbance in older\n      caregiving dyads-a topic that has important implications for the safety, health, functioning\n      and QOL of older Veterans living at home and being cared for by a family caregiver. Because\n      of the inter-related, bi-directional nature of sleep to stress, burden and depression, the\n      most efficacious interventions should be ones which consider risk factors as they relate to\n      the sleep of both members of a dyad. Yet, this study is the first to attempt to elucidate\n      the dynamic relationship between CG and care recipient sleep and the impact of dyadic sleep\n      to daytime functioning and well-being with Veterans and their caregivers.\n\n      These activities will lead to the implementation and evaluation of a definitive randomized\n      clinical trial for CG/CR dyads and make a significant and important contribution to\n      complement the emergent program of caregiver research in the VA devoted to improving quality\n      of life for Veterans and their families."
