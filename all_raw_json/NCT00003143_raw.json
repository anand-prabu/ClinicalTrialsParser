Evaluate the role of amifostine in reducing hematologic toxicity and\n      improving mobilization of peripheral progenitor stem cells in patients with recurrent or\n      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's disease who are undergoing platinum based\n      salvage chemotherapy. II. Evaluate the role of amifostine in preventing renal toxicity in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an randomized, open label study. Patients are randomized to receive salvage\n      chemotherapy with intravenous dexamethasone/cisplatin/cytarabine (DHAP) with or without\n      amifostine. Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours followed by cytarabine IV for 2\n      doses. Patients also receive dexamethasone orally or IV. Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks\n      for 2-6 courses. Arm I: Patients receive amifostine IV over 15 minutes prior to all courses\n      of DHAP, as a 15 minute infusion, beginning 30 minutes prior to cisplatin administration.\n      Arm II: Patients do not receive amifostine.
