            "textblock": "Several studies have shown that stenting of the femoropopliteal artery in the lower leg\n      leads to improved overall results compared to balloon angioplasty alone. However, scar\n      tissue development can occur within the stent, a process called restenosis. Treatment of\n      these in-stent restenotic lesions has a high procedural success rate but recurrence of scar\n      tissue is frequently seen. Several methods have been proposed to treat in-stent restenosis\n      in the lower leg arteries but mixed results have been noted. In this study we hypothesize\n      that simultaneous tissue excision and aspiration using the JetStream Navitus device (Medrad)\n      can lead to a high rate of acute procedural success with low intraprocedural complications\n      and an acceptable recurrence rate of restenosis at 6-month follow-up."
