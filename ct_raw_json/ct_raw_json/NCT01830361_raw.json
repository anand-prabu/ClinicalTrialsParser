            "textblock": "AML patients displaying t(8;21) have a relatively favourable outcome. Nevertheless, only\n      approximately 50% of patients carrying this cytogenetic aberration are alive at 5 years.\n      This suggests that some patients have more aggressive leukemic phenotypes and indicates the\n      need for treatment optimization with novel therapies.\n\n      The mutated KIT gene as well as the FLT3-ITD mutation have recently been identified as\n      factors most likely to explain the heterogeneous clinical outcomes within the group of\n      t(8;21) AML. The FLT3 and c-KIT genes encode type III receptor tyrosine kinases (RTK) with\n      important and partly redundant functions in early hematopoietic stem cells. Various\n      activating mutations have been described for both genes. For c-KIT, the incidence ranges\n      from 17 to 48% depending on the source population and type of mutations determined. It has\n      been consistently shown that in AMLs with t(8;21), mutated c-KIT is associated with a\n      dramatically increased risk of relapse and reduced overall survival compared to their\n      unmutated counterparts. The FLT3-ITD mutation has a similar negative effect on prognosis in\n      the patient group of t(8;21) mutated AMLs as c-KIT.\n\n      PKC412 (midostaurin) is known to inhibit the c-KIT RTK activity as well as the FLT3 kinase,\n      both in patients with ITD and TKD mutations. It should therefore be possible to abrogate the\n      negative impact of pathologically increased c-KIT or FLT3-ITD activity on relapse and\n      overall survival by using midostaurin in this patient population. Aim of the proposed\n      clinical trial is to prove the efficacy of midostaurin in c-KIT or FLT3-ITD mutated t(8;21)-\n      AMLs in an open-label one-arm design."
