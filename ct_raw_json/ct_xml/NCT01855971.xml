    <textblock>
      Fragile X syndrome (FXS) present alterations in synaptic plasticity that produce
      intellectual disability. can produce improvement. Estrogens (targeting Estrogen Receptors
      beta (ER-β)can act as neuroprotective agents, promoting synaptic plasticity and neurite
      outgrowth, and health benefits derived from flavonoids, as the flavonol epigallocatechin
      gallate (EGCG), phytoestrogens of natural origin are partially explained by their
      interaction with membrane ER. Selective ER-β flavonoids are thus good candidates for their
      therapeutic evaluation in intellectual disabilities. EGCG also targets central intracellular
      transduction signals altered in FXS and improves memory recognition in a FXS animal
      model(adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)and
      mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2).
      This study targets the synaptic plasticity alterations that underlie the learning and memory
      impairment but also the computational disability in FXS. The hypothesis is that EGCG can act
      by favoring the physiological processes involved in cognition.

      Rare diseases leading to intellectual disability, such as Fragile X syndrome (FXS), where
      alterations in synaptic plasticity are involved, may benefit from treatments targeting
      Estrogen Receptors beta (ER-β). Estrogens can act as neuroprotective agents, promoting
      synaptic plasticity and neurite outgrowth, and health benefits derived from flavonoids, as
      the flavonol epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), phytoestrogens of natural origin are partially
      explained by their interaction with membrane ER. Selective ER-β flavonoids are thus good
      candidates for their therapeutic evaluation in intellectual disabilities. EGCG also targets
      central intracellular transduction signals (EGCG is an ATP-inhibitor of PI3K, and mTOR and
      ERK1/2) altered in FXS and improves memory recognition in a FXS animal model. This study
      targets the synaptic plasticity alterations that underlie the learning and memory impairment
      but also the computational disability in FXS. The hypothesis is that EGCG can act by
      favoring the physiological processes involved in cognition.
