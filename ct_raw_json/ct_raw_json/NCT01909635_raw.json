Next, for the remaining eligible participants, both meal sessions will be scheduled\n      within a two-week period, with the sessions scheduled within one hour of being at the same\n      time of day.  These sessions will be scheduled at dinnertime, between four pm and seven pm,\n      with each session lasting approximately 75 minutes.  Before leaving the orientation session,\n      you will be instructed to not exercise on either of the days of the sessions.  You will also\n      be instructed to not eat four hours before either of your sessions, but to eat in a similar\n      manner earlier in the day for each session.\n\n      You will be randomized to one of two groups in which you will be asked to think about\n      different things during your meal.\n\n      Group 1: If you are randomized to this group, you will be asked to think about  your\n      feelings of hunger, fullness, and the sensory qualities of the food  (such as texture,\n      smell, flavor) as you eat your meal.\n\n      Group 2: If you are randomized to this group, you will be asked to think about  how hot or\n      cold you feel, and how tired you are feeling as you eat your  meal.\n\n      At the start of each meal session, you will complete a food recall to record what you have\n      consumed that day prior to the scheduled session.  Also, a seven-day physical activity\n      recall will be collected prior to beginning the meal.  If you have not followed directions\n      regarding eating and exercise, the session will be rescheduled.\n\n      Next you will rate your hunger, fullness, and liking of each food in the meal on a scale.\n      Then you will be instructed to consume a bowl of chocolate pudding within five minutes.\n      When you have completed the pudding, there will be a 30-minute rest period in which you will\n      be allowed to read or study.  After the rest period and before the meal begins, you will\n      again rate on the scale your hunger, fullness, and liking of each food in the meal.  Then\n      you will be asked to silence or turn off any electronic devices, after which the researcher\n      will facilitate a brief raisin eating exercise.  After the raisin eating exercise, the\n      researcher will bring in your meal. The meal will last for 30 minutes and will be\n      videotaped, and you will eat until pleasantly full.  At the end of the thirty minutes, the\n      researcher will come in and remove the food and you will rate your feelings of hunger,\n      fullness, and liking of the foods in the meal, and then you will be done with the session.\n\n      At the second session, the procedure will be exactly the same.  In addition, you will\n      complete several questionnaires about your thoughts and feelings after completion of the\n      meal.\n\n      Please call Dr. Hollie Raynor at (865) 974-6259 if you have any questions  about these\n      procedures for the study."
