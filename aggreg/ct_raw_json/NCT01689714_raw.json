Technetium Tc 99m EC20 (99mTc-EC20; FolateScan), a folate-targeted diagnostic\n      radiopharmaceutical, is designed to bind to the folate receptor. Thus, FolateScan may\n      provide an effective method to determine folate receptor-positive (FR+) target tumors,\n      thereby assisting in the identification of those patients who may benefit from\n      folate-targeted therapy."
