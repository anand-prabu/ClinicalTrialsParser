  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test whether treatment with isososbide mononitrate
      will improve left ventricular hypertrophy (&quot;thickening&quot;) which puts people at risk for
      developing heart failure. Once it develops, heart failure is a very serious condition and
      thus it is important to find ways to prevent it from happening. The investigators have
      reasons to believe that dilating the blood vessels with this specific medication will
      improve the thickening of the heart, which increases the risk of heart failure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Systolic blood pressure &gt;140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure &gt; 90 mmHg.

          -  An elevated left ventricular mass index (defined as &gt;60 g/m1.7 in women and 80 g/m1.7
             in men) OR LV posterior wall thickness &gt;1.4 cm documented in a clinically indicated
             echocardiographic examination or magnetic resonance imaging scan within the previous
             12 months.

          -  Stable medical therapy as defined by: (1)No addition or removal of ACE, ARB,
             beta-blockers, or calcium channel blockers (CCBs) for 30 days. (2)No change in dosage
             of ACE, ARBs, beta-blockers or CCBs of more than 100% for 30 days.

          -  Current therapy with an ACE inhibitor, hydralazine or a statin, all of which have
             been shown to reduce nitrate tolerance.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Rhythm other than sinus rhythm (i.e., atrial fibrillation).

          -  Non-cardiac condition limiting life expectancy to less than one year, per physician
             judgment.

          -  Current or anticipated future need for nitrate therapy.

          -  Valve disease (&gt; mild aortic or mitral stenosis; &gt; moderate aortic or mitral
             regurgitation).

          -  Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.

          -  Known infiltrative or inflammatory myocardial disease (amyloid, sarcoid).

          -  Pericardial disease.

          -  Primary pulmonary arteriopathy.

          -  Have experienced a myocardial infarction or unstable angina, or have undergone
             percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography (PTCA) or coronary artery bypass
             grafting (CABG) within 60 days prior to consent, or requires either PTCA or CABG at
             the time of consent.

          -  Resting heart rate (HR) &gt; 100 bpm.

          -  A reduced LV ejection fraction (EF&lt;50%).

          -  Known severe liver disease (AST &gt; 3x normal, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin &gt; 2x
             normal).

          -  Patients with a clinically indicated stress test demonstrating significant ischemia
             within a year of enrollment which was not followed by percutaneous or surgical
             revascularization.

          -  Allergy to isosorbide mononitrate.

          -  Current therapy with phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil, vardanafil or
             tadalafil, since the combination of nitrates and phosphodiesterase inhibitors can
             result in severe hypotension.

          -  Therapy with rosiglitazone, since this combination is not recommended based on
             epidemiologic data suggesting that it may increase the risk of myocardial ischemia.

          -  Current pregnancy or a positive urine pregnancy test. Women who become pregnant
             during the study will be discontinued from the trial.

          -  Contraindications to a cardiac MRI: (i) Central nervous system aneurysm clips; (ii)
             Implanted neural stimulators; (iii) Implanted cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator;
             (iv) Cochlear implant; (v) Ocular foreign body (e.g. metal shavings); (vi) Other
             implanted medical devices: (e.g. drug infusion ports); (vii) Insulin pump; (viii)
             Metal shrapnel or bullet; (ix) Claustrophobia; (x) Extreme obesity rendering the
             patient unable to fit into narrow-bore scanners; (xi) Unwillingness of the patient to
             undergo a cardiac MRI. All patients with metallic implants will be individually
             evaluated prior to MRI.
