Therefore we examine the lung\n      function before and after surgery.\n\n      As a second purpose of the study, in a subgroup, we investigate the influence of the gas\n      insufflators (AirSeal and conventional) on hemodynamics during surgery. Furthermore we study\n      the change in the lung perfusion-ventilation-ratio by using the electric impedance\n      tomography technique."
