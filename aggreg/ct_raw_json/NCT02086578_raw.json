Currently, the standard way of giving radiation is with \"3D radiation\", which only\n      uses 2-5 beams of radiation. \"Multi-beam\" IMRT works by using 8-12 small radiation beams to\n      give a more \"tailored\" or \"customized\" radiation dose to the implant, breast, chest wall and\n      lymph nodes. At the same time, multi-beam IMRT may lower the radiation dose to the heart,\n      lung and nearby tissues. The goal of the study is to reduce complications after irradiation\n      to the implants.\n\n      The study doctors have recently completed a trial using this technique and are now\n      specifically looking at its impact on women with implant reconstructions who are undergoing\n      post-mastectomy radiation therapy. By delivering a more \"customized\" dose of radiation to\n      the implant, the intent is to reduce side effects of radiation on the implant."
