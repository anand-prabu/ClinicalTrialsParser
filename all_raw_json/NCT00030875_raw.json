Courses repeat\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      complete response (CR) receive 2 courses beyond documentation of CR. Patients with stable\n      disease receive a maximum of 4 courses. Patients with partial response (PR) continue therapy\n      until disease progression or for 2 courses beyond documentation of stable PR.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
