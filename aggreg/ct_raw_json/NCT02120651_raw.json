Most of the tympanoplasties are performed in\n      patients whose cause of perforation and hearing loss was chronic otitis media; this entity\n      affects the population between 0.5 to 30% , the statistics mention more than 20 million\n      people with this disease in the world. Since the introduction of tympanoplasty in the second\n      half of the nineteenth century there have been numerous publications nationally and\n      internationally about various experiences and new techniques. Including the use of fibrin\n      monomer . This procedure is usually performed with the use of hemostatic sponge and recently\n      with fibrin monomer, both materials are part of the basic input and surgical hemostatic\n      agents. In this hospital are performed on average 110 tympanoplasty per year which has a\n      percentage of non- integrity of the graft in the case of microscopic tympanoplasties using\n      hemostatic sponge of 16% which is similar to the index of lack of integrity of the graft in\n      microscopic tympanoplasties reported worldwide (18%), with the recent addition to the\n      service of fibrin monomer, was necessary to evaluate if this material contributes to the\n      integrity of the graft in microscopic tympanoplasty, as it has been reported in previous\n      studies, so if there is found more integrity with this material, it can be recommended for\n      routine use, improving the final prognosis of the patients."
