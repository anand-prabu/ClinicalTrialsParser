      Study population: Subjects with long standing symptoms from calcific tendonitis,
      non-responsive to other forms of conservative treatment

      Study method: A cohort of 50 patients with symptomatic calcific tendonitis will be treated
      by ultrasound-guided needle lavage. At baseline all study subjects will be assessed by
      clinical examination, imaging of the shoulder by x-ray and sonography and by the self-report
      section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES). Follow-up will be
      performed after 1 and 4 weeks (score only), 3 (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray), 6 and 12
      months (score only), and after 24 months (clinical, score, ultrasound, x-ray). Patients with
      insufficient treatment effect will be offered physiotherapy, re-lavage or surgical treatment
      by acromioplasty.

      Purpose of the study: The investigators want to find out

        -  if shoulder function, measured by a shoulder score, will increase during follow-up

        -  how much of the calcific material can be aspirated (in ml)

        -  to which extend the calcific deposit disappears on x-rays and sonographic images

        -  how many patients will need surgical treatment

    <description>The self-report section of the American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons score (ASES) consists of two equally weighted parts for pain and shoulder function, each contributing 50 points to a maximum score of 100. Pain measurement is performed on a 10 cm visual analogue scale divided into 1 cm increments. Shoulder function is measured by classifying 10 activities of daily living on a four-point ordinal scale. Change in points on the ASES scale from baseline to 24 month follow-up is the primary outcome measure of our study.</description>
