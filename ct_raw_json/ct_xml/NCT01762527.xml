  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol describes a Phase 2 clinical trial of online adaptive Radiotherapy, using a
      library of 3 dose plans corresponding to Small, Medium and Large size bladder. The procedure
      includes 'Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Effects'(CTCAE) for registration of adverse
      effects (baseline, every 2'nd week during RT, 2 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month after RT) as
      well as cineMR for intra-fractional motion (baseline and every week during RT). Patients
      receive standard non-adaptive RT in the first week. Delineations of the bladder on the
      Cone-Beam scans (CBCT) from first week of treatment are used for planning the Small and
      Medium size bladder plans. Large size plan are the standard non-adaptive treatment plan used
      for the first week of treatment. A margin of 5 mm for intra fractional movement is used.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After inclusion patients are asked about their adverse effects by an oncologist using CTCAE
      (version 4.0) questionnaire. A planning CT-scan is acquired and for the first 10 patients
      also a MR-scan for intra fractional motion is acquired. The MR sequence is repeated every
      week during radiotherapy. The first week of treatment a standard non-adaptive IMRT-plan is
      used and CBCT-scans are acquired before and after treatment. The CBCT-scans are used for
      delineation of the bladder on the CBCT-scans from the first 4 fractions. The adaptive plans
      are generated from the union of the first 4 CBCT-bladders and the planning CT bladder
      (medium size) and the volume contained in at least 2 out of the 5 bladder volumes (small
      size). Details can be found in the reference list. From the 6'Th fraction the treatment is
      performed using the most appropriate size of treatment plan. CTCAE is repeated every other
      week during radiotherapy and 2 weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24 month after radiotherapy.
