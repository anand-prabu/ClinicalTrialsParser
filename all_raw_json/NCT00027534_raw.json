Patients receive the infected ADCs intradermally and subcutaneously (SC) followed\n      by ADCs mixed with CMV pp65 peptide and ADCs mixed with tetanus toxoid SC and intradermally\n      on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 4, 8, or 12 immunizations in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive an escalating number of immunizations until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
