Some tumors become resistant to chemotherapy drugs. Combining\n      R101933 with paclitaxel or docetaxel may reduce resistance to the drug and allow the tumor\n      cells to be killed.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining R101933 with either\n      paclitaxel or docetaxel in treating patients who have metastatic breast cancer that has not\n      responded to previous chemotherapy."

Treatment repeats every 21 days for 7 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who have no disease\n      progression after 7 courses may continue with treatment at the investigator's discretion.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
