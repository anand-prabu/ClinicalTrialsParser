  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to compare the effect of double doses of a study drug
      known as insulin peglispro and insulin glargine in participants who have type 2 diabetes.
      Participants will be treated for up to 11 weeks, and will take part in two study periods.
      Each participant will receive insulin peglispro during one treatment period and insulin
      glargine during the other treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), based on the World Health Organization (WHO)
             classification, for ≥1 year.

          -  Use any type of basal insulin (except degludec), including once-or twice-daily human
             insulin neutral protamine Hagedom (NPH), insulin detemir, or insulin glargine.

          -  Have hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels ≤9.0% according to central laboratory testing at
             screening.

          -  Have body mass index (BMI) ≤40.0 kilogram/square meter (kg/m^2).

          -  Have been treated with stable doses of insulin for at least 30 days before screening
             with:

               -  Basal insulin with daily doses ±30% of mean during the last 4 weeks.

               -  Doses of a basal insulin must be between 0.3 unit/kg/day and 1 unit/kg/day.

          -  If on metformin, thiazolidinediones (TZDs), sodium glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT-2)
             inhibitors, or dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) inhibitors, must be on stable doses for
             the last 30 days.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Are using prandial, self-mixed, or premixed insulin. Participants using prandial
             insulin may be switched to everyday (qd) glargine if investigator judges that the
             participant will still meet fasting glucose requirements for randomization.

          -  Are using insulin pump therapy.

          -  Have excessive insulin resistance: Defined as &gt;1.0 unit/kg/day as baseline treatment.

          -  If being treated with sulfonylureas (SUs) before screening, then must have SUs washed
             out between screening and randomization.

          -  Use any of these concomitant medications: morphine, codeine, antidiuretics,
             glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (for example, exenatide, exenatide
             once weekly, lixisenatide or liraglutide), or pramlintide, used concurrently or
             within 90 days before screening.

          -  Have hypoglycemia unawareness, defined as confirmed by laboratory test results or by
             historical episodes of hypoglycemia &lt;54 mg/dL  (3.0 mmol/L) without symptoms.

          -  Have fasting hypertriglyceridemia &gt;400 mg/dL (&gt;4.5 mmol/L) at screening, as
             determined by the local laboratory.

          -  Have had any episode of severe hypoglycemia (defined by requiring assistance due to
             neurologically disabling hypoglycemia) within 6 months before entry into the study.

          -  Have had 2 or more emergency room visits or hospitalizations due to poor glucose
             control in the past 6 months.

          -  Have had a previous clinically significant episode of ketoacidosis as determined by
             the investigator (ketone bodies at fasting and without acidosis is acceptable) in the
             past 6 months.

          -  Have history of renal transplantation, are currently receiving renal dialysis, or
             have estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate (eGFR) &lt;60 milliliters/minute.

          -  Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms of liver disease (excluding nonalcoholic
             fatty liver disease), acute or chronic hepatitis, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or
             elevated liver enzyme measurements.

          -  Have active or untreated malignancy, have been in remission from clinically
             significant malignancy (other than basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer) for less
             than 5 years, or are at increased risk for developing cancer or a recurrence of
             cancer in the opinion of the investigator.
