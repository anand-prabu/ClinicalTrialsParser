Peripheral blood mononuclear cells\n      (PBMCs) and plasma are obtained from the blood, and T cells contained in the PBMCs are\n      transduced with anti-CD19 CAR gene by using SFG-1928z retroviral vector. Anti-CD19 CAR\n      expressing T cells (CD19-CAR-T) will be expanded using a medium containing  autologous\n      plasma.  After the T cells pass in quality control tests, the subject will go into 2nd\n      registration. Subjects will be hospitalized and administered Cyclophosphamide on Day -2 or\n      Bendamustine on Day -3 to Day -2 intravenously as Pre-treatment, and then subjects will\n      receive 1st infusion of  CD19-CAR-T on Day 0 and Day 1 (Day 1\uff1a1/3 dose, Day 2\uff1a2/3 dose) as a\n      split dose.  In case the sufficient cell number of CD19-CAR-T is manufactured, DLT is not\n      observed after CD19-CAR-T infusion, certain clinical effect is observed and additional\n      treatment is preferable, the necessity of 2nd infusion will be assessed. In the case that\n      2nd infusion is necessary, it is allowed to infuse at appropriate timing.\n\n      This study is conducted based on the 3+3 dose escalation scheme. Three subjects are enrolled\n      in each group of Dose Level. If one of the 3 subjects show DLT during DLT assessment period,\n      another 3 subjects will be added; therefore, decision as to whether the next Dose Level can\n      follow or not is made based on the results obtained from the total of 6 subjects.\n\n      The investigator assesses the tumor shrinkage effect of CD19-CAR-T in accordance with\n      \"Revised response criteria malignant lymphoma\", at 12 week after the 1st infusion of\n      CD19-CAR-T (or at the time of termination). The investigator also assesses the safety during\n      the follow-up period. Long-term follow-up study is conducted at frequency of once a year for\n      15 years after the 1st infusion of CD19-CAR-T in reference to guidelines of FDA."
