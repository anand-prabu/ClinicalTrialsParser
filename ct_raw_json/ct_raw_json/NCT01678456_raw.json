Incidence, clinical relevance and outcome after SAE is recorded and assessed by a\n      Critical Event Committee (CEC).\n\n      The CEC-members (experts in cardiology and neurology) defined as SAE any death with or\n      without relationship to AF, cardio-embolic events (stroke, peripheral arterial embolism),\n      bleeding complications due to antithrombotic therapy, acute heart failure, syncope,\n      resuscitation; additionally, the complication of interventional strategies for AF-treatment\n      and other AF-independent SAEs.\n\n      Over a 3-year follow-up period, during 6-monthly and unscheduled visits, the SAEs are\n      systematically documented, blinded and their relationship to AF will be interpreted in\n      detail by the CEC."
