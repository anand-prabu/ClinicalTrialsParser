            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine whether women with major depression lose bone mass\n      at a faster rate than women without depression. This study will also determine if the drug\n      alendronate can maintain or increase bone mass in premenopausal women with major depression\n      and osteoporosis.\n\n      Depression may be a major risk factor for osteoporosis; it is associated with abnormally\n      elevated stress hormone levels that may contribute to bone loss. This study will evaluate\n      bone mass in women with depression and healthy volunteers.\n\n      Participants will undergo psychiatric, medical, dietary, and stress hormone evaluations and\n      bone mineral density (BMD) measurements.\n\n      Participants with depression will be divided into two groups: those with normal BMD and\n      those with low BMD. Depressed participants with normal BMD will be compared to a control\n      group of healthy premenopausal women with normal BMD and followed for 36 months. Dual energy\n      X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) determinations will be made at months 6, 12, 24 and 36; bone\n      turnover and endocrine parameters of depression will be\n\n      measured every 3 to 6 months.\n\n      Participants with depression and low BMD will be randomly assigned to receive either\n      alendronate or placebo (an inactive pill) once a week for 24 months. Participants will\n      receive calcium and vitamin D supplements daily. DEXA determinations will be performed at\n      screening, and at Months 6, 12, 18 and 24;  bone turnover and endocrine parameters of\n      depression will be measured every 3 to 6 months.\n\n      For both groups, up to four of the visits may optimally be done as inpatient stays of two\n      nights.  All remaining visits are as outpatients."

            "textblock": "This is a five-year study on the natural history of bone turn-over in depressed\n      premenopausal women, ages 21 to 45 years, with normal bone mass, and the response to\n      treatment with alendronate in depressed premenopausal women, ages 21 to 45 with low  bone\n      mass (as indicated by a bone mineral density (BMD) of negative 1.5 SD below peak bone mass\n      at the spine and/or hip).  Osteopenia is defined as a BMD at the spine and/or hip that is\n      between negative 1.5 and negative 2.5 SD; osteoporosis is defined as a BMD that is below\n      negative 2.5 SD at the spine and/or hip.  During the initial screening, the women are\n      evaluated for depression.  Women who meet DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive\n      Disorder as indicated by a structured psychiatric interview (SCID-IV and HAM-D), will then\n      undergo a DEXA scan to determine BMD.  Participants will be divided into four subcategories\n      based on BMD results.  Premenopausal depressed women with normal BMD (less than negative 1\n      SD below the average peak bone mass at the spine and/or hip) (Group B) will be matched by\n      age, race, and body mass index to a control group of healthy, premenopausal, non-depressed\n      women with normal bone mass (Group A).  Groups A and B will be followed for 12 months with\n      DEXA determinations every 6 months, measurements of bone turnover markers every 3 months,\n      measurements of relevant endocrine parameters every 3 months, an exercise substudy at 0, 6,\n      and 12 months, and collection of a DNA sample at one of the above visits.\n\n      Women with depression and low BMD (negative 1.5 SD below peak bone mass at the spine and/or\n      hip) will enter a 12-month, placebo-controlled, clinical trial where they will be randomized\n      either to blind alendronate 70 mg once a week (Group C) or blind placebo once a week (Group\n      D).  In addition to alendronate 70 mg once a week or placebo once a week, women in Groups C\n      and D will also receive daily 500 mg of elemental calcium and 400 IU of vitamin D.  DEXA\n      determinations will be performed at Screening, Month 0, Month 6, and Month 12.\n      Determination of biochemical markers of bone turnover and endocrine parameters relevant to\n      depression will be performed at 0, 3, 6, 9 and 12 months.  An exercise substudy will be\n      performed at 0, 6, and 12 months.  The collection of a DNA sample will also be performed at\n      one of the above visits."
