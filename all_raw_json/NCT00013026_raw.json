Several classes of medications have been shown to\n      improve mortality in patients with CHF. Despite this these medications are widely under\n      prescribed.

Patient-based interventions\n      have been shown to be effective in implementing guidelines on CHF but they have been very\n      labor intensive.  A computer based intervention to implement CHF guidelines, if effective,\n      would be beneficial.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Patients with CHF consume a significant proportion of healthcare resources, with\n      exacerbations of CHF being the second most common reason for medical admission to VA medical\n      centers. Therefore, the main objective is to understand the impact of a tailored education\n      message program designed for direct use by patients on medical resource use. Other\n      objectives include understanding the tools impact on patient compliance and quality of life.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients have been randomized to one of two groups: 1) intervention group or the 2) control\n      group. The intervention group receives the tailored education messages program. This program\n      assesses patients\ufffd beliefs about compliance with medications, diet, and self-monitoring.\n      Based on identified barriers to compliance, intervention patients receive a tailored\n      educational message to dispel these beliefs and improve compliance.  The control group\n      interacts with a generic healthcare website. Patients in both groups are monitored for\n      hospitalization; emergent care visits, compliance with prescribed treatment and quality of\n      life\n\n      Status:\n\n      Project work is ongoing."
