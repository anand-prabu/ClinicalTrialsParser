  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Alive &amp; Thrive is an initiative that aims to improve infant and young child feeding
      practices and reduce childhood stunting. In Vietnam, Alive &amp; Thrive's primary intervention
      is implemented through a social franchise linked with the government's health system. The
      impact evaluation is conducted using a cluster-randomized design in which 20 commune health
      centers (CHC) were assigned to the social franchise model, and 20 CHC were assigned to
      routine government services. Repeated cross-sectional baseline and endline surveys will be
      used to assess the public health impact of this intervention. The baseline was in 2010 and
      an endline survey in the same communities will be conducted in 2014.  Mixed methods process
      evaluation will be conducted in 2011, 2012 and 2013 to study the pathways through which the
      program impact is achieved.
