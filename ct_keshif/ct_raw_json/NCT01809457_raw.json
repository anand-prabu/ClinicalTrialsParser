Poster will be sent to intervention group,\n      the school will place it at the notice broad or area of similar function in the classroom.\n      For the control group, nothing will be given, then after 2 weeks, the score of knowledge by\n      the second questionnaire of both groups will be collected again.\n\n      To compare the difference in knowledge before and after in both groups, statistical test\n      will be performed.\n\n      Investigators conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial. A list of secondary schools was\n      requested from the Education Bureau. Secondary schools will be invited to join the study and\n      then randomized to the intervention group and the control group in the unit of school using\n      computer generated numbers. All students will fill in the first questionnaire and send it\n      back to the investigator in 1 week. Then copies of the same poster will be given to the\n      intervention schools, these schools will be requested to place them in the classrooms of the\n      participating students. No poster will be given to the control group. After 2 weeks, the\n      poster will be removed. The same questionnaire will be filled out by all the students in\n      both groups and sent back in 1 week. Then the data will be processed to show whether the\n      poster is effective to improve the knowledge of the students."
