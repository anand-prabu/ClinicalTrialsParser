II. Assess the clinical\n      toxicities resulting from these regimens and from the immune response in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive polysialic acid keyhole limpet hemocyanin (PSA-KLH) conjugate or\n      N-propionylated PSA-KLH conjugate plus immunological adjuvant QS21 subcutaneously weekly on\n      weeks 1-4 and on weeks 8 and 16 for a total of 6 vaccinations. Patients are followed at 2\n      weeks, and then every 3 months for up to 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
