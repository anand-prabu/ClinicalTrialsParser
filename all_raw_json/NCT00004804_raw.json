If the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level has\n      normalized, the IFN-A dose is decreased in a stepwise fashion.  If the ALT level decreases\n      by more than 50%, IFN-A is continued at the same dose until week 24 or the ALT normalizes.\n      If the ALT level decreases by less than 50%, treatment is discontinued.\n\n      The second group is treated with standard-dose IFN-A administered subcutaneously twice a\n      week for 24 weeks."
