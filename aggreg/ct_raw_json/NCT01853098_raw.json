PAT involves a\n      combination of practicing mindfulness meditation and loving-kindness meditation in groups.\n      The goal of the research is to test the initial feasibility and efficacy in increasing\n      positive affect and decreasing negative affect in individuals recruited from the general\n      community who experience negative affect.  If the training proves to be successful, we will\n      test the intervention, in additional studies, on individuals with dysthymic disorder and\n      other clinical disorders. PAT is a cost-effective, non-invasive intervention. Therefore if\n      effective, it could be an alternative or supplemental intervention option to existing\n      psychotherapy for dysthymic disorder."

            "textblock": "Loving-kindness meditation (LKM) and mindfulness meditation, in which PAT is rooted, are\n      derived from Buddhist practices that have been empirically shown to have applications in\n      improving mental health. Throughout the 1990s and early 2000s, mindfulness based CBT was\n      shown to decrease stress, negative affect, and chronic pain in both psychiatric and\n      non-psychiatric subjects. Mindfulness-based therapy has since been shown to be effective for\n      treating mood and anxiety disorders. Only recently has LKM been examined as an intervention\n      for affective symptoms. This meditation practice seems to be particularly suited for\n      reducing negative affect while also enhancing positive affect in individuals who show\n      emotional dysregulation, such as people with dysthymic disorder. This notion is supported by\n      experimental studies suggesting that LKM decreases anxiety and stress, positively influences\n      emotional responses to neutral stimuli, and promotes positive emotions such as trust, love,\n      hope, and compassion. Dr. Fredrickson, a prominent researcher and social psychologist who is\n      the foremost expert in LKM will serve as an outside consultant for the development of the\n      protocol. She is not listed as an official collaborator because she will not be in direct\n      contact with the participant data that the investigators will collect.\n\n      The intervention the investigators plan to develop, Positive Affect Training (PAT), combines\n      mindfulness and LKM, with a strong emphasis on the latter. The investigators will adopt\n      strategies that have been described in a previous LKM protocol for trauma victims. The\n      investigators contacted Dr. Kearney who shared his manual with us. Given the impressive\n      effect LKM seems to have on generating positive, and attenuating negative affect in\n      experimental studies, the investigators plan to test PAT as a method of improving positive\n      affect. The current study aims to test the initial efficacy of PAT in individuals who report\n      experiencing a low mood. The investigators hypothesize significant improvement in subjects'\n      self-reported ratings of negative and positive affect as a result of the intervention."

Suicidality will be assessed after obtaining consent\n             during the screening visit. In addition, the Beck Depression Inventory will be\n             examined for self-reported suidicality.

These participants will be allowed to remain in the study, but\n             will later be excluded from the data analyses. They are allowed to remain in the\n             study for ethical reasons and because the present trial is a proof-of-concept study\n             and not a clinical trial."
