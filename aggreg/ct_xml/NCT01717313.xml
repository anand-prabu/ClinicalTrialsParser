  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-3102, dosed once-weekly
      in participants with T2DM who have inadequate glycemic control on diet and exercise. The
      primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, treatment with MK-3102 compared with placebo
      provides greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c (A1C).
