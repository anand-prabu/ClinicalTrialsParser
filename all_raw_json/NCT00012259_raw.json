Determine the response rate, in terms of achieving complete hematologic\n      remission, partial hematologic remission, hematologic improvement, partial response, or back\n      to chronic phase status, in patients with blastic phase chronic myelogenous leukemia treated\n      with troxacitabine. II. Determine the proportion of patients whose disease returns to\n      chronic phase and remains at that level for at least 3 months when treated with this drug.\n      III. Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the\n      duration of survival of patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive troxacitabine IV over 30 minutes on\n      days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 4 weeks until relapse.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study within 14 months."
