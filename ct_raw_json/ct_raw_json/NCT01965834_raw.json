Upon screening, registration and enrollment, all subjects will receive fenofibrate 160 mg orally daily for at least 2 months and may continue receiving study medication for as long as in the opinion of the investigator there is clinical benefit in doing so. Patients with calculated creatinine clearance < 50 mL/min will receive a reduced dose of 54 mg orally daily.  Fenofibrate should be taken daily at around the same time of day.  Patients will receive a diary to document administration."

            "textblock": "Multiple myeloma cells are dependent on calcium (Ca2+) for their function.  Specifically,\n      Ca2+ is required for the function of the endoplasmic reticulum in which proteins, including\n      immunoglobulins, are folded prior to their release from the cell. Multiple myeloma cells\n      secrete large concentrations of immunoglobulins continuously and as result depend on\n      mitochondria activity to replenish the Ca2+ levels in the endoplasmic reticulum as was shown\n      in vitro in our lab.  Fenofibrate has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial function resulting\n      in inhibition of protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum of MM cells that leads to the\n      induction of a stress signal known as the unfolded protein response and subsequently\n      apoptosis.  The effective anti-myeloma concentrations for fenofibrate are attainable in the\n      clinical setting as they are in the same range as the effective concentrations for\n      anti-hyperlipidemic effect.  The investigators propose to evaluate fenofibrate therapy in\n      multiple myeloma patients."
