  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether the Cogstate testing battery can detect improvements in
      cognitive function in participants with mild AD. The primary hypothesis is that the standard
      deviation associated with the change from baseline in average One Card Learning (OCL)
      repeated measurements after 12 weeks of donepezil treatment is =&lt;0.1
