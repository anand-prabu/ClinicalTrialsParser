  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment, or problems with thinking and memory, is common in multiple sclerosis
      (MS) and can occur independently of physical disability. It is the most common reason, along
      with physical fatigue, for MS patients to stop working. The most frequent complaint is
      problems with multi-tasking or thinking quickly, which corresponds to impairment in the
      cognitive domain of processing speed.  Currently there is treatment available to prevent
      relapses and physical disability but there are no medications that have been shown to treat
      cognitive impairment. Amphetamines have been beneficial for selective attention and
      processing speed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and traumatic brain
      injury. This is study will determine whether Adderall XR improves objective measures of
      processing speed and attention in MS patients impaired in this cognitive domain, by
      comparing two doses of Adderall XR (5 and 10mg) to placebo before and after the medication
      is administered. The results of this study will help provide data to design a larger study
      to determine if Adderall XR, and potentially other amphetamine drugs, will help treat
      cognitive impairment in MS patients.
