Toxoplasmic encephalitis (encephalitis caused by Toxoplasma gondii) is the most\n      frequent cause of focal central nervous system infection in patients with AIDS. If\n      untreated, the encephalitis is fatal. At present, it is standard practice to give a\n      combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine to treat toxoplasmic encephalitis. The high\n      frequency of sulfonamide-induced toxicity in AIDS patients often makes completion of a full\n      course of therapy difficult. There is some information that high doses of parenteral (such\n      as by injection) clindamycin used with pyrimethamine may be as effective as pyrimethamine\n      plus sulfadiazine in the management of the acute phase of toxoplasmic encephalitis in\n      patients with AIDS. Administration of parenteral clindamycin for prolonged periods of time,\n      however, is costly, requires hospitalization, and is inconvenient for the patient. There is\n      some indication that treatment of AIDS patients with acute toxoplasmic encephalitis with\n      oral clindamycin may be effective. Leucovorin calcium is useful in preventing\n      pyrimethamine-associated bone marrow toxicity."

Patients are initially treated in the hospital (minimum of\n      7 days). Patients who are considered responders at day 7 may complete therapy on an\n      outpatient basis. Nonresponders at day 7 may also be managed on an outpatient basis when it\n      is medically appropriate."
