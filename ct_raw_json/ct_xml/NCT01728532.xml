      METHODOLOGY:

      This study is performed only in adults who required a non-surgical root canal obturation.
      The studied indication is the root canal sealing.

      This multi-centre and open-label study comprises two groups corresponding to tested root
      canal sealer (a reference product and investigational product). Randomization is required.

      Investigational product that is a dental cement based on biosilicate technology (PA0903)
      will be applied with lateral compaction or single cone technique. On the contrary, reference
      product that is a zinc oxide-eugenol used in dental practice (Pulp Canal Sealer) will be
      applied with a single wave technique.

      Study start: 01/12/11

      Inclusion period: 6 months

      Study duration: 2 years after the end of inclusion period

      OBJECTIVES: The trial objective is to illustrate the clinical and radiographic outcome of
      PA0903 in the described indication.

      Primary objectives:

      The primary objective is to evaluate: clinical and radiographic outcome of root canal
      treatment at two years when using PA0903 as an endodontic sealer with gutta-percha. The
      success rate is defined as no pain (score of 0 at the VAS scale) and no LEO (fulfilment of
      Strindberg's criteria) Treatment was considered successful when the contours, width, and
      structure of the periodontal margins were normal. All cases in which those criteria were not
      fulfilled were judged as unsuccessful. A follow-up of two years is described as the
      predictive time of success.Secondary objective: The secondary objectives are to evaluate the
      following criteria and in an indicative way, to compare them between patients receiving the
      PA0903 and those receiving the reference product:

        -  The success rate at each time point and also the components of this composite variable
           (i.e. pain andfulfillment of Strindberg's criteria ).

        -  the handling, consistency and physical characteristics of PA0903

        -  the longevity and safety of the product associated with PA0903 after two years.

      TRIAL POPULATION AND NUMBER OF PATIENTS: about 60 patients will have to be included in the
      study, 20 by center with a ratio 2 (PA0903): 1 (reference). Adults will be included without
      gender distinction.

      Coordinating center Endodotontic service of Pitié Salpétrière Pitié Salpétrière Hospital
      75634 Paris Cedex 13 France

      DURATION OF TREATMENT:

      The product is applied on D0 (inclusion) of the study. The follow-up period includes 2 years
      with 4 visits: Visit 1(Week 2), Visit 2 (Month 6), Visit 3 (Year 1) and Visit 4 (Year 2).

    <description>Pulp Canal Sealer is a zinc oxide eugenol sealer that has a powder base and liquid catalyst. It is used for permanent obturation of the root canal space with the aid of obturating points. It is a nontoxic and non-irritating formulation that is radiopaque and has a long history of clinical success.</description>

    <description>Investigational product: PA0903 PA0903 that is dedicated to seal the canal is class IIa medical device. Once the sealing performed with PA0903 by the dentist, a coronal obturation is always placed after the canal obturation limiting the buccal environment access. Consequently, PA0903 is a type C implant according to ISO 7405:2008 guidelines and ISO 10993 guidelines.</description>
