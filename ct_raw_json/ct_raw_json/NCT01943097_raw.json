In this study, we explored the accuracy and\n      clinical role of (18)F-FDOPA and (123)I-MIBG PET in neuroblastic tumors.\n\n      METHODS:\n\n      Patients with tissue-proven neuroblastic tumors receiving (18)F-FDOPA PET or (123)I-MIBG at\n      initial diagnosis or during follow-ups were enrolled. The sensitivity and specificity of\n      (18)F-FDOPA or (123)I-MIBG PET were compared to each other and compared to(18)F-FDG PET,\n      using tumor histology as the standard."
