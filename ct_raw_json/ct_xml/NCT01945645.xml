  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A pre-randomized study in primary health care was designed to investigate  health education
      in a subpopulation extracted from general practitioners (GPs) in one Danish county in the
      treatment arm of the ADDITION (Anglo-Danish-Dutch Study of Intensive Treatment in People
      with Screen-Detected Diabetes in Primary Care) study, DK. The overall objective of the
      'Ready to Act' health education programme was to support the participants' competences in
      daily life and act appropriately with respect to their dysglycaemic condition. The
      achievement of action competence involved four learning objectives: intrinsic motivation,
      informed decision-making, action experience and social involvement. The programme was
      delivered in primary care settings (health centre or GP surgeries) by nurses, dieticians,
      physiotherapists and GPs.
