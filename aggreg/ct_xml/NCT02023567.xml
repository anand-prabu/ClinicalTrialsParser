  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders, with high
      recurrence rate, suicide rate and disability rate. It's reported that the global burden
      caused by MDD will be up to the second rank among all the disease burdens by 2020. China is
      also confronted with the daunting challenges against MDD. It's assessed that the monthly
      incidence of MDD is 6.1%, non-hospitalizing rate reaches up to 92% and the non-treatment
      rate is approximate 95%. However, to date, the pathogenesis of MDD is obscure and the
      current therapies don't work well. Therefore, it's urgent and critical to elucidate the
      pathogenesis of MDD, to develop early diagnostic criteria and effective intervention in MDD.
      Considering the diversity of weights on genetic factor and environmental factor in MDD, in
      this project, the investigators aim firstly to explore the effect of &quot;genetic-environmental
      interaction&quot;on the pathogeny of MDD for classifying MDD into &quot;genetic type&quot;, &quot;environmental
      type&quot; and &quot;others&quot; based on a case-control study. We next conduct the neurobiological,
      electrophysiological, neurocognitive and psycho-behavioral assessments among MDD,
      schizophrenia and healthy groups to screen the salient endophenotypes for establishing the
      diagnostic models of different MDD subtypes. The investigators further analyse the changes
      of these indicators after 8 weeks'medication or 8 times' MECT to select the potential
      predictors for therapeutic evaluations and interventional options in different subtype MDD.
      Finally, the investigators continue a 2-year follow-up study to test and verify the
      predictors of prognosis in different subtype MDD.
