However, the optimal combination of\n      bolus volume and administrating interval has not yet been compared. The purpose of this\n      prospective, randomized, double-blind trial was to determine how intermittent epidural bolus\n      reduced the incidence of maternal intra-partum fever compared with continuous epidural\n      infusion during labor."
