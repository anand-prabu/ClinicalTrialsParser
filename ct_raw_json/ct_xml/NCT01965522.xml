  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators plan to carry out a study to investigate two different pills, Vitamin D and
      melatonin, and whether they can reduce the spread of cancer cells in the tumors of women
      with breast cancer. These pills are inexpensive and have very few side effects. A large
      number of studies using cell cultures and animals have shown that both vitamin D and
      melatonin can help destroy breast cancer cells. However thoughtful and well-designed studies
      are necessary on humans to see if they can decrease the spread of breast cancer, and
      possibly even prevent breast cancer. The proposed study aims to understand the anti-cancer
      activity of vitamin D and melatonin. This knowledge will assist in creating efficient cancer
      prevention strategies for Canadians. This study will include women with breast cancer who
      are being planned for surgery, and will assess whether treatment with vitamin D (dose of
      2000 IU per day) in a group of 36 women, or melatonin (dose of 20mg per day) in another
      group of 36 women, or both pills together in yet another group of 36 women, reduces the
      spread of cancer cells when compared to a fourth group of 36 women who are treated with
      sugar pills. To do this we will measure a substance in the blood called Ki67, which provides
      information about the spread of cancer. Investigators will compare the Ki67 levels in the 4
      groups, and all women will receive identical appearing pills so they will not know which
      treatment they received.
