Equally important is the ease of use, good\n      visualisation and easy removal of the OVD from the eye. Currently, 3 popularly used OVDs as\n      a single injection sufficing for surgery are: Healon 5, DiscoVisc, and Celoftal (2%\n      hydroxypropylmethylcellulose). Whereas, there are studies showing efficacy of each of these\n      in clinical scenarios, there is no randomized trial comparing intraoperative performance and\n      postoperative outcomes. The aim of this study was to compare intraoperative performance and\n      postoperative outcomes following microcoaxial phacoemulsification when using one of the\n      three OVDs"
