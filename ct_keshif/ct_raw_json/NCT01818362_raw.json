A crossover design will allow comparison\n      of the two vaccines. Volunteers will be divided into 4 groups (n=12 in each group). Groups\n      will be recruited simultaneously to control for seasonal changes in influenza. This is\n      because at certain times of year there is likely to be a higher naturally acquired T cell\n      response to influenza than at other times due to circulating influenza virus in the\n      community."
