            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of irinotecan in combination with\n      raltitrexed in patients with refractory solid tumors. II. Describe and quantify the toxic\n      effects of this combination treatment regimen in a minimally pretreated patient population.\n      III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this combination treatment regimen. IV. Document any\n      antitumor activity of this combination treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of irinotecan and raltitrexed. Patients receive\n      irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on\n      day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan and\n      raltitrexed until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Additional\n      cohorts receive raltitrexed on day 2 rather than day 1 near the final dose levels of the\n      combination drugs.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
