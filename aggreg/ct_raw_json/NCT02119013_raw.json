Clinical and echocardiography parameters were evaluated at baseline and\n      study end. LV mass (M) and ejection fraction (EF) were calculated according to Devereux\n      formula and biplane Simpson's algorithm, respectively. LV filling was assessed by mitral and\n      pulmonary vein flow velocity curves and mitral annulus early diastolic velocity peak (Ea) by\n      tissue Doppler imaging."
