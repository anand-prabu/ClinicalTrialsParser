            "textblock": "Violence against children has profound effects on both children's health and their ability\n      to do well at school.  Fear, anxiety and injuries caused by violence may play a large role\n      in both children's absenteeism and low educational achievement, and there is increasing\n      interest from large bilateral donors in investigating this link in low income countries.\n      The Good School Toolkit has been developed and refined for 6 years in Uganda by Raising\n      Voices.  The toolkit takes a systemic approach, involving an entire school in a process of\n      change to reduce violence and improve teaching techniques.  The Toolkit draws on the\n      Transtheoretical Model and incorporates standard behaviour change techniques such as setting\n      a goal and making an action plan, which are effective in modifying behaviour.  This study\n      aims to determine whether use of the Good School Toolkit reduces children's experience of\n      violence by school staff.  The investigators will also examine the effects of the Toolkit on\n      children's educational outcomes, mental health and well-being.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a cluster randomised controlled trial in 40 primary schools\n      in Luwero District, Uganda.  More than 3500 children in Primary 5, 6 and 7 will be surveyed\n      (aged about 11-16 years).  Half of the schools will receive the Toolkit, and other half will\n      be put on a waiting list to receive the Toolkit at the end of the study.  The results from\n      this evaluation will be used to brief policy-makers within the Ministry of Education and\n      Sports involved in developing country-wide policy and practice around violence against\n      children in schools."

The Toolkit articulates complex ideas (what is a good learning environment, a good teacher, how to create positive discipline without using violence) through booklets, posters and school initiated learning processes.  Specific modules on alternative discipline techniques and how staff can use positive discipline are included in the Toolkit.  The intervention includes sessions on knowledge, attitudes and opportunities to practice new behavioural skills.  Work is led by teachers and students, and supported by visits from Raising Voices staff.  The Toolkit can be reviewed at (http://www.raisingvoices.org/children/good_school_toolkit.php).",
