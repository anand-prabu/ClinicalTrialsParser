This is done by starting at a dose lower than the one that does not cause side\n      effects in animals. Participants are given selumetinib and are watched very closely to see\n      what side effects they have and to make sure the side effects are not severe. If the side\n      effects are not severe, then more potential participants are asked to join this study and\n      are given a higher dose of selumetinib. Participants joining this study later on will take\n      selumetinib at higher doses, take doses twice daily or take for more days in a 21 day period\n      than participants who join earlier. This will continue until a dose is found that causes\n      severe but temporary side effects. Doses higher than that will not be given."
