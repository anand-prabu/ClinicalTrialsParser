Assess the qualitative and quantitative\n      toxicities of PZA on this schedule. III. Assess the response duration and survival of\n      patients treated with this agent.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive intravenous pyrazoloacridine (PZA) every 3 weeks in the\n      absence of progressive disease or unacceptable toxicity. Therapy continues in responding\n      patients until 6 months after a complete response or for 1 year, whichever is shorter;\n      stable patients receive a maximum of 4 courses. The dose is increased once for patients who\n      experience minimal toxicity. Patients who fail PZA are encouraged to continue therapy with\n      cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin/fluorouracil (CAF). All patients are followed for survival.\n      Prophylactic granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is not permitted.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 20 patients will be accrued over 7-12 months. If no more than 1\n      response is seen in the first 12 evaluable patients, accrual will cease."
