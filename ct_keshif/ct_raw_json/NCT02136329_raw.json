Identified as representing a high risk group for acute kidney injury using a modified\n             risk score based on the variables of Age, Sex, BMI, Smoking Status, NHYA class,\n             Previous Operations, Peripheral Vascular Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension,\n             Pre-operative Haemoglobin level, Pre-operative eGFR, Operative Priority, Operation\n             Type, Ejection Fraction and Presence of Pre-Operative Critical Events.\n\n          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential are not to be pregnant (to be confirmed by\n             urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test prior to dosing). Women are\n             considered not to be of childbearing potential if they have been surgically\n             sterilised (eg, tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or are postmenopausal\n             (defined as serum follicle-stimulating hormone level of \u226530 IU/mL) in the absence of\n             hormone replacement therapy and complete absence of menses for at least 24\n             consecutive months.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Emergency or salvage procedure\n\n          2. Ejection fraction <30%\n\n          3. CKD Stage 5, defined as eGFR<15ml/min or renal replacement therapy.\n\n          4. Administration of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors within 1 month prior to study\n             participation (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, imidazole antifungals and erythromycin,\n             please see Appendix 1 for a full list of prohibited medications).\n\n          5. Administration of nitrate medicines (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate within 24 hours of\n             surgery.\n\n          6. Any ongoing malignancy, or prior malignancy that currently requires treatment.\n\n          7. Patients allergic to any other PDE-5 Inhibitor\n\n          8.
