  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study in chronic stable Schizophrenia with the purpose to answer the question of
      whether agonism of the nicotinic alpha7 receptor is capable of enhancing cognition in a well
      defined chronic stable patient population treated with antipsychotics as standard of care,
      and thus to support the future development of AQW051 for the treatment of cognitive
      impairment associated with Schizophrenia (CIAS).

    <description>The primary objective is to evaluate the pro-cognitive effects of AQW051 in a chronic stable schizophrenic patient population at week 4 as measured by the absolute change from baseline in CPAL number of errors (CogState battery) at week 4.</description>

    <description>Change from baseline will be analyzed using a mixed model for repeated measures, including baseline value as covariate, time (timepoint), treatment as fixed effects and treatment*time interaction term and patient as random effect. Appropriate contrasts will be used to compare treatments at each timepoint.</description>
