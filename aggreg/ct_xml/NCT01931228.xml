    <textblock>
      Respiratory failure after extubation is a relevant consequence of  poor airway clearance due
      to respiratory muscle weakness and respiratory failure after extubation and reintubation is
      associated with increased morbidity and mortality.

      the study will evaluate the contribution of Mechanical Insufflation-Exsufflation (MI-E) in
      Preventing Respiratory Failure After Extubation as compared manually assisted coughing

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Critical Care Neuromyopathy (CCN) occur in 25% of patient in Intensive Care Unit (ICU).
      Respiratory failure after extubation is a relevant consequences of poor airway clearance due
      to respiratory muscle weakness. Respiratory failure is a major cause  for reintubation which
      increase severity of illness, this is an independent risk factor for nosocomial pneumonia,
      increased hospital stay and mortality. Currently, respiratory physiotherapy  includes,
      manual expiration assist often associated with nasotracheal aspiration. Despite of this
      care, respiratory failure occur in 30% of patients within 48  after planned extubation. MI-E
      has been evaluated for neuromuscular disease patient, and increase peak cough flow and the
      airway clearance. So the beneficials effects of MI-E should be confirmed in a trial in this
      specific population.

      We planned to conduct a study evaluating the efficacy of MI-E in the prevention of
      extubation failure and mortality in these patients. If no signs of respiratory failure
      appeared after 120 min of a spontaneous breathing trial, patients will be extubated and
      randomly allocated after extubation to MI-E group or control group. The clinical follow-up
      will be as follow: the incidence of extubation failure, the reintubation, the ICU or 28-day
      survival,90-day survival, ICU  length of stay.
