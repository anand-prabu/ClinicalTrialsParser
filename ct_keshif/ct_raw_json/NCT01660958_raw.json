There is an infancy phase and a preschool phase.\n\n      The infant phase is conducted through home visits - micronutrient sachets are distributed to\n      be mixed with food. The preschool phase is conducted in Anganwadi Centers. Hypothesis #1 is\n      that infants who receive both the micronutrients and the early learning intervention will\n      have better scores on measures of child development than children who receive neither.\n      Children who receive one of the two interventions will have intermediate scores.  Hypothesis\n      #2 is that preschoolers in Anganwadi Centers that receive the micronutrient-enriched food\n      wll have better scores on measures of child development than children in Anganwadi Centers\n      who do not.\n\n      The preschool phase is conducted in Anganwadi Centers (AWC), which are like preschools.\n      Preschoolers age 36-48 months are recruited. AWC are classified as high or low stimulation,\n      based on a rating system (Early Childhood and Childcare Environmental Rating Scale, ECERS).\n      AWC are randomized into 2 cells: 1) multiple micronutrient-fortified food or 2)\n      placebo-fortified food. Preschoolers receive the food in the AWC; their mothers receive\n      information on iron-rich food. For both phases, evaluations are conducted at recruitment and\n      after 6 and 12 months and focus on changes in the children's cognitive performance and\n      micronutrient (iron) status.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that innovative multiple micronutrient (MN) fortification\n      strategies for infants and preschoolers combined with early learning opportunities will\n      impact children's micronutrient status, growth and development in Nalgonda district of\n      Andhra Pradesh, India."
