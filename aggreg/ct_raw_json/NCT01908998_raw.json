The test is typically conducted in\n      barefoot. The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of footwear on Y-Balance test\n      scores.  The investigators hypothesize that by improving alignment and augmenting muscle\n      mechanics, sandals with medial arch support may improve Y-Balance scores."
