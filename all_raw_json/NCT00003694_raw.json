To estimate the toxicity of these two drugs given in combination in a cooperative group\n      setting.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess duration of hematological response and incidence of hematological progression\n      for all patients.\n\n      II. To assess duration of cytogenetic response in patients continuing protocol therapy\n      beyond the initial nine months.\n\n      III. To use quantitative Southern blot monitoring of blood samples to monitor molecular\n      response rates in patients entered onto CALGB treatment studies for CML.\n\n      IV. To compare quantitative Southern blot results of blood samples with marrow cytogenetics\n      at the time of complete molecular response.\n\n      V. To use RT-PCR to monitor the frequency of residual disease in patients who have achieved\n      a complete blood Southern blot and marrow cytogenetic response (elimination of BCR/ABL\n      positivity by Southern blot and absence of the Philadelphia chromosome by cytogenetics).\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive cytarabine and homoharringtonine concurrently by continuous intravenous\n      infusion for 7 days. Courses repeat every 28 days. Patients receive a minimum of 9 courses\n      of therapy in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity.

Minor\n      cytogenetic responders are switched to interferon, and nonresponders are removed from\n      therapy and given the option to switch to interferon.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months for 10 years."
