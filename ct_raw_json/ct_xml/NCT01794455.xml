    <textblock>
      This pilot proposal will test the hypothesis that altered cerebral vessel reactivity and
      cerebral hypoperfusion (decreased blood flow to the brain) is a core mechanism underlying
      the relationship between vascular disease and depression in older adults.  The long-term
      objective of this line of research is to: A) determine the relationship between vascular
      reactivity, cerebral hypoperfusion and the persistence of late-life depression and B)
      determine if improving cerebral perfusion with angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) improves
      depression outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study will examine how magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures of cerebral perfusion
      relate to antidepressant response.  There are two phases to the study.  In the first phase,
      we will examine how cerebral perfusion is related to response to sertraline, a commonly used
      antidepressant.  In the second phase, we will examine individuals who do not respond to
      sertraline or other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI).  We will examine if
      candesartan, an ARB, improves depression and if it does so by improving cerebral perfusion.

      After providing informed consent, participants will undergo medical and psychiatric
      screening.  Participants determined to be eligible at the screen will proceed to a baseline
      evaluation, which will include brief cognitive neuropsychological testing and MRI.
      Participants will then begin open-label sertraline for eight weeks (baseline to week 8).
      Dosing will begin at 50mg daily and, based on response and tolerability, can increase up to
      the FDA approved maximum dose of 200mg daily.

      After the eight weeks, participants will be re-evaluated and complete another MRI.  Those
      who respond to sertraline and experience remission of their depression will end their study
      participation.  Those who do not experience remission will continue to the phase 2
      open-label candesartan arm.

      The candesartan arm will last for 12 weeks (week 8 to week 20).  Dosing will begin at 4mg
      daily and can increase to a maximum dose of 32mg, based on tolerability and response.
      Participants will be monitored closely, and other antihypertensive medications adjusted to
      avoid low blood pressure.  At the end of the 12-week trial, participants will again complete
      MRI and neuropsychological testing.  Their study participation will then end.
