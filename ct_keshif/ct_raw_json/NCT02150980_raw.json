Despite this,\n      there is little empirical data in low and middle-income countries quantifying the burden of\n      fractures and the current practice of care.\n\n      Methods: INORMUS is a global, multi-center, observational study. The primary objective of\n      the study is to determine the mortality, re-operation and infection rates of musculoskeletal\n      trauma patients within 30 days post-surgery. The INORMUS study seeks to enroll 40,000\n      orthopaedic trauma patients from low-middle income countriesin Africa, Asia, and Latin\n      America."

The incidence of major complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) as a\n           composite outcome and as individual components within 30 days post-hospital admission.\n\n        2. The factors (system and patient variables) associated with the composite of major\n           complications (mortality, re-operation and infection) within 30 days post-hospital\n           admission.\n\n      Secondary Research Objective:\n\n      To determine the rates of major complications within 30 days post-hospital admission by type\n      of fracture treatment provided (e.g. splinting versus operative fixation).\n\n      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria:\n\n      This study has minimal exclusion criteria by design. All patients 18 years of age or older\n      admitted to a recruiting hospital for treatment of an orthopaedic injury that occurred\n      within 3 months will be eligible for participation. Patients who are diagnosed with an\n      orthopaedic fracture, dislocation, or fracture dislocation of the appendicular skeleton or\n      spine will be included.\n\n      Study Outcomes:\n\n      The primary outcome is mortality within 30 days from hospital admission for all of our\n      research objectives. The secondary outcomes are re-operation and infection within 30 days\n      from hospital admission.\n\n      Duration of Patient Follow-Up:\n\n      Study participants will be followed until 30 days post hospital admission."
