    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and efficacy data for participants
      treated with PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) and to provide ongoing access to PCI-32765 for
      participants who are currently enrolled in PCI-32765 studies that have been completed
      according to the parent protocol, are actively receiving treatment with PCI-32765, and who
      continue to benefit from PCI-32765 treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to
      collect long-term safety and efficacy data and provide PCI-32765 (Ibrutinib) access to
      participants in completed PCI-32765 studies. Participants will continue with the current
      PCI-32765 dosing regimen established in the parent PCI-32765 study until the investigator
      determines that the participant is no longer benefitting from treatment (ie, disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity has occurred), the study is terminated by the sponsor,
      the participant withdraws consent, alternative access to PCI-32765 is available and
      feasible, or for other reasons as defined in the protocol. Safety will be monitored
      throughout the study and summarized. Efficacy may be analyzed in combination with the data
      collected in the parent protocol. There is no formal hypothesis testing planned for this
      long-term extension study. Participants can receive a maximum of 3 years of treatment with
      single-agent PCI-32765 in this study.
