            "textblock": "Foot and ankle injuries account for nearly two million visits to Emergency Departments (EDs)\n      in the United States and Canada each year.  Of these injured patients, only 15% are\n      diagnosed with actual fractures of the ankle.  Due to such a small percentage, the \"Ottawa\n      Ankle and Foot Rules\" (OFAR) were developed, which are a set of clinical decision-making\n      guidelines that have been shown to be effective in diagnosing ankle and foot fractures.\n      These rules are internationally accepted by the medical community, but are inconsistently\n      applied.\n\n      At Lehigh Valley Health Network (LVHN), the ED triage nurses are routinely trained in how to\n      use the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules, but the rules are not always applied which may result\n      in unnecessary X-rays.  These guidelines are current network \"standard of care\" (usual,\n      established care) that allow nurses to decide treatment for foot and ankle injury patients;\n      in other words, whether to send these patients for an X-ray or not.\n\n      The research staff is conducting this study in order to find out if using these\n      nurse-directed guidelines--on a regular and consistent basis--can decrease the number of\n      X-rays ordered, decrease patient waiting times/length of stay (LOS) and increase patient\n      satisfaction with their care in the ED.\n\n      STUDY PURPOSE:\n\n      The two main goals of this study are to find out if use of the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules\n      by triage nurses can decrease the amount of X-rays ordered in the ED, as well as LOS.\n\n      Secondary study goals are to: 1) see how many X-rays are  ordered by physicians and\n      physicians' assistants after patients are evaluated by the Ottawa Ankle and Foot Rules as\n      not having had a fracture; and 2) evaluate patient and provider satisfaction with the care\n      provided both when the Ottawa Foot and Ankle Rules are used and when they are not."
