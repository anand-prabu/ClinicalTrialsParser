Ischemia will be assessed using: 1)\n      peak VO2: measures the peak transport of O2 to the tissues when O2 extraction from the blood\n      is maximal; 2) the anaerobic threshold (AT): measures the sustainable work capacity in units\n      of VO2; 3) the O2-pulse measurements at the AT peak VO2: estimate stroke volume at those\n      levels of exercise; and 4) the relationship of O2 uptake to work rate (\u0394VO2/\u0394WR): provides\n      information on the ability of the cardiac output to increase. Patients whoseCPET results\n      meet the criteria for ischemia will be started on Ranexa 500mg BID and advanced within one\n      week +/-4 days to 1000mg BID. A second CPET will be performed after 4 weeks +/- 4 days of\n      maximum therapy. CPET results before and after therapy will undergo a statistical\n      comparison. The initial off treatment CPET measurement will serve as the control to assess\n      changes found during therapy. No medication changes or revascularization procedures will\n      occur during the study. If patients require and undergo a medication change or a\n      revascularization procedure, they will be excluded from the study.\n\n      Patients will be contacted at the completion of week one prior to up titration, then at the\n      end of week two to ensure tolerance and compliance with the 1000mg BID dose. Patients will\n      perform the second CPET study at week four +/- 1 week. The trial medication will be assessed\n      and counted to ensure that patients have taken there allotted pill count for the duration of\n      the study. Patients who are found to be noncompliant of less than 80% will be excluded from\n      the study."
