            "textblock": "Many Activities of Daily Living involve precision grasp and fine motor manipulation, such as\n      putting toothpaste on a toothbrush or feeding oneself. However, children afflicted by\n      stroke, cerebral palsy, or traumatic brain injury may lose the ability to actively (and\n      accurately) control the thumb, and specifically abduct/adduct the carpometacarpal (CMC)\n      joint and flex/extend the metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint. We are testing the Isolated\n      Orthosis for Thumb Actuation (IOTA), a device developed at the Wyss Institute at Harvard\n      University in collaboration with Children's Hospital Boston, for assisting opposable thumb\n      grasping tasks. The IOTA contains an adjustable brace fitted to the thumb and dorsum of the\n      hand that is easy to put on and facilitates grasping motions through flexible cable-driven\n      actuators that assist with CMC joint abduction and MCP joint extension.\n\n      In this pilot study, we plan to investigate whether the IOTA can effectively facilitate the\n      ability of participants to perform a specific set of clinically relevant tasks conducted in\n      a clinic setting.\n\n      The hypothesis for this work is that the IOTA will significantly improve the participant's\n      performance on clinically relevant tasks."
