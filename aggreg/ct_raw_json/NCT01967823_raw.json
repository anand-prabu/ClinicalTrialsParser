            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with\n      cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the\n      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to\n      the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type\n      of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of\n      the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors.  In this\n      study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we\n      hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified\n      cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to\n      shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 18 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and\n           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests\n           as needed\n\n        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will\n           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells.\n           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the\n           patient.}\n\n        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital\n           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin.  They will\n           stay in the hospital for about 1-2 weeks to recover from the treatment.\n\n        -  Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab\n           tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to\n           1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking."
