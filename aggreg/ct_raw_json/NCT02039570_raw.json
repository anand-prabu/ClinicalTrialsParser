            "textblock": "Based on previous research, we believe that haemorrhoids could be caused by faulty valves in\n      the veins running from deep within the pelvic region to the lower part of the abdomen\n      (internal iliac veins)resulting in reflux in the tributaries.\n\n      We have already presented research showing that patients with severe pelvic vein reflux,\n      particularly of the internal iliac veins and tributaries, are associated with a higher\n      chance of haemorrhoids.\n\n      The aim of this study is to see in a group of patients suffering from haemorrhoids, whether\n      all of them exhibit pelvic vein reflux feeding into the haemorrhoids.\n\n      If we are able to prove that either all or the vast majority of patients with true\n      haemorrhoids do have pelvic vein reflux feeding into them, this will support our hypothesis\n      that the internal iliac vein and tributary reflux is causative of haemorrhoids.\n\n      following this, in a future study we will treat internal iliac vein and tributary reflux to\n      see if the results of haemorrhoid treatments are improved.\n\n      If we find only a few patients with haemorrhoids have associated internal iliac vein and\n      tributary reflux feeding into the haemorrhoids, we will be able to refute the hypothesis\n      that there is a causative association, and will not need to progress with the studies and\n      will look instead for a different aetiology.\n\n      At the current time, there is no effective way of investigating male pelvic vein reflux. The\n      gold standard investigation for pelvic vein reflux is transvaginal duplex ultrasound scan.\n      As such this study will be restricted to females presenting with symptomatically\n      haemorrhoids who are able and willing to undergo transvaginal ultrasound scan to assess\n      their pelvic veins."
