      achieving HIV remission (HIV RNA below the limit of detection of the assay) among

    <textblock>
      IMPAACT P1115 will explore the effects of early intensive ART on achieving HIV remission
      (HIV RNA below the limit of detection of detection of the PCR assay) among infants infected
      with HIV in utero.  Infants in this study will initiate ART within 48 hours of birth and
      will first be evaluated to determine whether HIV RNA can be detected in their blood while
      they are on ART.  Upon reaching two years of age, infants with undetectable HIV RNA will be
      evaluated to determine if they meet study criteria to stop taking ART.  Infants who meet
      these criteria will stop taking ART and will be monitored closely to determine whether HIV
      RNA remains undetectable while they are off ART.  For any infant who stops ART and then has
      HIV RNA detected, ART will be re-started.

      The study will also assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of early intensive ART in
      infants.

               -  ≥ 34 weeks gestational age at birth

               -  Able to take ARVs by mouth, nasogastric tube, or gastrostomy tube

          3. COHORT 2 MOTHERS

               -  Presumed or confirmed HIV infection (if presumed, must be confirmed within 7
                  days after study entry)

               -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent for maternal and infant
                  study participation

          4. COHORT 2 INFANTS

               -  ≥ 34 weeks gestational age at birth

               -  ≥ one nucleic acid test positive for HIV infection on a sample drawn within 48
                  hours of birth

               -  Started ART within 48 hours of birth on a regimen including 2 NRTIs plus NVP at
                  a dose of at least 8 mg/day for infants weighing ≤ 2 kg or 12 mg/day for infants
                  &gt; 2 kg AND/OR LPV/r

               -  ART regimen was taken daily from date of initiation until study entry

               -  Able to take ARVs by mouth, nasogastric tube, or gastrostomy tube

        Exclusion Criteria:

        INFANTS

          -  Any clinically significant diseases (other than HIV infection) or clinically
             significant findings during review of medical history or physical examination prior
             to entry that, in the investigator's opinion, would interfere with study
             participation or interpretation.
