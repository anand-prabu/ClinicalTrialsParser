To participate in the clinical trial, subject's blood of more than 60 ml should be withdrawn to make a study drug at least 3 weeks before administration. Subjects should visit to hospital according to the protocol and receive a study drug. Therapeutic response rate, overall survival rate, time to progression should be investigated."
