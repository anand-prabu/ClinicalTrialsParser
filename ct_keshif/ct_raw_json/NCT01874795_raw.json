It is a well-accepted assessment technique in the HF population with American and European associations  endorsing its use. CPX is most often performed on a treadmill or cycle ergometer using ramping protocols and the addition of ventilatory expired gas analysis to the standard exercise test enables measurement of oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production (VCO2) and minute ventilation (VE) over time. Moreover, CPX provides a host of variables that are  predictive of adverse events in HF patients, including peak VO2, the VE/VCO2 slope and the oxygen uptake efficiency slope (OUES).",
