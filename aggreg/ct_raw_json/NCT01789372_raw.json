The controlgroup had only usual treatment.The usual treatment consists of\n      pharmaceutical, cardio version and ablation. Quality of life ( SF-36, EQ-5d), blood\n      pressure, heart rate and 24-hours ekokardiografi were measured at baseline and after twelve\n      weeks.A follow up after six months was accomplished with SF-36 and EQ-5d, bloodpressure and\n      heart rate."
