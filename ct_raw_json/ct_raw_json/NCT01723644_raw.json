The objective of this clinical trial is to compare two strategies: clinical\n      reassessment and procalcitonin guided diagnostic and therapeutic strategy in patients with\n      community-acquired pneumonia. In the clinical reassessment arm, antibiotherapy is\n      systematically started in the emergency department. The continuation, the discontinuation or\n      the modification of the antibiotherapy initially prescribed in the ED were made at Day 1 and\n      Day 5 based on clinical assessment. On Day 1, the aim of the clinical reassessment is\n      diagnosis reassessment: to confirm or not the diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia and\n      to confirm or not the antibiotherapy. On Day 5, the aim of the clinical reassessment is to\n      evaluate the possibility to stop the current antibiotherapy based on criteria for clinical\n      stability defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (Temperature \u226437.8\u00b0C, Heart\n      rate \u2264100 beats/min, Respiratory rate \u226424 breaths/min, Systolic blood pressure \u226590 mm Hg,\n      Arterial oxygen saturation \u226590% or pO2 \u226560 mm Hg on room air). In the procalcitonin arm,\n      initiation and discontinuation of the antibiotherapy is based on the antibiotic stewardship\n      based on procalcitonin (PCT) cut-off ranges previously published. Re-evaluation of the\n      clinical status and measurement of serum PCT levels is mandatory after 6-24 h in all\n      persistently sick and hospitalized patients in who antibiotic are withheld. The PCT\n      algorithm can be overruled by pre-specified criteria, e.g. in patients with immediately\n      life-threatening disease. If the algorithm is overruled and antibiotics are given, an early\n      discontinuation of antibiotic therapy after 3, 5 or 7 days is more or less endorsed based on\n      PCT levels. In hospitalized patients with ongoing antibiotic therapy PCT levels are\n      reassessed on days 3, 5 and 7 and antibiotics will be discontinued using the PCT cut-offs\n      defined above."
