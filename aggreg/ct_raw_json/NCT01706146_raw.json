            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most common sustained abnormal rhythm of the heart, affects\n      an estimated 2.5 to 5 million individuals in the US, and can lead to stroke, heart failure,\n      and premature death. For those with AF and other stroke risk factors, chronic\n      anticoagulation is recommended to prevent intracardiac thrombus formation and stroke even if\n      the AF is infrequent or short-lived. This standard of care is based partly on our inability\n      to rapidly recognize and respond to AF recurrences which can often be brief and\n      asymptomatic, but exposes the patient to the risk of anticoagulant-induced hemorrhage even\n      during prolonged periods of sinus rhythm where the risk of stroke is presumably low.\n\n      Recent advances in device technology and drug therapy, however, have the potential to change\n      the way the investigators manage AF. The use of a small leadless subcutaneous implantable\n      cardiac monitor with remote data transmission capabilities (Reveal XT, Medtronic Inc.)\n      provides the ability to remotely and continuously evaluate a patient for AF recurrences,\n      even episodes that are brief and asymptomatic. In addition, release of unique oral thrombin\n      inhibitor approved for use in non-valvular AF(Dabigatran [Pradaxa], Rivaroxaban [Xarelto])\n      allows for rapid onset anticoagulation within minutes to hours of a single oral dose.\n      Together, these advances allow for continuous AF monitoring with targeted anticoagulation\n      only around the time of an AF episode, thereby reducing the risk of drug-induced hemorrhage\n      while still protecting against stroke.\n\n      The aim of this pilot study is to assess the feasibility of intermittent anticoagulation\n      with a rapid-onset oral thrombin inhibitor guided by a continuous AF-sensing implantable\n      cardiac monitor (Reveal XT) with remote data transmission capabilities."
