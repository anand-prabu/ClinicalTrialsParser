  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter occlusion and dysfunction are common complications of central venous access device
      (CVAD) use in children with cancer and hematologic disorders. These events can lead to
      interruption of therapy and may require device removal and replacement. Attempts to clear
      occlusion can cause device fracture.

      There is a clear link between catheter occlusion and other serious complications including
      bloodstream infection and intravascular thrombosis.

      There is evidence that catheter occlusion or dysfunction may be preceded by subclinical
      catheter narrowing, which could be detected by accurate measurement of catheter resistance.

      This study aims to describe the feasibility and results of catheter resistance monitoring
      (CRM) over time with the aim of prospectively identifying patients at high risk of catheter
      occlusion.

      If CRM is feasible and proves to be sensitive and specific, it could provide an opportunity
      for preemptive therapy to prevent occlusion, which might also prevent bloodstream infection
      or thrombosis.

      Weekly measurement of catheter resistance will be determined using the Alaris® Syringe
      Module (Carefusion Inc., San Diego, USA), a commercially available, FDA-approved intravenous
      (IV) pump which is able to deliver accurate flow-rates and obtain accurate pressure
      measurements. The inline pressure will be measured at multiple flow-rates and resistance
      will be estimated from the gradient of the pressure-flow curve.

      Primary Objective

        -  To describe the feasibility of weekly CRM in children and adolescents treated at St.
           Jude.

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To describe patient and caregiver adherence with weekly CRM in children and adolescents
           treated at St. Jude.

        -  To explore the correlation between results of CRM and catheter occlusion or
           dysfunction.
