    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe and the United States of America (USA). The aim of this
      trial is to evaluate compatibility and safety of FIAsp (faster-acting insulin aspart) and
      insulin aspart (NovoRapid®) with an external continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII)
      system in adult subjects with type 1 diabetes.
