Weight \u2265 45 kg and body mass index (BMI) between 18.0 and 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive, at\n             screening.\n\n          4. Nonsmoker and does not use tobacco-containing products (including, but not limited\n             to, cigarettes, pipes, cigars, chewing tobacco, or nicotine patch or gum).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria Subjects meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be\n        enrolled in the study.\n\n          1. The subject has a history of drug abuse (defined as any illicit drug use) within 1\n             year before screening or is unwilling to abstain from drugs throughout the study.\n\n          2. The subject is unwilling to agree to abstain from caffeine and alcohol-containing\n             products from 72 hours before check-in (Day -1) to completion of the final\n             assessment.\n\n          3. The subject has taken any prescription medicine or herbal preparations (eg, St John's\n             wort) or received any immunizations within 30 days before check-in (Day -1).\n\n          4. The subject has taken any OTC medications or vitamin supplements within 14 days\n             before check-in (Day -1). The subject is unwilling to agree to abstain from\n             consumption of grapefruit or grapefruit-containing products from 72 hours before\n             check-in (Day -1) to completion of the final assessment.\n\n          5. The subject has current or recent (within 6 months) history of gastrointestinal\n             disease that would be expected to influence the absorption of drugs.\n\n          6. The subject has a positive test result for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C\n             virus (HCV) antibody, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody or antigen, or\n             serological reactions for syphilis at screening.\n\n          7. The subject has a clinically significant ECG abnormality at screening or check-in\n             (Day -1) or a QTc interval (by Fridericia's correction) of 450 msec or greater, or\n             the subject has a history of cardiac disease.\n\n          8. The subject has abnormal laboratory values suggesting a clinically significant\n             disease at screening or check-in (Day -1) .\n\n          9. Female subjects who are lactating and breastfeeding or pregnant before the first dose\n             of study drug.\n\n         10.
