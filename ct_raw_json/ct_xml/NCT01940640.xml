  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, the investigations in the field of the supplementation with DHA in premature babies
      have been focused on the study of neuronal and visual development, giving place to
      contradictory and ambiguous results, because they did not consider in many cases important
      aspects of this supplementation, such as the mother´s diet, dose, duration, etc., and
      precise studies have not been performed in the field of the oxidative damage, inflammation
      and bone development in this population.

      Hypothesis: If the composition of the mother´s milk is modified on the basis of her diet, a
      mother supplementation with high doses of DHA will increase proportionally the levels of
      this fatty acid in her milk, fact that will allows the premature newborn child receive a
      major dose of this fatty acid, and therefore this way, we will manage to improve the
      neuronal and visual development and to take part on the inflammatory process, oxidative
      damage and its evolution, together with the development or bone mass increase in the
      premature baby.

      Aims: Overall we aim to evaluate in a multidisciplinary way the effect of a mother
      supplementation during the lactation with high doses of DHA on the development and wellness
      of the premature newborn children. We try to deepen into the effect on the neuronal and
      visual development and to study, for the first time, the effect on the oxidative damage,
      pro- and antiinflammatory citoquines activity and bone metabolism in this group of newborn
      babies.

      Experimental design: We will establish two groups of premature newborn children (&lt;34 weeks)
      (n=40). The mothers of one of the groups of premature newborn children will receive an oral
      supplementation by means of capsules with high dose of DHA (900 mg/day) during the lactation
      (minimum period of 3 months). In addition, all the groups will be underwent to a nutritional
      surveillance (a follow-up of 48 hours and a questionnaire of frequency of consumption) and
      will be given nutritionally-balanced diets, insisting especially in the suitable consumption
      of fish (4 portions/week). Blood samples will be obtained in all the groups at the birth
      moment, at the week 40 of gestational age corrected in the groups of premature babies and at
      the end of the lactation in all the groups (minimum 3 months).We will obtain samples of
      mother´s milk (colostrum, transition and mature milk). In these samples we will study bone
      turnover biomarkers, pro - and anti-inflammatory citoquines and markers of aggression
      oxidative damage. In addition, we will perform psychomotor and visual development tests in
      the newborn children.
