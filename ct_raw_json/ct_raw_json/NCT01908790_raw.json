Furthermore, cardiac output (CO) measured from the Mespere VA Oximeter\n      using the jugular vein and finger pulse oximeter will be compared to CO typically measured\n      in practice using the central line, finger pulse oximeter, and Fick's equation."

            "textblock": "The conventional pulse oximeter has been a standard in clinical care for non-invasive\n      hemodynamic monitoring, which only measures arterial blood oxygenation.  The clinical\n      application of venous oximetry is numerous, including severe sepsis and septic shock, severe\n      trauma and hemorrhagic shock, and heart failure and cardiac arrest.\n\n      The existing method for venous blood oxygenation monitored is either through an invasive\n      fiber optic catheter, or intermittently by blood sampling and CO-Oximetry.  However,\n      catheterization can be costly and can include inherent risks.  Therefore, due to the\n      inherent risks of catheterization, venous oximetry is limited only to critically ill\n      patients.\n\n      By non-invasively monitoring both venous and arterial blood oxygenation, Mespere VA Oximeter\n      provides more complete information on patient hemodynamics and has clear advantages over\n      conventional pulse oximeters."
