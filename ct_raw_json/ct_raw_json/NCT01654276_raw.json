            "textblock": "The metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterized by a constellation of metabolic features\n      including dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and insulin resistance. This\n      cluster of features is strongly associated with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic\n      cardiovascular disease, and increased cardiovascular and all-cause mortality. Hyperuricemia\n      (elevated serum uric acid) is associated with insulin resistance and features of the MS in\n      cross-sectional epidemiological studies. However, it remains unclear whether this\n      association is causal or simply coincidental. If hyperuricemia CAUSES insulin resistance,\n      then lowering serum uric acid by pharmacological means may result in improved insulin\n      sensitivity and reversal of features of the metabolic syndrome.  In some recent small\n      studies, lowering serum uric acid with allopurinol was associated with improvement in some\n      of the features and/or complications of the MS: Allopurinol use resulted in reduction in\n      blood pressure in adolescents and improvement in exercise capacity in patients with chronic\n      stable angina. A low urine pH is strongly associated with insulin resistance, and individual\n      features of the metabolic syndrome. Similarly, a low fractional excretion of uric acid is\n      also associated with metabolic syndrome feature. We therefore would like to examine the\n      effect on febuxostat on these two parameters which have been linked with the metabolic\n      syndrome.\n\n      The goal of this study is to evaluate whether pharmacological lowering of serum uric acid\n      with the medication febuxostat is associated with improvement in the degree of insulin\n      resistance and various features of the metabolic syndrome."
