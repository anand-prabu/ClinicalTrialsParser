This study is being conducted by Dr. Balamurali Ambati at the\n      Moran Eye Center at the University of Utah.\n\n      The cornea is the clear outer front part of the eye. In corneal neovascularization, blood\n      vessels grow over the cornea. Corneal neovascularization and ocular anterior segment\n      inflammations are sight-threatening conditions. Lipid deposition and edema with subsequent\n      scar formation can compromise corneal clarity irreversibly. Corneal neovascularization is\n      also a well recognized risk factor for corneal graft failure. In its natural state, the\n      cornea is a site of immune privilege well suited to tissue transplantation. Once\n      vascularized, there is direct exposure of corneal antigens to circulating host immune\n      mechanisms greatly increasing the chance of rejection [Collaborative Corneal Transplantation\n      Study].\n\n      Melting or inflammation in the anterior chamber, cornea, or ocular surface can cause\n      irreversible scarring or destruction of the optical elements of the eye, which can\n      compromise vision.\n\n      Current standard of care for such conditions includes use of topical steroids and sometimes\n      immunosuppressants (e.g., cyclosporine). These do not address a common underlying corneal\n      neovascularization or melting.\n\n      This is a Phase 1 clinical trial of subconjunctival IVIg (Gamunex-C) injection for treatment\n      of corneal neovascularization in the setting of corneal transplantation with\n      neovascularization. Candidates for corneal transplantation with corneal neovascularization\n      in one or more quadrants crossing more than 0.5mm over the limbus will be identified for\n      inclusion in our study."
