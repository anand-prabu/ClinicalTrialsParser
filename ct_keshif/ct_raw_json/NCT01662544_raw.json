Multiple supportive therapies have been tried in infants with bronchiolitis\n      including albuterol, racemic epinephrine, hypertonic saline nebulization, but to date\n      supportive therapy with oxygen is the only proven therapy to decrease respiratory distress\n      in infants with bronchiolitis, with hypertonic saline showing a borderline statistically\n      significant improvement.  This prospective, randomized study will compare CSS and PEWS\n      scores on infants who receive oxygen by standard flow nasal cannula and to those who receive\n      oxygen via Humidified High-Flow Nasal Cannula (HHFNC).  The results will help determine if\n      infants with viral bronchiolitis who receive humidified high flow nasal cannula oxygen\n      therapy have improved Clinical Severity Score (CSS) and Pediatric Early Warning System\n      (PEWS) scores and ultimately decreased lengths of admissions when compared to patients\n      treated with nasal cannula oxygen therapy with/without bronchodilator therapy.\n\n      Hypothesis Heated Humidified High-flow Nasal Cannula Delivery of Oxygen decreases\n      respiratory distress as measured by pediatric CSS and PEWS when compared with routine nasal\n      cannula oxygen delivery in infants with bronchiolitis."
