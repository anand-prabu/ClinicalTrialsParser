Palliative care\n      intervention will involve use of pancreas cancer-specific decision aides (iPC3)about\n      prognosis, treatment choices, and advance care planning for patients facing a treatment\n      decision as well as symptom assessments. We hypothesize that palliative care consultations\n      with iPC3 will be accepted, symptoms can be diminished, information can be received in a way\n      that improves choices, and that the quality of care can be improved."
