Secondary objective: To\n      establish the safety of short-term administration of AZT and valproic acid in combination\n      with regard to hematologic parameters and liver function in asymptomatic HIV-infected\n      patients.\n\n      Preliminary studies using human liver tissue have shown that valproic acid inhibits the\n      metabolic inactivation of zidovudine (AZT), which may prolong the plasma half-life of AZT\n      and thus prolong the duration of the drug's effects in the body."

On days 6 through 9, patients receive AZT orally every 8 hours in\n      combination with valproic acid (lowest dose in the first 5 patients and a higher dose in\n      patients 6 and 7) orally every 8 hours. On day 10, AZT and 1 of the 2 doses of valproic acid\n      are given orally as single doses, followed by pharmacokinetic sampling. AZT is continued\n      alone orally every 8 hours on days 11 through 14, then resumed at the patient's usual dose\n      beginning on day 15. Per 03/09/92 amendment, dosing schedule may be modified slightly to\n      accommodate patients with scheduling conflicts."
