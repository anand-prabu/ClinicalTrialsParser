  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, prospective, randomized, controlled study being conducted in China to
      evaluate improvement of lung function after treatment with the Spiration Valve System as
      compared to medical management in the control group. The control group will be evaluated in
      the same manner as the treatment group.

      The Spiration Valve is a small, umbrella-shaped, one-way valve that is placed inside the
      airways of one lung. It is used to redirect air from the less healthy to the more healthy
      parts of the lung. This helps to reduce over-inflation and may improve overall lung function
      and quality of life for people living with emphysema.
