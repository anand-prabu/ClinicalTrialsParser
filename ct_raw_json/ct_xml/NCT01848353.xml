  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Among youth populations, American Indians have the highest prevalence of diabetes in the
      United States.  This study will use exercise as the principal lifestyle modification
      approach to reduce the risk of diabetes in this population.  The Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma
      has several excellent, but underutilized wellness facilities in their Health Services Area
      in rural Southeast Oklahoma, a low socioeconomic region.  It has been established that
      exercise lowers diabetes risk, and many obese, insulin resistant American Indian youth who
      live in this region would benefit from an increase in regular exercise.  The challenge is to
      modify behavior so that routine exercise is established and maintained.  The proposed study
      will test whether monetary incentives can elicit greater frequency and duration of exercise
      in American Indian youth when transportation and access barriers are reduced.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to exercise on 3 days per week for 48 weeks.  Clinical and
      physical assessments will be performed at baseline and after 16, 32 and 48 weeks.
      Participants will be randomized into one of two groups.  Each group will receive payment for
      exercise sessions completed but one group will be on a fixed schedule of compensation and
      the other will have a schedule that incentivizes frequency or duration of exercise.

    <description>Frequency and duration of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity will be measured using heart rate monitors.  The monitors will be worn each exercise session.  Participants are asked to complete 3 exercise sessions per week throughout the 48-week period of enrollment.  The primary comparison between the experimental and active comparator groups will be the volume of exercise (total time) accumulated.  Comparisons will be made for accumulated exercise volume at 16, 32, and 48 weeks and the change from baseline (week 0).</description>

    <description>Fasting blood glucose and insulin concentration will be measured and used to calculate the homeostatic model of assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).  Testing will be performed at baseline (week 0) and weeks 16, 32, and 48.  Data analysis will focus on the change from baseline and whether that change differs between groups.</description>

    <description>All participants will perform exercise training.  Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise  session lasting at least 20 minutes during weeks 1-16 (phase 1).   All exercise recommendations and outcome tests will be same for this group as the experimental group so that the two groups differ only in the financial incentives they receive for exercise behavior.</description>

    <description>All participants will perform exercise training.  Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise  session lasting at least 20 minutes during weeks 17-32 (phase 2).

    <description>All participants will perform exercise training.  This phase will last from weeks 33-48 (phase 3).  Participants in this arm will receive a fixed amount of money for exercise  session lasting at least 20 minutes, but the value of the payments will decrease weekly (ramp-down) until reaching zero in week 41.
