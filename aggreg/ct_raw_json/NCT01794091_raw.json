This study is looking at the importance of \"diffuse scar tissue\"\n      that is found in the heart of diabetic people. We have discovered a way to detect diffuse\n      scar tissue by cardiac MRI, a non-invasive test. In this study, we do cardiac MRI on\n      diabetics with low risk stress test results and follow them for 5 years to see if the\n      measure of scar tissue in the heart by MRI is related to events. If this study is positive,\n      we will be able to use cardiac MRI scar tissue measurements to target those patients with\n      diabetes who are at highest risk."
