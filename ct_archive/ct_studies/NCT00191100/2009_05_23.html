<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of two methods of treating cancer of the cervix. Half the patients will receive gemcitabine plus cisplatin while undergoing radiation therapy, followed by adjuvant gemcitabine and cisplatin and the other half will receive cisplatin along with radiation therapy without adjuvant therapy.</p>
