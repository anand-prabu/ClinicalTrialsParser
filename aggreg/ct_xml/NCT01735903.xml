    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the effect of nerve decompression on the recovery of
      the treated nerves.  To obtain objective data during surgery of the treated nerves' via
      electrical signals and muscle power when stimulated.  Also, to monitor muscle strength,
      balance/gait and blood flow in the lower extremity before and after surgery.

    <textblock>
      Nerve decompression (ND)as treatment for the foot complications of diabetic sensorimotor
      peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) is a controversial topic although many patients find it
      provides gratifying relief of pain and numbness. Neural electrical monitoring has been used
      intra-operatively to diagnosis nerve abnormality, monitoring for ongoing normal nerve
      function and confirm nerve integrity for spine surgeries and thyroid surgeries with success.
       Presently there is not objective data to indicate the the use of neural electrical
      monitoring is reliable or effective.  The goal of this study is to measure objectively and
      quantifiable clinical surgical outcomes of nerve decompression surgery in diabetic
      neuropathy patients.  The study is designed to measure changes in nerve function, gait,
      balance and blood flow in the lower limb.

    <description>Primary Endpoint is assessed by changes in:
Neuromotor function in the lower limb as measured by intraoperative electromyographic(EMG) recordings of the muscles in the anterior and lateral compartments of the leg and muscles of the foot.
Blood flow in the lower limb both distal to and proximal to the nerve  release sites, as measured by duplex doppler of the external femoral artery (a.), superficial femoral a., popliteal a., anterior and posterior tibial a., dorsal pedis a.  Shear stress changes in these arteries.
Lower limb performance defined as:
Dorsiflexor strength and speed of contraction
Proprioception at the ankle
One-legged standing balance
Functional reach
Sensory function in the foot
Usual gait speed
Standardized tests of mobility</description>

    <description>Arm A will enroll patients WITHOUT diabetes, but with peripheral neuropathy and lower limb pain, paresthesia, gait disturbances, or motor weakness and will follow the same protocol except the subject will NOT participate in blood flow testing performed at Colorado State University.
Subjects may have any combination of lower limb nerve decompression surgery of the listed surgical sites with or without the addition of Soleal Sling Decompression.  Soleal Sling Decompression surgical procedure will require the use of a thigh tourniquet.</description>
