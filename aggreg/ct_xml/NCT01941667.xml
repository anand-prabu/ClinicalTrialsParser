  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to determine if additional, increased contact with infants and
      families discharged to home after cardiac surgery improves infant and parent outcomes as
      compared to usual care.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators want to compare videoconferencing (SKYPE or FACTIME) and a monitoring
      system called Buddy Check is helpful. Buddy Check is a web-based tool using speech and
      internet technology to maintain contact with the health care team.

      Infants are randomized to usual care or the intervention which uses automated daily phone
      calls and 2 virtual home visits each week. Weights, oxygen levels, and amount of food taken
      are obtained by the primary caregiver (parent) daily and sent via automated phone call, text
      message or email messages based on primary caregiver's desired.
