The investigators believe that the absorption of\n      the small molecule radiopharmaceutical Indium 111 diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid\n      (In-DTPA) will indicate changes in liquid absorption in the airways and demonstrate whether\n      new CF medications will be effective. In this study the investigators will determine whether\n      the imaging technique will demonstrate similar results when it is repeated on different\n      days.  They will also determine how their results change when subjects utilize several\n      common CF medications."

            "textblock": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive genetic disease, caused by mutations of the\n      Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) that impairs ion transport at\n      epithelial surfaces. This results in the accumulation of dehydrated secretions in the\n      airways and chronic infection and inflammation in the lungs, leading to significant\n      morbidity and mortality. The investigators understanding of CF pathogenesis has increased\n      substantially and many new targeted therapies are being developed to treat this disease,\n      however, the measurements of clinical efficacy used to evaluate these therapies require long\n      trials to demonstrate an effect. New translational techniques are needed to assess changes\n      in the most basic aspects of the disease and allow for the rapid screening of\n      disease-altering therapies. The investigators have recently developed a novel aerosol-based\n      imaging technique to measure liquid absorption in the airways - a central pathophysiological\n      process related to CFTR dysfunction. The investigators propose that airway liquid\n      hyper-absorption is a key link between cellular defects in ion and fluid transport and\n      progressive airway dysfunction in CF. Thus The investigators technique may provide a measure\n      of disease severity and rapid indication of therapeutic correction in advance of currently\n      available outcome measures."
