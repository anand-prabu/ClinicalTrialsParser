Family members and/or friends often assist older adults in their health\n      care and may help overcome barriers to formal care, yet there is a lack of primary\n      care-based interventions that mobilize family members and friends to improve depression\n      treatment.  In partnership with a community-based clinic, this research will address this\n      scientific gap by developing and then testing the feasibility and acceptability of a\n      family-based intervention that can be delivered pragmatically in a primary care setting\n      serving large numbers of older minorities."

            "textblock": "The family-based intervention will be tested in a 6 month randomized controlled trial of 24\n      depressed older men-family member dyads (18 intervention and 6 controls).  The purpose of\n      the RCT is to test the acceptability of the intervention, as well as the feasibility of the\n      study methods.  Patients from the RCT will be identified from a family practice clinic based\n      on their scores on the PHQ-9 as well as additional inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Once\n      they and their family member have agreed to participate, patients will be randomized either\n      to the family based intervention or a usual care control condition augmented by family\n      psychoeducation. The investigators will recruit English and Spanish speaking age 60 and\n      above older men from SJGH who have 1) significant depressive symptoms (i.e. PHQ > 15, 2)\n      have at least one criteria A symptom (depressed mood or anhedonia), 3) depression-related\n      functional impairment) and 4) an adult family member willing to participate in the study.\n      We have chosen a higher cut-off to minimize false positives.  We will exclude psychotic,\n      demented or institutionalized men.  After enrollment, 24 dyads (i.e. older man and family\n      member) will be randomized one of two groups: intervention or usual care augmented by\n      written psychoeducational materials on depression. Dyads will be randomized to achieve a 2:1\n      ratio of intervention versus usual care dyads (i.e. 18 intervention and 6 control dyads).\n      To ensure adequate numbers of ethnic minority patients in each arm of the trial, we will\n      conduct a stratified randomization such that each arm of the RCT is 50% English language\n      preferring and 50% Spanish language preferring (i.e. 3 in control and 9 in intervention\n      arm).  The research assistant conducting subject assessment at baseline, 1-month, 3-months\n      and 6 months will be blinded to intervention and control assignments."
