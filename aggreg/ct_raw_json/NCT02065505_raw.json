The most obvious implication is postural\n      asymmetry, having direct relation to respiratory pressures are also reduced due to muscle\n      weakness, thus altering the respiratory capacity of these individuals. The Pilates Method is\n      gaining prominence in clinical and scientific areas, contributing to restoring good posture\n      and vertical alignment of the body. Therefore, this study aims assess muscle electrical\n      activity, respiratory capacity and functionality of spastic hemiparetic patients before and\n      after application the Pilates Method, soil and therapy pool. A randomized study where 60\n      hemiparetic participate will be held with brachial predominance and 30 healthy subjects\n      (Control Group), of both sexes, ages 40 to 70 years. Individuals with hemiparesis will be\n      randomly assigned through a lottery and half held 10 consecutive sessions of Pilates in the\n      soil and the rest will the same protocol adapted for therapy pool. The control group will be\n      treated by the Pilates Method in the soil. The exercises will aim to lengthen musculature\n      shortened due to postural pattern of pathology ; strengthen selected muscles that give\n      support and postural musculature more important upper limb for activities of daily living.\n      Participants will undergo postural assessment, activity EMG, muscle strength, respiratory\n      capacity analysis and evaluation of the functionality of the upper limbs on the first day of\n      treatment and after doing all sessions. The Student's t test will be used, with a\n      significance level of 5 % to compare results obtained before and after treatment. After the\n      tests, the Pearson correlation will also be made \u200b\u200bbetween the data obtained in soil and\n      therapy pool. Thus, it is expected that Pilates can improve postural alignment and the\n      breathable hemiparetic and the strengthening of specific muscles of the upper limbs assist\n      in improving the functionality of them in their daily activities."
