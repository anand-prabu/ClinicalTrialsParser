Sedative doses\n      may be reduced if necessary.  Treatment is continued until sedation is no longer needed, any\n      other sedative therapy is administered, or unacceptable toxicity is experienced.\n\n      Patients are assessed after extubation, just prior to hospital discharge, and then every 2\n      months for 6 months after hospital discharge."
