The etiology of TW is\n      still not fully understood.\n\n      Patients and Methods:\n\n      This is a prospective randomized study including 60 patients, conducted in a Level I trauma\n      center in Innsbruck, Austria. The study protocol was approved by the hospital ethics\n      committee. This study is planned and conducted following the Consolidated Standards on\n      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines. Aperture fixation is performed using BioComposite\n      interference screws (Arthrex, Naples, FL). Extracortical fixation is performed using the ACL\n      Tightrope (Arthrex, Naples, FL). TW is measured on CT scan postoperative, after 6 and 24\n      months. Clinical outcome is determined at 1, 2 after reconstruction, IKDC with KOOS\n      Knee-related QoL subscale, Lysholm, Tegner Activity scores, hop tests and KT-1000\n      measurements are performed.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      The purpose of this randomized controlled trail is to determine the influence of two\n      different fixation methods on TW and clinical outcome after anatomic ACL reconstruction\n      using hamstring graft in young and active patients."
