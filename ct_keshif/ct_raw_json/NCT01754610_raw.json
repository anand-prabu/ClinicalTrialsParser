The purpose of this study is to gather practice-based evidence on the\n      effectiveness of the manualized treatment, on the dynamics involved in the group format, and\n      on implementation fidelity and feasibility. Analyses will involve initial exploration of the\n      following hypotheses: 1) Families will show a significant increase in the constructive use\n      of family coping skills and in general family functioning. 2) The target child will show a\n      reduction in trauma-related symptoms and behavior problems. 3) Families will engage and\n      participate in the treatment. 4) Providers will implement SFCR with fidelity.\n\n      Cortisol sub-study: Overall Objective: To pilot the feasibility of collecting salivary\n      samples from families participating in SFCR and gather preliminary data on efficacy of SFCR\n      in improving regulatory processes for families of young children who experience high levels\n      of stress related to urban poverty.\n\n      Other outcomes of interest are the process measures that will be collected to monitor\n      participation in the groups, cultural sensitivity and acceptability, clinician competence,\n      and intervention integrity."

            "textblock": "Strengthening Family Coping Resources (SFCR) is a manualized, trauma-focused, skills-based\n      intervention that uses a multi-family group format. SFCR is designed for families living in\n      traumatic contexts with the goal of reducing the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder\n      (PTSD) and other trauma-related disorders in children and adult caregivers. Since most\n      families living in traumatic contexts contend with on-going stressors and threats, SFCR is\n      also designed to increase coping resources in children, adult caregivers, and in the family\n      system to prevent relapse and re-exposure. SFCR provides accepted, empirically supported\n      trauma treatment within a family format. SFCR includes additional therapeutic strategies\n      designed to improve the family's ability to cope with on-going stress and threats of\n      re-exposure. Specifically, SFCR builds the coping resources necessary to help families boost\n      their sense of safety, function with stability, regulate their emotions and behaviors, and\n      improve communication about and understanding of the traumas they have experienced. The\n      model includes family work on storytelling and narration, which builds to a family trauma\n      narrative. SFCR is currently being implemented at University of Maryland Medical Center\n      (UMMC), at sites that are part of the National Child Traumatic Stress Network (NCTSN), and\n      at community agencies within the Baltimore Metro area and beyond.\n\n      500 families will participate in a multifamily version of the intervention. Multiple groups\n      of 5-6 families will be conducted with pre-post data collected in addition to information on\n      the feasibility of the intervention. Prior to beginning each group, families will be\n      assessed using a structured assessment. This assessment will be repeated at the end of group\n      (all groups) and approximately one year following the completion of the group (for UMMC\n      groups only).\n\n      At least one child in each family will be designated as the research subject. The target\n      child(ren) will be chosen according to age, aged 1 through 17 years old, and referral for\n      services. If more than one child in the family meet these criteria, the primary caregiver\n      will be given the option of how many children s/he would like to be assessed for inclusion\n      in the study. Data on the parents will only be collected from mothers or female caregivers.\n      If no female caregiver is available, the primary caregiver will complete the assessments.\n\n      Cortisol sub-study: Specific Aim 1: To determine whether the cortisol stress response is\n      better regulated and synchronized following SFCR participation. Hypothesis 1: Intervention\n      caregivers and children will increase pre-post morning cortisol levels over the course of\n      the 10-week intervention. Hypothesis 1a: Intervention caregivers and children will develop\n      more synchronous cortisol levels following the intervention. The sample for this substudy\n      will consist of 20 families participating in SFCR groups at two participating centers.\n      Saliva samples will be collected from one caregiver and one child in the family who is\n      willing to participate."
