Giving chemotherapy with autologous bone marrow\n      transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy and autologous bone marrow\n      transplant work in treating patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian cancer."

Patients receive high-dose\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour and mitoxantrone IV over 15 minutes on days -8, -6, and -4\n      and carboplatin IV continuously on days -8 to -3 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n      Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0 beginning at least 60 hours after completion of\n      carboplatin infusion.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5-3\n      years."
