  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) is characterized by airflow obstruction that is
      progressive over many years and is largely irreversible.  Advanced COPD is associated with
      arterial oxygen desaturation leading to a series of complications and, ultimately, decreased
      survival.  Long-term oxygen therapy can improve clinical outcomes in these patients, but the
      exact target of oxygen saturation that actually translates into improvements is not known.
      The basis for the work in this proposal is to focus a new approach to measure oxygen
      desaturation linked to daily activity.  Accelerometers are used to measure daily activity
      and then synchronized with ambulatory oximetry to establish an activity/oxygen-saturation
      profile for individual patients.  The three main objectives of this study are 1) determine
      the feasibility of AOM as a measurement of the temporal profile of oxygen saturation in
      patients with chronic lung disease; 2) determine if serial AOM-derived data is reliable and
      reproducible; and 3) determine thresholds of oxygen desaturation that are associated with
      different activity profiles

    <description>Oxygen saturation is measured with a pulse oximeter that has the capacity to collect data over 30- 34 hours; physical activity is measured with two pizo-electric accelerometers.  Oximetry and activity data are synchronized to define a profile of oxygen saturation that is linked to usual daily activity.</description>
