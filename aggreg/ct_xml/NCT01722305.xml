    <textblock>
      This phase I clinical trial aims to elucidate the maximal tolerated dose and side effects of
      pomalidomide in patients with relapsed or refractory primary central nervous system lymphoma
      or newly diagnosed or relapsed or refractory vitreoretinal lymphoma (Intraocular lymphoma).
      The study will also determine the efficacy and survival related to pomalidomide therapy in a
      MTD expanded cohort.

      Rationale - Pomalidomide is a novel immunomodulatory agent, which has shown significant
      activity against CNS lymphoma in preclinical studies. Blood brain barrier is an obstacle in
      treatment of brain tumors such as CNS lymphoma. Pomalidomide was shown to have an excellent
      CNS penetration in a murine model: approximately 39% of systemically administered
      pomalidomide could penetrate the central nervous system. As such, pomalidomide is a
      promising immunomodulator to be tested in a clinical trial for CNS lymphoma. It works by
      killing the lymphoma cells directly as well as indirectly via activation of the immune
      response against lymphoma cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pomalidomide in patients with CNS
      lymphoma.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (overall response rate) and safety of pomalidomide in patients
      with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) and primary vitreoretinal lymphoma
      (PVRL) in an MTD expanded cohort.

      II. To evaluate overall survival and progression free survival.

      Objectives of correlative research:

      I. To study the pharmacokinetics of pomalidomide in the central nervous system.

      II. To identify the predictive biomarkers for responsiveness to pomalidomide.

    <description>In phase I, dose-escalation study of pomalidomide will be performed to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD). The dose escalation schedule consists of different dose levels: 2 mg/day (level -1), 3 mg/day (level 1, starting dose level), 5 mg/day (level 2), 7 mg/day (level 3), 10 mg/day (level 4). Dose escalation is to be determined by dose limiting toxicity (DLT). In the MTD expanded cohort, the maximal tolerated dose of pomalidomide as determined by phase I will be used.
Patients receive pomalidomide orally (PO) on days 1-21 of each 28-day cycle. In the first and second cycles of treatment, pomalidomide is given with dexamethasone 40 mg PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Pomalidomide alone is given after the second cycle of treatment. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.</description>
