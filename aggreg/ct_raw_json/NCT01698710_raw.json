In this pilot study we are testing the safety of a\n      procedure. \"Investigational\" means that the Albumin bound paclitaxel (Abraxane) is still\n      being studied and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it. It also means\n      that the FDA has not approved Abraxane injection for your type of medical condition.\n      Treatment of pancreatic cysts often requires follow-up imaging studies and surgical\n      resection of the cysts. As part of standard medical care, you will be undergoing a\n      diagnostic endoscopic ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNA) in order to\n      evaluate type of the cyst. During the EUS and just after the cyst fluid aspiration, you will\n      undergo the injection of the drug into the cyst cavity if your cyst is thought to be\n      cancerous or precancerous. Cyst fluid will be analyzed for further diagnosis."

Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular\n      cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take part in the research\n      study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they may or may not have\n      to be repeated. Screening tests include the following: medical history, performance status,\n      assessment of pancreatic cyst by CT, MRI or EUS, blood tests and a pregnancy test.\n\n      If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the research study, you will\n      begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility criteria you will not be able\n      to participate in this research study.\n\n      As part of your medical care you will be undergoing an endoscopic procedure EUS-FNA\n      (Endoscopic Ultrasound Fine Needle Aspiration) in order to evaluate and evacuate the cyst\n      fluid. During the EUS-FNA and just after the cyst fluid aspiration, albumin bound paclitaxel\n      will be injected into the cyst cavity.\n\n      The study procedure (injection of drug into cyst cavity) takes place over 5 minutes during\n      the EUS-FNA. 2 days after the procedure you will receive a phone call from the research\n      coordinator to check on how you are feeling. 3 months after study procedure participants\n      will undergo a follow up CT to see what happened to the cyst. You will continue to have\n      routine follow up for your medical problems."
