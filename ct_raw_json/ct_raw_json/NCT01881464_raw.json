            "textblock": "Crohn's Disease (CD) is a life long disease that mainly affects young adults. There is\n      evidence That gut tissue injury is the result of an abnormal immune  response that involved\n      multiple non immune cellular systems including the intestinal microvascular endothelial\n      cell. Moreover, clinical studies have shown that 1-7% of irritable bowel disease (IBD)\n      patients suffer from arterial and venous thromboembolic complication.\n\n      Chronic inflammation has a major role in the development and propagation of endothelial\n      dysfunction, which can lead to coronary artery disease.\n\n      Endothelial dysfunction has been described in patients with various and diverse chronic\n      inflammatory conditions. Over the last few years, dysfunction of vascular endothelium has\n      been widely recognized as the first step in the development of atherosclerosis. Several\n      inflammatory mediators, such as C-reactive protein (CRP), Tumor Necrosis Factor \u03b1, (TNF \u03b1),\n      nitric oxide (NO), vascular endothelial growth factor, CD-40, interleukin-6 (IL-6), which\n      are up-regulated in IBD, also are known to impact vascular impact.\n\n      The normal endothelium produces a vasodilatatory response to ischemia referred  to us as\n      reactive hyperemia. Shear stress on the blood vessel wall leads to the production and\n      release vasodilatation. With endothelial dysfunction there is often either a blunted\n      vasodilatatory in response to ischemic event, and chronic inflammation.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that patients with Crohn's disease have an increased\n      incidence of endothelial dysfunction, which can be corrected or improved by treatment with\n      anti TNF \u03b1.\n\n      The purpose of our study was to assess endothelial function in patients with  Crohn's\n      Disease, before and after treatment (steroids, immunomodulators, and anti TNF \u03b1). This study\n      assessed the presence of endothelial dysfunction in patients with Crohn's disease and\n      evaluated the possible role of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 in the pathophysiology of this\n      abnormality.\n\n      In this study we will preformed an endothelial function test before and after treatment by\n      Endopath device from Itamar medical, FDA approved.\n\n      Safety- Each subject will be screened by clinical history, physical examination,\n      electrocardiogram, chest X-ray, Mantoux test (PPD), routine chemical analysis, and\n      biomarkers.\n\n      The study protocol has been approved by the local institutional review board."

Thermo-neutral, quiet surroundings are recommended. Endo-PAT quantifies the endothelium-mediated changes in vascular tone, elicited by a 5-minute occlusion of the brachial artery (using a standard blood pressure cuff).",
