Intra-operative ultrasound is used to confirm probe\n      placement and to monitor treatment delivery. If the target temperature or impedance are not\n      reached, treatment is repeated no more than twice. No more than 5 tumors are treated per\n      kidney.\n\n      All patients are followed at 2 to 3 months, 6 months, and then at 1 year.\n\n      Patients with tumors greater than 2 cm in diameter are followed every 6 months for up to 5\n      years. Patients whose tumors become greater than 3 cm are recommended for surgery and\n      removed from study if surgery is performed.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 63 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
