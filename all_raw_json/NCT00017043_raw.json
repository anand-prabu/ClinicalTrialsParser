Treatment repeats every 21 days for\n      2-18 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a\n      complete response (CR) receive 4 additional courses after confirmation of CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-58 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
