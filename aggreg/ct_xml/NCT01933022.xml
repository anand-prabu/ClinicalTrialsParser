  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of the study medication (Eligard®) on
      cancer markers (in the blood) of prostate cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the study is to explore the effect of Eligard® on the following
      prostate cancer biomarkers:

      Testosterone in serum, Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) in serum, Prostate Cancer Antigen
      (PCA3 score) in urine, PSA mRNA in blood/Peripheral Blood Mononuclear Cell (PBMC), PCA3 mRNA
      in blood/PBMC, Transmembrane protease, serine 2-Ets Related Gene (TMPRSS2-ERG) mRNA in
      blood/PBMC

      A blood sample for RNA analysis will also be collected and stored for future investigation
      in patients giving specific informed consent.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Confirmed metastatic prostate cancer for whom androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is
             indicated.

          -  Non-castrate level of testosterone (≥ 8 nmol/L (230 ng/dL)) at screening.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) score of 0-2

          -  A life expectancy of at least 12 months.

          -  Is able to tolerate injection of study drug and comply with the study requirements.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of bilateral orchidectomy.

          -  History of any hormonal treatment/therapy with GnRH agonist, GnRH anti-agonist within
             6 months of enrolment.

          -  Treatment with anti-androgens, 5-α reductase inhibitors, estrogens and/or other any
             investigational hormone-derivative within 3 months of enrolment or 5-times the
             half-life, whichever is longer.

          -  Any previous treatment with chemotherapy treatment for prostate cancer prior to the
             screening visit or within 6 months prior to screening for any other cancer.

          -  Patients previously treated for cancer with hormonal therapy in whom treatment was
             stopped due to lack of efficacy, progression of the disease or lack of tolerability.

          -  Previous treatments for cancer (including prostate cancer) within 6 months prior to
             enrolment: immunotherapy, external beam radiotherapy, brachytherapy, thermotherapy,
             or biological response modifiers (e.g. cytokines).

          -  Known or suspected spinal cord compression or evidence of spinal metastases with risk

          -  Not available for follow-up assessments or unable to comply with study requirements.

          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to leuprorelin acetate, to other GnRH agonists or
             to any of the excipients of Eligard.

          -  Male subjects who are intending to donate sperm within 9 months following the
             injection of Eligard

          -  Male subjects and their female spouses/partners who are of childbearing potential and
             are NOT using highly effective contraception consisting of two forms of birth control
             (one of which must be a barrier method) starting at Screening and continuing for 9
             months from the time of the Eligard injection. Acceptable forms include:

               -  Established use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of
                  contraception.

               -  Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).

               -  Barrier methods of contraception: Condom OR Occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                  cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/suppository
