The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 3\n      or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the\n      highest dose level immediately preceding the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months until disease progression or initiation of another\n      therapy.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
