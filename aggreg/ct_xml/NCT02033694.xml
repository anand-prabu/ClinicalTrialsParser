  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to enhance medical knowledge of the causes of future coronary
      problems.    Many studies in patients who have already experienced a coronary problem point
      to the danger associated with plaques that are rich in cholesterol.  This study determines
      if the near-infrared method of detection of these fatty plaques can predict future events.
      If dangerous plaques can be identified, there are many treatments already available that
      could be tested for their ability to prevent coronary events.

acute coronary syndrome
revascularization by coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) or percutaneous intervention (PCI)
rehospitalization for progressive angina, related to a non-index culprit lesion</description>

        Patients presenting for coronary angiography in whom IVUS and/or NIRS evaluation is
        planned or could be utilized as part of their clinically-indicated evaluation will be
        screened for participation.  The total study enrollment will be 9000 patients.

        General Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects presenting for coronary angiography in whom IVUS imaging is likely to be
             performed for clinical purposes.

          -  Greater than 18 years of age.

          -  Clinical presenting symptoms meeting one of the three criteria below:

               1. Subjects presenting with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) including at least one
                  of the following:

                    1. Elevated cardiac biomarkers with CK-MB or troponin greater than upper
                       limits of normal;

                    2. ST depression or ST elevation &gt;1mm in 2 or more contiguous leads in the
                       absence of LVH, paced rhythm, BBB or early repolarization;

                    3. A stabilized patient 24 to 72 hours post STEMI;

               2. Unstable angina pectoris;

               3. Stable angina pectoris and/or a positive functional study with evidence of
                  ischemia.

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

          -  At least one Suspected Index Culprit Lesion requiring imaging with IVUS and/or NIRS
             for clinical indications.

          -  At least two native epicardial coronary arteries (which may include the Suspected
             Index Culprit Artery) eligible for imaging with NIRS-IVUS.

        IVUS/NIRS Imaging Inclusion Criterion

          -  A minimum of a total 50 mm of coronary artery not involved in a prior or Index
             Procedure PCI (including the 5mm borders on either edge of the site receiving PCI)
             must be scanned.    This 50mm total length may include contributions from the
             Suspected Index Culprit Arteries and from Index Non-Culprit Arteries. This total
             length must include contributions from two or more native imaged arteries.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Unstable patients (STEMI within the prior 24 hours; cardiogenic shock, hypotension
             needing inotropes, hypoxia needing intubation, and IABP) and patients that had a
             procedural complication (coronary dissection, perforation or a complication that
             would necessitate immediate-unplanned revascularization) during index PCI procedure.

          -  History of CABG or planned CABG within 6 months following NIRS-IVUS imaging.

          -  Patient has additional lesion(s) that needs a staged PCI.

          -  Subject life expectancy is less than 2 years at time of index catheterization.

          -  Subject with ejection fraction (EF) &lt;30%.

          -  Subject pacemaker dependent/paced rhythm.

          -  Subject pregnant and lactating.

          -  Any other factor that the investigator feels would put the patient at increased risk
             or otherwise make the patient unsuitable for participation in the protocol

          -  Patients undergoing performance of PCI in all three major vessels during the index
             PCI.
