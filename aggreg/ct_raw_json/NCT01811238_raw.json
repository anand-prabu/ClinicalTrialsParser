If patient is eligible\n      in inclusion/exclusion criteria at the time of visit 1, the patient will receive treatment\n      with TARGIN(R). Re-screening, study drug dose interruption is not allowed. The duration of\n      study drug dose interruption is defined as for 1 week.\n\n      Treatment with TARGIN(R) will be started at 5/2.5mg b.i.d.,and proper titration (up\n      titration) will be allowed  at each visit or at unscheduled visit according to the\n      investigator's decision. On-site visit or phone call will be allowed for visit 2(wk 1).The\n      up titration will be considered by investigator's judgement as followings; (1) if the rescue\n      medication was used more than 2 times per day, on average or (2) based on the daily average\n      numerical rating scale\n\n      , if the numerical rating scale was changed to worsen since the previous visit, (3)\n      Investigator's judgement by considering any titration needed situation (e.g. dose, frequency\n      of rescue medication). Pain assessment by investigator at each visit will be used for\n      analysis and criteria for uptitration. Daily pain diary will be used for only criteria for\n      uptitration.\n\n      Safety laboratories will be obtained at baseline (visit 1) and study end (visit 4) in a\n      local laboratory. The laboratory values within 4 weeks prior to baseline (visit 1) will be\n      allowed to use at study visit 1.\n\n      The rescue medication is the IRcodon(R).\n\n      Patients will be withdrawn from the study if the following circumstance require study drug\n      discontinuation:\n\n        -  Failure of pain control (Failure of pain control will be decided by investigators\n           judgement, e.g. there is poor pain control or lack of efficacy despite 2~3 times of\n           titration.)\n\n        -  Adjustment of the other analgesics due to Adverse event except TARGIN(R) or IRcodon(R)\n\n        -  Adjustment of the other major pain management modality (e.g. surgery, non-surgical\n           interventional therapy, etc.)\n\n        -  Withdrawal of informed consent\n\n        -  Pregnancy\n\n        -  Any other significant risk to the patient's safety in the clinical judgement of the\n           investigator"
