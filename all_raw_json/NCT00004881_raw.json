Determine the biological and immunological\n      effects of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive TG4010 IM weekly for 4 weeks,\n      every other week for 8 weeks, and then every 4 weeks. Treatment continues every 4 weeks in\n      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of TG4010 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience treatment related\n      grade 3 toxicity. If any patient experiences grade 4 toxicity, the prior dose level is\n      considered the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 months."
