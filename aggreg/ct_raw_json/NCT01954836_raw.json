            "textblock": "Evidence from experimental animals provides strong support for the concept that caloric\n      restriction (CR) increases resistance to multiple forms of stress. CR decreases plasma\n      levels of growth factors, e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), thereby diverting\n      energy from growth to maintenance. Accordingly, the currently available information suggests\n      that short-term fasting protects normal cells against the perils of (high dose)\n      chemotherapy. In contrast, cancer cells are not (or less) protected as a result of their\n      self-sufficiency in growth signals. This phenomenon is termed Differential Stress Resistance\n      (DSR). DSR may reduce the severity of adverse effects caused by chemotherapy, without\n      interfering with its anti-tumoral effects. A first case series of 10 cancer patients,\n      suggested that short-term fasting may also protect against the side effects of chemotherapy\n      in humans. This study aims to further evaluate the impact of short-term fasting on tolerance\n      to chemotherapy in humans.Within a randomized controlled pilot trial 30 female patients with\n      gynecological cancer disease (ovarian and breast cancer)in all stages and 4-6 scheduled\n      chemotherapies will be randomized to fast 60-72 hours during half of chemotherapies and to\n      have normocaloric food intake during the other chemotherapies. Fasting is defined as caloric\n      restriction to below 400kcal energy intake/day with free intake of water and tea. Sequences\n      of fasting and normocaloric food intake will be randomized. Assessments of adverse effects,\n      quality of life, fatigue and laboratory values will take place 24 and 7 days after each\n      chemotherapy. Statistical analyses will compare the summarized differences of fasted and\n      non-fasted chemotherapy cycles, that means a total of max. 60-90 chemotherapies with\n      accompanying fasting will be compared to 60-90 non-fasted chemotherapies."
