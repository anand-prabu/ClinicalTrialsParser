Quality of life outcomes as well as\n      gastrointestinal and genitourinary early and late toxicities will be analyzed and compared\n      to conventional proton therapy regimens. It is thought that this regimen will produce\n      comparable findings and would result in substantial health care cost savings, as well as, be\n      more convenient for patients."

The need to exclude patients with AIDS from this\n                  protocol is necessary because the treatments involved in this protocol may be\n                  significantly immunosuppressive.
