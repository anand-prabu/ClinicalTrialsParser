  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the Scleroderma Registry is to support and promote the basic
      science and clinical research of this complex rheumatic disease at the Hospital for Special
      Surgery (HSS). The registry facilitates our understanding of the clinical features,
      pathobiology, genetics of Scleroderma. This will ultimately lead to a potential treatment
      for this currently untreatable condition.

      What will be asked of you:

        -  Completion of 2 health questionnaires

        -  Donation of research bloods. This is optional, but encouraged (if possible).

        -  We also encourage patients who come for initial visits to return so follow-up data can
           be collected.

      Benefits to Patients:

        -  The HSS Scleroderma Registry gives patients the opportunity to participate in
           observational research with the goal of improving the lives of patients in the future.

        -  By donating research bloods and providing clinical information, patients will help
           generate new knowledge about Scleroderma that can guide the treatment and care of
           patients afflicted with this rare disease.

        -  Patients will also receive a comprehensive, medical evaluation from an HSS physician
           who specializes in treating Scleroderma. He or she will provide guidance on treatment
           options and recommendations for current or upcoming clinical trials.

        -  Physicians will also make patients aware of the resources available to them, including
           support groups and educational programs.

      Research bloods will be collected if the patient gives permission. These bloods can be
      donated at the time of a patient's private visit with a physician at Hospital for Special
      Surgery, or at an independent research visit.
