Healthy volunteers will be recruited, who will each receive three injections\n      with either 21G, 23G or 27G subcutaneously on the abdomen. After each injection, the\n      participants will be asked to evaluate the pain on a Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). It is\n      anticipated that the pain will decrease with decreasing thickness of the needle. The aim of\n      this study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in clinical\n      practice."
