The accumulation of respiratory secretions in the subglottic\n      space is a well-proven cause of VAP. Therefore, prevention should include the aspiration of\n      secretions from the subglottic space. Investigators invented a manual method with high-flow\n      air produced by resuscitator to impinge secretion from the subglottic space to oral cavity.\n      This method has been granted as a patent by Chinese national intellectual property Patent\n      Office, it has been used in their daily work for more than 10 years and more than 20 Chinese\n      ICUs have used it everyday. Investigators want to compare it with conventional method which\n      uses a special intubation tube with an independent dorsal lumen to suction subglottic\n      secretion."
