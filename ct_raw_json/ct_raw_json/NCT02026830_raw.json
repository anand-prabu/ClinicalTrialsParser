            "textblock": "Recent studies have demonstrated substantial variation in the etiology of DFIs (Diabetic\n      Foot Infections) in different regions of the world . In contrast to Western countries,\n      studies from  Asia and Africa have demonstrated that aerobic gram-negative organisms,\n      particularly Pseudomonas aeruginosa, are far more common . The majority of current\n      guidelines for the management of DFIs have been prepared in Western countries . Based on the\n      results of more recent studies from the Asian continent, however, empiric antibiotic therapy\n      for DFIs may need to be directed at organisms with substantially different antibiotic\n      susceptibility patterns than those recommended in current guidelines. Thus, suggested\n      antibiotic regimens for DFIs should be optimized for local clinical practice. The aim of the\n      current trial is to provide an up-to-date view of the causative microorganisms and their\n      antibiotic sensitivity patterns in diabetic patients with a foot infection in Turkey."
