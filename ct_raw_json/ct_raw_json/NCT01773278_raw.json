            "textblock": "Smith-Lemli-Opitz Syndrome (SLOS) is an autosomal recessive disorder caused by a metabolic\n      error in the final step of cholesterol biosynthesis, leading to cholesterol deficiency and\n      accumulation of the cholesterol precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol.Patients with SLOS display\n      complex medical problems including growth failure, intellectual disability, behavioral\n      disorders, progressive retinal dystrophy, hearing loss and photosensitivity. Dr Elias was\n      one of the original geneticists who discovered the cause of this disorder in 1994, and ever\n      since has been treating SLOS patients with cholesterol supplementation. Since 2008, a second\n      medication called AquADEKS, a mixture of vitamins and other compounds with antioxidant\n      properties was added to the treatment regimen. The purpose of the AquADEKS is to allow\n      treatment with antioxidant medications in an effort to prevent retinal degeneration, hearing\n      and skin problems associated with SLOS.\n\n      This protocol has been approved by the Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board and\n      supported by the Clinical Translational Research Center (CTRC) since 2001. Since the last\n      Colorado Multiple Institutional Review Board annual review, the following updated\n      information is available about the protocol:\n\n        1. New research has revealed that oxysterols are toxic compounds made from the cholesterol\n           precursor, 7-dehydrocholesterol. These oxysterol compounds are severely neurotoxic and\n           treatment with antioxidants may help lower their levels, resulting in slowing of\n           retinal deterioration. Testing of oxysterol levels in patients with SLOS is now\n           starting, in collaboration with a laboratory at Vanderbilt University (Dr Ned Porter\n           and Dr Libin Xu). It is hoped that testing of oxysterol levels in blood may help\n           provide more updated info to help guide treatment.\n\n        2. New data is available and has been recently re-analyzed by a CTRC statistician, showing\n           that the antioxidant treatment leads to statistically significant improvement in\n           retinal function in SLOS patients, as measured on serial electroretinogram testing."
