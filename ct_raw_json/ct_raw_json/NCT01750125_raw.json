Blood flow velocity waveforms require the use of\n      invasive catheters, thus precluding clinical use.  Such information would allow the\n      researcher / practitioner the ability to continuously measure blood flow, pulse pressure,\n      and the pulsatility index of any vascular structure accessible by ultrasound with minimal\n      additional risk to the subject / patient.  This data, when combined with arterial blood\n      pressure data, could also be used to measure peripheral pressure volume loops as well as\n      aortic vascular impedance, both of which cannot be currently measured in vivo.\n\n      The ability to measure blood flow velocity waveforms at high temporal resolution would\n      provide clinicians with new tools for hemodynamic optimization (both a novel means of\n      estimating myocardial oxygen consumption [pressure volume area] as well as afterload [aortic\n      vascular impedance]) and researchers with the ability to conduct hemodynamic experiments\n      that were not previously possible.  This work will serve as the foundation for several other\n      related projects which depend on the ability to continuously record blood flow velocity\n      waveforms."
