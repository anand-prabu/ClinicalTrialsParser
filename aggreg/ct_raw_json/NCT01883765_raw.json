However, randomized double-blind trials that\n      include a sham-neurofeedback control group are lacking, as well as studies examining the\n      efficacy of NFT in adult ADHD populations. The inclusion of a sham-neurofeedback group is\n      crucial to monitor and exclude unspecific effects.\n\n      This study aims to investigate the efficacy of NFT as compared to a sham-feedback condition\n      and a cognitive behavioral treatment in adults with persistent ADHD.\n\n      Efficacy is assessed on several outcome parameters, such as symptom severity,\n      neuropsychological variables (e.g., attention, memory), and event related potentials in the\n      EEG."
