            "textblock": "Treatment resistant depression is a common and disabling condition. The delayed onset of\n      action and side effects exhibited by oral antidepressants are significant limitations. An\n      alternative and well-established therapy is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). ECT has rapid\n      antidepressant effect beginning with the completion of the first session.  Nevertheless,\n      like oral medications, patients treated with ECT can develop treatment resistance or failure\n      to respond. There is great need for a novel approach to treatment-resistant depression; one\n      that that is safe, has rapid onset, and is sustained.\n\n      Pharmaceutical agents with rapid antidepressant effects are a new and promising paradigm in\n      the research for treatment of MDD.  A potential therapeutic target is glutamate based signal\n      transmission because glutamate transmission is abnormally regulated in the limbic/cortical\n      areas of many depressed people.  Glutamatergic modulating agents, in particular ketamine,\n      have been shown to induce rapid antidepressant effects both in both preclinical models and\n      humans.  Additionally, ketamine has been shown to have persistent antidepressive effect.\n\n      Presently worldwide, propofol is one of the most commonly used anesthetic agents for ECT.\n      There are 2 main disadvantages to this practice.  First, propofol has no antidepressive\n      effect.  Second, propofol is a potent anticonvulsant that may worsen the quality of the ECT\n      induced seizures. A recent open-label trial compared ketamine to propofol for anesthesia\n      during ECT and demonstrated a significant improvement of depression in the ketamine arm.\n      Ketamine is routinely used to provide safe general anesthesia as well as procedural\n      sedation, analgesia, and amnesia. The combination of the intrinsic antidepressant effects of\n      ketamine with electroconvulsive therapy is a promising concept in clinical research."
