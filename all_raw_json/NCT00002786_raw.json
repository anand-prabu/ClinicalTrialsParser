Patients\n      receive cellular adoptive immunotherapy comprising autologous CD8+ CTL clones over 30\n      minutes on day 1. Patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously every 12 hours on days\n      1-14 of courses 2-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for approximately 1 year after the last infusion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
