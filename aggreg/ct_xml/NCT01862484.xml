  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) aged 9-12 years of age will be
      placed on a restriction diet for a 5 week period.  Children will be randomized to either
      receive daily snacks that conform to the diet or will violate the diet (Ruse diet) in a
      double blind fashion.  It is hypothesized that children who are consistently on the
      restricted diet (relative to those on the ruse diet) will show improvements in ADHD
      symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ADHD rating scale (RS) will be the principal behavioral outcome measure.  We hypothesize
      that children on restriction diet will have significantly lower ADHD RS scores after 5 weeks
      relative to the Ruse diet group. In addition children will undergo functional magnetic
      resonance imaging (fMRI) at baseline and again at 5 weeks.  Children will perform a flanker
      task known to engage the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the anterior cingulate
      cortex (ACC) during attention tasks.  The children will also perform will look at pictures
      of appealing and unappealing food and rate whether they would like to eat it or not. This
      task is known to activate the ventral striatum (VS) (reward processing).  A secondary
      hypothesis is whether children on the restricted diet will show changes in activity and
      connectivity of areas (DLPFC, ACC, VS) relative to those on the Ruse diet.
