The study consists of 3 phases: screening (up\n      to 4 weeks), open-label treatment and inpatient follow up (1 week) and outpatient follow up\n      (11 weeks). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, vital signs,\n      physical examination, electrocardiograms, injection-site reactions, and clinical laboratory\n      tests. The total duration of the study for each participant will be approximately 16 weeks."
