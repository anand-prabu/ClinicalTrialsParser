  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center trial involving the University of Minnesota, Ohio State University
      Comprehensive Cancer Center, and Roswell Park Cancer. Cigarette smokers who are eligible
      will enter a Camel Snus sampling phase. Smokers interested in continuing with the study
      after the sampling phase will undergo a 2 week baseline assessment phase and will then be
      randomized to one of the five experimental conditions for 8 weeks. Tobacco use patterns,
      subjective responses to product, and nicotine and toxicant exposure will be assessed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Baseline smoking period: Subjects will be required to attend baseline clinic visits during
      Week -2 and -1 of the clinical trial phase, and they will record their cigarette or other
      tobacco intake on a daily basis using an interactive voice response system (IVR).

      Experimental Period:  After the baseline assessment, subjects will be randomized to one of
      five experimental conditions: 1) smoking usual brand cigarette controls, who after 8-weeks
      will be offered Camel Snus to use as they will for 8 more weeks; 2) complete substitution
      (i.e., no smoking) and ad libitum use of snus; 3) complete substitution (i.e., no smoking)
      and specific instructions for snus use based on the number of cigarettes smoked per day (if
      10-20 cigarettes, use snus every 2 hours for about 8 pouches per day, and if &gt;20 cigarettes
      then 12 pouches per day ; 4) partial substitution with ad libitum use of both snus and
      cigarettes; and 5) partial substitution with controlled use of snus (paralleling the
      instructions for complete substitution condition) and ad libitum smoking. Snus, but not
      cigarettes, will be provided to subjects at the clinic visits.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects who are at least 18 years of age;

          -  smoking history of at least 10 cigarettes daily (Carbon Monoxide&gt;8 or NicAlert &gt;2)
             for at least 1 year and no serious quit attempts in the last 3 months (to ensure
             stability of smoking, particularly for those randomized to the continued smoking
             group);

          -  No unstable and significant medical or psychiatric conditions as determined by
             medical history and Prime-MD questionnaire (to ensure safety of the subject, to
             minimize the effects of poor health on biomarker measures and to maximize compliance
             to study procedures);

          -  Lack of stabilization of medications (determined by study MD);

          -  Subject has provided written informed consent to participate in the study
             (adolescents under the age of 18 will be excluded because this project involves
             continued use of tobacco products and new tobacco products);

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Immune system disorders, respiratory diseases, kidney or liver diseases or any other
             medical disorders that may affect biomarker data;

          -  Current or recent alcohol or drug abuse problems (to ensure alcohol and drug use does
             not affect biomarkers o nnf exposure and to maximize retention);

          -  Regular tobacco use (e.g., greater than weekly or 9 times in last 30 days) other than
             cigarettes;

          -  Currently using nicotine replacement or other tobacco cessation products (to minimize
             confounding effects of another product) or intention to quit in next three months;

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding (due to toxic effects from tobacco products).

          -  Unable to read for comprehension or completion of study documents.
