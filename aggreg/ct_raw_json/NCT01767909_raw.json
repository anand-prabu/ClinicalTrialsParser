            "textblock": "An urgent need exists to find effective treatments for Alzheimer's disease (AD) that can\n      arrest or reverse the disease at its earliest stages. The emotional and financial burden of\n      AD to patients, family members, and society is enormous, and is predicted to grow\n      exponentially as the median population age increases. Current FDA-approved therapies are\n      modestly effective at best. This study will examine a novel therapeutic approach using\n      intranasal insulin (INI) that has shown promise in short-term clinical trials. If\n      successful, information gained from the study has the potential to move INI forward rapidly\n      as a therapy for AD. The study will also provide evidence for the mechanisms through which\n      INI may produce benefits by examining key cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers and\n      hippocampal/entorhinal atrophy. These results will have considerable clinical and scientific\n      significance, and provide therapeutically-relevant knowledge about insulin's effects on AD\n      pathophysiology. Growing evidence has shown that insulin carries out multiple functions in\n      the brain, and that insulin dysregulation may contribute to AD pathogenesis.\n\n      This study will examine the effects of intranasally-administered insulin on cognition,\n      entorhinal cortex and hippocampal atrophy, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers in\n      amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) or mild AD.  It is hypothesized that after 12\n      months of treatment with INI compared to placebo, subjects will improve performance on a\n      global measure of cognition, on a memory composite and on daily function.  In addition to\n      the examination of CSF biomarkers and hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy, the study aims to\n      examine whether baseline AD biomarker profile, gender, or Apolipoprotein epsilon 4 (APOE-\u03b54)\n      allele carriage predict treatment response.\n\n      In this study, 240 people with aMCI or AD will be given either INI or placebo for 12 months,\n      following an open-label period of 6 months where all participants will be given active drug.\n       The study uses insulin as a therapeutic agent and intranasal administration focusing on\n      nose to brain transport as a mode of delivery."

Credit is awarded for each bit recalled verbatim or accurately paraphrased.\nThe Buschke Selective Reminding Test measures verbal memory through multiple trials of a list learning task. A list of 12 words is audibly presented to the participants, who then recall as many words as possible. On subsequent trials, participants are only told those words they omitted on the previous trial. The procedure continues until the participant recalls all words on two subsequent trials or to the twelfth trial. After a 30-minute delay, participants recall as many items as possible.
