      The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of electrical stimulation at the speed
      of blood circulation and tactile sensitivity of the arms of women who underwent axillary
      dissection for breast cancer.

      Introduction: the surgical treatment of breast cancer, especially axillary lymphadenectomy
      (AL), can cause blood circulatory changes, also partial or total lesion of the sensory nerve
      intercostobrachial, often causing anesthesia or hypoesthesia in the corresponding dermatome
      ipsilateral upper limb surgery. Objective: to investigate the influence of high voltage
      electrical stimulation (HVES) in the in the blood flow and tactile sensitivity in nerve path
      intercostobrachial of women undergoing AL. Methodology: sample of 30 volunteers, aged
      between 40 and 60 years, divided into two equal groups (n = 15): women with axillary
      dissection for breast cancer undergoing therapeutic procedure (GAL) and control group (CG)
      composed of women who did not undergoing axillary surgery. The treatment procedure consist
      of the application of high voltage electrical simulation for 30 minutes in both limbs twice
      a week over the course of seven weeks. The profile of blood flow, including speed, direction
      were evaluated by means of continuous wave Doppler ultrasound. The assessment of tactile
      sensitivity was accomplished through esthesiometer in three stages: before the start of the
      first therapeutic procedure, after completion of the intervention and 30 days after the end
      of treatment (wash-out). The data will be analyzed using descriptive statistics (ANOVA) even
      as the hypothesis testing of Shapiro-Wilk and if the data are not normally distributed,
      non-parametric tests will be used. For the analyses will be used SPSS software with critical
      level of 5%. The results obtained on this study aim to justify therapies for intervention
      with that equipment in the treatment of morbidities caused by axillary linfadenectomy.
