Upon arrival to the clinic, the study will be explained to\n      the patient in detail. The patient will be asked at that time to sign this consent form. The\n      patient will have the opportunity to ask questions and the research staff will answer those\n      questions. If the patient decides to participate in this study and sign a consent form, then\n      a blood sample will be collected from a vein in the arm. A total of 2 teaspoons full of\n      blood will be drawn for the study.\n\n      During this visit, in addition to collecting a blood sample, patients will be asked about\n      their medical history and medications they are currently taking, and will have their vital\n      signs assessed, including blood pressure, pulse, and temperature.\n\n      Blood will be drawn by a trained nurse or a phlebotomist at a family medicine clinic in\n      Gainesville, Florida. The blood sample will be further processed in  laboratories at the\n      University of Florida, for the establishment of iPS cells. iPS cells will retain the\n      patient's genetic makeup which makes them useful for research. Several experiments will be\n      conducted on these cells that will provide data that can be used to learn more about how\n      genetic markers can lead to differences in blood pressure response to medicines. These cells\n      will be used for up to 8 years."
