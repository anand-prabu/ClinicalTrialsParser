Patients age 18 or greater\n      with uncontrolled glaucoma and scheduled to undergo their first superotemporal Baerveldt 350\n      implant will be recruited and randomized at the time of enrollment to either scheduled\n      ripcord removal at post-operative week 3 or no ripcord removal. Incidence of complications\n      will be documented and compared between the 2 groups. The final intraocular pressure control\n      between the 2 groups will also be compared in a secondary outcome analysis. This study will\n      help to establish post-operative management guidelines to minimize complications and improve\n      intraocular pressure lowering success following Baerveldt 350 implantation."
