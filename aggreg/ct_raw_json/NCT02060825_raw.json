Regional saturation monitoring is a standard of care in\n      many institutions, including NCH. Advances in the technology and recent approval of the use\n      of CASMED devices for this purpose will allow us to use this technology more effectively. We\n      aim to evaluate if there is a change in the mesenteric blood flow during the pre, intra and\n      post operative period for the hybrid procedure and the balloon atrial septostomy procedure\n      (BAS)."
