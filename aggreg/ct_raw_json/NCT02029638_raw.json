            "textblock": "Transplantation is a good treatment for people with end-stage kidney disease.  However,\n      there is still much to learn about how to best care for the transplanted kidney and keep it\n      working for a long time.\n\n      Unless a person receiving a kidney from someone else takes drugs that reduce immune\n      function, the kidney will be rejected. Those drugs must be continued life-long and cause\n      many issues. Therefore, tolerance of the transplanted kidney, without chronic rejection and\n      without the need for permanent immunosuppressive drug treatment, is a highly desirable goal.\n       If this can be achieved, it would make \"one kidney for life\" possible.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to find out if the study treatment will allow people to accept\n      their new kidney and be able to stop taking anti-rejection medications.  The study treatment\n      includes several days of study medications followed by a kidney and bone marrow transplant.\n      After the transplant, the study treatment will continue with a few more doses of study\n      medications and then anti-rejection medication is started.  After a while, the\n      anti-rejection medication is slowly stopped. Researchers will examine blood and tissue\n      samples and try to identify genetic markers for certain conditions like chimerism, response\n      to therapy, and tolerance."

Recipient of a first renal allograft from an HLA-haploidentical, living related\n                  donor.  The donor and recipient must be HLA identical for at least one allele\n                  (using high resolution DNA based typing) at the following genetic loci: HLA-A,\n                  HLA-B, HLA-C and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of this criterion shall be considered\n                  sufficient evidence that the donor and recipient share one HLA haplotype.\n\n               2. Age 18 to 65 years.\n\n               3. Single solid organ recipients (kidney only).\n\n               4. ABO compatibility with donor.\n\n               5. Demonstration of absence of DSA using solid phase micro particle technology (by\n                  Luminex\u00ae phenotype panel or Luminex single antigen bead test) performed 30 days\n                  or less prior to transplant as assessed by local laboratories.\n\n               6. No known history of anti-HLA antibodies.  Recipients with low- level anti-HLA\n                  antibodies not considered to be clinically significant may be eligible,\n                  following consultation with the  Protocol Chairs, the local HLA Laboratory\n                  Director, the NIAID Medical Monitor and the ITN Clinical Trial Physician.\n\n               7. Negative T and B cell flow crossmatches with the designated donor; as assessed\n                  by local laboratories. If one or more of the crossmatches is positive, the\n                  participant will be considered a screen failure unless combined results of\n                  antibody and cross match testing implicate a non-HLA antibody as the cause of\n                  the positive flow crossmatch. In this case, the Protocol Chair must approve the\n                  participant as a screening success after consultation with the local HLA\n                  Laboratory Director.\n\n               8. Normal estimated left ventricular ejection fraction and no history of ischemic\n                  heart disease requiring revascularization, unless cleared by a cardiologist.\n\n               9.

For women of childbearing potential, a negative serum or urine pregnancy test\n                  with sensitivity less than 50 mIU/m within 72 hours before the start of study\n                  medication.\n\n              12. Use of two forms of contraception with less than a 5% failure rate or abstinence\n                  by all transplanted participants for 18 months after the first dose of study\n                  therapy. For the first 60 days post-transplant, recipients should be encouraged\n                  to use non-hormonal contraceptives due to the potential adverse effect of\n                  hormones on bone marrow engraftment.\n\n              13. Ability to receive oral medication.\n\n              14.

HLA-haploidentical, first-degree relatives or half-siblings of the recipient\n                  participant at the allele or allele group.  The donor and recipient must be HLA\n                  identical for at least one allele (using high resolution DNA based typing) at\n                  the following genetic loci: HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, and HLA-DRB1. Fulfillment of\n                  this criterion shall be considered sufficient evidence that the donor and\n                  recipient share one HLA haplotype.\n\n               2. Age 18 to 65 years.\n\n               3. Creatinine clearance >80 ml/minute as measured from a 24 hour urine collection\n                  within 26 weeks of the screening visit. If a serum creatinine drawn at the\n                  screening visit is > 20% higher than the serum creatinine drawn at the time of\n                  the 24 urine collection, the creatinine clearance must be re-evaluated by a\n                  repeat 24 hour urine test. If the new value is \u226480mg/dL the donor will be\n                  excluded.\n\n               4. Meets institutional selection criteria for organ and bone marrow donation.\n\n               5.

QFT testing done within 52 weeks before transplant\n                  is acceptable as long as there is documentation of the results.  Prior\n                  recipients of a BCG vaccination are not exempt.\n\n              10. Any active, severe local or systemic infection at the screening visit.\n\n              11.
