To provoke different glycemic levels the following intervention will be performed: Lunch (with fast glucose absorption characteristics) will be served. Up to 30 minutes after the usual insulin dosing time, the subjects will take his/her lunch dose of insulin adjusted to the chosen lunch plus additional approximately 25% (in the range of 0-50% according to the discretion of the Investigator) of insulin - in order to provoke moderate postprandial hypoglycaemia with glucose values < 70 mg/dl."
