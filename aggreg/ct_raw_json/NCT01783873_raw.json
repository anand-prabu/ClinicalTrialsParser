In contrast, OA caused by low molecular\n      weight (LMW) substances results in a neutrophilic inflammation. In addition, data regarding\n      phenotype of lymphocytes in OA caused by HMW and LMW substances are scarce. The use of a new\n      equipment will allow the realization of specific standardized bronchial challenges (BC) to\n      occupational agents. Thus, we propose to study in more detail the cellular mechanisms\n      involved during BC to HMW and LMW occupational agents in a double-blind placebo controlled\n      study."
