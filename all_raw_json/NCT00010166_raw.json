Combining chemotherapy with radiation\n      therapy after surgery may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine with radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have undergone surgery to remove cancer of the pancreas."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for a total of 2 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 6 months and then every 3 months for up to 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 72 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.2 or 3.4\n      years."
