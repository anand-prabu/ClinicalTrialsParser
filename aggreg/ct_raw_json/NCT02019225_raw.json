Facilities will be randomized in a 1:1\n      distribution to the Intervention arm or the Usual Care arm.  Facilities randomized to the\n      Intervention arm will adopt the practice of recommending dialysis session durations of at\n      least 4.25 hours for all patients initiating hemodialysis treatment regardless of body size\n      or dialysis solute clearance measurements.  Facilities randomized to Usual Care will\n      maintain their existing approaches to prescribing dialysis session duration.  Participants\n      will be followed for up to 3 years.  The primary endpoint is mortality; major secondary\n      endpoints are hospitalization rate and quality of life.  Pragmatic features of the TiME\n      Trial include 1) high generalizability due to non-restrictive eligibility criteria and broad\n      representation of participating facilities, 2) implementation of the intervention by\n      clinical care providers rather than by research personnel, and 3) reliance on data obtained\n      through routine clinical care rather than through research activities."
