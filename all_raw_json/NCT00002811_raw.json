These skin lesions, such as actinic keratoses, can develop into skin\n      cancer. T4N5 liposome lotion may reduce actinic keratoses or other sun-induced skin damage\n      in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to compare treatment using T4N5 liposome\n      lotion with treatment using placebo in reducing actinic keratoses and other sun-induced skin\n      damage in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum."

Groups of 6 patients are randomly assigned in a 2:1\n      ratio to Arms I and II, respectively. Arm I: Chemoprevention. Lotion composed of T4\n      endonuclease V protein encapsulated in liposomes and suspended in phosphate-buffered saline\n      in a hydrogel base, T4N5 Liposome Lotion, T4N5. Arm II: Control. Liposomes suspended in\n      phosphate-buffered saline in a hydrogel base, Placebo, PLCB.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 6-30 patients will be entered in this multicenter study."
