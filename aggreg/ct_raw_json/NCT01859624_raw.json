The initial dose of albuterol will be a 4 mg daily for the first 6 weeks.  If the 4 mg is well tolerated, the dose will be increased to 8 mg at the 6 week visit."

Studies have shown that albuterol may be beneficial in\n      improving muscle function in people with late-onset Pompe disease. The purpose of this study\n      is to evaluate whether albuterol is safe and effective for improving muscle function in\n      people with late-onset Pompe disease, whether or not they are receiving enzyme replacement\n      therapy (ERT). For this study, albuterol is considered an investigational drug. The word\n      \"investigational\" means albuterol is not approved by the FDA for individuals with late-onset\n      Pompe disease."
