    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to determine if OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN delivered nasally
      (through the nose) using the OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN DEVICE can reduce the pain associated with
      migraine headaches in 30 minutes after use.

      The primary objective for this study is to compare the proportion of attacks in which pain
      reduction (defined as a decrease in pain intensity of at least 1 point) is achieved at 30
      minutes following 20 mg OPTINOSE SUMATRIPTAN treatment with 100 mg Sumatriptan Tablets

             angina such as the Prinzmetal variant), all forms of myocardial infarction and silent
             myocardial ischemia.  Cerebrovascular syndromes include, but are not limited to,
             strokes of any type as well as transient ischemic attacks. Peripheral vascular
             disease includes, but is not limited to, ischemic bowel disease, Raynaud syndrome
