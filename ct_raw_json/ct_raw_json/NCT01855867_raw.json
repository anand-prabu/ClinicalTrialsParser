We are proposing to evaluate the safety, tolerability\n      and acceptability of Stribild given to participants over age 18 after a possible sexual\n      exposure to HIV-1. Enrolled participants will have experienced a moderate to high risk\n      exposure, as outlined in the study protocol, within the last 72 hours - per 2005 Center for\n      Disease Control and Prevention guidelines. Participants will take one Stribild tablet, by\n      mouth, once a day for 28 days. Study staff will assess for changes in blood chemistries and\n      clinical signs and symptoms from baseline health. Study participation is 90 days and will\n      include HIV testing, STI screening, HIV/STI risk reduction counseling, clinical assessments,\n      blood draws and surveys designed to gather knowledge and perception of HIV post-exposure\n      prophylaxis (PEP) and HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Conditional referrals to\n      continued HIV/STI risk reduction counseling and testing will be made if risk remains high at\n      study termination. In addition, participants will be connected to a medical provider if risk\n      demonstrates a potential need for HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis."
