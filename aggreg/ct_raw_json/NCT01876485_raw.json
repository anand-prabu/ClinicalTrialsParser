In Phase 2, we will conduct a randomized, clinical trial to compare\n      the effectiveness of EPIC to enhanced usual care (EUC). In the proposed clinical trial, we\n      will enroll 32 primary care teams (referred to as Patient Aligned Care Teams [PACT] in the\n      VA) and recruit an average of 12 patients per team with treated but uncontrolled diabetes.\n      Patients in the intervention arm will receive EPIC group training sessions consisting of 4\n      one-hour group sessions led by clinical research staff occurring over a 6-month period.\n      Group sessions will consist of behavioral coaching focused on diabetes management. Following\n      each group-session, patients enrolled in the intervention arm will meet with a designated\n      member of the primary care team to personalize diabetes goals and action plans. Patients in\n      the control arm will receive EUC consisting of a diabetes group education class, an\n      appointment with the nutritionist, an appointment with the clinical pharmacist for\n      medication management, and a primary care visit dedicated to diabetes management. Providers\n      of patients in the EUC arm will receive standardized recommendations for diabetes self\n      management education. Study measurements using self-reported questionnaires and blood tests\n      to assess blood sugar control will be obtained at baseline, six months and one year."

            "textblock": "Project Background: Diabetes mellitus is a highly prevalent chronic condition, affecting one\n      in five Veterans who use the Veterans Affairs (VA) health care system.  Self-management\n      skills are critical for controlling diabetes and reducing its cardiovascular sequela.\n      Providing diabetic patients with effective self-management training and support can be\n      challenging due to time constraints at primary care encounters and limited clinician\n      training with behavior change. We have previously demonstrated that a group-based, VA\n      primary care intervention to help patients set highly effective, evidence-based diabetes\n      goals had a positive impact on both diabetes self-efficacy and hemoglobin (Hb) A1c levels.\n      This study aims to evaluate the process of implementing a collaborative goal-setting\n      intervention personalized to patient activation and health literacy  levels (i.e. Empowering\n      Patients in Chronic Care [EPIC]) into routine VISN 12 PACT care and to evaluate the\n      effectiveness this intervention relative to usual care.\n\n      Project Objectives: Specific Aim 1: Assess effective processes for and costs associated with\n      implementing a collaborative diabetes goal-setting intervention personalized to patient\n      activation and FHL (i.e., EPIC) into the routine workflows of VISN 12 PACTs. H1:  Formative\n      measures within the PARIHS framework (evidence, context, facilitation) will be associated\n      with implementation of EPIC (defined by reach, adoption, cost effectiveness, and fidelity\n      measures) into routine PACT care.  Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the effectiveness of delivering\n      collaborative goal-setting personalized to patient activation and FHL on clinical (HbA1c)\n      and patient-centered (Diabetes Distress Scale) outcomes among eligible patients in enrolled\n      PACTs. H2: Patients receiving collaborative goal-setting personalized to activation and FHL\n      levels will have significant improvements in a) HbA1c and b) Diabetes Distress Scale levels,\n      respectively, at 6-months (post-intervention) compared with patients receiving enhanced\n      usual care.  H3: Patients receiving collaborative goal-setting personalized to activation\n      and FHL levels will maintain significant improvements in a) HbA1c and b) Diabetes Distress\n      Scale levels at 1-year follow-up, respectively, compared with patients receiving enhanced\n      usual care.\n\n      Project Methods: In Phase 1 of the study, we will implement EPIC into routine PACT care.  We\n      will conduct a mixed-methods formative evaluation that includes 33-48 key informant\n      interviews with VISN 12 leadership, clinicians, and staff and an assessment of\n      organizational readiness for change. This evaluation will identify how group and one-on-one\n      sessions of EPIC can best be implemented into routine workflows of VISN 12 PACT. In Phase 2,\n      we will conduct a randomized clinical trial enrolling 32 designated PACT members and 260 of\n      their patients with poorly controlled diabetes defined by average hemoglobin A1c of   8% to\n      receive EPIC or enhanced usual care.  The PACT teamlet will serve as the unit of\n      randomization.  EPIC consists of four 1-hour group sessions focusing on 1) The ABCs of\n      Diabetes Care, 2) How to Make Goals and Action Plans, 3) Communication with Your Provider,\n      and 4) Staying Committed to Your Goals & Action Plans.  After each group, a one-on-one\n      session between a designated PACT member and patient participants will focus on\n      collaborative goal-setting.  Designated PACT members will be trained to personalize\n      goal-setting using patient-reported activation and health literacy data.  We will collect\n      laboratory and survey data at baseline, six months, and one year.  We will evaluate the\n      effectiveness of personalized goal-setting compared to enhanced usual care on clinical\n      (e.g., hemoglobin A1c) and patient-centered (e.g., Diabetes Distress Scale) outcomes."
