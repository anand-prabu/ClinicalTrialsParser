            "textblock": "Periconceptional supplementation with folic acid - the synthetic form of the B-vitamin\n      folate - reduces the occurrence of adverse pregnancy outcomes such as spina bifida. The\n      underlying biochemical mechanisms for how folic acid affects health outcomes however are\n      unknown. The naturally occurring form 5-methyltetrahydrofolate (5-MTHF) is now available and\n      discussed as an adequate substitute to folic acid. This study aims to determine the effect\n      of folic acid compared to 5-MTHF on cellular mechanisms. Stable isotope tracer protocols\n      will be used that allow determining the effect of folic acid on the dynamics of metabolic\n      pathways in the human body.\n\n      Hypothesis: Supplementation with high-dose folic acid alters the turnover rate of folate\n      dependent pathways in healthy humans; but 5-MTHF does not. Genetic variations in a key\n      enzyme of the folate metabolism will aggravate the effect of folic acid on the metabolic\n      pathways."
