  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the antiviral effect, pharmacokinetics, safety, and tolerability
      of GS-5806 in respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) positive adults who have been hospitalized
      with acute respiratory infectious symptoms.

      Participants will be stratified by presence or absence of chronic airways diseases;
      participants with chronic airways diseases will be further stratified by chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, or other. Participants will receive 1 dose of GS-5806 and
      followed for 28 days postdose. Nasal swabs will be collected at each study visit (excluding
      Day 28) and assayed for change in viral load as the primary endpoint.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Admission to the hospital primarily for a respiratory related illness

          -  New onset or acute worsening of at least 1 respiratory infectious symptom from each
             category with a duration of  â‰¤ 5 days prior to screening:

               -  Upper respiratory tract symptoms: nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat, or
                  earache

               -  Lower respiratory tract symptoms: cough, sputum production, wheezing, dyspnea,
                  or chest tightness

          -  Documented to be RSV-positive at the current admission within 72 hours of screening,
             or as evaluated at Screening

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Related to medical history:

               -  Pregnant, breastfeeding, or lactating females

               -  Subjects requiring &gt; 50% supplemental oxygen (while the subject is awake) at
                  Screening

               -  Subjects with a Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) &gt; 7 at Baseline

               -  Any clinically significant history of a bleeding disorder (as determined by the
                  investigator) at any time in the past or epistaxis (as determined by the
                  investigator) within 30 days prior to screening

               -  Known significant abnormality altering the anatomy of the nose or nasopharynx
                  that in, the opinion of the investigator, will preclude obtaining adequate nasal
                  swab sampling in either nasal passage

               -  Waiting for or recently (within the past 12 months) received a bone marrow, stem
                  cell, or solid organ transplant, or who have received radiation or chemotherapy
                  within 12 months prior to screening

               -  Known history of HIV/AIDS, hepatitis B or C

               -  History of severe dementia or Alzheimer's disease

               -  History of drug and/or alcohol abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator,
                  may prevent adherence to study activities

          -  Related to medical condition at screening:

               -  Influenza-positive as determined by local diagnostic test

               -  New onset of arrhythmia during current admission

               -  Use of mechanical ventilation during the current admission, not including
                  noninvasive ventilation

               -  Positive bacteremia or fungemia at the current admission

               -  Inadequate treatment of confirmed bacterial, fungal, or non-RSV pneumonia, as
                  determined by the investigator

               -  New cerebrovascular accident or stroke documented at the current admission

               -  Admission for trauma or emergent or planned surgeries

               -  Excessive nausea/vomiting at admission, as determined by the investigator, that
                  precludes administration of an orally administered study drug

          -  Related to allergies:

               -  Known allergy to components of the study drug (microcrystalline cellulose,
                  mannitol, croscarmellose sodium, magnesium stearate, polyvinyl alcohol, titanium
                  dioxide, polyethylene glycol and talc)

               -  Documented history of acute (anaphylaxis) or delayed (Stevens-Johnson syndrome
                  or epidermal necrolysis) allergy to sulfa drugs
