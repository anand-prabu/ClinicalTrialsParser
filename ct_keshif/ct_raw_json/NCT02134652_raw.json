            "textblock": "Dengue fever has various levels of severity, from mild disease to severe hemorrhagic\n      complications and shock. Dengue is endemic world-wide and has been found in the United\n      States. The mortality from dengue fever can be as high as 15-20%, with nearly 22,000 deaths\n      annually, most of them children (Reddy, 2013). There is no reliable way to immediately\n      predict which children presenting with a fever during a Dengue fever outbreak will progress\n      to more severe disease. Some children with dengue fever will improve with limited clinical\n      interventions, but others require intensive therapy. Limited healthcare resources in\n      developing countries make decisions on treatment or disposition difficult as many children\n      and poor clinical decision increase morbidity and mortality. In more developed countries\n      such as the United States, early identification of patients with dengue fever has the\n      potential to identify children who may benefit from early interventions. Identifying those\n      patients is the first step in exploring early therapies to effect mortality. Previous\n      research has demonstrated that intrathoracic/ peritoneal fluid and gallbladder wall\n      thickening is associated with worsening of the clinical prognosis for hospitalized patients\n      with dengue fever (Michels, 2013). We will explore earlier presentations in the emergency\n      department and outpatient department.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that the presence of gallbladder wall thickening and/or pleural effusions\n      in children correlates with progression to Dengue hemorrhagic fever and Dengue shock. In\n      addition, we hypothesize that sonographic imaging of pediatric patients presenting to the\n      emergency department with a fever during a Dengue fever outbreak will change management and\n      disposition. Our specific aim is to 1) compare the accuracy of bedside ultrasound detection\n      of intra-thoracic fluid, peritoneal free fluid, and gallbladder wall thickening and physical\n      exam versus physical exam alone in diagnosing dengue fever and 2) determine the association\n      between sonographic features of dengue (intra-thoracic fluid and gallbladder wall\n      thickening) and clinical outcome in children with dengue fever.\n\n      This study is a prospective observational clinical study in the emergency department,\n      inpatient ward, intensive care unit, and outpatient department of the Angkor Hospital for\n      Children in Siem Reap, Cambodia. Study subjects will include children 16 years or less, who\n      present during the annual Dengue Fever outbreak with suspected Dengue fever. Subjects\n      include children with an acute febrile illness, and two of the following: headache,\n      retro-orbital pain, myalgias, arthralgia, rash, hemorrhagic manifestations, or plasma\n      leakage (i.e. shortness of breath, abdominal distention/pain). Clinicians will determine\n      their clinical suspicion of dengue, intended therapeutic interventions and disposition\n      following a history and physical exam but before ultrasound imaging. Study personnel will\n      perform diagnostic bedside ultrasound imaging of the gallbladder and peritoneal and pleural\n      spaces (FAST exam) and the clinician again determine their clinical suspicion of Dengue,\n      intended therapeutic interventions and disposition. Patients will be followed to determine\n      clinical outcome, therapeutic interventions and disposition.  The primary endpoint is\n      progression of disease. The secondary endpoint will be change in clinical care provided in\n      the emergency department related to ultrasound imaging."
