The aim of the TARGet Kids! registry is to link early life\n      exposures to health problems including obesity, micronutrient deficiencies, and\n      developmental problems.\n\n      TARGet Kids! represents an innovative collaboration between child health researchers and\n      children's primary care doctors (pediatricians and family physicians) to promote research\n      that really matters and create solutions to some of the today's biggest health concerns. The\n      results of this collaborative research study are not only improving the quality of\n      children's healthcare but also the health of children across the country. Coordinated by\n      Sick Kids and St. Michael's Hospital with data management services by the Applied Health\n      Research Centre (AHRC), TARGet Kids! is the only primary care research network for children\n      in Canada."
