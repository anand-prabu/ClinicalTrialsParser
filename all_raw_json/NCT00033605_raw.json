Patients\n      are stratified according to prior anterior resection of the rectum (yes vs no), total\n      planned cumulative dose of radiotherapy, including boost fields (4,500-5,350 cGy vs\n      5,351-6,000 cGy vs more than 6,000 cGy), use of concurrent fluorouracil (none vs bolus vs\n      continuous infusion), use of concurrent leucovorin calcium (yes vs no), use of concurrent\n      cisplatin (yes vs no), superior border of initial field (at or inferior to the L4-5\n      interspace vs superior to the L4-5 interspace), planned intracavitary brachytherapy (yes vs\n      no), and primary site of disease (rectal cancer vs prostate cancer vs gynecological cancer\n      vs other). Beginning no later than the fourth day of radiotherapy, patients are randomized\n      to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive short-acting octreotide subcutaneously (SC) on day 1 and\n           long-acting octreotide intramuscularly (IM) on days 2 and 29.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive placebo SC on day 1 and IM on days 2 and 29. In both arms,\n           treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or the development of\n           severe diarrhea.\n\n      Patients complete a bowel function questionnaire at baseline, weekly during radiotherapy,\n      and then weekly for 4 weeks and at 1 and 2 years after completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 4 weeks and then at 1 and 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 125 patients (62 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 38 months."
