Unnecessary delays in the diagnosis and treatment of brain\n      damage in patients who can benefit from evacuation procedures can lead to worse brain\n      injury, worse outcome and, sometimes, unnecessary death. However, there is no reliable and\n      sensitive method for diagnosis of TBI severity in the field. In this study we will examine\n      the feasibility of using this a multifocal chromatic pupillometer for monitoring TBI, by\n      examining the pupillary response to multifocal chromatic stimuli in intracranial pressure\n      (ICP)-monitored severe TBI patients. As control, normal subjects will be tested for\n      pupillary responses using this device."
