  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The success of coronary artery bypass grafting is reliant on the quality of the grafts used.
      A new technique for harvesting veins used as grafts has been introduced. The study
      hypothesis is that veins harvested with this technique have an improved endothelial
      function.

    <description>The saphenous vein is exposed by a longitudinal incision, and all visible side branches ligated. The vein is then isolated together with a pedicle of surrounding tissue and left in situ until extracorporeal circulation is started to allow continuous heparinized blood perfusion. After removal, the vein is stored in blood obtained from the aortic cannula before cooling. To check for leakage from side branches and the distal anastomosis, the proximal end of the graft is briefly connected to the arterial cannula.</description>

    <description>The saphenous vein is exposed by a longitudinal leg incision, skeletonized from surrounding tissue, and side branches ligated. The vein is removed from the leg immediately after dissection, manually distended with saline using a syringe and stored in saline at room temperature, according to standard procedure at St. Olav's Hospital.</description>
