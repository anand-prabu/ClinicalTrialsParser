The main task for\n      this research project is to address how this novel stimulant acutely influences motivation,\n      divergent and convergent thinking, cognitive performance and subjective wellbeing in\n      non-sleep deprived healthy young adults.This is a randomised between-subjects parallel group\n      design study.\n\n      Based on the hypothesis that psychostimulants might enhance creativity through the increase\n      in of dopamine and executive planning in healthy adults , we predict that healthy\n      individuals who are in the modafinil condition will perform better in the motivation,\n      creativity, and the cognitive performance tasks. Furthermore, based on the evidence that\n      modafinil increases dopamine in the nucleus accumbens, putamen and the caudate, we expect\n      specific subjective well-being and pleasure enhancement associated with modafinil use in\n      healthy young adults."

Participants will be randomly allocated to one group and will receive\n      either one dose of modafinil (200mg) or a placebo prior to testing.\n\n      Participants Sixty-four healthy volunteers will be identified via the City of Cambridge\n      participant panel, and via local advertisements. Participants between the ages of 18-40\n      years will be chosen to avoid any effects of cognitive decline. The larger age range will be\n      chosen to be representative of a wide range of ages and socio-economic statuses.  A\n      chartered psychologist will screen all volunteers.\n\n      After participants are assessed by the team, they then will complete a baseline\n      physiological measures (blood pressure and pulse) and the National Adult Reading Test (NART)\n      which calculates pre-morbid IQ estimates and matches participants' level of verbal IQ.\n      Participants will then be given a single oral dose (200 mg) of modafinil or placebo with a\n      small glass of water. They will then be asked to rest in a quiet room. Two hours post-drug\n      administration, participants will also complete the computerised neuropsychological battery\n      including the motivational reinforcement cue task and the salience of pleasure task in the\n      form of visual analogue scale (VAS) on a computer screen. The VAS will measure the\n      subjective pleasure gained from completing the computerised tasks and in participating in\n      the study. After the completion of the study, participants will be debriefed by the\n      researcher and will be discharged by a research nurse."
