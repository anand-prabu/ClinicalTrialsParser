            "textblock": "While few students may consider a career in research at baseline, receiving information from\n      peers via online social networks represents a potential way of reaching underserved minority\n      students.\n\n      This study addresses a critical problem in the process to diversify the pipeline of clinical\n      researchers - how to cultivate baseline interest in research among high achieving youth\n      before they participate in pipeline programs. We will seek to challenge existing paradigms\n      of studying effectiveness of interventions to promote entry of minority youth into clinical\n      research careers through testing a novel social media campaign that aims to increase\n      interest in research careers among schoolmates of students in a pipeline program.  We are\n      testing the use of of peer-created and inspired videos about career choice as a novel way to\n      develop messages that have potential to influence teens.\n\n      Should this research program be successful, it will yield valuable insights for researchers\n      and educators who are attempting to train minority students about the importance of\n      involving youth in creating materials to recruit and retain minorities into pipeline\n      programs and educational programs targeted towards clinical research."
