            "textblock": "Eating disorders are conditions that are defined by abnormal eating habits that involve\n      insufficient or excessive food intake. With regards to treating these disorders, there is an\n      increasing interest in fat deprivation due to a lack of proper diet, particularly dietary\n      fats such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. These fatty acids are essential components of the\n      brain and are important for normal functioning of the body. Since the body cannot synthesize\n      these fats, it has to rely completely on diet to obtain a sufficient amount. Hence, diets\n      that lack sufficient fats or under fasting conditions, the imbalance of these fats can\n      severely alter brain functions. The investigators want to see if these supplements are well\n      tolerated and accepted by adolescent patients with eating disorders."
