  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liposomal formulations are frequently used today in the treatment of cancer. LiPlaCis is the
      first targeted liposomal formulation with a tumour triggered release mechanism to undergo
      clinical development in oncology and it is expected that LiPlaCis will improve the
      therapeutic index of cisplatin compared to conventional cisplatin.

      Cisplatin is one of the most widely used drugs in the treatment of cancer due to its
      documented efficacy in a number of tumour types. Furthermore, it seems highly likely that
      cisplatin will remain an important drug in the future treatment of cancer. However, the drug
      is associated with a number of serious toxicities that complicates or necessitates
      discontinuation of therapy - e.g. need for pre-hydration, neurotoxicity, nausea and
      vomiting.

      Thus, there is a well-established need for improving cisplatin therapy in cancer patients.
      One option here is improving the formulation of the drug, so that a more selective up-take
      of cisplatin administered takes place at the tumour sites.

      Based on the results of the pre-clinical studies of LiPlaCis, it seems clear that LiPlaCis
      offers the potential to improve cisplatin therapy to the benefits of cancer patients.

      In a prematurely stopped Phase I Dutch study a Recommended Dose (RD) for a Phase II study
      was never reached which is now the aim of this Phase I dose escalating study.
