Purpose To evaluate the use of mitomycin-C (MMC) as an intraoperative adjunct during\n           photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), its effect on postoperative healing and its ability\n           to reduce the postoperative topical steroid course after the surgery.\n\n        2. Research Design This is a single-center, prospective, comparative cohort study.\n\n        3. Hypothesis There will not be a significant difference in the refractive corrections\n           amongst the treatment groups, 12 months after surgery.\n\n        4. Objectives The primary study objective is to compare the effect of intraoperative MMC\n           and a postoperative short topical steroid taper of 3 weeks, intraoperative MMC and a\n           rapid topical steroid taper of 1 week, and a more commonly accepted postoperative\n           regimen of a 2 month long topical steroid taper without any intraoperative MMC.  The\n           primary endpoint evaluated will be objective estimates of refractive error (WaveScan\n           WaveFront\u2122 System) at 12 months post-surgery.  Secondarily, the extent of haze\n           formation will be evaluated objectively using densitometry maps generated by automated\n           Scheimpflug imaging of the cornea (Pentacam\u00ae).  Furthermore, the subjective vision from\n           the patients' perspective will be evaluated by questionnaires."

Methodology At the Navy Refractive Surgery Center San Diego (NRSC SD), a total of 300\n           patients will be enrolled and randomly assigned to three cohorts.  PRK will be\n           performed in a standard fashion for all treatment groups.  In the first two groups,\n           intraoperative MMC 0.01% for a contact time of 15 seconds will be utilized.  During the\n           postoperative period, the first cohort will use the short steroid taper and the second\n           cohort will use the rapid steroid taper.  The third cohort will not receive any\n           intraoperative MMC and will self-administer postoperative steroids, tapering for two\n           months.  All cohorts will be followed at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 12\n           months after the procedure. Standard clinical measures of visual performance will be\n           recorded. Since visually significant corneal haze is relatively rare, corneal\n           densitometry will be used as an objective measure to detect subclinical corneal haze in\n           addition to our usual subjective haze evaluation done by the clinical optometrists.\n\n      The patients will complete a voluntary questionnaire that evaluates their subjective\n      impression of the refractive surgery, their recovery and their outcomes.  Specifically, the\n      patient will report the use of refractive correction, usefulness of the surgery at work, dry\n      eye complaints, and subjective appraisal of their vision."

The lower age limit\n             of 21 is intended to ensure documentation of refractive stability.\n\n          2. Manifest spherical equivalent (MSE) from +3.00 D to -11.0D with refractive cylinder\n             of up to 3.00 D.\n\n          3. Best spectacle corrected visual acuity of 20/25 or better in both eyes.\n\n          4. Stable spectacle refraction, confirmed by clinical records.

Concurrent topical or systemic medications which may impair healing, including\n             corticosteroids, antimetabolites, isotretinoin, (Accutane\u2122), amiodarone hydrochloride\n             (Cordarone\u2122), and/or sumatriptan (Imitrex\u2122).\n\n          4. Medical conditions which, in the judgment of the investigator, may impair healing,\n             including but not limited to thyroid disorders and diabetes.\n\n          5. Active ophthalmic disease, neovascularization of the cornea within 1 mm of the\n             intended ablation zone, or lens opacity.\n\n          6. Evidence of glaucoma or an intraocular pressure greater than 22 mm Hg at baseline.\n\n          7. Evidence of keratoconus, corneal irregularity, or abnormal videokeratography in\n             either eye.\n\n          8. Patients with known sensitivity or inappropriate responsiveness to any of the\n             medications used in the post-operative course.\n\n          9.
