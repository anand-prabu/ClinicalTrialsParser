The usual treatment for this condition is a\n      specific exercise program that has been previously shown to be effective.  The research team\n      is trying to determine if combining Astym with the exercise program is more effective than\n      exercise program only.\n\n      The main hypothesis for this study is that Astym plus eccentric exercise will be more\n      effective than eccentric exercise alone at improving pain and function in patients with\n      insertional Achilles tendinopathy."

Once in the elevated position, subjects are instructed to transfer all of their body weight to the painful leg and slowly lower their heel to the floor while keeping their knee extended. The eccentric exercise program will consist of 3 sets of 15 repetitions performed per session. Subjects will perform 2 sessions per day for a total of 12 weeks and a log will be kept to monitor compliance. In order to partially control for the effect of regular contact with a therapist, subjects in the control group will be contacted by telephone one time per week to discuss their progress with the program and address any questions they may have.",
