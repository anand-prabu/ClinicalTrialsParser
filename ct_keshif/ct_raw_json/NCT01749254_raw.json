Using positron emission tomography, we have recently shown that sodium\n      18-fluoride uptake holds major promise as a novel marker of plaque vulnerability and\n      rupture. Here we wish to characterise coronary atherosclerotic plaque using\n      128-multidetector computed tomography combined with 18-fluorodeoxyglucose and sodium\n      18-fluoride positron emission tomography and Virtual histology-intravascular ultrasound in\n      80 patients with stable and unstable coronary artery disease. This has the potential to\n      provide an innovative and highly valuable translational model with which to test novel\n      therapeutic interventions targeted at reducing atheroma and plaque rupture. This could have\n      major implications for the future treatment of cardiovascular disease."
