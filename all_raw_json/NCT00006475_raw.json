Provide expanded access of this treatment to these patients.\n      III. Determine the rate of hematological response and duration of response in patients\n      treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the improvements in symptomatic parameters in\n      patients treated with this regimen. V. Determine the cytogenetic response in patients\n      treated with this regimen. VI. Determine the overall survival in patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an expanded-access, multicenter study. Patients receive oral STI571 daily.\n      Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients who are considered to have benefited may continue treatment beyond 1\n      year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not determined"
