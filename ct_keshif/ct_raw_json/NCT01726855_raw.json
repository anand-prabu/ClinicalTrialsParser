The function outcomes of 14 patients (Group A) with flexor tendon repair\n      in zone II with this new technique were compared with those of 32 patients (Group B) with\n      flexor tendon repair in zone II with standard modified Kessler technique. This new technique\n      may prevent serious adhesions between flexor digitorum superficialis /profundus tendons."
