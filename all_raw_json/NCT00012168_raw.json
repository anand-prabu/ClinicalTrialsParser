Once the afferent lymphatic channel and sentinel node have been\n      identified, patients undergo cervical lymphadenectomy followed by resection of the primary\n      tumor.\n\n      Resected primary tumor, radioactive lymph nodes, and blue-stained sentinel nodes are then\n      subjected to molecular (polymerase chain reaction) and histocytochemical\n      (immunohistochemistry for cytokeratin and micrometastases, light microscopy) analyses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 25 patients will be accrued for this study."
