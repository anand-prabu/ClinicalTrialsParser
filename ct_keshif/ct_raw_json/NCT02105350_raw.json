Everyone will receive the same standard doses of oxaliplatin and\n      gemcitabine but may receive different doses of MEK 162.\n\n      MEK 162 is a new drug which plays an important role in the regulation of cell growth and has\n      been shown to shrink tumours in patients with biliary cancer and other types of human\n      cancers.  This type of drug has also been shown to shrink tumours when given in combination\n      with cisplatin and gemcitabine in research studies done in animals and in some patients with\n      biliary cancer."
