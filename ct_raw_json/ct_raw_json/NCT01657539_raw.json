During periods 2 and 4 (2 weeks each) the\n      volunteers will have a daily ingestion of yogurt containing probiotic or of control yogurt\n      which did not contain probiotic. Periods 1 and 3 were run-in and wash-out periods of 1 and 4\n      weeks, respectively. Experimental samples of saliva and biofilm will be collected from each\n      participant at the end of each phase. Mutans streptococci, lactobacilli, total aciduric\n      microorganisms, Candida spp. and total cultivable microorganisms will be counted. The values\n      before and after the treatment will be compared with Wilcoxon's test (p<0.05)."
