Other objectives are: 2) to determine the effect of\n      Tamoxifen on the pharmacokinetics of 9-cis-Retinoic acid; 3) to evaluate the anti-tumor\n      activity of this combination therapy within the context of a phase I study; 4) and to\n      determine the expression of surrogate biomarkers of breast carcinogenesis before and after\n      treatment."
