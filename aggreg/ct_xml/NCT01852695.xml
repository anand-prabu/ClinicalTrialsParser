  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the highly technological environment of the modern neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),
      the infant is physically, psychologically and emotionally separated from its parents.
      Recognition that this impedes parent- infant interaction and is detrimental to the infant,
      led to the development of programs such as family centered care, kangaroo care and
      skin-to-skin care1-3. However, they are based on the common premise that only NICU
      professionals with special skills can provide care for the infant. Parents are relegated to
      a supportive role, and some have described themselves as voyeurs who are &quot;allowed&quot; to visit
      and hold their infants4. Many feel anxious and unprepared to care for their infants after
      discharge5.

      In 1979, a shortage of NICU nurses in Estonia prompted Levin1,6 to implement a &quot;humane&quot; care
      model in which parents provided nursing care for the infant (except for administration of IV
      fluid and medication), while nurses provided teaching and guidance to parents. This resulted
      in 30% improvement in weight gain1,30% reduction in infections, 20% reduction in NICU length
      of stay, 50% reduction in nurse utilization and overall improved satisfaction among parents
      and staff [personal communication, Levin,A.]. Building on the Estonian experience, we have
      developed a new Family Integrated Care (FIC) model that is adapted for the NICU environment
      in North America. In a pilot study at Mount Sinai Hospital, Toronto 46 infants and their
      families were enrolled in the study. Preliminary results and feedback from parents and
      healthcare providers (HCP) show that the FIC model is both feasible and safe, and may lead
      to improved outcomes including improved weight gain(paper submitted for publication). This
      study is a cluster randomized controlled trial in 16 tertiary level NICUs, to evaluate the
      efficacy of the FIC model in Canada.
