It is not yet known whether a\n      nicotine inhaler or bupropion are more effective alone or combined for stopping smoking.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of the nicotine inhaler or\n      bupropion alone to that of the nicotine inhaler combined with bupropion in helping people to\n      stop smoking and prevent starting smoking again."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the effectiveness of nicotine inhaler vs bupropion vs nicotine\n      inhaler plus bupropion on smoking cessation and prevention of relapse in participants who\n      currently smoke. II. Compare the reduction in the rate of relapse to smoking after initial\n      abstinence in participants treated long term with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to gender, cigarettes smoked per day at time of screening (10-39 vs\n      40 or more), and total length of smoking in years (less than 5 vs 5-9 vs 10 or more).\n      Participants are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Participants receive 6-16\n      nicotine inhaler cartridges per day. Arm II: Participants receive oral bupropion 1-2 times\n      daily. Arm III: Participants receive 6-16 nicotine inhaler cartridges per day and oral\n      bupropion 1-2 times daily. In all arms, treatment continues for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks,\n      participants are randomized a second time based on whether they continue to smoke or are\n      smoke-free. Participants randomized to arm I who continue to smoke are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms. Arm IV: Participants receive oral bupropion 1-2 times daily for 12 weeks\n      Arm V: Participants receive oral placebo 1-2 times daily for 12 weeks. Participants\n      randomized to arm II who continue to smoke are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm\n      VI: Participants receive 6-16 nicotine inhaler cartridges per day for 12 weeks. Arm VII:\n      Participants receive 6-16 placebo inhaler cartridges per day for 12 weeks. Participants\n      randomized to arm III who continue to smoke do not receive any further therapy. Participants\n      randomized to arm I who are smoke-free are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm\n      VIII: Participants receive 6-16 nicotine inhaler cartridges per day for 40 weeks. Arm IX:\n      Participants receive 6-16 placebo inhaler cartridges per day for 40 weeks. Participants\n      randomized to arm II who are smoke-free are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm X:\n      Participants receive oral bupropion 1-2 times daily for 40 weeks. Arm XI: Participants\n      receive oral placebo 1-2 times daily for 40 weeks. Participants randomized to arm III who\n      are smoke-free are randomized to one of four treatment arms. Arm XII: Participants receive\n      6-16 nicotine inhaler cartridges per day and oral placebo 1-2 times daily for 40 weeks. Arm\n      XIII: Participants receive 6-16 placebo inhaler cartridges per day and oral bupropion 1-2\n      times daily for 40 weeks. Arm XIV: Participants receive 6-16 nicotine inhaler cartridges per\n      day and oral bupropion 1-2 times daily for 40 weeks. Arm XV: Participants receive 6-16\n      placebo inhaler cartridges per day and oral placebo 1-2 times daily for 40 weeks. All\n      participants are followed every month for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1850 participants (616 per treatment arm of the initial\n      randomization) will be accrued for this study within 6 months."
