To determine the safety and tolerability of dendritic cell (DC)-AdGM carbonic anhydrase\n      IX (CAIX) administered by intradermal injections at study doses and schedule.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate clinical antitumor effects following study treatment according to Response\n      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline version 1.1. Parameters include\n      objective response (complete response [CR], partial response [PR]), duration of response in\n      patients with objective response, and time to disease progression.\n\n      II. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by enzyme-linked immunospot\n      (ELISpot) for numeric determination of CAIX specific T cells in blood.\n\n      III. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by cytokine profiling of T cell\n      culture supernatants for characterization of the immune response in subjects with\n      demonstrated immune activation may be performed.\n\n      IV. To evaluate immune responses to DC-AdGMCAIX vaccination by anti-sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n      antibody response.\n\n      V. To evaluate tumor biopsies for immune cell infiltrates.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive AdGMCAIX-transduced autologous dendritic cells intradermally (ID) on days\n      1, 15, and 29.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2-3 months for at least\n      6 months."
