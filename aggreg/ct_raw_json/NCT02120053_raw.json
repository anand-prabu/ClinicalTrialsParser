            "textblock": "More than 2 million French people suffer from the widespread disability of edentulism, with\n      large consequences on function, nutrition, aesthetics and well-being. Complete denture is a\n      common therapeutic strategy.\n\n      The immediate complete denture technique consists in placing the denture in the same\n      clinical session as last anterior teeth extractions. With this technique, aesthetic and\n      function are immediately reintroduced and the patient is never left toothless or without any\n      denture.\n\n      After teeth extractions, alveolar healing process leads to ridge resorption with bone volume\n      modifications and reduction in height and width.\n\n      However ridge bone volume is an essential factor in removable denture stability. With\n      implantology as an alternative prosthetic strategy, ridge volume is also a most important\n      factor to place dental implants in a situation close to previous dental roots position. In\n      order to preserve bone volume, a current alternative strategy proposes to place bone\n      substitute materials in tooth sockets after extraction. This strategy was never evaluated\n      with the immediate complete denture technique.\n\n      Hypothesis: A new strategy associating immediate complete denture and bone substitute\n      material is more effective than conventional immediate complete denture in a bone\n      preservation perspective."
