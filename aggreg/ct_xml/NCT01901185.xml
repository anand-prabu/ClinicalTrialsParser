      The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of people with Rheumatoid Arthritis or
      Psoriatic Arthritis to use an experimental autoinjector to self inject etanercept (EnbrelÂ®).
      Study participants need to have been self-administering etanercept for greater than or equal
      to 6 months prior to screening. You will be in this study for about 9 weeks. This includes a
      4-week screening period and a 5-week treatment period.

        Inclusion Criteria: Subject has diagnosis of RA or PsA and indicated for treatment with
        etanercept per the current label, based on history. -  Subject is willing to self-inject
        per investigator judgement at screening. - Subject has no known history of tuberculosis.

        - Exclusion Criteria: Latex allergy. - Subject has any active infection (including chronic
        or localized infections) for which anti-infectives were indicated within 4 weeks prior to
        first study dose of etanercept. - Subject had prosthetic joint infection within 5 years of
        screening or native joint infection within 1 year of screening. - Other criteria may
        apply.
