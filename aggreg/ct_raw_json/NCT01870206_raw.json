The virus enters the body through the mouth\n      and multiplies in the intestine. Initial symptoms are fever, fatigue, headache, vomiting,\n      stiffness in the neck and pain in the limbs. One in 200 infections leads to irreversible\n      paralysis (usually in the legs). Among those paralysed, 5% to 10% die when their breathing\n      muscles become immobilized. There is no cure for polio, it can only be prevented. Polio\n      vaccine, given multiple times, can protect a child for life.\n\n      Compare in newborns the immunogenicity and safety of the vaccine OPV produced by Birmex\n      compared with the vaccine OPV produced by Sanofi Pasteur, both produced in Vero cells."
