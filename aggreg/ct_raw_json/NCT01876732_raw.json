            "textblock": "Vitamin B12 has several important functions in the body, two of which are production of red\n      blood cells and the maintenance of a healthy nervous system. When vitamin B12 is deficient,\n      abnormal red blood cells form. These cells are called megaloblasts. The end result is a\n      decreased number of red blood cells; a condition called anemia. Some symptoms of anemia\n      include fatigue, weakness, shortness of breath, and pallor. Vitamin B12 is also important in\n      maintaining a healthy nervous system. Nerves are surrounded by an insulating material that\n      helps them conduct impulses.  Patients with low B12 levels who receive this vitamin in\n      injection form, state that there quality of life is better.  Anemia in Hemodialysis patients\n      is treated with Epogen, a synthetic material which helps your body make blood cells.  The\n      investigators believe that if you have a low vitamin B12 level in your blood and the\n      investigators give you the vitamin during dialysis your requirement for epogen will be lower\n      and you will be able to produce blood cells better.  When evaluating for Vitamin B12\n      deficiency a special test is needed called methylmalonic acid level (MMA).  This is a blood\n      test  that will be performed and when this level is high and your vitamin B12 level is in\n      the low normal range the investigators can make a diagnosis of vitamin B12 deficiency."
