  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects and efficacy of dietary sodium
      restriction by mean of a new healthcare approach in patients with chronic kidney disease.
      The test persons in the intervention group are actively supported to adhere to a restricted
      sodium diet with a structured self-regulation program to implement sodium recommendations
      that are in current guidelines.

      The intervention entails two group meetings with fellow-patients, motivational interviewing,
      e-coaching and ICT-based self-regulation as add-on to regular care. The intervention
      consists of a baseline measurement (T0), followed by a preparation phase of 2-3 weeks
      duration before the first group meeting. The first group meeting is followed by the action
      phase with a second group meeting in 9-11 weeks. During the action phase, test persons are
      stimulated to use the special self-regulation computer program, monitor their dietary sodium
      intake on this website and receive e-coaching from their personal coach. Test persons in the
      control group receive standard care. After 3 months in study (T1), all test persons visit
      the outpatient clinic for measurements and data collection. The half year long maintenance
      phase starts after this timepoint, test persons in the intervention group can continue the
      use of the special website and get feedback from their coach at 3, 4, 5, 6 months. After 9
      months of total study duration (T2), data collection and measurements take place.

      At each timepoint blood and 24-hourly urine is collected, test persons fill out
      questionnaires. The intervention group collects after 5 weeks in study an additional
      24-hourly urine collection to assess dietary compliance and enable feedback.

      Cost-efficacy and implementation analysis will be conducted after study closure.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Be 18 years or older.

          -  Have chronic kidney disease (CKD stage 1-3, CKD 4 if eGFR is not lower than 25
             mL/min/1.73m2, or be a renal transplant recipient.)

          -  Have a urinary sodium excretion during at least the last 2 subsequent visits of more
             than 130 mmol per day, or one last urinary sodium excretion of more than 150 mmol per
             day.

          -  Have a systolic blood pressure higher than 135 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure higher
             than 85 mmHg or a well-controlled blood pressure by treatment with antihypertensives
             including RAAS-blockade (ACE-inhibitor or ARB).

          -  Sufficient command of the Dutch language.

          -  Access and ability to use the internet.

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  eGFR &lt; 25 ml/min/1.73m2 or an anticipated need for predialysis work-up within the
             time frame of the study.

          -  Unstable disease: defined as rapid, persistent, progressive renal function loss (e.g.
             &gt; 6 mL/min/1.73m2 per year), not from acute, intermittent origin.
