This treatment will be delivered via\n      catheter under local anaesthetic.\n\n      Patients assigned to the surgical management group will receive the standard surgical\n      management in use at their hospital for treatment of recurrence which may include a single\n      post-operative installation of 40mg MMC within 24 hours.\n\n      All participants will be followed up at 3 weeks from the start of treatment (ie at time of\n      final MMC instillation for chemoresection group) and each will receive a cystoscopy three\n      months from the end of treatment to assess response, in accordance with European Association\n      of Urology (EAU) guidelines.  Subsequent cystoscopic follow up will take place 12 months\n      after treatment if recurrence-free at 3 months and then annually."
