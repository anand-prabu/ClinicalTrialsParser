      A large body of data shows that fatigue impairs human performance. Additionally, many
      studies have provided evidence that fatigue can worsen mood, as indicated by increased
      scores on measures of depression, anxiety, confusion, and anger. In this context, we
      examined attentional and emotional changes in physicians after they completed an
      overwhelming outpatient clinic in a university-affiliated tertiary referral hospital in
      South Korea.
