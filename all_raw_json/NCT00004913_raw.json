            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel administered in combination\n      with cisplatin, fluorouracil, and leucovorin calcium in patients with advanced solid tumors.\n      II. Determine the toxicities associated with this combination regimen in this patient\n      population. III. Evaluate the clinical response to this combination regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel and fluorouracil (5-FU). Patients\n      receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2, and leucovorin\n      calcium IV immediately followed by 5-FU IV on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in\n      the absence of disease progression. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of\n      docetaxel and 5-FU until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which more than 1 of 3 or 1 of 5 patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
