Overweight subjects showing a state of disturbed blood glucose control\n      will be included as subjects with compromised health and compared to healthy lean subjects\n      with the same age (shifting from healthy towards unhealthy, not diseased).\n\n      Hypothesis Ex vivo LPS stimulation of whole blood will induce a measurable inflammatory\n      cytokine response in a healthy population that is different from a response of the\n      compromised population. The investigators will include subjects aged 35-45 years that differ\n      in health characteristics, especially blood HbA1c, fat% and waist circumference."
