Determination and comparison of the relative rates of\n      progression and extents of atherosclerosis in the coronary and carotid arterial trees may\n      have major impacts on clinical research and clinical practice.  Correlation between findings\n      in the carotid and coronary circulations is an important scientific and clinical topic to\n      address. Results from a well design study incorporating imaging technologies that currently\n      represent the gold standards for the assessment of coronary and carotid artery plaque\n      burden, will have potentially impact on clinical research and clinical practice."
