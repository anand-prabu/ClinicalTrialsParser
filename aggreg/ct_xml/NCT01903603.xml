  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to establish and evaluate an image-based biomarker for the
      impaired motor control and sensory information processing present in Cerebral palsy (CP)
      patients

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral palsy (CP) may lead to various motor deficits, which further influence the
      activities and participation. It would be ideal to characterize neural network and motor
      control model in patients with CP that underlies their clinical behavior by identifying
      altered neural network and motor control associated with behavioral improvement. The aim of
      this study is to investigate the brain image and motor control in patients with CP evaluated
      by multimodal imaging studies utilizing multi-modal techniques and kinematic analysis.

      This study includes a prospective longitudinal study of patients with CP over one-year. This
      study will be executed in 3 phases within 3 years: 1st phase (1st years): to establish the
      multimodal brain images and motor control, and clinical outcomes protocol with a prospective
      one-year follow-up study in healthy subjects; 2nd phase (2nd years): to establish the brain
      images and motor control, and clinical outcomes with a prospective one-year follow-up study
      in older patients with CP; and 3rd phase (3rd years): to establish the brain images and
      motor control, and clinical outcomes with a prospective one-year follow-up study in younger
      patients with CP. In a prospective longitudinal study, each participant received 3-times
      measurements: at the beginning, 6 months later, and one year after the first data collection
      point
