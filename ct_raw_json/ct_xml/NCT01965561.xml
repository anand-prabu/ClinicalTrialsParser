    <textblock>
      The present research application is a new study involving normal human adult volunteers who
      will be used to investigate the performance of medical devices intended to stop junctional
      bleeding on the battlefield. Junctional wounds of interest are of the groin and the
      surrogate of bleeding is distal pulse absence temporarily during brief mechanical
      compression by devices at or near the groin. Data of differential device performance can
      generate knowledge of effectiveness rates ranked by device (models of devices), which may
      help in selecting prehospital devices for military and civilian trauma care.
