  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the two different saphenous vein cannulation
      techniques; real-time ultrasound image-guided technique (Ultrasound group) vs. traditional
      landmark technique (Landmark group).

    <measure>A comparison will be made between groups for overall success rate within 3 attempt of needle insertions or a 10 minute time period, whichever comes first.</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Before attempts of the cannulation are made, investigators will measure the diameter of the saphenous vein with ultrasound imaging to determine if there is correlation between size of the vein and success rate.</measure>

    <description>An operator is not allowed to use an ultrasound. A 22 or 24 G catheter will be advanced blindly toward the expected location of the saphenous vein at the level of the medial malleolus. The vein is often located just anterior to the medial malleolus. Once blood appears in the hub, then the catheter will be advanced into the saphenous vein.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>An operator will identify the saphenous vein by using ultrasound with a linear transducer (L15-7io) in short axis view. A 22 or 24 G catheter will be advanced until the tip of the needle is seen on the ultrasound image. Then, fine adjustments are made with the needle until the tip is visualized in contact with the anterior wall of the vein. The needle is then advanced until blood appears in the hub. The catheter is then advanced into the saphenous vein.</description>
