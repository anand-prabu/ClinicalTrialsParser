Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent anticonvulsants (Dilantin, Tegretol, or phenobarbital vs other anticonvulsants or\n      none).\n\n      Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 and oral\n      temozolomide on days 1-5. Treatment continues every 43 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
