  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic diseases and mitochondrial disorders are caused by genetic mutation which lead to
      disruptions in energy producing pathways in our body. Enough energy or calories must be
      given in the diet to ensure normal growth and development. Currently, energy needs for
      patients with metabolic and mitochondrial diseases are not measured, but is estimated using
      a mathematical equation based on healthy children. This may lead to under feeding or
      overfeeding of calories, and has negative nutritional implications.

      The clinical standard for measuring energy needs is the use of indirect calorimeter.The
      indirect calorimeter takes individualized measurements for each patient and therefore will
      enable dietitians and clinicians to provide sufficient calories in the diet to better manage
      the disease and promote normal growth and development.

      We believe daily energy requirements will vary within metabolic diseases (Phenylketonuria)
      and mitochondrial disorders (mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation defect, POLG1 mutation
      etc.).

      The objective of this preliminary study is to measure resting energy expenditure in children
      living with metabolic and mitochondrial conditions and data obtained will be used to
      generate future hypothesis and will form a basis for future studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Children(1-18y) who are diagnosed with either Phenylketonuria (PKU) or a
             mitochondrial disorder

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Children, less than 1y old, who are diagnosed with PKU or a mitochondrial disorder,
             as it is difficult to perform indirect calorimeter on them.

          -  Children(1-18y) who are not diagnosed with PKU or a mitochondrial disorder

          -  Children(1-18y) who are diagnosed with either PKU or a mitochondrial disorder, but
             are currently experiencing illness such as fever, cold, vomiting or diarrhea
