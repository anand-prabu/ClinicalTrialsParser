An early diagnosis with consequent therapy might prevent the\n      progression of disability.Objective To determine the structural and dynamic changes in the\n      microstrucutre of the spinal cord and CSF, and to explore the relationships between the MRI\n      parameters, clinical disability, and electrophysiology. Method and subjects Anatomical MRI\n      data will be acquired in subjects with spinal cord disorders and control subjects on a 3T\n      MRI scanner. Morphological changes will be assessed using a high axial resolution sequence,\n      diffusion tensor imaging sequences and an optimized MPRAGE sequence. Fluid dynamics will be\n      assessed using an optimized phase contrast sequence. Upper and lower limb function will be\n      scored in all subjects according to the American Spinal Cord Injury Association (ASIA)\n      impairment scale, the Graded and Redefined Assessment of Strength and Prehension (GRASSP),\n      Walking Impairment in Spinal Cord Injury (WISCI II), and Spinal Cord Independence Measure\n      (SCIM III). Nerve function will be measured by standard electrophysiological methods (evoked\n      potentials, nerve conduct velocity, nerve reflexes)."
