Exemplar models have been refered to as \"Fracture Liaison\n      Service\" (United-Kingdom [1-3], Europe [4,5] and Australia [6-8]) \"Osteoporosis Coordinator\n      Program\" (Canada [9,10]) or \"Care Manager Programs\" (USA [11,12]).\n\n      The objective of this trial is to assess efficacy of a new coordinator-based post-fracture\n      program in the Saint-Joseph Hospital in Paris to improve the management of osteoporosis\n      after fracture thanks to an optimal recommendations practice to reduce the incidence of\n      secondary fractures.\n\n      Men and women are included aged over 45 years with fragility wrist and hip fractures.\n\n      Evaluation criteria are based on the evidence-based assessment (stratify risk, identify\n      secondary causes of osteoporosis, fracture evaluation), the medication adherence, others\n      prescriptions adherence (osteodensitometry), the incidence of secondary fractures and number\n      of falls.\n\n      Number of patients : 200 Duration of the study: 3 years Patients' participation  duration: 6\n      months"
