      Ingestion of sodium citrate (Na-Cit), an alkalizing agent, increases extracellular pH via
      liver oxidation by decreasing [H+] and increasing bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-). Studies
      have confirmed that increasing extracellular pH promotes the efflux of La- and H+ from
      active muscles. This is due to an increase in activity of the pH sensitive monocarboxylate
      transporter as the gradient of intracellular versus extracellular H+ increases. Therefore,
      artificially inducing alkalosis prior to anaerobic exercise may reduce intracellular
      acidosis and increase the time to fatigue - defined as a decrease in force production with
      an increased perception of effort. The investigators will test the null hypothesis that
      sodium citrate ingestion (chronic and acute) will not have an effect on exercise performance
      compared to placebo.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaerobic glycolysis quickly provides adenosine triphosphate (ATP) for muscular contraction
      during high intensity, short duration exercise. The fast rate of glycolysis during anaerobic
      exercise results in pyruvate formation exceeding pyruvate oxidation resulting in a build up
      of lactic acid. Lactic acid dissociates quickly to lactate (La-) and hydrogen ion (H+) which
      causes a decrease in muscle and blood pH. The increase in H+ causes impaired release of
      calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and calcium ion binding which inhibits the coupling
      of actin and myosin.

      Ingestion of sodium citrate (Na-Cit), an alkalizing agent, increases extracellular pH via
      liver oxidation by decreasing [H+] and increasing bicarbonate concentration (HCO3-). Studies
      have confirmed that increasing extracellular pH promotes the efflux of La- and H+ from
      active muscles. This is due to an increase in activity of the pH sensitive monocarboxylate
      transporter as the gradient of intracellular versus extracellular H+ increases. Therefore,
      artificially inducing alkalosis prior to anaerobic exercise may reduce intracellular
      acidosis and increase the time to fatigue - defined as a decrease in force production with
      an increased perception of effort. Furthermore, Cit- enters the cell through the Plasma
      Membrane Citrate Transporter and in the cell Cit- is involved in a number of processes: i)
      intermediary in the Krebs Cycle, ii) transports acetyl-Co-enzyme A (CoA)from the
      mitochondria to the cytosol for fatty-acid synthesis, iii) negative allosteric effector of
      phosphofructokinase, iv) anionic effect on membrane potential can cause a reduction in the
      contraction threshold.

      Researchers have studied sodium bicarbonate and Na-Cit as potential alkalizing agents.
      Na-Cit has been studied in few sports over a broad array of doses, times, and distances with
      inconclusive results. McNaughton et al. researched the optimal doses and durations for
      Na-Cit to be potentially beneficial to performance. They concluded that 0.3-0.5g/kg, 90-120
      minutes prior to maximal effort are the optimal conditions for potential ergogenic effect.
      The only reported side effect was gastrointestinal (GI) discomfort in a 3 of the 8 subjects.
      However, it seems Na-Cit is handled better than the more commonly employed sodium
      bicarbonate.

      The investigators will test the null hypothesis that sodium citrate ingestion (chronic and
      acute) will not have an effect on exercise performance compared to placebo.
