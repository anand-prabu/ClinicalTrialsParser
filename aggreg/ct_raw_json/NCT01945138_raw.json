The investigators hypothesize that the average blood\n      glucose will be lower in the closed loop group than the control group, there will be less\n      glucose variability in the closed loop group than the control group, and there will be less\n      total time spent in hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia in the closed loop group than in the\n      control group.  The investigators also will investigate insulin requirements and islet\n      function in the first 6 months post-transplant in the closed loop group  The investigators\n      hypothesize that the insulin requirements will be lower and the C-peptide levels higher in\n      the closed loop group than in the control group."
