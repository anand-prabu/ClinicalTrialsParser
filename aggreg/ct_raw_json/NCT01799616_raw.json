            "textblock": "Erosive degenerative disk disease, also known as Modic type 1 changes, is usually\n      characterized by low back pain, with an inflammatory pain pattern, as seen in\n      spondylarthropathies. Intravenous pamidronate has proven effective in patients with\n      ankylosing spondylitis, and in painful bone diseases in general. We therefore hypothesized\n      that pamidronate would be effective in treating back pain associated with Modic type 1\n      changes.\n\n      This study aimed to determine pamidronate's efficiency in reducing pain, with the primary\n      outcome being a between-group difference of 30 points on a 100mm VAS at 3 months. Secondary\n      outcomes are the improvement in functional status and the drug's tolerance. Primary and\n      secondary outcome criteria will be assessed at each visit (inclusion, at 6 weeks, 3 months,\n      and 6 months). If the primary goal is not attained, a rigid or semi-rigid back brace will be\n      proposed to the patient, regardless of the treatment group.\n\n      In total, 48 patients will need to be recruited. These patients will be randomly assigned to\n      one of the two groups, with each group comprising 24 patients: one group will be given\n      pamidronate and the other placebo. Pamidronate will be administered at a dose of 90mg per\n      day, 2 days in a row, and every patient, regardless of the treatment group, will be given\n      paracetamol, in order to maintain blinding by preventing drug-induced fever."
