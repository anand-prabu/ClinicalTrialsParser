Eylea appears to have a longer duration of action in the\n      eye and a more powerful effect on the edema in the macula than previously used growth factor\n      inhibitors. This means that the disease can be controlled with fewer number of injections\n      into the eye and the investigators can therefore reduce the risk of complications associated\n      with this type of treatment.\n\n      It is unclear what the plasma VEGF concentration after treatment with Eylea into the eye in\n      patients with wet age-related macular degeneration is."

Pegaptanib (Macugen, Pfizer), ranibizumab (Lucentis, Novartis) aflibercept\n      (Eylea, Bayer) and bevacizumab  Avastin, Roche) . They have different molecules and\n      pharmacodynamics .\n\n      VEGF plays an important role in many physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms.\n      Studies have shown that even low-dose intravitreal treatment with bevacizumab leads to\n      significant reduction of VEGF plasma concentration up to a month after treatment in patients\n      with exudative AMD.\n\n      No significant systemic effect could be detected after intravitreal administration of\n      ranibizumab or pegaptanib.\n\n      The purpose of this study is :\n\n        -  To determine if intravitreal treatment with Eylea affects VEGF plasma levels in\n           patients with exudative AMD\n\n        -  How long after intravitreal injection is VEGF plasma concentration affected?"
