    <description>Patients randomized to Arm A(control group) will receive an iPhone application without any of the adherence intervention turned on.   The control phone application will allow patients to record their medications and how many refills they have remaining.   The application will also provide patients with links about their medication.
No adherence intervention will be done to these patients.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cases (Arm B)</arm_group_label>
    <description>Patients randomized to Arm B will receive an iPhone application with the adherence intervention turned on.  The study coordinator will help with the installation of the iPhone application.
Participants in this group will not need to pay for the iPhone application.</description>

        We will evaluate patients using aminosalicylates as their maintenance agent.
        Aminosalicylates contain 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) as the effective component, and can
        be given either orally or rectally to reduce colonic inflammation. They are effective in
        treating mild-to-moderate ulcerative colitis.  Patients will be randomized to an iPhone
        application with or without an adherence reminder.
