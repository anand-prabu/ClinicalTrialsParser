Assess the efficacy of bryostatin 1 administered as a 72-hour infusion in\n      patients with relapsed non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. II. Gain\n      information regarding the toxicity and tolerability of escalated vincristine doses given\n      after each bryostatin 1 infusion in cohorts of patients who fail to respond to bryostatin\n      alone. III. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1 in\n      these patients. IV. Determine the duration of response and survival following treatment with\n      bryostatin 1.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive bryostatin 1 by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks\n      until disease progression or until 2 courses beyond documentation of complete remission.\n      Response is assessed after every 4 courses. Patients with disease progression who continue\n      to meet the eligibility criteria receive vincristine within 2 hours after completion of each\n      bryostatin 1 infusion. Groups of 3-6 patients receive escalated doses of vincristine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose with bryostatin 1 is determined. Courses repeat every 2 weeks, as\n      above; no individual dose escalation is allowed. No concurrent steroids are permitted.\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 evaluable patients with low-grade NHL or CLL will be\n      entered over approximately 20 months if there are 2-4 responses in the first 15 patients. A\n      total of 20 evaluable patients with intermediate- or high-grade NHL will be entered over\n      approximately 2 years if there are 1 or 2 responses in the first 10 patients."
