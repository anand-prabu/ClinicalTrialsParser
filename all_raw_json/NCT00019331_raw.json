Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 and/or sargramostim may be a more\n      effective treatment for solid tumors.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus interleukin-2\n      and/or sargramostim in treating adults who have metastatic solid tumors."

Beginning 4 days\n           after vaccination, patients receive interleukin-2 (IL-2) SC 5 days a week for 2 weeks.\n\n        -  Group II (closed to accrual 6/4/01): Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC daily\n           beginning 1 day prior to the vaccination and continuing for 4 days. Patients receive\n           the vaccination as in group I immediately followed by GM-CSF on day 2. Patients are\n           vaccinated once every 4 weeks for 3 courses.\n\n        -  Group III: Patients receive the vaccination and IL-2 as in group I and GM-CSF as in\n           group II.\n\n      In all groups, patients receive up to 15 vaccinations in the absence of disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (20 per treatment group) will be accrued for\n      this study within 2-4 years."
