      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial, which tests the safety and effectiveness
      of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a specific cancer.
      Preoperative paclitaxel and trastuzumab are used as standard preoperative treatment for HER2
      positive inflammatory breast cancer. In this study, paclitaxel and trastuzumab are being
      combined with pertuzumab which is &quot;investigational&quot;. Trastuzumab is given for a total of 12
      months for the treatment of HER2 positive breast cancer. This study also adds pertuzumab to
      trastuzumab so that both drugs are given for a total of 12 months; this combination is also
      &quot;investigational&quot;.

      &quot;Investigational&quot; means that pertuzumab is being studied. It also means that the FDA has not
      yet approved pertuzumab for preoperative use to treat your type of breast cancer. It has
      been FDA approved for specific use in advanced breast cancer that is HER2 positive.

      Pertuzumab is an antibody, which is a protein that attacks a foreign substance is the body.
      Pertuzumab blocks the function of the HER2 protein like trastuzumab does. However,
      pertuzumab binds to a different part of the HER2 receptor and stops cancer cells from
      growing. This drug has been used in the treatment of advanced breast cancer that is HER2
      positive, and has been combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy in those studies.
      Information from those other research studies suggests that pertuzumab may help to kill the
      cancer cells in the breast and enable you to undergo a mastectomy. The addition of
      pertuzumab may also help reduce the chance of cancer recurrence.

      In this research study, we are combining pertuzumab with paclitaxel and trastuzumab as
      preoperative therapy and will determine the response of the cancer remaining in the breast
      at the time of mastectomy. In addition, we are combining trastuzumab with pertuzumab for a
      total of 12 months and we are looking to see whether the combination reduces the chance that
      the cancer will return.

      Another goal of this research study is to determine whether we can develop a way to identify
      tumors that will respond well to this study treatment. We will do research tests on your
      tumor tissue before, during and after study treatment. These tests may help doctors
      understand how the study treatment may work to treat your type of breast cancer. In the
      future, these tests may help us find ways to help match patients with the drugs most likely
      to work against their specific tumors before treatment begins.

      If you agree to take part in this study we will ask you to undergo some screening tests and
      procedures to confirm that you are eligible. Many of these tests and procedures are likely
      to be part of regular cancer care and may be done even if it turns out that you do not take
      part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or procedures recently, they
      may or may not have to be repeated. The screening process will include the following: a
      medical history, performance status, physical examination, scans and x-rays, blood samples,
      blood pregnancy test, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram. If these tests show that you are
      eligible to participate in the research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do
      not meet the eligibility criteria you will not be able to participate in this research
      study.

      Before beginning study treatment you will undergo a tumor biopsy and have photographs of
      your tumor taken to assess the response of your tumor to the study treatment.

      On the first day of study treatment (Week 1, Day 1) with trastuzumab and pertuzumab, you
      will receive an intravenous infusion of trastuzumab over about 90 minutes, followed by a 30
      minutes observation period. If the trastuzumab infusion is tolerated, you will receive the
      rest of your study treatment, the pertuzumab. This will also be given as an intravenous
      infusion over about 60 minutes with you being observed for a further 60 minutes. Thus, the
      total duration of infusion and observation periods for the first dose of study treatment
      (Week 1, Day 1) is about 5 hours. If the drugs are well tolerated at Week 1, the duration of
      the infusion with trastuzumab and pertuzumab may be shortened for subsequent doses.

      Prior to starting Week 2, you will undergo a second research biopsy of your breast. The
      biopsy will be performed either prior to Week 2, Day 8 or on the same day. You will then
      receive an infusion of trastuzumab and begin chemotherapy. If the infusion of trastuzumab
      was tolerated on Week 1, Day 1, then the infusion time is reduced to about 30 minutes. You
      will then be pre-medicated with drugs to reduce the chance of having a sensitivity reaction
      to paclitaxel. This takes approximately 30 minutes. The paclitaxel is give by intravenous
      infusion over about 60 minutes. If you tolerate the paclitaxel infusions, then the
      pre-medication can be changed by your doctor.

      The pertuzumab is given every 3 weeks beginning on Week 1, Day 1. It is given for a total of
      6 doses. Trastuzumab is given weekly for a total of 17 weeks beginning on Week 1, Day 1.
      Paclitaxel is given weekly for a total of 16 weeks beginning on Week 2, Day 8.

      Study treatment visits will occur at regular intervals during the period of study treatment,
      beginning on Week 1, Day 1. During these study treatment visits the following will be done:
      physical exam, performance status, blood samples, heart function tests.

      After completing 17 weeks of study treatment with trastuzumab, pertuzumab and paclitaxel,
      you will undergo surgery for removal of your breast cancer. This will occur approximately
      3-4 weeks after your last infusion. Prior to surgery, you will have the following
      assessments: a repeat breast MRI, PET scan (if necessary), physical exam, vital signs,
      performance status, blood tests, tumor tissue tests.

      Approximately 3-4 weeks after surgery, when you are well-healed, you will begin chemotherapy
      with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, known as AC. This is standard chemotherapy for IBC.
      Doxorubicin will be given intravenously over about 5-10 minutes. This is followed by an
      intravenous infusion of cyclophosphamide given over about 30 minutes. Anti-nausea medicine
      is given first under the direction of your doctor. AC is given every 3 weeks for 4 doses (4
      Cycles). Prior to each cycle, you will undergo the same procedure as that described above in
      the study treatment visits.

      Approximately 3-4 weeks after finishing the AC treatment, you will receive radiation therapy
      to the mastectomy site and the surrounding lymph nodes. This will be given daily, Monday
      through Friday for approximately 6-7 weeks. This will be administered as standard of care
      for IBC.

      Approximately 3-4 weeks following the completion of AC, you will begin maintenance therapy
      with trastuzumab and pertuzumab. As with Week 1, Day 1, you will receive an intravenous
      infusion of trastuzumab over about 90 minutes followed by a 30 minute observation period. If
      the trastuzumab infusion is tolerated, you will receive the rest of your study treatment,
      the pertuzumab. This will also be given as an intravenous infusion over about 60 minutes
      with your being observed for a further 60 minutes. Thus, the total duration of infusion and
      observation periods for the first day of maintenance study treatment is about 5 hours. If
      the study drugs are well tolerated, the duration of the infusion with trastuzumab and
      pertuzumab may be shortened for subsequent doses. Both trastuzumab and pertuzumab will be
      given every 3 weeks for a total of 12 doses. Every 9 weeks (every third dose of trastuzumab
      and pertuzumab) you will undergo the same procedure as taht described above in Study
      Treatment visits.

      About one month after your last dose of study treatment, you will be asked to return to the
      clinic. At this visit tests will be done to check your physical condition and to check that
      you have recovered from any side effects of study treatment. During this visit the following
      will be done: physical exam, vital signs, performance status and blood tests.

      You will be asked to attend regular follow up visits to check if you are experiencing any
      long term side effects and to check taht the cancer has not come back. We plan to follow
      participants for up to 13 years after the start of teh study. During these visits the
      following will be done: physical exam and questions about your health/medications you have
      taken (every 3 months for the first year, every 6 months for the next 4 years, yearly until
      the end of study follow up); blood draws (every 6 months for the first 4 years, yearly after
      that); mammograms will be performed annually, other scans may be performed as needed.
