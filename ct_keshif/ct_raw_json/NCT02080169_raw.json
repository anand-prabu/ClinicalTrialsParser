Until now, there is rare study about the combined sedation or sequenced\n      sedation of different sedation drug.The purpose of the study is to explore the value of\n      combined sedation with midazolam and dexmedetomidine compared to single drug sedation in\n      ICU, so as to seek an ideal sedation protocol that could reduce the cost of treatment,obtain\n      the appropriate  sedation not under sedation or over sedation,reduce the incidence of\n      delirium, reduce the adverse event of sedation."
