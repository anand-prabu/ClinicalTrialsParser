  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preliminary results demonstrated no significant changes in cortical excitability or
      handwriting performance following 5 days of rTMS in focal hand dystonia. However, the
      majority of subjects reported symptom improvement. Previous research using a similar
      protocol has shown significant changes in cortical excitability and handwriting performance
      lasting at least 10-days following treatment. Data collection and analysis is currently in
      progress. Additionally, Impaired inhibition as measured by CSP may be present in people with
      oromandibular dystonia, which is a similar finding to other focal dystonias. Inhibitory rTMS
      may be effective in reducing excitability that may improve clinical symptoms of this
      disorder.

      This study investigated the short- and long-term effects of repeated administrations of
      repetitive-transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) on cortical excitability and handwriting
      performance. Six subjects with focal hand dystonia (FHD) and nine healthy controls were
      studied. All subjects with FHD received rTMS (1Hz) to the premotor cortex (PMC) for five
      consecutive days; of those, three subjects received five days of sham rTMS completed ten
      days prior to real treatment. Healthy subjects received one real rTMS session. Cortical
      silent period (CSP) and measures of handwriting performance were compared before and after
      treatment and at ten-day post-treatment follow-up. At baseline, significant differences in
      CSP and pen pressure were observed between subjects with FHD and healthy controls.
      Differences in CSP and pen velocity between subjects in real and sham rTMS groups were
      observed across treatment sessions and maintained at follow-up. After five days of rTMS to
      PMC, reduced cortical excitability and improved handwriting performance were observed and
      maintained at least ten days following treatment in subjects with FHD. These preliminary
      results support further investigation of the therapeutic potential of rTMS in FHD. We have
      modified the current treatment parameters to increase the treatment time to build upon these
      initial findings
