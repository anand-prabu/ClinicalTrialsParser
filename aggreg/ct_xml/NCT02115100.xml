    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized, controlled, multicenter, international clinical trial. The study
      population consist of patients with paroxysmal or persistent atrial fibrillation with out
      range hypertension or signs of sympathetic overdrive. Patient will be randomized into one of
      the following three groups.

      group 1 : patients will undergo renal artery denervation/ group 2 : Patients will undergo
      pulmonary vein isolation/ group 3: Patients will undergo pulmonary vein isolation and renal
      artery denervation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The target group of patients are subjects ages &lt;65 years, with paroxysmal or persistent
      atrial fibrillation, who have out of range hypertension (systolic &gt;140 or &gt;130/80 mmHg in
      diabetics and patients with chronic renal disease) or signs of sympathetic overdrive.
      Patients should use at least 2 anti-hypertensive's or should be intolerant for
      antihypertensive medication. Atrial fibrillation terminology: If atrial fibrillation recurs
      more than once but terminates spontaneously within seven days, the term paroxysmal AF is
      used. This is also used when the episode is less than 48 hours in duration and is terminated
      with electrical or pharmacological cardioversion. Persistent AF is defined as recurrent AF
      that is sustained for more than seven days. A patient that is electrically or
      pharmacologically cardioverted after more than two days is also diagnosed with persistent
      AF. After the exclusion of apparent secondary causes of hypertension, patients will be
      randomized to one of the following interventional treatments: First arm: RDN (84 patients)
      Second arm: PVI (84 patients) Third arm: RDN+PVI (84 patients) The patient will be treated
      under conscious sedation or general anesthesia. The control group will consist of patients
      who undergo PVI alone. The study will be a randomized, controlled trial. The follow up
      period will be up to one year after the interventional therapy. Patients will be treated
      clinically and will have regular follow-up at the outpatient clinic of the hospital at which
      they were treated. If patients receive continuous loop recorders for cardiac rhythm
      monitoring, this data will be used for the study. The other patients will undergo Holter ECG
      monitoring at regular intervals during follow-up (at 3, 6 and 12 months after the
      interventional treatment). During follow-up, the first 3 months after the interventional
      treatment will be a blanking period, as is common in the ablative therapy of AF (ablations
      points need to heal, and paroxysms of AF in this period are not associated with therapy
      failure).
