    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot trial studies broccoli sprout extract in treating patients with
      estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer. Broccoli sprout extract contains ingredients that
      may prevent or slow the growth of certain cancers.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether isothiocyanate-rich broccoli sprout extract (ITC-BSE) modifies
      biomarkers in breast tumor cells.

      II. To determine whether the intervention alters proliferative and apoptotic markers (Ki-67
      and cleaved caspase-3).

      III. To determine whether the intervention down-regulates the expression of estrogen
      receptor (ER).

      IV. To determine whether the intervention induces NAD(P)H dehydrogenase (quinone) 1 (NQO1)
      expression.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine tolerability of ITC-BSE and compliance in breast cancer patients.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive broccoli sprout extract orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-14.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO QD on days 1-14.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

    <description>Appropriate transformation (such log transformation) will be used to achieve normality of the data. Results will be given as the back-transformed geometric means and 95% confidence intervals in order to preserve the units of measurement. Change in immunohistochemistry measures will be calculated for each individual and compared between treatment and placebo groups by use of independent samples t-test. If the normality could not be reached by transformation, Wilcoxon rank-sum test will be used, which considers both the direction and the magnitude of changes.</description>

             malignancy, clinical stage I or II, ER positive breast cancer

          -  Current ingestion of broccoli sprout extract, which may confound study results

          -  Current or recent treatment for any malignancy within the last one year, which may
             affect biomarkers
