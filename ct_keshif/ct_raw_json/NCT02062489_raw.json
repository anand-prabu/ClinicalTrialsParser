The trial is designed to evaluate the effectiveness\n      of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for ER(ER-\u03b1)/PR negative, ER-\u03b2 positive operable breast\n      cancer patients. 620 female ER(ER-\u03b1)/PR negative, ER-\u03b2(wild type ER-\u03b21) positive operable\n      breast cancer patients who had undergone neoadjuvant chemotherapy or directly modified\n      radical mastectomy or breast-conserving surgery were randomly (1:1) enrolled to receive\n      tamoxifen (20 mg per day) or placebo (2# per day) within 6 weeks after postoperative\n      chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy if needed (according to 2013 NCCN breast cancer\n      guideline). If the breast tumor's HER2 is positive, the patient can receive targeted therapy\n      (Herceptin) combined with tamoxifen or placebo. The follow-up time will be ten years. The\n      aim of this trial is to evaluate the effectiveness of tamoxifen as adjuvant therapy for\n      ER(ER-\u03b1)/PR negative, ER-\u03b2 positive operable breast cancer patients by comparing the DFS and\n      OS between tamoxifen group and placebo group and to determine whether the percentage of\n      positive ER-\u03b2 expression is associated with the response to the hormone therapy in breast\n      cancer."
