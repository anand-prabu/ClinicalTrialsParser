      The Smoking Treatment and Anxiety Management Program (STAMP) is a treatment program focused
      on helping people manage their anxiety while quitting smoking. The study involves coming in
      to our clinic for 4 treatment sessions, with follow-ups for up to 2 years (a week 1, week 2,
      month 1, month 3, month 6, year 1, and year 2 follow-up).  Participants will be paid $142.50
      for their full participation as well as receive 6 weeks of free nicotine replacement
      patches.

    <description>The ASI is a 16-item self-report measure that assesses the fear of consequences of bodily sensations associated with anxiety. Items are rated on a five-point Likert-type scale ranging from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much) and a total score is computed by summing all items. The ASI is hierarchical in structure with one higher order factor (AS) and three subfactors (physical, cognitive, and social concerns). The physical concerns subscale includes items related to the fear of consequences or presence of specific physical sensations (e.g. &quot;When I notice that my heart is beating rapidly, I worry that I might have a heart attack&quot;). The cognitive concerns subscale includes items related to potential mental health implications of sensations (e.g. &quot;When I cannot keep my mind on a task, I worry that I might be going crazy&quot;). The social concerns subscale includes items related to the potential social consequences of physical sensations (e.g. &quot;It is important to me not to appear nervous&quot;).</description>
