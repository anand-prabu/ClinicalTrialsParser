The LPP is designed as a \"neural exercise\"\n      to reduce auditory hypersensitivities, to improve auditory processing of speech, and to\n      improve behavioral state regulation.  The LPP uses acoustic stimulation to exercise the\n      neural regulation of the middle ear structures to rehabilitate and to normalize the acoustic\n      transfer function of the middle ear structures. The current study is being conducted to\n      evaluate efficacy and feasibility of the LPP and will use objective measures to evaluate\n      changes in acoustic transfer function of the middle ears structures, auditory processing\n      skills, physiological state regulation, and sensory symptoms."

Modulation of the acoustic energy within the frequencies of human voice, similar to an exaggerated vocal prosody, are hypothesized to recruit and modulate the neural regulation of the middle ear muscles and to functionally reduce sound hypersensitivities and improve auditory processing.",
