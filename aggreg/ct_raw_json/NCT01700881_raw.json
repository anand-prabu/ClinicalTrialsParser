The study duration is 36 weeks.\n\n      This study tests that a low fat, plant-based (vegan) diet free of foods commonly identified\n      as triggers improves mood, using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression\n      Scale-Revised (CESD-R), and the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)."
