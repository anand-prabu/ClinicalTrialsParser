Patients are stratified\n      according to gender and by position of the lesion (periorbital vs nonperiorbital).\n\n      All patients receive oral prednisone daily for 3 weeks.  Patients are then randomized to\n      receive either placebo or leuprolide IM every 3 weeks, while continuing oral prednisone.\n      Tumors are assessed at 1, 3, and 6 weeks.  If the tumor is not responding, the leuprolide\n      will be administered every 2 weeks. Tumors are reassessed at 3 and 6 months, at which point\n      the treatment is stopped.  Responding patients are observed every 3 weeks for 3 months.  If\n      the tumor begins to grow again, leuprolide may be administered for another 3 months.\n      Patients whose tumors grow rapidly during treatment may crossover to the alternate therapy,\n      repeat the leuprolide or prednisone therapy, or undergo surgical excision."
