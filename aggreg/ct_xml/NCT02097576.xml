  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether high-volume nasal rinses with a manuka
      honey/saline mixture will improve symptom scores, nasal endoscopic findings and CT scan
      findings compared to nasal saline rinse without manuka honey in patients with chronic
      rhinosinusitis.

      Manuka honey is a honey made from bees that drink the nectar from tea (manuka) trees in New
      Zealand. It has been shown to have antibacterial activity against common bacteria that cause
      chronic sinusitis.

      If the subject chooses to participate in the study, the subject will be asked to fill out a
      symptom questionnaire at the beginning of the study and at each follow-up visit. The subject
      will be randomly assigned (much like the flip of a coin)  to one of two treatment arms in
      addition to the prescribed medical treatments: 1) nasal rinses twice daily with a saline
      solution (standard therapy) or 2) nasal rinses with a saline solution mixed with manuka
      honey (the experimental therapy.) Subjects in the manuka honey/saline rinse arm will perform
      the experimental rinses twice daily for one month, and then will continue with saline rinses
      twice daily, with manuka honey added to the rinses only as needed. Nasal rinsing of some
      kind will be continued through the entire study period.
