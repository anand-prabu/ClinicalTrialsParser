    <textblock>
      Cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) or biventricular pacing is a useful treatment for
      heart failure and those suffering from arrhythmias. The purpose of this research study is to
      determine the effect left-ventricular pacing has on patients who have a ventricular assist
      device.

      As part of the study participation the following two visits will be completed as listed
      below.

      Baseline Visit:  The following procedures will be conducted at this visit:

        -  Review of past medical history and medical records;

        -  A limited echocardiogram will be performed.  This is a test that uses ultrasound to
           evaluate the size of the heart and how well the heart is pumping blood.

        -  The investigators will use a computer-like device, called a programmer, that &quot;talks&quot; to
           the CRT device using radio signals or by using wanded telemetry to adjust the CRT
           device's programmed settings.   The left ventricular lead of your device will be turned
           off.  The defibrillator will continue to function and back-up pacing will continue if
           needed.

        -  Complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).

        -  A 6 minute walk test will be done.

      Regularly Scheduled Clinic Visit:  At the next regularly scheduled Left Ventricular Assist
      Devices (LVAD) clinic visit, approximately 4 weeks after the baseline visit, the following
      procedures will be done:

        -  A second limited echocardiogram.

        -  The investigator will use a computer-like device, called a programmer, that &quot;talks&quot; to
           the CRT device using radio signals or by using a wand to obtain a report that will give
           the current program settings and any heart rhythm events that have occurred since the
           last CRT device was checked.  Once the information from the CRT is obtained, the study
           doctor will reprogram the device to its original settings.

        -  Complete the Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ).

        -  A 6 minute walk test will be done.
