    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Monitoring and recording all adverse events, including serious adverse events. Annual incidence rate of ocular and systemic drug-related adverse events will be calculated as number of events/eye year. Data will be presented together with 95% CI, separately for Seriousness (SAE and non-SAE).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Treatment patterns for ranibizumab in the study population is described by the overall number of injections (mean, standard deviation, median, 25th and 75th percentiles, minimum and maximum), number of visits, time-interval between injections in bilateral disease, number and reasons for retreatment, number and reasons for treatment terminations.</description>

    <measure>Number and type of systemic and ocular AEs, stratifyed by type of patient</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Annual incidence rates of drug-related AEs, overall AEs and ocular AEs will be calculated comparing events occurring in patients with bilateral treatment when they are receiving bilateral injections and events occurring in patients unilaterally treated or bilaterally treated but considering a period in which only an eye is treated (IR ratio with asymptotic 95% CI). For bilaterally patients, only ocular AEs experienced in eyes enrolled in the study will be considered. A stratified analysis of systemic and ocular AEs will be performed also considering the study population, demographics and baseline characteristics, including disease characteristics and ocular conditions (IR ration 95% CI).</description>

    <measure>Number and type of AEs by study drug exposure</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to month 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>In order to evaluate the possible relationship with drug exposure, the annual incidence rate of systemic AEs will be evaluated stratifying patients by number of injections. The analysis will be performed for drug-related events and overall. A further analysis that considers the effect of the number of injections, time of injections and study population on the systemic annual incidence rate will be performed by means of a model based on counting process. This approach allows measuring the incidence rate of events, taking into consideration the number and timelines of injections. The analysis will be performed for drug-related events and overall.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline to month 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>To evaluate a potential carry-over effect of previous treatments, a comparison between the incidence rate of ocular and systemic AEs during all observation time and the incidence rate of AEs excluding the AEs occurred in the first 3 months after first dose of ranibizumab will be performed. The incidence rate ratio with asymptotic 95% CI will be computed in order to compare the results. The analysis will be performed for drug-related events and overall.</description>

    <description>All patients will receive ranibizumab 0.5 mg/0.05 ml according to approved label: treatment is given monthly until maximum VA is achieved (i.e. stable VA for three consecutive monthly assessments performed while on ranibizumab treatment). Thereafter according to approved label, patients should be monitored monthly for visual acuity and treatment is to be resumed when monitoring indicates loss of visual acuity due to disease activity. Monthly injections should then be administered until stable visual acuity is reached again for three consecutive monthly assessments (implying a minimum of two injections).</description>
