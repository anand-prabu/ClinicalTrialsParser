            "textblock": "The investigators intend to demonstrate whether there are statistically significant\n      differences in the rates of repeat abortions between three groups: 1. women choosing to have\n      an intrauterine device (IUD) inserted immediately post-abortion, 2. those choosing to begin\n      oral contraceptives immediately post-abortion, and 3. all other choices for post abortion\n      contraception including those stating an intention to obtain contraceptives at a later time\n      or from an alternate location or to use no contraception. This data will then be used to\n      conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of health system provision for cost-free IUDs\n      post-abortion. Thus, if providing a free IUD immediately post-abortion significantly reduces\n      the rate of repeat abortions, it may be more cost- effective for health system services to\n      provide free IUDs at abortion clinics than to field the costs associated with a higher rate\n      of repeat abortions.\n\n      The researchers will conduct a retrospective observational cohort study by chart review. The\n      researchers propose to review the charts of women undergoing abortions between January 1,\n      2005 and December 31, 2006 at Kelowna General Hospital's Women's Services Clinic. The\n      researchers will record the following data from each chart: age, parity, gestational age,\n      date of index therapeutic abortion (TA), dates of subsequent TAs, contraception used at the\n      time of the index conception, contraceptive method chosen post-abortion, and outcome of\n      follow-up at two weeks, such as expulsion of IUD. The researchers will also record the\n      recurrent pregnancy rates."
