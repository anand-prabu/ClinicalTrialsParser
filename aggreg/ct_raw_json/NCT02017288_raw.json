            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Cancer of the mouth and throat is one of the most common cancers in Taiwan. This cancer\n      develops over several years, beginning as white or red patches in the mouth or throat that\n      become growths. It can also cause a condition that leads to rigidity of the cheeks. The\n      growths can be identified when a doctor looks into a person   s mouth. It is currently not\n      clear why some people with abnormal growths progress to cancer while others do not.\n      Researchers want to better understand why some patients with early abnormal growths get late\n      abnormal growths. They also want to understand why some people get abnormal growths again,\n      even after they receive treatment.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To understand why some people with precancerous lesions in their mouth develop cancer\n      while others do not.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 21 years and older, some with abnormal growths in the mouth, some without any, and\n      some with head and neck cancer.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will visit a hospital in Taiwan 2 times.\n\n        -  At the first visit, participants will answer questions about their health, lifestyle,\n           and family medical history. A doctor will examine the participant   s mouth and take a\n           small piece of any growth they see. They will do this with a brush. They will also\n           photograph the participant   s mouth. Participants will also give blood and saliva\n           samples, plus a small sample of a mouth rinse.\n\n        -  Participants who are diagnosed with a late abnormal growth that is not cancer will\n           return for a second visit. They will answer the same questions and undergo the same\n           procedures as at the first study."

            "textblock": "Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs), which include cancers of the oral cavity,\n      oropharynx, and larynx, are the sixth most common cancer worldwide with an estimated annual\n      burden of 355,000 deaths and 633,000 incident cases. HNSCCs are ideal candidates for\n      screening, early detection, and secondary prevention given the amenability for visual\n      inspection and specimen collection, the availability of recognized premalignant lesions\n      (clinically-defined as leukoplakia, erythroplakia, and submucous fibrosis and\n      histologically-defined based on the grade of dysplasia), and evidence that screening and\n      early detection can lead to significant reductions in mortality. Nonetheless, there are\n      currently no guidelines for screening, treatment, or follow-up of patients with HNSCC\n      precursors, in part, owing to the current gaps in knowledge regarding the early and\n      long-term natural history of clinical/histologic precursor lesions, the lack of validated\n      predictive biomarkers, and thus the inability to accurately identify those lesions that are\n      most likely to progress to cancer.\n\n      To address these gaps in knowledge, we plan to conduct a prospective cohort study to\n      investigate the early natural history of HNSCC precursors, including: 1) the rates and time\n      course of progression or regression of precursor lesions, 2) ability of epidemiologic\n      variables and tissue-based biomarkers in predicting progression/regression, and 3)\n      feasibility of identifying promising biomarkers in less invasively collected specimens.\n\n      The current concept pertains to a pilot study in Taiwan to evaluate the feasibility of\n      conducting a prospective cohort study. The goals of the pilot study are: 1) to pilot the\n      study procedures, including recruitment and follow-up of participants, collection of\n      questionnaire data, and collection, storage, and testing of biologic specimens and 2) to\n      collect preliminary data, such as prevalence of risk factors and histologic precursors, to\n      aid in the design of a cohort study. Furthermore, the pilot study will be adequately large\n      to conduct case-control comparisons of risk factors and molecular markers across the control\n        precursor   cancer continuum."
