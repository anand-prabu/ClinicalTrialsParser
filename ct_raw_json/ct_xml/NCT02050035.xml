      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of 12 weeks of aerobic exercise
      training on blood vessel function in Stages 1-4 Chronic Kidney Disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The endothelium lines the inside of the blood vessels. A healthy endothelial lining acts as
      a defense mechanism against vascular injury, mediating vascular tone, vascular structure,
      and blood-vessel wall relations. Endothelial dysfunction marks the occurrence of
      cardiovascular injuries and is a critical step in the development of cardiovascular disease.
      Individuals with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) have an increased risk of cardiovascular
      disease and this may be related to poor blood vessel function. Interventions to improve
      blood vessel function in CKD are needed.  Exercise training has been shown to improve blood
      vessel function in older subjects and those with heart disease but this has not been
      investigated in CKD.  The National Kidney Foundation recommends exercise for dialysis
      patients to reduce cardiovascular risk however there is very little data regarding the
      benefits of exercise in earlier stages of CKD.  The purpose of this study is to determine
      the effect of 12 weeks of exercise training on blood vessel function in moderate to severe
      CKD.
