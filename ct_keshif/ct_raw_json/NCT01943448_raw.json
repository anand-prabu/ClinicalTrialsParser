            "textblock": "Visual impairment in high myopic eyes is mainly due to the different types of myopic\n      maculopathies, such as diffuse or patchy atrophy, lacquer cracks and choroidal\n      neovascularization. Macular hemorrhage was one of those complications. Despite choroidal\n      neovascularization, simple hemorrhage from rupture of Bruch's membrane and choroidal\n      microcirculation is also the cause of hemorrhage. The prognosis of those eyes with simple\n      hemorrhage is generally good. However, some patients had persistently poor vision after the\n      absorption of the hemorrhage. In the literature, the visual prognosis in those patients was\n      reported to be associated with the microstructure change under the optical coherent\n      tomography (OCT) or the presentation of the autofluorescence. The investigators will collect\n      the patients with high myopia and presenting with macular hemorrhage. High resolution OCT\n      and autofluorescence imaging will be used to analyze the change of the microstructure of\n      retina and its correlation with the visual prognosis."
