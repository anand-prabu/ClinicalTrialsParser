  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this investigation is to generate the needed PMCF data for the HiFocus Mid-Scala
      electrode. As a point of interest the investigators would like to evaluate the benefit to
      patients with low-frequency residual hearing implanted with the HiFocus Mid-Scala Electrode.
      The HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array is designed to allow surgeons the flexibility to use a
      variety of contemporary surgical techniques that have been shown to enable easy insertion
      and to minimize cochlear trauma (see, e.g., Adunka and Buchman, 2007; Friedland and
      Runge-Samuelson, 2009; Roland et al., 2007). Temporal bone experiments have shown the
      HiFocus Mid-Scala electrode array to be straightforward to insert while causing minimal
      trauma to cochlear structures during and after surgery (Lenarz et al., 2010). In addition ,
      the HiFocus Mid-Scala has already shown to be a safe electrode and promising post op
      clinical results in the premarketing study that is now in the final stage.
