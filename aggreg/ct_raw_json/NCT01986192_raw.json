However, the EINSTEIN program excluded patients with deep vein thrombosis\n      if they had been treated with a vena cava filter or a fibrinolytic agent for the current\n      episode of thrombosis Although catheter-directed thrombolysis (CDT) or pharmacomechanical\n      thrombolysis has now been accepted as a treatment of choice in iliofemoral DVT, thrombolysis\n      has an inherent risk of bleeding. Therefore, patients who have completed CDT and have been\n      stabilized at least 24 hours after thrombolysis will be included in this study.\n\n      Also, the investigators want to explore the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in patients\n      with iliofemoral DVT after catheter-directed thrombolysis and/or a vena cava filter\n      insertion and/or venous stent insertion and compare these outcomes with warfarin treatment\n      alone.\n\n      This study will be a pilot study to establish the safety and efficacy parameters for further\n      studies."
