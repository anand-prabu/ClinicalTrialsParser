  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this two-year pilot study is to adapt a 12-week attachment-based parenting
      intervention (Parenting from the Inside Out or PIO) originally developed for substance
      abusing mothers (as part of an ongoing NIDA-funded treatment development study; R01 DA17294)
      for implementation with female adult caregivers who have or are at risk for long-term
      interpersonal conflict with family members, children, or significant others and are caring
      for a child between the ages of birth and 7 years.  The PIO intervention involves 12-24
      weekly 1 hour individual therapy sessions with Masters level therapists who are trained and
      supervised by Dr. Suchman (the Principal Investigator) in the PIO approach.
