After the first session of TRP, subjects will have a repeat wide field angiogram at M4/V8 and possibly a second TRP session if peripheral non-perfusion or poor-perfusion persist. The 200\u00b0wide field angiography will indicate areas of peripheral ischemia which will be selectively treated, preserving areas of more perfused retina."
