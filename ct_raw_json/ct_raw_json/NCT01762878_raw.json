GSK2269557 has already been administered as a nebulized\n      solution in single and repeat doses to humans and has been well tolerated across the range\n      of doses used. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and\n      pharmacokinetics of single and repeat inhaled doses of GSK2269557 as a dry powder. This\n      study is the first administration of dry powder GSK2269557 in humans.\n\n      Part A will consist of four treatment periods separated by at least 14 days wash out\n      periods. In each treatment period there will be 12 subjects receiving GSK2269557 and 4\n      subjects receiving placebo. The doses of GSK2269557 planned for Part A are 100 micrograms\n      (mcg), 500 mcg and 3000 mcg. Blinded safety and available pharmacokinetic (PK) data will be\n      reviewed before each dose escalation. Part B will be a parallel group design conducted in a\n      separate group of subjects from Part A. Nine subjects will receive repeat doses of\n      GSK2269557 and 3 subjects will receive repeat doses of placebo for 14 days. The total daily\n      dose will be the same as the dose that was well tolerated in Part A. The study duration,\n      including screening and follow-up, is not expected to exceed 82 days for subjects in part A\n      and 55 days for subjects in part B of the study."
