Acquire data for SoftVue evaluation from a cohort of 100 women receiving standard\n      ultrasound (US) evaluation as follow-up to mammographic or palpable abnormalities and\n      construct reflection, sound speed and attenuation images with SoftVue.\n\n      III. Evaluate the ability of SoftVue to detect dominant breast findings (i.e. major normal\n      landmark architecture) or masses previously identified with standard diagnostic evaluation\n      (palpation, mammography, standard US) using standard clock position and radial distance\n      measurements from the nipple.\n\n      IV. Conduct tomographic (i.e. slice-by-slice) comparison of SoftVue with magnetic resonance\n      imaging (MRI) findings from a subgroup of 50 patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo ultrasound tomography using SoftVue. Some patients also undergo MRI of the\n      breast."
