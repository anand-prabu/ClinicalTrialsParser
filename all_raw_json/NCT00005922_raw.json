Classical conditioning is a process of\n      behavioral modification in which a person learns to connect a certain response-in this case,\n      improvement of psoriasis-with a new action, or stimulus-in this case, application of an\n      inactive cream. The goal of this study is to show that people with psoriasis who are\n      maintained on corticosteroid cream part of the time and an inactive (placebo) cream at other\n      times show a lower incidence of relapse and a reduced severity of psoriasis that patients\n      treated with that same (reduced) amount of medication administered all the time."

This research addresses the clinical significance of\n      behavior-immune system interactions.\n\n      This study will capitalize on conditioned immunosuppressive responses to reduce the\n      cumulative amount of corticosteroid medication used in the treatment of psoriasis. We will\n      continue to treat patients with steroid, but will shift experimental patients from their\n      current schedule of continuous reinforcement (active drug whenever medication is applied) to\n      a partial schedule of reinforcement (active drug a percentage of the time and placebo alone\n      at other times). To equate amount of medication, we will treat another group of patients\n      with a reduced dose of steroid in a standard treatment regimen (continuous schedule of\n      reinforcement).\n\n      We hypothesize that, holding cumulative dose constant, a partial schedule of reinforcement\n      will enable patients to be maintained on lower cumulative amounts of corticosteroid than\n      patients treated under a continuous schedule of active drug. This is the first attempt to\n      adopt conditioning principles and use schedules of reinforcement to design regimens of drug\n      therapy. If proven effective, this new approach to pharmacotherapy and placebo effects is\n      likely to stimulate new interdisciplinary research in neuropharmacology and behavioral\n      pharmacology for the treatment of autoimmune disorders and a variety of other chronic\n      diseases."
