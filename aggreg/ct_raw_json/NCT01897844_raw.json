            "textblock": "This was a two part Phase I repeated incremental doses study in male healthy volunteers. The\n      study was conducted in two parts. A total of 36 subjects was planned to be enrolled in Part\n      A and 36 subjects in Part B. Part A was performed according to a double blind, randomized,\n      placebo controlled design and included three sequential dose groups of repeat doses. Each\n      group enrolled 12 subjects on ITF2984 or placebo (ratio 9 active: 3 placebo) and received\n      ITF2984 s.c. or placebo twice daily for 14 days. For all three groups the last dose was\n      planned to be the first dose on Day 14.\n\n      The study started with the Group 1 2000mcg s.c. b.i.d., Group 2 received 3000mcg b.i.d.\n      after an interim review of the safety and PK data of the 2000mcg dose level. Group 3\n      received 100mcg s.c. to gather data to complete the PK/PD profile of ITF2984. Subjects were\n      screened up to 28 days before dosing with ITF2984/placebo that took place on Days 1-14.\n\n      For all Groups, on day -1 and day 13 subjects received the exogenous tests administration\n      (GHRH, Arginin and TRH) 30 minutes after the first morning administration of\n      ITF2984/placebo.\n\n      Part B was open label, and planned for six sequential dose groups of 6 subjects each. In\n      each group subjects received ITF2984 continuous subcutaneous infusion for 7 consecutive\n      days. The dose was escalated, from the starting dose of 900 mcg, by a maximum of three fold\n      or more cautiously, if deemed necessary. The decision to test higher dose levels was based\n      on review of safety and PK data from the previous dose level(s). After a 28 day screening\n      period, subjects were admitted to the clinical unit on the evening of day -2. ITF2984\n      continuous infusion planned from day 1 to day 8 in the morning. On day -1 (the day prior to\n      the start of infusion) subjects received the exogenous/challenge test administrations\n      (GH-RH+Arginina and TRH). On day 7 the challenge tests were repeated."
