This toxin causes the symptoms of food\n      poisoning.  Small amounts of botulinum toxin A have been used to treat speech disorders such\n      as stuttering and problems with the muscles of the eyes.\n\n      The study examines the effectiveness of botulinum toxin as treatment for a variety of\n      movement disorders.  The goals of the study are to refine the technique of treatment to\n      provide the best results, to improve the understanding of how botulinum toxin works on\n      movement disorders, and find other conditions that may be treatable with botulinum toxin.\n\n      In addition, researchers also plan to study the possible use of botulinum toxin F alone and\n      in combination with botulinum toxin A in patients who do not respond to botulinum A toxin\n      treatment.< TAB>"

The application of botulinum toxin\n      therapy to movement disorders requires treatment tailored to the individual patient and\n      specific techniques of injection.  This protocol 1) provides for training of physicians in\n      the use of botulinum toxin and 2) allows us to provide botulinum toxin injections for\n      patients participating in other studies on the physiology of sensorimotor systems and\n      physiological effects of botulinum toxin.  Patients can be in the study at any one time\n      either for the teaching value or for participation in other protocols, or both."
