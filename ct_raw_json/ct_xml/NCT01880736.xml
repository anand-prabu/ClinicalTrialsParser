    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Asia. The aim of the trial is to investigate the efficacy and
      safety of flexible versus fixed dosing and simple versus stepwise titration with once daily
      insulin degludec in inadequately treated subjects with type 2 diabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Current treatment with IGlar (insulin glargine) with or without OADs (oral
             antidiabetic drug). All antidiabetic treatments should have been on-going for at
             least 12 weeks prior to randomisation, and doses of OADs should have been stable in
             this period of time. - Please note that a maximum of 3 OADs are allowed during this
             trial: metformin, sulphonylurea (SU)/glinides, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-IV)
             inhibitors, alfa-glucosidaseinhibitors or pioglitazone.

          -  Diagnosis of T2DM (type 2 diabetes mellitus) at the discretion of the investigator
             for at least 26 weeks prior to visit 1 (Screening visit)

          -  HbA1c 7.0-9.5% (both inclusive) by central laboratory analysis

          -  Body mass index (BMI) equal to or below 35 kg/m^2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any chronic disorder or severe disease which, in the opinion of the Investigator
             might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol

          -  Stroke; decompensated heart failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or
             IV; myocardial infarction; unstable angina pectoris; or coronary arterial bypass
             graft or angioplasty; all within the last 26 weeks prior to Visit 1 (Screening visit)

          -  Impaired renal function, defined as serum-creatinine higher than or equal to 1.4
             mg/dL for males and higher than or equal to 1.3 mg/dL for females

          -  Current or past (within the last 5 years) malignant neoplasms (except basal cell and
             squamous cell skin carcinoma)

          -  Treatment with glucose-lowering agent(s) other than stated in the inclusion criteria
             in a period of 12 weeks prior to randomisation
