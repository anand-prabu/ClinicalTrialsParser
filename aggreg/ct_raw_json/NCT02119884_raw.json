Terlipressin and octreotide can\n      effectively control bleeding with few side effects, which has been  recommended by Baveno V\n      in treatment of acute variceal bleeding.  Terlipressin and high dose octreotide will be\n      administered to the patients with cirrhosis related esophageal varices when they undergo\n      hepatic venous pressure gradient measurement.  Changes from portal and systemic hemodynamics\n      will be observed to evaluate the safety and effects of terlipressin and high dose octreotide\n       as well as to determine wether patients respond to them. The results can be served as\n      clinical evidence for  preventing  re-bleeding  through long-acting  terlipressin and\n      octreotide in the future."
