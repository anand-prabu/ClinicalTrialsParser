Although delirium is thought to be common in the Intensive Care\n      Unit (ICU) there are few studies that have evaluated its incidences, risks and outcomes. It\n      has been associated with increased morbidity, and mortality and increased cost to the\n      healthcare system. In addition to the uncertainty of the incidence of ICU delirium, there is\n      a lack of information about the effects that certain pharmacological treatments have on\n      delirious patients.\n\n      The rationale for this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of risperidone alone,\n      trazodone alone, and risperidone plus trazodone for the treatment of delirium in critically\n      ill patients when compared to placebo."
