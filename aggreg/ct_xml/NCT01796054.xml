  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindful meditation sessions have been associated with an improvement in mindfulness,
      perceived stress, psychological well-being, anxiety, hostility, and depression. Meditation
      has been associated with a decrease in autonomic sympathetic activity, heart rate, oxygen
      consumption and energy expenditure.  Randomized controlled trials of online mindfulness and
      relaxation programs have been studied in patients with conditions such as irritable bowel
      syndrome, headache, depression, fibromyalgia, and insomnia. Nurses may benefit from such
      programs given levels of job stress.  This study will determine whether an online stress
      reduction program that incorporates meditation with and without concomitant group support
      reduces burnout among nurses, including emotional exhaustion and depersonalization. The
      proposed research study will utilize Stress Free Now, an online stress reduction program
      developed by Cleveland Clinic Wellness Institute.

      This is a randomized, controlled, single-center research study of an online intervention
      with peer group support to reduce stress in nurses. All participants will be assigned to the
      intervention or control groups by random number allocation.  The duration of the
      intervention is 6 weeks; follow-up is at 6 and 24 weeks; the duration of the study is 6
      months (24 weeks). Total individual participant time commitment will depend on particular
      intervention or control group assignment. Both intervention and control groups will be
      requested to complete a set of questionnaires at weeks 0, 6, and 24.  The questionnaires
      will take an estimated 45 minutes to complete.
