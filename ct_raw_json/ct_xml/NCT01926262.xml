  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to investigate, whether physical training, targeted neck and
      shoulder muscles, can reduce and prevent neck pain among military helicopter pilots and
      crewmembers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Military helicopter pilots and crewmembers is often burdened by work-related neck and
      shoulder pain. Neck pain is a health challenge, that can reduce functional level,
      concentration and operational safety. Physical exercise has shown good efficacy in reducing
      neck/shoulder pain in other occupational groups in previous studies.

      The Royal Danish Air Force and the University of Southern Denmark, wishes to examine whether
      specific physical exercise can prevent and reduce neck/shoulder pain within this
      occupational group.

      Participants in this project will be randomly selected to either a physical exercise group
      or a reference group.

        -  The physical exercise group will follow a training program targeted neck and shoulder
           muscles and train 1 hour per week (3 x 20 min) for 26 weeks.

        -  The reference group will continue normal routines, including workout routines. They
           will later be offered the same training program as the Physical Exercise group provided
           that training has a positive effect.
