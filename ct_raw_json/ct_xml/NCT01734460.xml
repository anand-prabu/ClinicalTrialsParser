  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) is a common condition affecting up to 9% of adults with
      serious neurocognitive, metabolic and cardiovascular consequences that has a significant
      impact on public health. Evidence indicates that the physiologic changes occurring during
      pregnancy, particularly during the third trimester, increase the risk of those women to
      develop SDB. As in the general population, SDB during pregnancy is more frequent among obese
      women. In the light of the increasing prevalence of obesity among females of reproductive
      age, SDB may thus have an increasingly significant impact on women's and children's health
      by contributing to the adverse maternal and fetal outcomes associated with maternal obesity.

      Only a limited amount of data is available on the consequences of maternal SDB during
      pregnancy. Even less information is available on the effect of maternal SDB on fetal growth
      and development. The current proposal is designed to specifically explore the effect of
      maternal SDB on fetal growth.

      It has been suggested that fetal growth as reflected in birth weight is a strong correlate
      for conditions occurring in the intrauterine environment with potential long lasting
      influence on a child's health.

      Our overall hypothesis is that the intermittent hypoxia, sleep fragmentation and the
      metabolic alterations associated with maternal SDB will affect fetal growth.

      Using a variety of methods and a multidisciplinary approach, we will explore the following
      objectives:   1) The effect of maternal SDB on fetal growth  ; 2) To explore mechanisms that
      may underlay the effect of maternal SDB on fetal growth 3) To explore the long term (first 3
      years of life) effect of maternal SDB on a child's growth.

      The results of this study will make an important contribution to the fields of women and
      children's health. It will provide better insight into the mechanisms by which disrupted
      maternal sleep affects fetal growth.

      We expect that the findings from our study will enable the defining of a new treatable
      clinical entity or syndrome: &quot;the infant of the gestational SDB mother&quot;, for which early
      diagnosis and intervention might be of major importance to the newborn infant.
