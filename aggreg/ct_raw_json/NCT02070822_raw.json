A total of 100 subjects will\n      be recruited. MRI will be performed before TACE (day 0), day 14, and day 28 to assess the\n      tumor responses. After day 28, all subjects will receive standard clinical care and be\n      follow-up for 1 year. The imaging parameters will be compared among each MRI and correlate\n      with patients' outcome. The investigators hypothesis that it might be helpful to combine\n      DCE-MRI, DWI, and MRS for assessment of tumor response after TACE and predict patients'\n      prognosis."

This modality is being increasingly used in many oncological studies to\n      characterize tumor angiogenesis and invasiveness, and monitor the treatment response.\n\n      Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) enables qualitative and quantitative assessment of tissue\n      diffusivity (apparent diffusion coefficient, ADC) without the use of gadolinium chelates.\n      DWI has been suggested to be useful in monitoring the response of HCC after TACE because of\n      earlier assessment of tumor necrosis with increasing ADC values.\n\n      MR spectroscopy facilitates the study of cellular metabolism and in vivo detection of\n      abnormalities. A few studies of in vivo MR spectroscopy reported an increase in choline\n      levels within tumors such as HCC and a reduction in the lipid-to-choline ratio after\n      conventional TACE was performed for HCC."
