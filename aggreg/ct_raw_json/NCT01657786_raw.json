However, although 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 (5-HT3)\n      receptor antagonists have significantly reduced PONV, it is reported that over 35% of\n      patients treated with ondansetron experience PONV. Though the cause of failure in\n      ondansetron treatment is not clear, the investigators assumed that polymorphism in the 5-HT3\n      receptor gene would contribute to such inter-individual variation. In this study, the\n      investigators examine whether the polymorphisms of 5-HT3 receptor gene affect the efficacy\n      of ondansetron to prevent PONV in patients undergoing general anesthesia for laparoscopic\n      surgery."
