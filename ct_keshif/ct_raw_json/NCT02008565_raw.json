We will test the\n      following null hypotheses:\n\n        1. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to loperamide and women\n           randomized to  oral placebo for treatment of FI;\n\n        2. there is no difference in outcomes between women randomized to anal sphincter exercises\n           with biofeedback and women randomized to usual care (educational pamphlet) for FI\n           treatment;\n\n        3. there is no difference between women randomized to both treatments together and women\n           randomized to either FI treatment alone; and\n\n        4. there is no correlation between anal manometry measurements and digital anal squeeze\n           strength or measures of FI severity and bother."

Sessions will include introduction, standard patient education, and exercises using anal manometry-assisted biofeedback introducing concepts such as shaping, generalization and termination. The protocol will include strength and sensory training including urge resistance training. During the final twelve weeks, subjects will perform anal exercises on their own. The sessions with interventionists will occur every other week for 12 weeks (total 6 supervised sessions).",
