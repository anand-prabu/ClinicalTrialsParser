To improve\n      postoperative nutritional status and QOL, surgeons have tried to establish ideal\n      reconstruction after total gastrectomy and the optimum procedure for reconstruction has been\n      discussed.\n\n      This study will compare the postoperative quality of life (QOL) of gastric pouch\n      reconstruction with the usual reconstruction to see if the pouch makes patients feel better."
