Heart\n      failure and sudden cardiac death are complications associated with aortic stenosis.  In\n      symptomatic individuals, valve replacement is often the only effective treatment.  However,\n      there are no good markers to identify patients who may benefit from early surgery before\n      symptoms developed.  The purpose of the study is to test the hypothesis that the presence\n      heart muscle scarring on the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging may predict a worse outcome\n      in patients with aortic stenosis, and thus may be helpful in identifying patients for early\n      valve replacement."

Currently, the indications for valvular replacement are based on the valvular\n      severity evaluated by echocardiography and the presence of symptoms.  There is some evidence\n      to suggest the presence of myocardial fibrosis is associated with a poor outcome in patients\n      with aortic stenosis.  The aim of this prospective study is to investigate the prognostic\n      implications of myocardial fibrosis in patients with aortic stenosis.  The presence of\n      myocardial fibrosis will be identified by delayed enhancement with the cardiac magnetic\n      resonance imaging at 3T.  We will also be evaluating the application of T1 mapping\n      techniques to detect diffuse myocardial fibrosis."
