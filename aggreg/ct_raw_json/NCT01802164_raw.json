            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Incisional hernia is a common complication in visceral surgery and varies between 11 and 26%\n      in the general surgical population [1,2]. An incisional hernia is defined as any abdominal\n      wall gap with or without a bulge in the area of postoperative scar perceptible or palpable\n      by clinical examination or imaging [3]. Overall incidence of incisional hernia at our\n      institution with a follow-up of five years was 14%, whereas in patients undergoing liver\n      transplantation we found an incidence of incisional hernia of 25% in a prospective study\n      [2]. However, patients with peritonitis are at very high risk for the development of\n      incisional hernia. Moussavian et al demonstrated an incidence of incisional hernia of 54.3%\n      after a median follow-up of 6 years in patients undergoing emergency surgery for secondary\n      peritonitis [4]. In patients undergoing surgical therapy for secondary peritonitis, redo\n      surgery because of complications associated with the abdominal wall, such as fascial\n      dehiscence and surgical site infection are frequent. Impaired wound healing in response to\n      the systemic inflammatory response and the high incidence of surgical site infection might\n      render the abdominal wall even more susceptible for incisional hernia, compared with the\n      general surgical population [5,6]. Furthermore, patients with peritonitis undergoing\n      emergency laparotomy develop fascial dehiscence in up to 24.1% [7]. Fascial dehiscence\n      requires reoperation and is associated with a mortality rate up to 44% [8].\n\n      Objective\n\n      To compare prophylactic mesh implantation to conventional abdominal wall closure in patients\n      undergoing emergency laparotomy for peritonitis.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Implantation of a non-resorbable intraperitoneal mesh in patients with peritonitis\n      undergoing emergency laparotomy."
