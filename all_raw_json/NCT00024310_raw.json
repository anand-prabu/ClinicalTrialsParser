Folic acid may protect normal cells from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy and may increase the effectiveness of chemotherapy by making tumor cells more\n      sensitive to the drug. Lometrexol may stop the growth of tumors by blocking one of the\n      enzymes necessary for cancer cell growth. Combining chemotherapy with folic acid and\n      lometrexol may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel, folic acid, and\n      lometrexol in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors."

Patients also receive oral folic acid beginning 7 days before\n      lometrexol/paclitaxel and continuing for 14 days. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel are escalated sequentially. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      receive escalating doses of lometrexol and paclitaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)\n      is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity. Six to twelve additional patients are treated at the recommended\n      phase II study dose (dose immediately preceding the MTD).\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study."
