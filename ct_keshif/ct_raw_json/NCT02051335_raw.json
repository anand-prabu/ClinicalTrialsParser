The patterns are then displayed in the middle of the screen, one at a time, and the participant must touch the box where the pattern was originally located. If the participant makes an error, the patterns are re-presented to remind the participant of their locations. If the participant has not responded correctly within six attempts, ie, one presentation and five re-presentations, the task is terminated. As the task progresses the difficulty level increases with the number of patterns to be remembered. For participants who fail to complete all levels, an adjusted total is calculated that takes into account errors predicted in the stages that were not attempted.",
