            "textblock": "With the prevalence of asthma increasing each decade, our focus has shifted from treatment\n      to understanding the pathogenesis of asthma so we may develop methods of prevention. With\n      the advent of new bacterial detection techniques, we have the opportunity to examine the\n      infant microbiome (collection of genetic information from organisms that live on humans and\n      pose no threat) prior to the development of wheezing and subsequent asthma. Based on our\n      knowledge that certain bacteria are associated with recurrent wheezing, we believe that an\n      increase in pathogenic bacteria alters the airway epithelium resulting in airway\n      inflammation. This chronic inflammation leads to airway obstruction, resulting in recurrent\n      wheezing. By prospectively following children over two years we have the opportunity to\n      determine if changes seen in early infancy are established early and persist until 2 years\n      of age. In addition, we propose to determine if the microbiome contributes to airway\n      obstruction and episodes of wheezing with respiratory illness. This study tests the\n      hypothesis that an increase in pathogenic bacteria within the infant airway leads to\n      increased airway inflammation, decreased airway function and ultimately airway obstruction\n      throughout the first two years of life.\n\n      Once enrolled, study procedures will consist of 3 nasal swabs collected at enrollment, 4-6\n      months, and 22-24 months; spirometry will be performed through infant pulmonary function\n      tests at 4-6 months and repeated at 22-24 months of age; and finally surveys completed every\n      three months starting after the 4-6 month time point and ending before the 22-24 month time\n      point."
