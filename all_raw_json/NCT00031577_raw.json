Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Paclitaxel may make the tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining paclitaxel with radiation\n      therapy in treating children who have newly diagnosed brain stem glioma."

The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
