Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated\n      with poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well\n      as chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that\n      HDMA leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in\n      HDM-sensitised patients.\n\n      ToleroMune House Dust Mite (TM-HDM), a combination of seven Synthetic Peptide\n      Immuno-Regulatory Epitopes, is being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy.\n\n      This study to assess the tolerability of ToleroMune House Dust Mite in subjects with\n      controlled asthma and house dust mite-induced rhinoconjunctivitis."
