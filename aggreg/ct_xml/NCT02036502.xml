  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/maximum administered dose
      (MAD) and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D), and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) when given in combination with lenalidomide (Len) and dexamethasone
      (Dex) to participants with multiple myeloma (MM). Preliminary efficacy data will also be
      assessed. The primary study hypothesis is that this combination is sufficiently well
      tolerated to permit further clinical investigation.
