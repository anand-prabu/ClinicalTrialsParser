            "textblock": "Researchers in recent years have begun to consider how modern occupational practices and\n      environments could be enriched to facilitate increased energy expenditure by replacing\n      sedentary behaviors with opportunities for non-exercise physical activity without competing\n      with time committed to work tasks. The investigators have developed a pedal desk: a\n      semi-recumbent (upright) portable pedal mechanism with a maneuverable and adaptable desktop.\n      While utilizing the pedal desk, workers are able to complete their tasks in a more\n      traditional seated position. Determining workers' acceptability is a key initial step in\n      translating this \"sedentary behavior countermeasure\" to real workplace settings.\n\n      In addition to having their height, weight, body fat percentage, and bioelectrical impedance\n      measured, eligible participants will be asked to complete three tasks while simultaneously\n      pedaling at a sustainable and self-selected pace. The three tasks are: 1) compose and send\n      an email; 2) search a topic on the internet, and 3) complete an on-line questionnaire. The\n      questionnaire that participants will complete was developed specifically for this study,\n      utilizes Likert scales, and is based on the Theory of Planned Behavior. Constructs tested\n      focus on perceptions of using the pedal desk at work and include: behavioral beliefs,\n      normative beliefs, control beliefs, intention, self-efficacy, and an open-ended question\n      soliciting general impressions concerning using the pedal desk at work."
