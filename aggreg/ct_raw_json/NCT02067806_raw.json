The mandatory\n      follow-ups of the study are at 24 h and 7 days (-1/+2) after anaesthesia. In case of signs\n      of neurological complications, the patient has to undergo to a medical visit at the hospital\n      by the relevant specialists (anaesthetist, surgeon, neurologist). In order to characterise\n      the occurred adverse event, a complete analysis evaluation has to be conducted, as CT, MRI,\n      Electromyography, etc. following the indication of the specialists. In case of persistent\n      neuropathy the patient needs to be accurately followed according to the internal hospital\n      procedure. In the meantime, a full screening of the patient's clinical history together with\n      a detailed analysis of the relevant variables, potentially related to the adverse event,\n      have to be carried out.\n\n      Therefore, the physician will take all appropriate measures to ensure the safety of the\n      patients, notably he/she should follow up the outcome of any Adverse Events (clinical signs,\n      laboratory values or other, etc.) until the return to normal or consolidation of the\n      patient's condition. In case of any Serious Adverse Event, the patient has to be followed up\n      until clinical recovery is complete and laboratory results have returned to normal, or until\n      progression has been stabilized. The follow-up will continue after the patient has left the\n      study."
