            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Combining bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation\n      with chemotherapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It is not\n      yet known whether a more intensive chemotherapy regimen plus stem cell or bone marrow\n      transplant is more effective than standard chemotherapy in treating patients with myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two different regimens\n      of combination chemotherapy plus interferon alfa with or without high dose melphalan or bone\n      marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with previously\n      untreated myeloma."

Compare survival of patients under age 65 with myeloma treated with standard\n      ABCM (doxorubicin, carmustine, cyclophosphamide, melphalan) vs. intensive C-VAMP\n      (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin, methylprednisolone) followed by high-dose\n      melphalan (with or without total-body irradiation) with bone marrow and peripheral blood\n      stem cell support, both with IFN-A maintenance. II. Compare the toxicity profiles of the 2\n      treatment arms. III. Compare the 2 treatment arms with respect to quality of life and health\n      economics issues. IV. Investigate cellular changes by means of linked morphology, phenotype,\n      and cytogenetics studies before and after treatment and at relapse.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study.

Induction: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy or, as indicated, 2-Drug\n      Combination Chemotherapy. ABCM: DOX; BCNU; CTX; L-PAM; or, if pretreatment ANC and platelets\n      are less than 1,300 and 75,000, CTX; PRED. Maintenance: Biological Response Modifier\n      Therapy. IFN-A. ARM II. Induction: 4-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by Hematopoietic\n      Stimulation. C-VAMP: DOX; VCR; MePRDL; CTX; followed by CTX; G-CSF or GM-CSF. Consolidation:\n      3-Drug Combination Chemoablation with or without Radioablation followed by Hematopoietic\n      Rescue. CTX; L-PAM; MePRDL; with or without TBI using megavoltage equipment (linear\n      accelerator preferred); followed by ABM and/or PBSC. Maintenance: Biological Response\n      Modifier Therapy.
