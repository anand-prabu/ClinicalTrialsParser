  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general aim of the proposed pilot study is to evaluate the the efficacy of mind-body
      bridging (MBB) for anger management compared with the Real Deal anger management program, in
      helping adolescents control or reduce their anger.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this pilot randomized-controlled study, we evaluate the effects of MBB as compared with
      an established anger management program (Real Deal), in helping youth prone to anger develop
      tools to effectively reduce and control their anger, and potentially reduce other negative
      emotions and feelings that might be associated with their anger.

    <description>The Youth Outcome Questionnaire Self-Report 30 (YOQ-30) is a relatively brief (30-item) psychotherapy outcome measure, which considers general symptoms relevant to many youth mental health disorders and social issues. YOQ-30 is appropriate for tracking youth outcomes over time. It can be completed by adolescents between the ages of 12 and 18 and takes about five minutes to complete. It comprises six subscales (Somatic, Social Isolation, Aggression, Conduct Problems, Hyperactivity/Distractibility, and Depression/ Anxiety). A total score can be computed with 0 indicating no symptomatology and 120 indicating severe symptomatology.</description>

    <description>Five-facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) The FFMQ Short Form (FFMQ-SF) is a 15-item scale assessing five distinct, interpretable facets of mindfulness, including (1) observing, (2) describing, (3) acting with awareness, (4) non-judgement of inner experience, and (5) non-reactivity to inner experience.</description>

    <description>Self-Compassion Scale (SCS) The SCS short form (SCS-SF) is a 12-item scale used to measure self-compassion, an emotionally positive attitude that can protect against the negative consequences of self-judgment, isolation, and rumination (such as in depression). Self-compassion has three main aspects: (1) self-kindness (being kind and understanding toward oneself in instances of pain or failure, rather than being harshly self-critical); (2) common humanity (perceiving one's experiences as part of the larger human experience, rather than seeing them as separating and isolating); and (3) mindfulness (holding painful thoughts and feelings in balanced awareness, rather than over-identifying with them).</description>

    <description>The Real Deal Anger Management Program is a structured, video-based intervention, which is an easy-to-implement, &quot;plug and play&quot; program that engages students in: (a) cognitive exercises for learning to recognize and correct thinking errors that lead to anger, (b) active practice of social-behavioral skills through role-playing, and (c) participation in progressive muscle relaxation exercises. The program features three training videos that focus on specific skills for controlling conflict.</description>

    <description>The Mind-Body Bridging program for anger management, includes experiential awareness activities, in which individuals learn to become aware of their thoughts, feelings, emotions, and bodily sensations, to help them identify and deal with ruminative and negative thoughts that might be associated with their anger. MBB helps participants use their senses to listen to sounds, and experience visual or tactile input, to calm their minds and relax their bodies. Written 'mapping' exercises enable them to recognize and defuse requirements, which are expectations of how they or the world should be. For the MBB anger management program, participants will be provided with a variety of mapping exercises to identify the source of their anger, and how they can effectively control it.</description>
