  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, prospective, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) in routine clinical practice in patients with HBeAg-positive
      or HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B. Eligible patients receiving treatment with Pegasys
      according to standard of care and the summary od product characteristics/local labelling
      will be followed for the duration of treatment and up to 2 years of follow-up.
