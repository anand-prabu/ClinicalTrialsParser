      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of systematic identification and
      genetic counseling referral on rates of bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (surgery to remove
      both fallopian tubes and ovaries) in women having mammograms at Swedish Medical Center in
      Seattle, WA.

    <description>The genetic counseling sessions are conducted by a licensed genetic counselor, certified by the American Board of Genetic Counseling and the American Board of Medical Genetics. This clinical counseling session may include, but is not limited to the following:
A review of medical and family history information to determine which genetic test (BRCA, HNPCC, p53, etc.), if any, is appropriate;
Discuss how the results - positive or negative - affect cancer risk
Discuss how cancer risk might be managed (surveillance, prophylactic surgery, oral contraceptives, etc.);
Discuss how the test is conducted and what the results might be (positive, negative, uncertain);
Discuss the disadvantages of genetic testing (cost, insurance coverage, worry about insurance discrimination, uncertain results, etc.) and the psychological and emotional issues surrounding testing, etc.</description>
