A total of 60 overweight and obese\n      participants over age 50 will be enrolled. Each participant will drink each beverage for 4\n      weeks with a 2-week rest period between two beverage consumption periods. The order of\n      beverages (grape juice first or placebo juice first) will be randomized. The investigators\n      will use ultrasound to measure brachial artery flow-mediated dilation, a measure of\n      endothelial vasodilator function. The investigators will also collect blood samples to\n      further assess the cardiovascular effects of grape juice.\n\n      The aim of the study is to determine whether Concord grape juice improves endothelial\n      function in patients at risk who do not have cardiovascular disease and may provide\n      information that would guide dietary recommendations. The results may also be used by the\n      sponsor to substantiate claims and labeling of their product."
