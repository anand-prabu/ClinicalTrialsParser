All\n      patients admitted to the hospital on two separate days will have hepatitis C testing done on\n      leftover serum and plasma that was collected as part of routine inpatient lab work.  Our\n      primary goal is to determine the number of undiagnosed hepatitis C infected patients in our\n      hospitalized population.  We will also compare these rates to specific demographic\n      characteristics, such as age, race, gender, zip code and type of insurance to see if any\n      associations exist between these demographics and undiagnosed hepatitis C infection."
