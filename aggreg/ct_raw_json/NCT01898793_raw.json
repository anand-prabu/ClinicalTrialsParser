Giving\n      chemotherapy before a donor natural killer cell infusion helps stop the growth of cancer\n      cells.  It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's natural\n      killer cells.  Modified natural killer cells may help the body build an immune response to\n      kill cancer cells.  Aldesleukin (interleukin-2) may stimulate the white blood cells\n      (including natural killer cells) to kill leukemia cells."
