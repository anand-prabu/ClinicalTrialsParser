However 6% of the cultures remain sterile, etiological\n      diagnosis cannot be established despite obvious signs of infection. As part of this research\n      project, we have developed a new strategy diagnosis including directly the use of PCR to\n      reduce the number of negative results. This should have a major therapeutic impact in terms\n      of timeliness and specificity of antibiotic.\n\n      Primary:\n\n      Evaluate the effectiveness of the new diagnostic strategy on etiological identification of\n      prosthesis infections.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      Minimum  6 percent increase in the number of patients with an etiological diagnosis of\n      infection on prosthesis."
