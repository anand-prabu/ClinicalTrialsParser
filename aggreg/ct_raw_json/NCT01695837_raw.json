The intervention will be\n      initiated by the primary care physician during the routine office visits and will use paper\n      and web-based counseling materials. Internet based healthcare, or e-healthcare, is a\n      consumer focused health care delivery paradigm that physicians and the healthcare system can\n      no longer ignore. Lifestyle counseling and preventive medicine are potentially ideal areas\n      of patient care that could be provided efficiently through this emerging venue of healthcare\n      delivery. Internet access is near-universal for Americans under the age of 60: 90% of 18-29\n      year-olds, 85% of 30-49 year-olds, and 70% of 50-64 year-olds.\n\n      The aims of this study are: 1) -  develop  a patient self-administered, computerized version\n      of the  paper-based  Rate-your-Plate dietary screening  Questionnaire;  2) - create\n      counseling materials on diet and  cholesterol and build  a secure, HIPAA compliant,\n      interactive web-based counseling application that will allow patients to receive\n      personalized counseling base on the results of the screening  dietary questionnaire and the\n      goals chosen by the patients;  3) - to test the feasibility of this intervention in the\n      clinical settings of primary care, and evaluate its effect on lipids panel at 3 and 6 months\n      ."
