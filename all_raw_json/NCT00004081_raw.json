Courses repeat\n      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients\n      achieving complete response (CR) receive a minimum of 6 courses of therapy, including 2\n      courses beyond CR.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
