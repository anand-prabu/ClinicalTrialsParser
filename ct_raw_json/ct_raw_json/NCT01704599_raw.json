            "textblock": "This is a pilot study designed to evaluate whether  addition of oral vitamin B12, vitamin\n      B6, and folic acid to the use of adalimumab for psoriasis leads to further  improvement of a\n      patient's psoriasis and quality of life.\n\n      Adalimumab is indicated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of\n      adults with moderate to severe long standing (chronic) plaque psoriasis.  Adalimumab is a\n      medicine called a TNF-alpha (tumor necrosis factor alpha) blocker.  The extra TNF-alpha in\n      the body can attack normal healthy body tissues and cause inflammation. The purposes of this\n      study are to investigate the effects of the addition of 12 weeks of modulators of\n      homocysteine (oral vitamin B12, oral vitamin B6 or pyridoxine, and oral folic acid) plus\n      adalimumab after  16 weeks adalimumab therapy on the clinical appearance of psoriasis and on\n      laboratory values correlated with the use and disuse of said modulators. Given that near\n      maximum clinical improvement on adalimumab is expected after 16 weeks of adalimumab, if\n      further clearcut improvement was seen  in most subjects at the 28 week visit, it would be\n      attributed to the addition of the vitamins."
