  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of deferiprone and its
      3-O-glucuronide metabolite following administration of a single 1500 mg dose of Ferriprox in
      patients with sickle cell disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, single-dose study of Ferriprox in patients with sickle cell disease.
      Patients found to be eligible will visit the clinic the day before receiving the drug, in
      order to reconfirm eligibility and to undergo baseline assessments, and will receive a
      single dose of 1500 mg Ferriprox under fasting conditions.  Blood and urine samples for
      pharmacokinetic assessment will be collected over a 10-hour period. Standard safety
      assessments will be performed throughout the study, and patients will return for a safety
      follow-up.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female, 18-45 years of age (inclusive)

          2. Diagnosis of sickle cell disease, confirmed by Hb electrophoresis

          3. Body weight ≥ 50 kg

          4. Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 18 and ≤ 32 kg/m^2

          5. Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &gt;1.5 x 10^9/L

          6. Women of childbearing potential must agree to either be sexually inactive or use an
             acceptable method of birth control for 14 days prior to dosing and for 30 days
             afterwards

          7. A fertile heterosexual male must agree that he or his partner will use an effective
             method of contraception for 14 days prior to dosing and for 30 days afterwards

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. History or presence of hypersensitivity or idiosyncratic reaction to Ferriprox

          2. Use of Ferriprox within the past 3 months

          3. History of malignancy

          4. Evidence of abnormal liver function (serum ALT level &gt; 5 times upper limit of normal
             or creatinine levels &gt;2 times upper limit of normal)

          5. A serious, unstable illness, as judged by the Investigator, within the past 3 months
             before screening visit including but not limited to hepatic, renal,
             gastro-enterologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, endocrinologic, neurologic or
             immunologic disease

          6. Hemodialysis during the week prior to dosing or planned for the day of dosing

          7. Known difficulty in providing blood samples

          8. Disorders or surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that may interfere with drug
             absorption or may otherwise influence the PK results (e.g., resection of the small or
             large intestine, febrile conditions, chronic diarrhea, chronic vomiting, endocrine
             disease, severe infections, acute inflammations, etc.)

          9. Clinically significant abnormalities on 12-lead ECG (e.g., QTcF ≥ 430 ms in males or
             ≥ 450 ms in females)

         10. Use of tobacco/nicotine-containing products for at least 3 months prior to study drug
             administration

         11. Use of any drugs within the past 14 days that are metabolized by the UGT1A6 enzyme
             and hence could affect the PK of Ferriprox

         12. Treatment with an investigational drug within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives of
             that drug (whichever is longer) prior to study drug administration

         13. Pregnant or nursing female
