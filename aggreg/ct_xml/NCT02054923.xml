  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Routine video recording of the colonoscopy examination has been proposed as a simple and
      easy to implement method that could improve the quality of colonoscopy. The purpose of this
      study is to investigate whether implementation of routine video recording of screening
      colonoscopy withdrawal is effective as a means of supporting quality performance of
      colonoscopy. The study will be performed in 8 screening centers within the framework of a
      national colonoscopy screening program in Poland (the Polish Colonoscopy Screening Platform;
      PCSP). Individuals aged 55-64 years are eligible to participate in the PCSP. In the run-in
      period colonoscopy quality measures will be monitored through a dedicated joint database.
      Then eligible screening centres will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the video
      recording group or the control group. Screening centres assigned to the video recording
      group will receive videorecorders and DVDs and will be asked to video record all screening
      colonoscopies (only withdrawal). Control group will be allowed to record colonoscopies on
      demand only. Then , the colonoscopy quality measures will again be monitored through a
      dedicated joint database.

    <description>All screening centres (clusters) assigned to the routine video recording group will receive an appropriate number of video recorders and DVDs for each colonoscopy room. Screening centre coordinators will be responsible for the implementation of routine video recording of all screening colonoscopies (only withdrawal) in the centres. Every three months screening centre coordinators will be asked to send back all recorded DVDs. All the recorded DVDs will be reviewed to verify ceacal intubation  and withdrawal time by the PCSP team and then stored.</description>
