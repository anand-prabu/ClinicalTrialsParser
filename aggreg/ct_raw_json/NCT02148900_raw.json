(2) Determine if high\n      concentrations of fibrillin-1 fragments are associated with large aortic root diameters.\n      (3) Determine which fibrillin-1 fragments are good biomarkers for aortic root growth and\n      size in Marfan syndrome. (4) Determine the relation between fibrillin-1, aortic root\n      diameter, and medical and lifestyle factors reported on questionnaires."
