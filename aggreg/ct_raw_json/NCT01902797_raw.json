In the first stage, sections are selected using  Population-proportion-to size (PPS) method.   In the second stage,  households are randomly selected from the household list in each section provided by NGO and local committee.    When a household is not responding, a nearest household on the north will be used as replacement.  All family members and overnight guests aged above 5 years in the selected household will be invited for venous blood sample  (2 ml);  for children aged 1-5 years old, the blood sample (100 microL) will be obtained by finger prick;  children younger than 1 year old are excluded.   The head of household will be invited for a short questionnaire."

The malaria risk among the refugee camp is higher than the Thai\n      residences inside Thailand.\n\n      To avoid resource wastage, it is thus essential to conduct a simple questionnaire to\n      understand the current situation of malaria prevention in the camps, especially information\n      regarding the mosquito net ownership and usage (mosquito net distribution has been a major\n      malaria prevention activity among the NGOs in the camps).\n\n      PCR method is being used more and more in recent year due to its sensitivity compared to\n      slide reading. PCR is considered being able to capture more cases with sub-microscopic\n      infection.  However, the current PCR methods conventionally used in malaria survey usually\n      use finger prick to obtain only few microliters of capillary blood , the detectable level of\n      parasitaemia is therefore limited due to minimal amount of blood from which Plasmodium DNA\n      can be extracted.  Thus the RT-PCR method proposed here using 2ml venous blood well\n      compensates these shortcomings.\n\n      The comparison of test results of conventional microscopy (currently still as the universal\n      golden standard in the clinics) and RT-PCR will not only enable detection of both\n      symptomatic and asymptomatic malaria cases but help define the epidemiology apart from our\n      conventional understanding of malaria.\n\n      Thus this study is necessary and is strategically important for the next roadmap development\n      of malaria elimination and resistance containment."
