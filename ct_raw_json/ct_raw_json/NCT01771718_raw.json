Currently, there is no standard non-invasive method\n      for skin imaging.  Researchers of the Beckman Laser Institute (BLI) have developed many\n      non-invasive imaging modalities for assessment of skin.  In this study, a multiphoton\n      tomograph (MPM/MPTflex) based on the MPM technology will be used for assessment of skin."
