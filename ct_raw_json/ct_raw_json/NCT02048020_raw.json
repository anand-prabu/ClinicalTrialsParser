Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either\n      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high energy x\n      rays to kill tumor cells. Giving paclitaxel and carboplatin before radiation therapy with\n      paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells."

To determine the overall survival and local-regional control for patients with\n      HPV-positive HNSCC who receive induction chemotherapy and dose de-intensified\n      chemoradiotherapy.\n\n      II. To determine the incidence of acute grade 3+ mucosal and esophageal toxicity associated\n      with attenuated concurrent chemoradiotherapy in patients with HPV-positive HNSCC.\n\n      III.
