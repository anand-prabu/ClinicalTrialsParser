Zinc deficiency has been\n      shown to favor the development of infections and has been considered a real public health\n      problem.\n\n      Within the zinc compounds used are zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate, the first that\n      has shown evidence of being better absorbed and tolerated.\n\n      We propose a study showing the effectiveness of zinc amino acid chelate and zinc sulphate in\n      the prevention of acute diarrheal disease and acute respiratory infection."
