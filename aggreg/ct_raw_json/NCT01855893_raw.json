Patients with\n      diagnosis of cervicalgia of benign origin will include. They will be randomly assigned to\n      receive just conventional treatment or this plus auto-acupressure.\n\n      The professionals will once receive instruction in the Centres of Health by an experienced\n      acupuncture professional that will supervise, in a workshop, the right application of the\n      technique, that will consist of the application of manoeuvres of auto-acupressure by the own\n      patient during periods of 10 minutes, once in a day during one week. The pain intensity will\n      be evaluated by means of a millimetric scale of 10 cm (0 represents the pain absence, 10 the\n      maximum imaginable pain, Numerical Scale Rating). The pain will be measured in the inclusion\n      and days 1, 3, 7, 30 and 90. The sample size has been calculated to detect a minimum\n      difference of 1.5 points (DS 2) in the scale of the pain in day 7, which implies the\n      recruitment of, at least, 80 patients by group (if losses don't exceed 20%). Also the\n      perception of the quality of life (euroQol-5D) and the functional capacity with the scale of\n      Oswestry will be evaluated, at the beginning, and days 3, 7, 30 and 90. The measures in each\n      point between the group will be compared control and intervention. The evolution of the\n      repeated measures will compare between groups with a generalized estimating equation (GEE)\n      model."
