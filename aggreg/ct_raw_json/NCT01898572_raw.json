            "textblock": "It has been hypothesized, based on recent trials, that only early intervention can reduce\n      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). This\n      finding may imply that atherosclerosis at diabetes diagnosed, is either negligible, or at\n      early, or non-advanced, still modifiable disease stage. However, sparse information is\n      available regarding atherosclerosis prevalence and its characteristics at diabetes\n      presentation. Furthermore, although cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention is the major\n      goal of treatment in T2DM, risk assessment tools, mostly based on traditional CV risk\n      factors, lack of adequate specificity to identify individuals at higher risk. Therefore,\n      non-invasive tests, such as carotid ultrasound, have been recommended to better define CV\n      risk in several groups of individuals, including those with intermediate risk or with T2DM.\n\n      This clinical study aims to improve the investigators knowledge on cardiovascular disease\n      (CVD) in subjects with newly diagnosed T2DM (NEWDM). The investigators hypothesis is that\n      carotid ultrasound (carotid intimae media thickness [CIMT] and carotid plaque [CP]) will\n      show a worse subclinical/preclinical CVD stage in NEWDM compared with non-diabetic (CONTROL)\n      individuals. Moreover, carotid ultrasound will also identify T2DM individuals at a higher\n      risk in whom intervention should be more intensive.\n\n      Because individuals with T2DM have a higher prevalence of several CV risk factors, NEWDM\n      will be matched with CONTROL individuals, not only for age and sex (the main determinants of\n      atherosclerosis), but also for known, treated hypertension and dyslipidemia, and smoking\n      habit.\n\n      The investigators will study NEWDM and CONTROL individuals without clinical CVD. This is a\n      cross-sectional and longitudinal (18 months of follow-up) case-control study. The main study\n      variables will be carotid ultrasound derived variables. The main aims of the study are: 1)\n      to investigate CIMT and CP prevalence differences between NEWDM and CONTROL subjects; 2) to\n      characterize the subset of NEWDM subjects with a higher CIMT (\u2265 mean+1SD o \u2265 P75th) or CP\n      presence; and 3) to early characterize individuals in whom subclinical CVD worsens (CIMT\n      progression \u2265 mean + 1SD o \u2265 P75th) even after standard (according to clinical guidelines)\n      diabetes treatment."

To investigate differences in CIMT and the presence of CP in subjects with NEWDM and a\n           control population. Cross-sectional study.\n\n        2.

To investigate the main determinants of progression of CIMT in subjects treated\n           according to clinical practice guidelines\n\n        3. To investigate the association of baseline CIMT, its progression, and the presence of\n           CP with clinical scores used to estimate cardiovascular risk. These scores are: REGICOR\n           (Registre Giron\u00ed del Cor: the Gerona Heart Register), a calibrated Framingham Score for\n           a Mediterranean population, low risk SCORE (Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation), and\n           the UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) score (specific for T2DM).\n\n        4.
