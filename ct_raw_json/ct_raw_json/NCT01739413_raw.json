It\n      is unclear, however, whether the preoperative metabolic status of the surgical patient plays\n      a role in the degree of this hyperglycemic response. For instance, the presence of low\n      insulin sensitivity before surgery could predispose the individual to an altered metabolic\n      response after surgery. In this case, it would be appropriate to identify adequate\n      interventions that attenuate the response to surgical stress and facilitate the recovery\n      process.\n\n      The aims of this research projects are the following:\n\n        1. To determine the extent in which epidural local anesthetics, initiated before surgery\n           and continued after surgery, improves insulin secretion in patients with preoperative\n           low insulin sensitivity.\n\n        2. To understand  which measures of postoperative recovery are sensitive to the\n           restoration of insulin secretion in this particular group of patients"
