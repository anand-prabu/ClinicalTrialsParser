            "textblock": "This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.  In addition to studying safety, Phase II\n      clinical trials test if the investigational drug is effective and whether the drug works in\n      treating a specific cancer.  \"Investigational\" means that the drug is still being studied\n      and that research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to\n      use, the side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different\n      types of cancer.  It also means that the FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not\n      yet approved CRLX101 for your type of cancer.\n\n      Camptothecin is a chemical extracted from plants that is the basis for the standard\n      FDA-approved chemotherapy drugs irinotecan and topotecan.  Camptothecin works by interfering\n      with the way cells divide and multiply.  The investigational drug CRLX101 is a formulation\n      of camptothecin and a large molecule (nanoparticle)that appears to allow more of the\n      camptothecin to get into tumors and stay in tumors. The persistence of the CRLX101 in the\n      tumor may increase the probability that the tumor cells will be damaged.\n\n      CRLX101 has been well tolerated in the laboratory and in participants with different kinds\n      of cancer.\n\n      Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a VEGF inhibitor which has activity in many kinds of cancer.\n      Bevacizumab has been successfully combined with many chemotherapy partners.\n\n      It has been hypothesized that the combination of bevacizumab with CRLX101 might have unique\n      clinical activity in combination in the treatment of this disease due to the simultaneous\n      inhibition of distinct steps along the HIF \u2192 (CAIX) \u2192 VEGF \u2192 VEGFR2 pathway. Specifically,\n      it is hypothesized that CRLX101-mediated inhibition of HIF-1\u03b1 carries with it the potential\n      to interrupt hypoxia and HIF-1\u03b1-associated resistance to VEGFR inhibitors. It is hoped that\n      this combination will work to treat your type of cancer."

At every clinic visit, you will undergo the following assessments: Medical\n      history, physical examination, vital signs, performance status, routine blood tests, urine\n      tests, assessment for any new side effects, CT evaluation (every 8 weeks).\n\n      You will have an end of study visit within 30 days of your last dose."
