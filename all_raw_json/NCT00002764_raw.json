Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known whether surgery plus combination chemotherapy is more effective than surgery\n      alone in treating patients with lung metastases from soft tissue sarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of surgery plus combination\n      chemotherapy with that of surgery alone in treating patients who have soft tissue sarcoma\n      that has spread to the lung."

Compare disease control, overall survival, and relapse-free survival in\n      patients with lung metastases secondary to soft tissue sarcoma treated with high-dose\n      doxorubicin and ifosfamide with or without filgrastim (G-CSF) before and after\n      metastasectomy vs metastasectomy alone. II. Determine the safety and morbidity of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      location of metastases (unilateral vs bilateral). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients are assigned to regimen A or B. Regimen A: Patients receive\n      high-dose doxorubicin IV and ifosfamide IV continuously on day 1 and filgrastim (G-CSF)\n      subcutaneously on days 3-13. Regimen B: Patients receive chemotherapy as above without\n      G-CSF. Treatment on both regimens continues every 3 weeks for 3 courses. Patients then\n      undergo radical pulmonary metastasectomy via thoracotomy or sternotomy with wedge resection\n      or lobectomy. Patients with responding disease after metastasectomy receive 2 additional\n      courses on the regimen to which they were originally assigned. Arm II: Patients undergo\n      radical pulmonary metastasectomy as in arm I. Patients are followed every 3 months for 2\n      years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 340 patients (170 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within approximately 4.5 years."
