The primary outcome is to determine the prevalence of\n      self-perceived unmet supportive care needs, as identified by the Supportive Care Needs\n      Survey -Short Form (SCNS-SF), in people who have pain caused by their cancer or cancer\n      treatment.\n\n      Hypothesis- Patients with pain caused by their cancer or cancer treatments will report unmet\n      needs, which will increase if their pain is uncontrolled or if they have breakthrough pain.\n\n      Secondary Objectives-\n\n        1. To establish if other confounding factors -such as age, gender, marital status,\n           diagnosis, educational level and treatment, are significant predictors in the reporting\n           of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain.\n\n        2. To establish if there are any other symptoms, identified by the Memorial Symptom\n           Assessment Scale - Short Form (MSAS-SF), that are significant predictors in the\n           reporting of unmet needs of people with cancer or cancer treatment related pain.\n\n        3. To compare the prevalence and severity of self-perceived unmet supportive care needs\n           between people who experience controlled pain, uncontrolled pain and breakthrough pain.\n\n        4. To compare the prevalence and severity of unmet supportive care needs of people whose\n           pain has become controlled or uncontrolled over a period of four weeks.\n\n        5. To identify if there are any changes in the participants' symptoms,  Eastern\n           Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score or treatment that could contribute\n           to a change in the reporting unmet needs between time point one and two.\n\n        6. To establish if there are any characteristics of breakthrough pain, such as the\n           frequency  or severity of pain episodes, that have an association with prevalence and\n           the severity of the unmet supportive care needs reported by patients with breakthrough\n           pain caused by their cancer or cancer related treatments. Factors will be identified by\n           the Breakthrough pain Assessment Tool (BAT)."
