  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, open-label superiority study comparing the efficacy and
      safety of plazomicin with colistin when combined with a second antibiotic (either meropenem
      or tigecycline) in the treatment of patients with bloodstream infection (BSI) or nosocomial
      pneumonia due to CRE. Therapeutic drug management (TDM) will be used to help ensure that
      plazomicin exposures lie within an acceptable range of the target mean steady-state area
      under the curve (AUC).
