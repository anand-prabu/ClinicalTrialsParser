Patients\n      who have received androgen ablation therapy and are found to have increased bone resorption\n      undergo a dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan.\n\n      A comparison is made between androgen ablation therapy and bone resorption and if metastases\n      are associated with the two.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months."
