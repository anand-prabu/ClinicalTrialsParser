The study design is a two-arm community randomized\n      controlled trial of Comprehensive Triaged HIV Prevention (CTHP) which includes: (a) Access\n      to an HIV center which will provide free HIV testing and counseling, (b) Educational\n      activities related to HIV risk behavior, (c) Special counseling sessions for HIV-infected\n      clients, (d) A onetime provision of a small amount of food or health products for sex\n      partners of persons testing positive for HIV or reporting HIV risk behaviors when they come\n      to receive HIV testing, (e) A post test support club for persons infected with HIV, (f) An\n      income generation training program for people testing positive for HIV, (g) Transportation\n      assistance in visiting the HIV Care and Treatment Clinic in the area for those who test\n      positive for HIV, and, (h) Counseling and transportation support for those on medical\n      treatment for HIV to assist them in attending scheduled appointments, and receiving and\n      taking their medications as recommended by the clinic staff. The study will take place\n      within two communities located in Kisarawe district, Tanzania. The intervention will occur\n      over an 18-month period with outcomes assessed at baseline and post-intervention. The study\n      hypothesis is that individuals in the intervention community will have a lower incidence of\n      sexually transmitted infections (STIs) than those in the control community."
