Measures\n      included RER via indirect calorimetry, energy expenditure, subjective appetite, food intake\n      measured at an ad libitum pizza meal and net energy balance as the sum of the calories of\n      the glucose preload +  calories from the pizza lunch minus energy expended at exercise or\n      rest."
