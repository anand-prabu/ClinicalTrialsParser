II. Determine the safety profile of\n      this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ISIS 2503 IV continuously for 14\n      days. Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
