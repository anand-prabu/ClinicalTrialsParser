            "textblock": "Opioid dependence continues to be a serious public health problem, particularly with the\n      dramatic rise in prescription opioid abuse. Traditional methods of detoxification from\n      opioids, including tapering off the opioid agonist methadone or buprenorphine (BUP) and\n      supportive treatment of symptomatology with the alpha2-adrenergic receptor agonists, are\n      limited by the high relapse rate and/or lack of efficacy in relieving subjective symptoms.\n      In addition, transitioning individuals from methadone to BUP maintenance has been limited by\n      the need to drastically taper the methadone maintenance dose of methadone-maintained\n      individuals prior to switching to BUP maintenance, which can precipitate opiate withdrawal\n      and relapse. This application takes a novel approach to address the problem of opioid\n      withdrawal by examining the utility of the L-type calcium channel blocker (CCB) isradipine\n      as an adjunct to BUP detoxification. L-type CCBs have been shown to alleviate opioid\n      withdrawal in opioid-treated nonhumans, to be safe and effective in alleviating withdrawal\n      symptoms in human detoxification trials, and to have low abuse potential. Moreover,\n      isradipine was the most effective of several CCBs tested and was more effective than the\n      alpha2-adrenergic agonist clonidine in blocking naloxone-induced behavioral effects without\n      producing self-reported effects associated with high potential for abuse. Thus, this project\n      will address the need for improved detoxification strategies by assessing the tolerability\n      and preliminary efficacy of adjunct isradipine during a BUP detoxification in\n      opioid-dependent participants. The aim of this 8-week randomized, placebo-controlled pilot\n      clinical trial is to determine the potential utility of the L-type CCB isradipine to improve\n      treatment outcomes in up to 60 opioid-dependent individuals undergoing a BUP detoxification\n      procedure. The specific aims are to (Aim 1) determine the efficacy of isradipine to reduce\n      withdrawal symptoms, craving, and illicit use of opioids in opioid-dependent individuals\n      undergoing BUP detoxification and (Aim 2) determine the tolerability and safety of\n      controlled-release isradipine (10 mg/day) in opioid-dependent individuals undergoing BUP\n      detoxification. Currently, the only FDA-approved medications for opioid withdrawal are the\n      opioid agonists methadone and BUP, both of which have abuse liability. Our findings, if\n      positive, will support a larger phase II clinical trial. Ultimately, this work could impact\n      the addiction field by providing another pharmacological tool that is efficacious for\n      treating opioid withdrawal while having minimal abuse liability. This would shift clinical\n      practice, establishing an effective adjunct regimen for BUP detoxification as well as having\n      the potential to enhance transition to naltrexone therapy."

Participants must fulfill DSM-IV criteria for opioid dependence. These criteria will\n             be ascertained in the following manner:  the physician will determine whether the\n             individual is appropriate based on several clinical assessments that are routinely\n             employed by methadone program physicians, including history and severity of opioid\n             use, presence of track marks, prior treatment history, self-reported and/or observed\n             signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal. If any individual's degree of opioid\n             dependence is questionable, that person will be excluded from further consideration\n             as a participant.\n\n          3.

Unstable medical condition or stable medical condition that would interact with study\n             medications or participation.\n\n          2.

Present or recent use of over-the-counter psychoactive drug, prescription\n             psychoactive drug or any drug that would have major interaction with drugs to be\n             tested.\n\n          5. Liver function tests greater than 3 times normal; BUN and Creatinine outside normal\n             range.\n\n          6.
