      The purpose of this study is to investigate the pharmacokinetics of CKD-11101 and NESP after
      IV administration in health male volunteers

    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers are administrated CKD-11101 60μg and NESP 60μg once intravenously.
      (crossover) Every time before and after taking each medication, PK parameters and safety of
      CKD-11101 60μg and NESP 60μg are performed using a blood sample and conducting some
      tests(Laboratory test, V/S and Physical Examination, etc) respectively.
