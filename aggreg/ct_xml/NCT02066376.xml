    <textblock>
      The present phase II/III, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group comparative
      study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral administration of
      NE-58095NF(New formulation) tablets for 12 months in patients with involutional
      osteoporosis. For this study, patients receiving oral NE-58095 2.5-mg tablets once daily for
      12 months are set as the control group.

  <detailed_description>

      The primary objective of the present study is to verify the non-inferiority of  oral
      administration of NE-58095NF tablets for 12 months to once-daily oral administration of
      NE-58095 2.5-mg tablets for 12 months, in terms of efficacy in patients with involutional
      osteoporosis.

      Secondary objectives of the present study are as follows: to compare the safety of  oral
      administration of NE-58095NF tablets for 12 months with the safety of once-daily oral
      administration of NE-58095 tablets (at 2.5 mg) for 12 months in patients with involutional
      osteoporosis at time of wakening
