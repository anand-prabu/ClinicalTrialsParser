The technology of measuring HIV RNA in plasma has been suggested as a tool for\n      monitoring clinical drug efficacy. However, uncertainty remains about whether aggressive\n      antiretroviral treatment to lower HIV RNA and maintain low levels for as long as possible\n      will confer clinical benefit in comparison with management based on monitoring CD4 counts\n      and HIV-related symptoms."

The results of these\n      quantitations will be blinded until the end of the study. CD4 counts will be obtained at\n      least every 4 months if the previous count was > 20 cells/mm3. The remaining patients in the\n      CCP arm will have CD4 counts obtained according to their clinicians' current clinical\n      practices.
