Hepatic resection (HR) has been the standard treatment\n      modality for HCC aiming at clinical cure. In both Europe and Unit States proposed guidelines\n      for HCC, HR was recommend only for patients with a single HCC lesion and preserved liver\n      function . Unfortunately, only 10%-30% of HCCs are amenable to such \"curative\" surgical\n      resection at the time of diagnosis, because of tumor multifocality, portal vein invasion,\n      and underlying advanced liver cirrhosis . Alternatively, transarterial chemoembolization\n      (TACE) has become the most popular modality for palliative treatment for the other patients.\n      However, the long term outcomes were generally poor for HCC patients treated with TACE.\n\n      Recently, sorafenib has shown some promises in improvement of 3-month survival among\n      patients with advanced HCC. It is claimed that sorafenib has become the standard of care for\n      patients advanced HCC.\n\n      Thus, the purpose of this study was to prospectively compare the effectiveness of sorafenib\n      combined with TACE with that of TACE alone in the treatment of unresectable HCC ."

It is interesting to recognize the combined\n      therapeutic effect of TACE with sorafenib.
