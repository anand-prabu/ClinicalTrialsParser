            "textblock": "The osteoarthritis (OA) is a chronic and degenerative disease of multifactorial etiology,\n      characterized by the gradual loss of the cartilage to articulate. It is a question of one of\n      the most common rheumatic disorders in the population, is the most habitual reason of pain\n      and disability in the major adults and the first reason of surgeries of replacement to\n      articulate. In Mexico, in a study of national area, the prevalence of locomotives\n      manifestations was 26 %, with predominance in the women. Nowadays criteria exist for the\n      classification of the OA, based on epidemiological studies, for the knee, the hip and the\n      hand. Basically they have been established to homogenize studies of clinical epidemiological\n      type. In other hand, the Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory, chronic, systemic\n      disease that has more prominent manifestations in the diartrodiales joints. The disease have\n      a wide range of characteristics, from the progressively chronic disease with variable\n      degrees of destruction to articulate up to the extra-articular manifestations clinically\n      evident. Demographically, the RA is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis and\n      affects approximately 0.5 to 1 % of the world population, with an economic impact comparable\n      with arterial coronary disease. The National Institute of Geographical Statistics (INEGI)\n      thinks that in Mexico the population of major adults will double in the next decades, for\n      what the impact of these rheumatic disorders will be serious and will turn into a problem of\n      public health.\n\n      Based in the previous information, the Mexican Initiative of Patients with OA and RA\n      (IMPACTAR), will on patient interview to increase the knowledge regarding the number of\n      affected adults and the current treatment strategies.\n\n      This will be the first Mexican  Registry related with Osteoarticular diseases."
