Identifying women at\n      high risk of giving birth prematurely can be challenging. It is believed that higher levels\n      of fFn measured in vaginal fluid suggest a woman is at a greater risk for delivering early.\n      fFN testing is already approved for use in women from weeks 22 to 35 of pregnancy.  The goal\n      of this study is to evaluate the benefits of collecting fFN measurements from a vaginal\n      fluid specimen taken during early pregnancy (from 16 weeks to 22 weeks) to assess the risk\n      of pre-term birth."
