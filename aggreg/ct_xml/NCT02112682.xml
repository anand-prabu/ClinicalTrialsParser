      STUDY AIM To decrease the number of breast cancer patients receiving overtreatment of the
      axilla, in order to positively influence the axillary morbidity rate and quality of life.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE To determine whether omitting completion axillary treatment is not
      inferior to the current axillary treatment regimen in sentinel node positive breast cancer
      patients undergoing a mastectomy, in terms of regional recurrence rate.

      HYPOTHESIS Completion axillary treatment can be safely omitted in sentinel node positive
      breast cancer patients undergoing a mastectomy. This will lead to a decreased axillary
      morbidity rate and to an increased quality of life, with non-inferior regional control,
      distant-disease free- and overall survival rates.

          -  Pathologically confirmed invasive unilateral breast carcinoma

          -  A clinical T1-2 tumour (including multifocal or multicentric breast cancer)

          -  Will be or is treated with mastectomy

          -  Clinically node negative: no signs of axillary lymph node metastases at physical
             examination and preoperative axillary ultrasound (or negative cyto-/histopathology)

          -  Sentinel lymph node procedure and its pathologic evaluation should be performed
             according to the Dutch breast cancer guideline

          -  pN1mi(sn) or pN1(sn): at least one and a maximum of three axillary sentinel lymph
             nodes containing micro- and/or macrometastases

          -  Written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinically node positive pre-operative

          -  Sentinel lymph nodes only containing isolated tumour cells (&lt;0.2 mm)

          -  Solitary parasternal sentinel lymph node metastasis (pN1b)

          -  Bilateral breast cancer

          -  Irradical resection of primary tumour at time of randomization (applicable in case
             the mastectomy is performed before randomization)

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease

          -  History of invasive breast cancer

          -  Previous treatment of the axilla with surgery or radiotherapy (except surgery for
             hidradenitis suppurativa or for other superficially located skin lesions, such as
             naevi)

          -  Pregnant or nursing

          -  Other prior malignancies within the past 5 years (except successfully treated basal
             cell and squamous cell skin cancer, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or carcinoma in
             situ of the ipsilateral or contralateral breast) or unsuccessfully treated
             malignancies &gt; 5 years before randomization

          -  Unable or unwilling to give informed consent
