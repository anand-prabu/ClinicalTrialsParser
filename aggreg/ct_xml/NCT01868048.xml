    <description>At Visit 2 (i.e. prior to commencing any treatment) subjects were asked to write a brief description of their spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis and how it affected them emotionally, physically and their ability to function with day to day activities.  If subjects were unable to write due to disability then the investigator staff could assist as necessary.  Prior to answering the Subject global impression of change, subjects were given the description of their spasticity to aid their memory regarding their symptoms at the start of the study. They were then be asked to complete the global impression of change by answering the following question to be rated on a seven-point scale, &quot;Please assess the change in your spasticity due to multiple sclerosis since immediately before receiving the first course of study treatment (Visit 2) using the scale below&quot; with this anchors: Very much worse, Much worse, Minimally worse, No change, Minimally better, Much better, Very much better.</description>

          -  Willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age or older.

          -  Diagnosed with any disease sub-type of multiple sclerosis of at least six months
             duration.

          -  Spasticity due to multiple sclerosis of at least six months duration, which is not
             wholly  relieved with current anti-spasticity therapy, and which is expected to
             remain stable for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject must be receiving at least one of the following anti-spasticity therapies to
             be eligible: Baclofen, Tizanidine, Clonazepam, Diazepam, Dantrolene.

          -  Subject is willing to maintain anti-spasticity medication at a stable dose for the
             duration of the study and should be stable for 30 days prior to screening.

          -  If the subject is currently taking disease-modifying medication, this must be at a
             stable dose for at least three months prior to the screening visit; the dose must
             also remain stable for the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has previously used Nabiximols or Sativex.

          -  The subject is currently using or has used cannabis or cannabinoid based medications
             within 30 days of study entry and is unwilling to abstain for the duration of the
             study.

          -  Any history or immediate family history of schizophrenia, other psychotic illness,
             severe personality disorder or other significant psychiatric disorder other than

             abuse disorder (including opiate abuse), current heavy alcohol consumption (more than
             60g of pure alcohol per day for men, and more than 40g of pure alcohol per day for
             women), current use of an illicit drug or current non prescribed use of any
             prescription drug that should exclude the subject from participation.

             the last year).

          -  Any known or suspected hypersensitivity to cannabinoids or any of the excipients of
             the study medication.

          -  Has experienced myocardial infarction or clinically significant cardiac dysfunction
             within the last 12 months or has a cardiac disorder that, in the opinion of the
             investigator would put the subject at risk of a clinically significant arrhythmia or
             myocardial infarction.

          -  Has significantly impaired renal function as evidenced by a creatinine clearance
             lower than 50mL/min at Visit 1.

          -  Has significantly impaired hepatic function at Visit 1 (Alanine Aminotransferase &gt;5

             child-bearing potential, unless willing to ensure that they or their partner use
             effective contraception or complete abstinence, for example, oral contraception,
             double barrier or intra-uterine device, during the study and for three months
             thereafter (however, a male condom should not be used in conjunction with a female
             condom as this may not prove effective).

          -  Female subject who is pregnant, lactating or planning pregnancy during the course of
             the study and for three months thereafter.

          -  Subjects who have received a non-approved investigational medicinal product within 30

          -  Any other significant disease or disorder which, in the opinion of the investigator
             or sponsor, may either put the subject at risk because of participation in the study,
             or may influence the result of the study, or the subject's ability to participate in
             the study.

          -  Travel outside the country of residence planned during the study.

          -  Subjects previously enrolled into this study.
