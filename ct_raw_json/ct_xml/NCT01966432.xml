    <textblock>
      This add-on study of providing tobacco, alcohol and other drug screening, brief intervention
      and referral for treatment to a primary care high risk diabetic population leverages the
      existing research resources of a funded parent project &quot;Duke University CMS Innovation Award
      Southeastern Diabetes initiative (PI: Robert M. Califf, MD)&quot; to explore the feasibility of
      implementing Screening for substance use, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment
      services in Primary Care (SBIRT-PC) and to examine the effects of substance use status on
      diabetes health care outcomes. This pilot study also examines the feasibility of the CTN's
      common data element algorithms of SBIRT for illicit and nonmedical drug use in the primary
      care setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Duke University Translational Medicine Institute has received funds from the Bristol-Myers
      Squibb Foundation and the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (2012-2016) to augment
      existing standard of care for patients with diabetes in community-based medical settings in
      order to achieve goals of better health, better health care, and reduced costs (&quot;Duke
      University CMS Innovation Award Southeastern Diabetes initiative&quot;; Principal Investigator,
      Robert M. Califf, MD). Its goals are to (1) improve population-level diabetes management,
      health outcomes, and quality of life for diagnosed and undiagnosed adults living with type 2
      diabetes, (2) reduce disparities in diabetes management, health outcomes and quality of life
      for adults living with type 2 diabetes, and (3) reduce healthcare costs associated with type
      2 diabetes. This already funded diabetes care project provides a cost-effective platform for
      conducting an add-on project to examine the feasibility of the CTN's clinical decision
      support algorithms for SBIRT in primary care settings, as the study team can leverage
      existing organizational and research infrastructure to facilitate the completion of the
      study. The add-on study is supported by strong rationale, including the fact that primary
      care settings serve as common points of contact for adults and provide many opportunities to
      detect drug misuse and to intervene early in low or mild severity (better outcomes), which
      in turn may reduce substance use, increase awareness and drug-medication interactions,
      enhance patient medication adherence, and decrease high inpatient costs and repeat emergency
      department visits.
