  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and determine the maximum tolerated
      dose of TAS-102 administered in combination with CPT-11 in patients with advanced
      gastrointestinal tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, dose-escalation, Phase 1 study of TAS-102
      administered in combination with CPT-11. The study will be conducted in 2 parts: a Dose
      Escalation Phase (Part 1) to determine the maximum tolerated dose and an Expansion Phase
      (Part 2) to further evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, and preliminary efficacy of the
      maximum tolerated dose. Patients will be assigned to sequential dose-level cohorts with each
      cohort corresponding to a pre-specified dose of TAS-102 and CPT-11 combination. Escalation
      to the subsequent dose level will occur only after the previous dose level is determined to
      be safe.
