Participants will be\n      contacted at baseline and at 3-month intervals to complete telephone-administered study\n      surveys for one year.\n\n      Intervention Arm: Participants who are assigned to the intervention arm will receive a copy\n      of the NCI's \"What You Need to Know about Lung Cancer\" booklet and they will be assigned to\n      an RN-level nurse navigator. The patient navigators will contact their assigned participants\n      on at least a weekly basis. The role of the patient navigators is to: (1) help patients who\n      are newly diagnosed with early stage lung cancer schedule clinical appointments ; (2)\n      identify each patient's unique logistical and emotional needs (barriers to care) and\n      coordinate with professional staff to develop effective solutions; (3) connect patients to\n      community and social support services; (4) provide medical appointment reminders; (5)\n      accompany patients to their clinic appointments as requested; (6) reschedule appointments\n      when patients cannot keep them; (7) provide patients with sources of expert information\n      about the recommended surgical treatment; (8) guide patients through the health care system,\n      including helping them arrive at appointments on time and prepared; (9) interact with\n      patients to help them resolve financial, language, transportation, or other barriers to\n      treatment; (10) assist patients in finding ways to pay for their health care by working with\n      financial counselors at the health care site; (11) organize and coordinate patient\n      transportation services; (12) provide health education to patients about lung cancer surgery\n      and other relevant information (this may include smoking cessation services); (13) help\n      patients to access language-specific materials, (14) facilitate interaction and\n      communication with health care staff and providers; (15) use lay language to describe the\n      medical terms used by clinicians, and explain patients' concerns to their health care\n      providers so that these concerns can be addressed; (16) interact with patients' specialists\n      to relay patients' concerns about surgical resection so that they can be addressed by these\n      specialists; (17) provide support through active, empathic listening; (18) arrange for\n      patients to hear \"testimonials\" from other patients with similar racial and ethnic\n      backgrounds who had successful surgical outcomes for treatment of NSCLC and (19) respect\n      patients' medical treatment decisions.\n\n      The patient navigation intervention is standardized to ensure consistency of the\n      intervention delivery across the three intervention study sites. The navigators employ a\n      secure, web-based data management system to track the frequency, intensity, and content of\n      the navigation intervention. Information that is recorded includes the number, length, and\n      type of contact (telephone, email or in person) with each participant, and a description of\n      the barriers that were addressed. This system fosters the successful deployment of the\n      intervention in a standardized manner across the intervention sites and it identifies the\n      specific types of barriers to surgery or radiosurgery that were overcome through the\n      navigation intervention. These data will also be used to estimate the cost (using\n      time-driven, activity-based costing) and cost-effectiveness (increase in quality-adjusted\n      life years/cost) of the navigation intervention in a subsequent study. To further ensure\n      treatment fidelity, in Year the navigators participated in a 24- hour patient navigation\n      training program led by the study consultant, Dr. Beth Calhoun, who is one of the nation's\n      leading patient navigation experts, and Dr. Debbie C. Bryant, who led a successful breast\n      cancer-focused patient navigation intervention at the Medical University of South Carolina\n      MUSC Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC). In addition, the navigators participate in bi-weekly\n      teleconferences led by Dr. Ford, during which the intervention is discussed in detail and\n      training is provided in such areas as developing effective communication approaches,\n      identifying institutional and community resources, and problem-solving."
