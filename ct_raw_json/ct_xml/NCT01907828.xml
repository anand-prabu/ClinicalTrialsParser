  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this post market clinical investigation is to complete preliminary evaluation
      on whether or not concomitant renal denervation with the EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System
      and cardiac ablation will result in improved outcomes as compared to ablation alone in
      patients with uncontrolled hypertension being treated for Atrial Fibrillation
