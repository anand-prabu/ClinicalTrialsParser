However, no good\n      subjective rating scale have been developed or validated. Neither have possible\n      inter-individual differences in use of such subjective scales been described.\n\n      Purpose:\n\n      The aim of this study is to validate different subjective rating scales to determine which\n      scale is most useful among surgeons."
