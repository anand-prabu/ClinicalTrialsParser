  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project, which will innovatively combine risk factor research and evidence-based
      prevention programs, will advance knowledge on personalized approaches to prevention that
      may be able to better&quot;bend trajectories&quot; of depression that surge throughout adolescence. A
      randomized controlled trial will deliver equal doses of IPT-AST and CWS for the prevention
      of depression in adolescents. These two programs are designed to address distinct risk
      factors for depression - CWS addresses cognitive risks and IPT-AST addresses interpersonal
      risks. A total of 210 participants across two sites, University of Denver and Rutgers
      University, will be stratified on cognitive and interpersonal risk and randomized to the two
      conditions. The goals of the study are to (1) demonstrate that prevention programs can
      modify depression trajectories among youth by examining within person changes in
      trajectories over time (three years before and three years after the prevention programs)
      and by comparing trajectories of prevention youth with changes in same aged cohorts; (2)
      evaluate a personalized prevention approach to bending depression trajectories by matching
      and mismatching youth to either CWS or IPT-AST based on individual risk profiles; (3)
      examine mechanisms of bending depression trajectories and test whether the prevention
      programs operate via their hypothesized processes; and (4) explore how genetic
      susceptibility, emotion regulation, and temperament may affect individual response to
      IPT-AST and CWS. By implementing evidence-based prevention programs after 3-years of
      prospective naturalistic data collection, this study will contribute essential data on
      personalized medicine and altering developmental trajectories of first-onset depression.
