  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to investigate the impact of sugar sweetened beverages on the
      fat metabolism of healthy young men. It is well known that consumption of beverages
      sweetened with fructose is associated with different health risks such as type 2 diabetes.
      The present study has been designed to dissect differences in the metabolic pathways of
      fructose and glucose, but also metabolic adaptations during fructose, glucose and sucrose
      diets. During a period of eight weeks subjects will consume either fructose, glucose,
      sucrose or aspartame sweetened beverages or continue their usual drinking habits. During
      these eight weeks there will be different metabolic investigations using stable isotope
      tracers. First, fructose metabolism will be examined. Second, the rate of lipolysis and
      beta-oxidation will be determined. Third, the rates of fatty acid synthesis will be
      measured. During all examinations there will also be substrate- and energy-utilization
      measurements by indirect calorimetry, blood analysis and morphometric measurements. Based on
      the literature main hypotheses are: Fructose enhances de novo lipogenesis postprandially and
      also in the fasting state significantly more than glucose by enhanced expression of
      lipogenic enzymes. Fructose decreases beta oxidation via downregulation of oxidative
      enzymes. In addition, the effects of fructose consumption on the longterm memory will be
      assessed.

    <description>Measurement of lipogenesis is based on i. v. administration of stable isotope labelled acetate (1,2-13C-acetate). 13C incorporation into palmitate is quantified by mass-spectrometry. 13C incorporation correlates to the rate of fatty acid synthesis.</description>
