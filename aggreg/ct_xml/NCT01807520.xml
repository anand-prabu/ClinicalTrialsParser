    <time_frame>Baseline, 16 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary endpoint is percentage change from baseline in Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) score at 16 weeks of study treatment. The NAPSI score will be determined using all 10 fingers on a 0-80 point scale.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (NAPSI) is an instrument to assess psoriatic nail involvement in nail psoriasis. Secukinumab will be compared with placebo by visit up to week 16 in terms of percentage change in the NAPSI score. All 10 fingernails is evaluated to determine the efficacy of secukinumab 150 mg and secukinumab 300 mg as assessed by NAPSI over time up to 16 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and over time up to 80 weeks.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: change in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index 75 (PASI75) and change in Investigator Global Assessment (IGA mod 2011) over time up to 16 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and over time up to 80 weeks</measure>
    <time_frame>16 weeks, 80 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The PASI score is derived by assessing separately for erythema, thickening, and scaling in the head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs. The IGA mod 2011 is conducted for overall psoriatic disease. A subject is considered a IGA responder if a score of 0 or 1 is achieved and improved by at least 2 points on the IGA scale at a given time point compared to baseline. The efficacy of secukinumab150 mg and 300 mg is assessed by PASI 75 response and IGA mod 2011 response by visit at 16 weeks of treatment compared to placebo and over time up to 80 weeks.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Adverse events, safety labs, ECG, and vital signs will be used to measure and evaluate safety and tolerability of subjects who took at least one dose of study treatment.</description>

          -  Subjects who have ongoing use of prohibited treatments (e.g. topical or systemic
             corticosteroids (CS), UV therapy)

          -  Subjects who have been exposed to secukinumab or any other biologic drug directly
             targeting IL-17 or IL-17 Receptor

          -  Subjects who have received any investigational drugs within 4 weeks of study drug
             initiation or within a period of 5 half-lives of the investigational treatment,
