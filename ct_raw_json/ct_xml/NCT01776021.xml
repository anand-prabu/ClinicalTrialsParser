      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of a cranberry juice beverage on rates
      of  Urinary tract infection (UTI) recurrence in women with a history of UTI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are the second most common infection of any organ system and
      the most common urological disease in the United States, with a total annual cost of more
      than $3.5 billion. Although UTIs can occur in both men and women, they are about 50 times
      more common in adult women than adult men. It is estimated that 25% of women diagnosed with
      a primary UTI will suffer a recurrence within two to three months. While no universal
      definition has been accepted, recurrent UTI is usually defined as three episodes in the last
      12 months or two episodes in the last six months following initial infection. In an
      estimated 75 to 95% of cases of uncomplicated UTI, Escherichia coli (E. coli) is the
      underlying cause.

      Cranberries have historically been associated with urinary tract health, but only recently
      has the biologic plausibility of cranberry use in the prevention of UTI been addressed.
      Current research suggests that A-type proanthocyanidins, a specific class of polyphenolic
      compounds found uniquely abundant in cranberries, inhibit adhesion of bacteria (including
      multidrug resistant E.coli) to cultured epithelial cells of the urinary tract.

      This study will compare the effects of a cranberry juice beverage vs placebo on rates of UTI
      recurrence in women with a history of UTI.
