  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An ADE is defined as harm caused by a drug or the inappropriate use of a drug. Retrospective
      record reviews in several countries have shown that anticoagulants frequently lead to
      hospital readmissions. In this study a hospital readmission is defined as an admission to
      the emergency department of the Jessa hospital. The objective of this study is to determine
      the incidence of one week and 30-day readmissions caused by (preventable) ADE's due to
      anticoagulants.
