  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The depth of neuromuscular blockade (NMB) during surgery may cause a clinical dilemma
      between optimal surgical conditions and the risk of postoperative residual blockade.

      The aim of the study is to investigate if intense NMB improves surgical conditions during
      operation in patients scheduled for elective open upper abdominal surgery.
