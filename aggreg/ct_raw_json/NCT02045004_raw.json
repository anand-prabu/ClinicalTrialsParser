            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Anesthesia care for elective surgery of patients that are in their seventies or eighties is\n      an ever-growing entity in clinical practice, given the demographic development in many\n      countries of the Western world. Cognitive decline of variable degree is frequently observed\n      after major surgery in elderly patients. A potential association between anesthesia and the\n      development of dementia and brain atrophy in elderly patients is controversial. However, it\n      is not uncommon that during preoperative visits by the anesthesiologist, patients express\n      fear to suffer some sort of cognitive decline after the operation, and raise concerns about\n      psychological or neurological long-term adverse effects (e.g. memory loss) related to\n      anesthesia. Clinicians have identified this problem decades ago, and are adding\n      postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) to the list of frequent complications of\n      anesthesia in elderly patients; yet, there is a lack of prospective clinical data and poor\n      understanding of the pathophysiology of POCD, and no preventive strategy or treatment has\n      been described so far.\n\n      One study reported an incidence of postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) of 41% in\n      surgical patients 60 years of age, or older. In a previous study conducted by our group, as\n      many as 47% of patients over 65 years presented with POCD one week after surgery. In many\n      patients, this is a transient problem, but some patients retain permanent deficits, with\n      increased mortality and important consequences on the socioeconomic situation. An\n      association between surgery and long-term cognitive decline has not been established yet;\n      however, patients who develop postoperative delirium (a transient, but particularly severe\n      form of POCD) have an increased risk of developing dementia in the years following surgery.\n      However, in a cohort follow-up study, the diagnosis of POCD itself did not represent a\n      significant risk factor for dementia. The pathophysiology of postoperative cognitive decline\n      remains unclear. However, studies in animals have shown that the systemic inflammatory\n      response elicited by the surgical procedure is associated with microglial activation and\n      postoperative cognitive impairment. Furthermore, volatile anesthetics have been shown to be\n      neurotoxic in cell cultures, and in some animal experiments exposure to clinical\n      concentrations of volatile anesthetics was associated with postoperative cognitive decline.\n      A recent retrospective analysis of cohort data suggests that surgery may be associated with\n      a decrease in brain volume in patients. However, due to methodological limitations in this\n      study, no analysis of a potential link between atrophy and cognitive functions was made.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      Prospective cohort study\n\n      Study Groups:\n\n      Two groups of patients will be investigated. Seventy patients undergoing major surgical\n      procedures will be recruited for this study, and 30 healthy study participants (no surgical\n      intervention) will be recruited to serve as controls. In all patients, baseline cognitive\n      functions and structural MRI imaging including determination of gray matter volumes relevant\n      for cognitive functions (hippocampus) will be performed.\n\n        -  Group 1:  Surgery group Sevoflurane (n = 70)\n\n        -  Group 2:  Control group (n = 30)\n\n      Recruitment:\n\n      Study participants of the Surgery group Sevoflurane (Group 1) will be recruited as patients\n      of the Basel University Hospital, a tertiary medical care center in Basel, Switzerland,\n      associated with the University of Basel, Switzerland. Study participants of the Control\n      group (Group 2) will be recruited randomly.\n\n      Endpoints:\n\n      Targeted primary endpoint of the study is the difference in change of hippocampal volume\n      over time between patients with POCD and patients without POCD.\n\n      Secondary endpoint is the correlation between change in cerebral volume and change in\n      cognitive function.\n\n      Anesthetic Management:\n\n      Anesthesia will be standardized (general anesthesia using sevoflurane and fentanyl for\n      maintenance, thiopental for induction and atracurium or rocuronium for neuromuscular\n      blockade). Intraoperatively, the dose of anesthetics will be controlled using an EEG derived\n      index (depth of anesthesia monitoring (Bispectral Index (BIS), Aspect Medical Systems), and\n      end-tidal sevoflurane concentration monitoring). Furthermore, intraoperative bilateral\n      cerebral near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) monitoring (NIRO-200, Hamamatsu Photonics, Japan)\n      will be applied. Data will be downloaded directly from the monitors and the anesthesia\n      machine (Dr\u00e4ger Perseus) using ICM+ software.\n\n      Neuropsychological Assessment:\n\n      The cognitive assessment test battery CERAD-Plus consistent of the Consortium to Establish a\n      Registry for Alzheimer's Disease - Neuropsychological Assessment Battery (CERAD-NAB), Trail\n      Making Tests A+B, and phonetic fluency (s-words), as well as the Test for Attentional\n      Performance (TAP) developed to analyze different aspects of attention, will be performed\n      preoperatively, at 7 days, 3 month and 12 months postoperatively. Training of all study\n      personnel and supervision of cognitive testing will be carried out by the Memory Clinic at\n      Basel University Hospital. Cognitive functions will be quantified using the CERAD total\n      score, in its demographically corrected form. A correction for short-term practice effects\n      will be carried out based on previous work.\n\n      Blood Samples:\n\n      Blood samples will be taken from study participants preoperatively, 12h postoperatively, and\n      on day 2 and 7, to determine levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor\n      necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Blood samples will be stored for 1 year to allow\n      additional determinations.\n\n      Demographic, Procedural and Subjective Patient Data:\n\n        -  Age, sex, and years of education.\n\n        -  Cognitive testing as outlined: CERAD-Plus (CERAD-NAB, Trail Making Tests A+B, phonetic\n           fluency (s-words)), Test for Attentional Performance (TAP), preoperatively, at 7 days,\n           3 months and 12 months postoperatively.\n\n        -  Charlson Comorbidity Score preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year postoperatively\n\n        -  Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year\n           postoperatively.\n\n        -  Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year\n           postoperatively.\n\n        -  Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) preoperatively, at 3 months and 1 year\n           postoperatively.\n\n        -  ASA physical status, type and duration of anesthesia, type and duration of surgery.\n\n        -  Postoperative delirium (Confusion Assessment Method; CAM), repeat surgery and\n           postoperative infections.\n\n        -  Subjective grading of cognitive functions on a VAS scale (0-10) preoperatively, at 7\n           days, 3 months and 1 year postoperatively.\n\n        -  Subjective grading of change in cognitive functions on a five-point Likert scale (much\n           worse, worse, equal, better, much better) at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year\n           postoperatively.\n\n        -  Subjective grading of successful surgery (Yes/No) at 7 days, 3 months and 1 year\n           postoperatively.\n\n        -  Subjective grading of pain on a VAS scale (0-10) preoperatively, 7 days, 3 months and 1\n           year postoperatively.\n\n      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI):\n\n      MRI will be performed preoperatively, at 3 month, and at 12 months postoperatively on the\n      same day as cognitive function testing. Training of all study personnel and MRI evaluation,\n      and/or supervision of MRI evaluation, will be carried out by the Division of Neuroradiology\n      at Basel University Hospital. Imaging will be performed using the institutional SIEMENS 3T\n      TimTrio\u2122 MRI scanner. The imaging sequence used is the whole brain quantitative MRI protocol\n      comprised multi-parameter mapping based on 3D Fast Low Angle Shot (FLASH) MRI at 1 mm\n      isotropic resolution (clinical standard at the University Hospital Basel). For our initial\n      MRI analysis, we will assume that the same regions are relevant as those described in mild\n      cognitive impairment (MCI) and Alzheimer's disease (AD), and a region of interest (ROI)\n      analysis will be performed. In a second step, we will perform a whole brain analysis.\n\n      For multi-parameter mapping, 3 multi-echo datasets will be acquired with T1-, PD-, and\n      MT-weighting imposed by the choice of repetition time (TR) and flip angle (T1: 18.7 ms/20\u00b0;\n      PD and MT: 23.7 ms/6\u00b0), and by applying an off-resonance Gaussian-shaped radio frequency\n      (RF) pulse (4 ms duration, 220\u00b0 nominal flip angle, 2 kHz frequency offset) prior to\n      nonselective excitation, respectively. Alternating gradient echoes are acquired at 6\n      equidistant echo times (TE) between 2.2 ms and 14.7 ms for the T1- and MT-weighted\n      acquisitions and at 8 equidistant TE between 2.2 ms and 19.7 ms for the PD-weighted\n      acquisition. A high readout bandwidth (BW) = 425 Hz/pixel is used to minimize off-resonance\n      artifacts. To speed up data acquisition, Generalized Autocalibrating Partially Parallel\n      Acquisitions (GRAPPA) imaging with an acceleration factor of two is applied in the\n      phase-encoding (anterior-posterior) direction and 6/8 partial Fourier in the partition\n      (left-right) direction. The total acquisition time for the 3 FLASH datasets is approximately\n      20 min. The rationale and detailed design criteria for the protocol were previously\n      published. The multi-parameter mapping provides better sensitivity over the classically used\n      T1-weighted imaging. The main advantage is that it allows quantitative assessment of changes\n      in myelin content, tissue water and iron (transferrin, ferritin).\n\n      Statistical Analysis:\n\n      All MRI image pre-processing and analyses will be conducted with the Statistical Parametric\n      Mapping software SPM8. Multivariate analyses will be conducted with the Multivariate Methods\n      (MM) toolbox for SPM8. Comparisons (preoperatively to 3 months postoperatively) of\n      hippocampal volume and the results of voxel-based volumetry of the medio-temporal lobe and\n      lateral association areas of the temporal and parietal lobes will be performed using ROI\n      analysis. The quantitative imaging results will be correlated to the CERAD-Plus total score\n      performance obtained on the same day as the scans. The relationship of changes in volume (if\n      present) with intraoperative depth of anesthesia (BIS) and the administered dose of\n      sevoflurane expressed as age-corrected minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) equivalent\n      multiplied by time of administration will be calculated. The relationship between changes in\n      gray matter volume (if present) determined by voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and peak values\n      (on postoperative day 2) of inflammatory markers (CRP, IL-6, TNF-alpha) will be determined.\n      We will also use multivariate approaches (voxel-wise multivariate analysis (MANOVA) and\n      classification/prediction procedure) on multi-parameter MRI data in order to build optimal\n      composite predictors of patients' neuropsychological outcomes. In whole brain analysis, we\n      will use a multiple regression and repeated measures ANOVA whole brain voxel-wise analyses\n      in SPM8 to correlate the estimated modulated gray matter volume with the neuropsychological\n      scores.\n\n      Sample Size Calculation:\n\n      Assuming that 41% of operated patients develop POCD, and a standard deviation of the\n      hippocampal volume change of 0.45 in both patients with POCD and without POCD, a total\n      sample size of 56 subjects may detect a difference of 0.4 mm3 in hippocampal volume with a\n      power of 90% at a two-sided significance level of 5%. To compensate for the high loss to\n      follow-up which is unfortunately typical for studies on POCD, and estimated at 20%, we will\n      recruit 70 patients in the surgery group."
