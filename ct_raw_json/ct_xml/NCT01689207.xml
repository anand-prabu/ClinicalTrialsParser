  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, 3-part study designed to investigate the safety and
      tolerability of ATM-AVI.  The study aims to characterise the pharmacokinetics of ATM-AVI,
      when both drugs are administered alone (ATM or AVI) and in combination (ATM-AVI), following
      single administration, and following multiple administrations of ATM-AVI in healthy male and
      female (females of nonchildbearing potential) volunteers both young and elderly.
