  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients treated with Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) or direct oral anticoagulants as
      Rivaroxaban, Apixaban, Edoxaban or Dabigatran, who experience severe bleeding and/or need
      urgent interventions/operations that cannot wait are included in this registry, when they
      receive intervention with a reversal agent (e.g. PCC, aPCC; rVIIa and/or hemodialysis (for
      removal of dabigatran)).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Registry will offer the opportunity to evaluate the effects of reversal agents as PCC,
      aPCC, rVIIa in e.g. severe bleeding patients treated with oral anticoagulants.

      By collecting case reports from several university hospitals and clinics, different
      treatment strategies in clinical practice will be observed and evaluated, and may serve as a
      comprehensive information resource for the safe management with DOA, but also with the
      long-term anticoagulation based on coumarin derivatives in the near future.

      The current objective of this registry is to:

        1. Document the clinical course and outcome of various clinical bleeding events associated
           with DOA or VKA in patients with severe life-threatening bleeding making intervention
           necessary

        2. Document the clinical course and outcome of urgent surgical interventions within 24
           hours after admission in patients under DOA or VKA treatment.

        3. Characterisation of therapeutic strategies in stopping acute life-threatening bleeding
           including following agents and methods:

             1. blood transfusion,

             2. platelet concentrates

             3. reversal agents [e.g. vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated
                PCC (aPCC), activated factor VII (aVII), fibrinogen concentrate, fresh frozen
                plasma (FFP)]

             4. haemodialysis

             5. desmopressin

             6. tranexamic acid

             7. no specific treatment in respect to the above mentioned treatments (e.g. stop of
                medication and waiting until anticoagulant effect of DOA is decreased).
