Regular pain relief is\n             not permitted and subjects must not take any analgesics in the 24 hours preceding any\n             clinic visit.\n\n          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who, for the duration of the study, are\n             either unwilling or unable to take adequate contraceptive precautions or are\n             unwilling to be sexually abstinent.\n\n          -  Pregnancy or lactating mother."
