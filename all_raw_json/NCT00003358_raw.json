Determine the maximum tolerated dose of intraperitoneal (IP) gemcitabine\n      given in combination with IP cisplatin in patients with refractory or recurrent ovarian\n      epithelial, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. II. Determine the safety of this\n      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of IP gemcitabine\n      administered with IP cisplatin.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive intraperitoneal\n      cisplatin on day 1 plus intraperitoneal gemcitabine on days 1, 8, and 15. No treatment will\n      be given on day 22. Courses are repeated every 4 weeks. Patients receive up to 4 courses of\n      therapy. Dose escalation of gemcitabine continues in cohorts of 3 patients until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 2 years, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
