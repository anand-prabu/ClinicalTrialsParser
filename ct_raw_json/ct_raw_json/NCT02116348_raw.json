Associated disabilities as mental\n      retardation, delayed speech development add psychological burden of the disease on the\n      family as well as economic burden.\n\n      Mental retardation is the major problem in children with cerebral palsy. Improving mental\n      development will have a positive effect on quality of life for the child and his family.\n      Treating associated impairments (mental retardation) with Cerebrolysin will improve mental\n      development and quality of life, and will decrease the economic burden in children with\n      cerebral palsy."
