In the\n      literature and in our recent study (evaluation of the pain in the disease of CMT - Reference\n      center of the neuromuscular diseases - CHU Bow) the frequency of the pain is important\n      varying from 66 to 96 % cases, affecting especially hands and lower limbs. The care of the\n      pain in the Charcot syndrome Marie Tooth is not codified. The transcutaneous\n      neurostimulation(TENS) is a not medicinal and not invasive therapeutics, without any brought\n      back collateral effect, used at the same time in the chronic pain and acute since 1960, as\n      well for the neuropathic pains that musculo-scrawny. No study was realized this day on the\n      use of the TENS with analgesic aim in the CMT. We suggest studying the analgesic efficiency\n      of the TENS in the Charcot syndrome Marie Tooth on the pains of lower limbs, the most\n      frequent painful location in our recent works.\n\n      The main objective will be to analyze the improvement of the pain of lower limbs, based on\n      the decrease of the analogical visual scale(ladder) (EVA), at least 30 %.\n\n      The secondary objectives will be to estimate repercussions on the functional capacities (\n      ONLS), the quality of life (SF(sci-fi) 12), the satisfaction (EVA), the global\n      impression(printing) of change ( PGIC), the consumption of analgesic, DN4, NPSI (Neuropathic\n      Pain Symptom Inventory), Concise Questionnaire of the Pains ( QCD), HAD (Hospital Anxiety\n      and Depression scale)."
