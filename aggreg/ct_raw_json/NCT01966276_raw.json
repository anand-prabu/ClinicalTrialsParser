In other words, therapeutic dosages of\n      micronutrients are provided to support the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and immune\n      systems to a level at which a lower than customary dosage of methylphenidate can produce\n      positive clinical effects on CFS symptoms and also be well tolerated.\n\n      Methylphenidate is the generic form of Ritalin\u00ae. The dose being tested in this study is\n      relatively low (5-10mg twice daily). This drug has been in clinical use for over 50 years\n      for the treatment of Narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder and has a well-described\n      safety profile when used as recommended. Methylphenidate alone has been studied as a\n      treatment for CFS in the past and has been shown to produce mild benefits and be\n      well-tolerated. When provided as innovative therapy, methylphenidate plus this CFS Nutrient\n      Formula has produced substantial improvements in CFS symptoms in a limited number of\n      patients, and demonstrated excellent tolerability.\n\n      Use of low dose methylphenidate hydrochloride coadministered with a CFS Nutrient Formula has\n      not been previously evaluated in a controlled clinical study. The risk to patients using\n      this combination is believed to be low, especially in the context of a well-controlled\n      clinical study. Furthermore, this combination is not expected to increase the incidence or\n      severity of adverse events associated with methylphenidate hydrochloride."
