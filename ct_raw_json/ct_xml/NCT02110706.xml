  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific primary objective of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and
      beneficial therapeutic for Myasthenia Gravis (MG) that warrants further study in a phase III
      efficacy trial.

      Investigators plan on conducting a multicenter randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled
      Phase II clinical trial utilizing a futility design. The study would include acetylcholine
      receptor (AChR) antibody positive generalized MG subjects. This study also presents a unique
      opportunity to study both drug and disease mechanisms because unlike many other autoimmune
      diseases in which rituximab has been used, MG affords the investigation of antigen-specific
      components that participate in the immunopathology of the disease, namely autoantibodies,
      autoantibody-producing B cells, and antigen-specific T cells. This work will further our
      understanding of MG immunopathology and it represents the first step toward gaining a more
      complete understanding of the immune mechanisms underlying treatment of MG with rituximab
      leading to new ways to treat the disease.

      The specific aim of this study is to determine whether rituximab is a safe and effective
      treatment for subjects with MG.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects 21 to 90 years old

          -  Subjects must have MGFA MG grades 2, 3, or 4 generalized MG, according to the MGFA
             classification system. These grades correspond to mild (2), moderate (3), and severe
             (4).

          -  Elevated AChR antibody titer

          -  Subject's signs and symptoms should not be better explained by another disease
             process.

          -  Prednisone dose of at least 15 mg/day (or the equivalent in alternate days) and the

          -  No history of thymoma, tumor, infection, or interstitial lung disease on chest CT,
             MRI, or chest x-ray. Note: Chest x-ray will be completed at screening to look of
             interstitial lung disease.  A chest CT or MRI to evaluate for thymoma must be
             completed as part of prescreening.

          -  Able and willing to give written informed consent and comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol.

          -  Subjects must be able to give written informed consent before participating in this
             study. A copy of the signed consent must be kept in the subject's medical record.

          -  Men and women of reproductive potential must agree to use an acceptable method of
             birth control during treatment and for twelve months (1 year) after completion of
             treatment.

             that can produce weakness or fatigue.
