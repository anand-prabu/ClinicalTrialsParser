Furthermore, it is\n      unclear whether women with prepartum dyspareunia experience an improvement following vaginal\n      delivery. While physicians may expect that vaginal birth improves dyspareunia due to the\n      stretching effect on pelvic floor, to date, there is insufficient evidence to support this\n      claim. The Investigators plan to prospectively study 200 patients at our Institution,\n      collect information regarding birth and follow them, via questionnaires, regarding their\n      dyspareunia postpartum."
