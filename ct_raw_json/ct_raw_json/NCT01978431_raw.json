Mean inter-infusion intervals (time between cocaine boluses) are then averaged by adding all intervals within each session and dividing by 60. Intervals during which pump access is withheld (due to increase in vital signs) will be excluded. Data on cocaine self-administration (total number of responses, infusions, and III), subjective effects, and vital signs will be checked for normality prior to analysis using Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistics and normal probability plots.
