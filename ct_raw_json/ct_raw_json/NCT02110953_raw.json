Irinotecan-eluting beads are tiny beads that\n      have been loaded with irinotecan hydrochloride, a chemotherapy drug. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as irinotecan hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of\n      tumor cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. This treatment\n      delivers the chemotherapy directly to the tumor area inside the liver instead of to the\n      whole body as with systemic delivery of the drug. Irinotecan-eluting beads may work better\n      that standard chemotherapy in treating patients with colon or rectal cancer that has spread\n      to the liver."
