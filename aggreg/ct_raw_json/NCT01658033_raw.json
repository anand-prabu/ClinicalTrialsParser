Avastin is a target therapy with proven efficacy in the\n      treatment of MBC. Avastin plus FOLFOX regimen showed synergetic effet and been used as the\n      standard trial in metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Based on the above reason, we\n      initiate this phase II study to evaluate efficacy and safety of avastin plus modified\n      FOLFOX6 regimen in HER-2 negative metastatic breast cancer patients."
