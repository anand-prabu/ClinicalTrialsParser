The HR option will demand a significant amount of physical\n      effort and will be paired up with a large reward as opposed to the LR option which will be\n      less demanding physically and paired up with a small reward. The assignment will be carried\n      out using a hand held dynamometer which measures the power produced by the participants'\n      upper extremity.\n\n      We propose that a child with ADHD will choose a task that involves less effort despite the\n      small reward tied to it compared to a control child who will choose the more demanding task\n      and the larger reward."
