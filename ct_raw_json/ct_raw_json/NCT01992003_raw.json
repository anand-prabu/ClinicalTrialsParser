The Butterfly Sensor will be connected to the 3rd or 4th finger on\n           either the right or left hand.\n\n        -  Masimo Pronto-7\u2122 intermittent hemoglobin monitoring The Masimo Pronto-7\u2122 is a\n           hand-held, noninvasive device used for intermittent measuring of blood hemoglobin. The\n           device is connected to a re-usable sensor which is clipped onto a finger for quick\n           spot-check readings. A reading from the Pronto-7 will  be taken immediately before\n           surgery.\n\n        -  Blood sampling for hemoglobin determination For the study, about a \u00bd tsp of blood will\n           be collected from the arterial line placed for the purpose of surgery approximately\n           every hour during the surgery to obtain a hemoglobin measurement to be analyzed in the\n           UCSF Clinical Lab."
