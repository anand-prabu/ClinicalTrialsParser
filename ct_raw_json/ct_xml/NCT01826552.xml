      The purpose of this multicenter, randomized, open label, parallel arm study whether the
      newest 3rd generation stent - Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent is noninferior to the
      newest 2nd generation stent - Resolute Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent in terms of 9
      months in-stent late lumen loss. 345 Korean patients with a wide variety of coronary heart
      disease will be enrolled to this &quot;all-comers&quot; trial to give definite answer to the above
      hypothesis that is urgently needed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rate of restenosis after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has dramatically
      decreased since the introduction of drug-eluting stents (DES). However, restenosis still
      remains a problem and some papers reported that the rate of restenosis can even go up to
      nearly 20% after the first-generation DES implantation, depending on the complexity of
      target lesion. Furthermore, there arises a concern about thrombogenic risk of these DES at
      the expense of reduced restenosis. Therefore, works aiming to reduce both restenosis and
      thrombosis are on-going, and there has been a rush of various second-generation DES with
      &quot;biocompatible but non-absorbable polymer&quot; and third-generation DES with &quot;bioabsorbable
      polymer&quot;.

      Recently, Orsiro hybrid sirolimus-eluting stent (Orsiro SES, Biotronik AG, Bulach,
      Switzeland) has been developed. It has a unique hybrid combination of polymers coated on
      thin cobalt-chromium struts (60um). The BIOlute® active component is a bioabsorbable polymer
      matrix combined with an anti-proliferative drug, sirolimus, and elutes the drug in a
      controlled manner after implantation, degrades over time and leaves only the PROBIO® coated
      stent behind in the long-term. The PROBIO® passive coating encapsulates the stent and
      protects interaction between the metal stent and the surrounding tissue. Although Orsiro SES
      showed excellent results in terms of late lumen loss at 9 months in first-in-man single arm
      trial (BIOFLOW-I trial), randomized controlled trials evaluating its efficacy and safety are
      limited to date.

      The ORIENT Trial will evaluate the angiographic and clinical outcomes of the innovative
      third-generation DES, Orsiro SES, compared with the latest second-generation DES, Resolute
      Integrity zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES-I, Medtronic Cardiovascular, Santa Rosa,
      California, USA), for treatment of patients with coronary artery disease.
