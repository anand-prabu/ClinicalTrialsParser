Lung function will be assessed as it\n      provides an objective measure to support the subjective patient reported outcomes of SGRQ\n      and rescue medication use. The study is intended to provide additional evidence to support\n      the use of UMEC/VI for the maintenance treatment of COPD Approximately 496 subjects will be\n      randomized from approximately 62 centers in order to ensure 422 subjects complete 12 weeks\n      of treatment. Eligible subjects will be randomized to UMEC/VI 62.5/25mcg or placebo in a 1:1\n      ratio. All treatments will be administered once-daily in the morning via a Dry Powder\n      Inhaler (DPI).\n\n      There will be a total of 5 clinic visits. The total duration of study participation will be\n      approximately 15 weeks.  All subjects will be provided with albuterol/salbutamol to use as\n      needed for the relief of COPD symptoms throughout the run-in and double-blind treatment\n      periods."
