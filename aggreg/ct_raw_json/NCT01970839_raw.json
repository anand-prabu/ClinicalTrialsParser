There is some scientific evidence from animal studies demonstrating\n      that prolonged tourniquet application can result in lack of oxygen supply to nerves, and\n      subsequent nerve damage resulting in chronic pain. This theory has not been proven in\n      humans. In this study the investigators will indirectly assess the evidence for\n      abnormalities caused by tourniquet application on subjects' nerves using well established\n      devices to determine the function of these nerves."
