The ideal stimulation regimen\n      for poor responders is currently unknown.\n\n      Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) has been reported to improve pregnancy chances for poor\n      responders, and is now utilized by approximately one third of all IVF centers world-wide.\n      However, the current clinical evidence for DHEA on improvement of ovarian response and IVF\n      outcome is insufficient. The validity of the results of the former studies, especially the\n      varied inclusion criteria used to specify poor responders, is a subject of debate. Recently\n      a uniform definition on poor ovarian response, the Bologna criteria, has been proposed by\n      the European Society for Human Reproduction and Embryology(ESHRE). However, no studies have\n      been performed study to evaluate the potential effects of DHEA supplementation according to\n      these standards.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of DHEA supplementation on IVF outcome of\n      poor ovarian responders that fulfill the Bologna criteria."
