To compare the treatment groups with respect to improvement in physical fitness\n           outcomes, including: (a) health behaviors (engagement in exercise and diet changes);\n           and (b) indicators of physical fitness.\n\n        2. To compare the treatment groups with respect to improvements in mental health outcomes,\n           including negative symptoms, depression, and self-efficacy.\n\n        3. To explore differences in the treatment groups with respect to psychosocial\n           functioning, health status, and acute service use, and the effects of selected\n           demographic, clinical, and health behavior variables on primary outcomes."

Despite\n      greater costs and adverse outcomes associated with the combination of mental illness and\n      poor physical health, little attention has been paid to the development of health promotion\n      interventions designed to address the needs of the high-risk group of people with SMI. This\n      study is testing an innovative approach to reducing these problems and developing a program\n      that will potentially have a downstream effect on early mortality for the vulnerable\n      population of people with SMI."
