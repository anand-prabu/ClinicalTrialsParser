            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicities of\n      gemcitabine in combination with oxaliplatin in patients with advanced malignancies. II.\n      Determine the pharmacokinetics of oxaliplatin and gemcitabine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive\n      oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine in combination\n      with a fixed dose of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The\n      MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
