            "textblock": "The current study attempts to utilize deep brain stimulation of the periaqueductal grey\n      (PAG) for diminution of both neuropathic and nociceptive pain in spinal cord injury\n      patients. Likewise, the study will look at the effects on autonomic function as well. Deep\n      brain stimulation, as a treatment, has gained widespread use for the treatment of various\n      movement disorders. It is currently approved for use by the FDA for treatment of Parkinsons\n      Disease, Essential Tremor, and Dystonia. Over 100,000 implants have been performed worldwide\n      for these indications. The safety profile is well defined.\n\n      Pain is a tremendous burden for those who suffer with SCI. Persistent pain below or at the\n      injury level is experienced in 2/3rd of chronic SCI patients. As a result of this pain at\n      least 1/3rd of this sub-population faces a severely reduced quality of life; some\n      authorities consider this rate to be much higher, based on surveyed pain ratings. It was\n      reported that 23% of a sample patients with cervical or high thoracic SCI and 37% with low\n      thoracic or lumbosacral SCI would sacrifice sexual, bowel and bladder function for good pain\n      relief.\n\n      SCI pain is typically a mixture of nociceptive pain, which is caused by activation of\n      primary afferents' receptors, and neuropathic pain, which is caused by damage to the nervous\n      system. Neuropathic pain of SCI is most frequently treated by anticonvulsant agents. There\n      is good evidence from randomized control trials for some degree of effectiveness of\n      gabapentin and pregabalin, with weaker evidence for valproic acid. Tricyclic antidepressants\n      are also used to control SCI pain, but the supporting evidence is not as strong. Thus\n      amitriptyline has proved somewhat effective when the patient is depressed, but trazodone was\n      reported not to reduce post-SCI neuropathic pain more than placebo. Traditional analgesics\n      are also useful. Morphine can provide effective relief of neuropathic pain due to SCI, and\n      can be combined with the alpha-2 agonist clonidine for this purpose. Subarachnoid or\n      epidural lidocaine has been used to obtain short-term relief. For the musculoskeletal pain\n      in SCI, which nociceptive, antispasticity agents are frequently used; intrathecal baclofen,\n      for example, can be fairly effective. Despite this considerable range of choices,\n      pharmacological treatment for the pain of SCI remains inadequate. Low effectiveness,\n      tolerance, side effects or difficulties with prolonged local administration (e.g., subdural)\n      are among problems encountered.\n\n      Due to the combination of severity of chronic pain SCI patients are faced with and the\n      inadequate medical treatments available that this study is pertinent. Although, prior\n      attempts at clinical studies to show efficacy of DBS for pain have essentially failed, the\n      Investigators believe this current protocol offers some unique aspects. Likewise, as\n      mentioned earlier, both neuropathic and nociceptive pain related to SCI is devastating for\n      those afflicted. The Investigators have performed a detailed literature search and reviewed\n      all papers related to DBS and pain. To date there has been very few studies looking at DBS\n      for pain. Of those papers, the etiology of pain was very variable with only a small subset\n      related to spinal cord injury. Of the papers, including spinal cord injury none were well\n      controlled and even fewer reported detailed outcomes, other than to say there was no pain\n      control. Also of importance was that none of those studies truly looked at the effects of\n      chronic stimulation on pain control. This is to say, that each paper had as a criteria, that\n      the patient felt immediate relief of pain at the time of surgery or else the leads were\n      removed and no further stimulation was given. Most papers to date do not detail the outcome\n      measures used to determine pain relief. There are various pain scales that can be used to\n      determine level of pain control, some more accurate than others. Our study will also look at\n      the effects of alternating stimulation parameters on a monthly basis from therapeutic\n      stimulation parameters to sub-therapeutic parameters in a double blinded fashion (patient\n      and examiner). This method of evaluation will give us a unique way to evaluate pain control\n      yet to be performed in any of these prior studies. Likewise, the Investigators will also\n      evaluate the subject's ability to decrease both antiepileptic drugs as well as narcotics as\n      DBS progresses.\n\n      For the reasons above, the Investigators feel our study is different from those of the past.\n      The Investigators believe that due to the severity of the problem and lack of effective\n      therapeutic options combined with the less than stringent studies to date that our study\n      should be done. The Investigators realize that prior attempts at pain control with DBS have\n      been lackluster. However, our study is not only based on prior clinical attempts but also on\n      basic science research from the Miami Project to Cure Paralysis. These studies performed by\n      Dr. Ian Hentall (co-investigator) suggest strongly that stimulation of the periaqueductal\n      grey on a chronic basis is effective for pain control. Likewise, they suggest a beneficial\n      effect on autonomic dysreflexia, a potentially life threatening complication of SCI, as\n      well. As a result, our study will also focus on evaluating the effects of DBS on autonomic\n      dysreflexia with very stringent outcome measures, another unique aspect of this study. There\n      is also data in humans to suggest that the PAG is a central control center for autonomic\n      function.\n\n      Key Points:\n\n      Primary Rationale\n\n        1. Need. Many patients with chronic neuropathic pain due to spinal cord injury (SCI)\n           experience long-term suffering and have no recourse to adequate alternative therapy.\n           Analgesic drugs are at best of weak or inconsistent efficacy for a given patient and\n           can produce serious side effects at typical doses. This clinical trial is therefore\n           qualitatively different from trials comparing some improved drug (etc.) with a\n           currently used one.\n\n        2. Prospects. Pain of many types is responsive acutely to stimulation in the\n           periaqueductal/periventricular gray region (PAG/PVG; our anatomical target). There is a\n           large confirmatory literature on this in both animals and man, going back 3-4 decades.\n           A review analyzing PAG/PVG stimulation in prior clinical studies for all types of\n           drug-refractory pain uncovered 148 cases with a 79.1% success rate after lead\n           internalization.\n\n        3. Clinical evidence. With regard to acute relief of chronic SCI pain by DBS in PAG/PVG,\n           the Investigators believe that useful evidence is non-existent at present, but that the\n           benefits of PAG/PVG stimulation for other kinds of pain strongly justify a targeted\n           evaluation. In the above-cited 2005 meta-analysis, pain originating from spinal cord\n           injury was identified in 10 cases and leads were internalized in 7 of these cases, of\n           which 5 showed good long-term pain relief. Unfortunately, it is impossible to tell from\n           the cases described in the original articles, many from the 1970s, whether the sensory\n           thalamus (a different brain region, probably less appropriate) or the PAG/PVG or both\n           were stimulated. Moreover, the clinical literature on DBS for SCI pain rarely describes\n           the type of injury (segmental level, completeness, age or onset, etc.) and often\n           includes non-typical SCI in its summary categories (e.g., root avulsion, myelopathy).\n           Because of the conflation of stimulation sites and the poor characterizations of the\n           injuries, these factors need to be revisited in a more thorough analysis.\n\n        4. Preclinical evidence. Prolonged DBS improves other symptoms of SCI as well as pain. The\n           Investigators have found that various types of sensory and motor performance and\n           anatomical damage are restored. Recovery of autonomic dysreflexia, and improvements in\n           gastric emptying, insulin level and glucose control have been measured more recently.\n           These improvements remain when the stimulation ceases. Separately from pain, it is\n           important to find out in man whether the Investigators can safely replicate these\n           findings, with possible great benefit to patients. Thus there is a potential for (a)\n           immediate pain relief, (b) long-term changes in pain status (such that the stimulation\n           can be reduced or stopped), (c) general improvement in different visceral or motor\n           symptoms of the SCI syndrome.\n\n        5. Surgical issues. In the past, typically, at some point during the surgery, tests were\n           done on whether the patient's pain is reduced immediately upon stimulation. If not,\n           then leads were never internalized. The Investigators  believe that this protocol may\n           have reduced success rates needlessly. Acute effects of electrode insertion may have\n           been present that prevented immediate benefits of the stimulation. Also, the most\n           benefits the Investigators postulate are due to long-term effects of the stimulation.\n           So the efficacy of DBS for pain, including SCI pain, may have been greatly\n           underestimated. The present study will include patients that do not show an acute\n           benefit immediately after surgical electrode implantation.\n\n        6. Safety. DBS has a very low rate of complications, which are mostly correctable.\n\n      Other Authorities\n\n        1. The Granting Agency (DOD), Regulatory Agency (FDA) and Device Manufacturer (waiver from\n           Medtronic Corp) have all supported the validity of this study.\n\n        2. The procedure (DBS in PAG/PVG for pain) is currently being used in the United Kingdom,\n           Germany, Australia and other countries."
