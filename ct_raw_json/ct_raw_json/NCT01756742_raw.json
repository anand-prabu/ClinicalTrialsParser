Pleural effusion (PE) is an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space that\n      is classified as transudate or exudate according to its composition and underlying\n      pathophysiology. The goal in the management of pleural effusion is to provide symptomatic\n      relief by removing fluid from the pleural space and to allow the treatment of the underlying\n      disease. While some authors (REF) propose respiratory physiotherapy, in the majority of the\n      cases only the medical treatment combined with the pleural fluid removal by thoracentesis\n      are the most common practice. The objective of this study is verify the effectiveness of\n      respiratory physiotherapy in pleural effusion"
