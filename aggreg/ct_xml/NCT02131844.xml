  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early mobilization (i.e. initiation of out of bed activities from the day of surgery) is
      considered an important component of postoperative care after colorectal surgery. Having a
      health professional dedicated to facilitate early mobilization has the potential to enhance
      postoperative recovery by preventing the negative effects of prolonged bed rest (e.g.
      increased risk for complications, muscle loss, deconditioning and functional decline);
      however, the need to implement this resource-intensive approach is not evidence based. This
      study aims to contribute evidence about the role of facilitated early mobilization as a
      strategy to enhance recovery after colorectal surgery.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary research question of this study is: to what extent does postoperative
      facilitation of early mobilization impact on recovery of functional walking capacity at 4
      weeks after surgery in comparison to standard care (preoperative education).

      The hypothesis is that, by 4 weeks after surgery, facilitated early mobilization will result
      in a greater proportion of participants returning to preoperative levels of functional
      walking, as measured by the six-minute walk test (6MWT).

    <description>Participants randomized to this group, in addition the preoperative education (usual care), will have early mobilization facilitated by a trained health professional. This health professional will: (1) visit the participant on the day of surgery to reinforce mobilization goals and assist with transfer to a chair and (2) visit the participant three times per day starting from POD 1 to reinforce mobilization goals and walk with the participant (at least the length of the hallway). Targeted walking distances will increase according to the participant's tolerance. This intervention will be undertaken until POD 5 or hospital discharge, whichever comes first.</description>
