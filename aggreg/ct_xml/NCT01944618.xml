      The study purpose is to assess adverse events in patients with Type 2 diabetes who have
      newly been prescribed Forxiga for the management of glycemic control

      Observational Model: Other: A post-marketing evaluation of the safety of Forxiga through an
      observational prescription adverse event monitoring program (registry-based monitoring
      program) is warranted to assess real-world incidence of adverse events in routine clinical
      practice
