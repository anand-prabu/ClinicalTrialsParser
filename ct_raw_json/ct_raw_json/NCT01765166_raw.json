GRIN); for children ages 8-12 years],\n      in order to teach and reinforce the same social skills and concepts within the home\n      environment. A primary goal of this Competing Renewal is to conduct a rigorous, large-scale,\n      longitudinal research project that is adequately powered to address questions of relative\n      impact, longer-term treatment benefits, and differential treatment effects of the Parent\n      Guide training on children's social skill development across settings and populations.\n      Though schools often struggle with how to increase parent involvement in school-based\n      programs, school officials report that it is infeasible for them to conduct the full series\n      of in-person parent training groups as the Parent Guide's current curriculum demands;\n      therefore, a second goal of this Competing Renewal is to test a Home-study version of the\n      Parent Guide to bridge training into the home environment. The Home-study version of the\n      Parent Guide will be included as a separate treatment condition within the effectiveness\n      trial. This clinical trial will provide S.S.GRIN treatment for 240 children ages 8-12 and\n      vary the level of parent intervention to determine the effectiveness of the two variations\n      of Parent Guide to S.S.GRIN. Parents will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions:\n      (1) Parent Guide treatment; (2) Parent Guide-Home Study treatment; (3) parent attention\n      control; or (4) no treatment. Pre-treatment, post-treatment, 6-month post-treatment, and 12\n      month post-treatment data will be collected assessing children's social skill development\n      from children, parents, and teachers.  Based on past clinical experience, the probability of\n      adverse psychological and behavioral effects from behavioral intervention is very low;\n      however, to ensure participants' safety, a data and safety monitoring plan will be in place."
