In cases in which the impact\n        of the condition upon risk to the subject or study results is unclear, the Medical Monitor\n        should be consulted. Any subject with a known cardiovascular disease or condition (even if\n        controlled) must be discussed with the Medical Monitor during screening.\n\n          -  Evidence of any chronic organic disease of the CNS such as tumors, inflammation,\n             active seizure disorder, vascular disorder, potential CNS related disorders that\n             might occur in childhood- eg, Duchenne Muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis, or\n             other neurologic or serious neuromuscular disorders.

However,\n                  a positive test for amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, benzodiazepines or\n                  methadone may not result in exclusion of subjects if the investigator determines\n                  that the positive test is as a result of prescription medicine(s).\n\n               2. Pregnancy test (only in female subjects \u2265 11 years old).\n\n          -  Lifetime history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive or acquired immune\n             deficiency syndrome (AIDS), or history of Hepatitis B or C.\n\n          -  Participated in another interventional clinical trial or receiving an investigational\n             product within 30 days prior to study drug administration.\n\n          -  Use of concomitant medications that consistently prolong the QT/QTc interval within\n             28 days prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Received depot neuroleptics unless the last injection was at least 1 month or 1\n             treatment cycle prior to screening, whichever is longer.\n\n          -  Subject has received treatment with antidepressants within 3 days, fluoxetine\n             hydrochloride at any time within 21 days, an MAO inhibitor within 21 days of\n             randomization or clozapine within 120 days of randomization. Depot neuroleptics must\n             be discontinued at least one treatment cycle prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Use of any antipsychotic medication (other than study drug), carbamazepine,\n             oxcarbazepine or fluvoxamine, within 3 days prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Females who are pregnant, lactating, or likely to become pregnant during the study.\n\n          -  Donation of whole blood within 60 days prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Has a prolactin concentration greater than or equal to 100 ng/mL at screening.\n\n          -  Subject is considered by the investigator to be at imminent risk of suicide during\n             the study. Subject has a history of one or more serious suicide attempts (based on\n             the investigator's judgment) in the 12 months prior to screening. Subjects determined\n             to be at risk of suicide or injury, as assessed by the investigator at screening,\n             will be referred for further psychiatric evaluation.\n\n          -  Clinically relevant history of drug hypersensitivity to lurasidone or any components\n             in the formulation.\n\n          -  Subject requires use of concomitant medications that are potent inducers or\n             inhibitors of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 enzyme system (Appendix C) from signing\n             informed consent until follow-up."
