Varicose vein endovenous radiofrequency\n      treatment have a lower risk of iatrogenic injuries and offer faster return to work\n      activities, when compared with open surgical techniques. Endovenous electrocoagulation can\n      selectively and safely cause Great Saphenous Vein (GSV) wall necrosis but its clinical\n      results has never been studied before.\n\n      Objective: The objective of this study is to compare Great Saphenous Vein electrocoagulation\n      and radio frequency (RF) endovascular varicose vein treatment clinical results and quality\n      of life improvement in a prospective double blind randomized controlled clinical trial.\n\n      Methods: Consecutive patients with varicose veins and primary GSV reflux will be randomized\n      to Electrocoagulation or Radiofrequency endovenous treatment.  The primary outcome measure\n      will be GSV occlusion rate at 3 and 6 months after treatment verified by Duplex Scanning\n      (DS). Secondary outcome measures will be pain visual analogue scale (VAS), bruising,\n      neuropathy and vein thrombosis frequency in the immediate postoperative period (1 week); and\n      Clinical Etiology Anatomy and Pathophysiology (CEAP) classification ,Venous Clinical\n      Severity Scale (VCSS), and Aberdeen Varicose Vein Questionnaire (AVVQ), obtained\n      preoperatively, at 3 and 6 months postoperatively. For statistical analysis, we will use the\n      Student's t test, the Mann-Whitney test and Pearson's correlation, considering positive\n      statistical significance when level of p <0.05."
