    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the incidence, type, and pattern of
      serious adverse events (SAEs), including but not limited to infections (including
      opportunistic infections), hepatic events, malignancies, and renal events, and of adverse
      events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation in patients with MS treated with DMF.
      Secondary objectives of this study in this population are as follows:  To determine dimethyl
      fumarate (DMF) prescription and utilization patterns in routine clinical practice in
      patients with multiple sclerosis (MS);  To assess the effectiveness of dimethyl fumarate
      (DMF) on multiple sclerosis (MS) disease activity and disability progression in routine
      clinical practice as determined by the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) score and
      multiple sclerosis (MS) relapse information; and To assess the effect of dimethyl fumarate
      (DMF) on health-related quality of life, healthcare resource consumption, and work
      productivity.
