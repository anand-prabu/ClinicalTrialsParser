Infusing chemotherapy drugs directly into the bladder may kill\n      more cancer cells. It is not yet known if surgery followed by chemotherapy is more effective\n      than chemotherapy alone in treating bladder cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy alone with\n      that of transurethral resection followed by chemotherapy in treating patients who have\n      bladder cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      disease status (primary vs recurrent) and participating center. Patients are randomized to 1\n      of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo chemoresection with intravesical instillation of mitomycin once\n           weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo transurethral resection followed within 1-6 hours by\n           intravesical instillation of mitomycin.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at week 1 (arm II only), at week 5 (arm I only),\n      and then at week 6.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 6 and 19, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 2\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,000 patients (500 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 5 years."
