Therefore, more local evidence on\n      dementia care is needed for the development of an evidence-based guideline appropriate for\n      people living in China. Meanwhile, the inadequate implementation of the current AD\n      guideline, which results in the low diagnostic rate and high diagnostic leakage, may bring\n      about extra barriers for AD patients to access dementia care service in different areas\n      nationwide. However, there is no data on the clinical pathway about how physicians follow\n      the dementia guideline in the routine practice.\n\n      Therefore, research is needed to learn clinical diagnostic process and treatment patterns of\n      physicians to people with AD in routine practice and help address the low accurate rate of\n      AD clinical diagnosis and low anti-dementia drug prescription in the real world and support\n      guideline development."
