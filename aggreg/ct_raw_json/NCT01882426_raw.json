Although\n      this situation is far from ideal, to change such entrenched physician behavior will require\n      compelling evidence that Step-care results in inferior outcomes to earlier introduction of\n      effective therapy.\n\n      Based on these considerations, we will perform a cluster randomization trial in which 40\n      gastroenterology  practices will be randomly assigned to a treatment algorithm featuring the\n      early use of combination therapy, treatment intensification guided by objective assessments\n      of inflammation and the use of remission as a therapeutic goal or a conventional Step-care\n      approach."
