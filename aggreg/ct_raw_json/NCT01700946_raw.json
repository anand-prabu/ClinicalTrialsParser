Patients also receive triple intrathecal therapy on day 1. High-risk\n      patients with negative MRD continue on to transplantation. All patients with positive MRD\n      continue on to Block III after count recovery.\n\n      BLOCK III: Patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice daily (BID) on days 1-4 and\n      mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over 1 hour on days 3-5. Patients also receive triple\n      intrathecal therapy on day 7.\n\n      INTERIM CONTINUATION (for patients unable to tolerate dose intensive chemotherapy): Patients\n      receive etoposide and cyclophosphamide IV on day 1, methotrexate IV on day 8, mercaptopurine\n      PO on days 8-14, teniposide and cytarabine IV on day 15, dexamethasone PO TID on days 22-26,\n      and vinblastine IV on day 22.\n\n      RE-INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive clofarabine, cyclophosphamide, and etoposide IV on\n      days 1-5; dexamethasone PO on days 1-6; and pegaspargase and vincristine sulfate IV on days\n      6, 13, and 20.Patients may also receive triple intrathecal therapy on days 1 and 15.\n      Patients continue on to continuation treatment after count recovery.\n\n      CONTINUATION TREATMENT: Patients receive methotrexate IV over 2 hours on day 1 and\n      mercaptopurine PO on days 1-7 of weeks 1, 2, 5, and 6; teniposide and cytarabine IV on day 1\n      of weeks 3 and 7; vincristine sulfate IV on day 1 of week 4; dexamethasone PO TID on days\n      1-5 of weeks 4 and 8; and vinblastine IV on day 1 of week 8. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks\n      for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients may also receive triple intrathecal therapy on day 1 of week 1 of all courses and\n      day 1 of week 5 of courses 6-10.\n\n      OUTLINE:  GROUP 2 (high risk defined as participants not meeting the standard risk criteria\n      noted above):\n\n      Patients receive Remission Induction (Blocks I, II, and III) treatment as described above\n      for Group 1. Patients then undergo allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)\n      as soon as they have negative MRD. Patients with negative MRD may continue chemotherapy\n      until a suitable donor is found.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 4 months for 1 year,\n      every 6 months for 1 year, and then yearly for up to 10 years."
