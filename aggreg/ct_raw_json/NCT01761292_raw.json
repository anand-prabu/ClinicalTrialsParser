A parent/guardian and child can comply with all study evaluations/procedures and\n             return for all study activities.\n\n          3. Able to complete the 2 screening 6MWTs with a minimal distance of at least 250 m\n             each.  In addition, the results of these tests must be within \u00b130 m of each other.\n\n          4. On a stable dose of systemic corticosteroids for at least 6 months.\n\n          5. At least 6 months worth of data on the 6MWT (this will be the \"historical\" 6MWT).\n             From the moment of the historical 6MWT assessment(s), the child must not have\n             received any compound that could potentially affect the 6MWT, with the exception of\n             the stable steroid treatment.\n\n          6. Parent/guardian has signed the informed consent form and child has assented to be in\n             the study (if applicable).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Initiation of systemic corticosteroid therapy within 6 months prior to the start of\n             study drug or change in systemic corticosteroid therapy (e.g., initiation, change in\n             type of drug, dose modification not related to body weight change, schedule\n             modification, interruption, discontinuation, or re initiation) within 6 months prior\n             to the start of study drug.\n\n          2. Use of any pharmacologic treatment, other than corticosteroids, that might have an\n             effect on muscle strength since the time of the historical 6MWT and in any case\n             within 3 months prior to the start of study treatment (e.g., growth hormone).\n             Vitamin D, calcium, and integrators will be allowed.\n\n          3. Surgery that might have an effect on muscle strength or function within 3 months\n             before study entry or planned surgery at any time during the study.\n\n          4. Exposure to another investigational drug since the time of the historical 6MWT and in\n             any case within 3 months prior to the start of study treatment.\n\n          5. History of participation in gene therapy, cell-based therapy or oligonucleotide\n             therapy.\n\n          6. Presence of other clinically significant disease that in the opinion of the\n             investigator places the child in unacceptable risk for an adverse outcome or that\n             could affect study results.\n\n          7. Symptomatic cardiomyopathy or heart failure.  If child has a left ventricular\n             ejection fraction <45% at screening, the investigator should discuss inclusion of\n             child in the study with the medical monitor.\n\n          8. Inadequate hematological function\n\n          9. Absolute neutrophil count: <1.5 x 109/L\n\n         10. Platelets: <100 x 109/L\n\n         11. Current or history of liver disease or impairment, including but not limited to an\n             elevated total bilirubin.\n\n         12. Inadequate renal function, as defined by serum creatinine >2 x the upper limit of\n             normal.\n\n         13. Positive test for hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis C antibody, or human\n             immunodeficiency virus at screening\n\n         14. A baseline QTc >450 msec, (as the mean of 3 consecutive readings 5 minutes apart) or\n             history of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (e.g., heart failure,\n             hypokalemia, family history of long QT syndrome).\n\n         15. Psychiatric illness/social situations rendering the potential child unable to\n             understand and comply with the study protocol."
