Approximately 300 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infected\n      patients who are prescribed simeprevir by their health care provider as part of their\n      routine HCV treatment regimen will be enrolled in this and observed to evaluate the\n      effectiveness of a simeprevir. Practice setting features will be documented at the\n      initiation of the study by each participating site. The decision of patients to participate\n      in this study will in no way impact upon the standard of care that they are receiving. All\n      treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the health care provider. Safety\n      assessments will include assessment of adverse events, and clinical laboratory parameters\n      (hematology, clotting tests, human immunodeficiency virus tests, chemistry, and liver\n      function tests). The maximum study duration for each patient will be approximately 2 years."
