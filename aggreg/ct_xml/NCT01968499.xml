      This registration study aims to investigate the associations of the pharmacogenetic and
      pharmacokinetic factors with clopidogrel low response and clinical outcome in patients with
      coronary artery disease, and provide new pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic targets for the
      individualized anti-platelet treatment.

      Associations of the Pharmacogenetic and Pharmacokinetic Factors With Clopidogrel Low
      Response and Clinical Outcome in Patients With Coronary Stent Implantation: a Registration
      Study

      Published data linking clopidogrel non-responsiveness to adverse ischaemic events lead to
      the suggestion that the magnitude of platelet inhibition by clopidogrel can be monitored and
      individually adjusted. This has been tested in randomised clinical trials (ARCTIC, GRAVITAS
      and TRIGGER-PCI), but despite reducing platelet reactivity, a strategy of therapy adjustment
      based on platelet function monitoring did not reduce the incidence of cardiac ischaemic
      events1, which indicates that most pharmacodynamical tests monitored anti-platelet treatment
      failed so far.

      We accordingly performed this registration study to investigate whether the pharmacogenetic
      and pharmacokinetic factors are associated with clopidogrel low response as well as clinical
      outcome, and aimed to provide new targets for the individualized anti-platelet treatment.

      Inclusion criteria:

        1. Successively recruit all patients who receive stent implantation;

        2. Patient aged &gt;18 years and ≦80 years old;

        3. Signed inform consent.

      Exclusion criteria:

      1.None

      Clinical data collection:

        1. Patients basic characteristics.

        2. Diagnosis and complicated diseases.

        3. Medical treatment and interventional treatment.

      Methods:

      Blood samples are collected on the 5th days after the patients' taking clopidogrel to
      perform the genetic testing and determine the light transmittancy aggregation (LTA) and the
      serum levels of the parent clopidogrel, intermediate and active metabolites of clopidogrel.
      LTA is to re-determined 1 month after clopidogrel consumption. Clopidogrel low response is
      defined as the inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) in response to 5μM ADP is no more
      than 60%. Clinical follow-up will be performed 1month, 6month, and 1year after the patients'
      included. Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) is set as death, non-fatal myocardial
      infarction (MI), ischemic stroke. Associations of the pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic
      factors with clopidogrel low response and clinical outcome will be analyzed.

      Tests:

        1. ADP-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 5μM ADP.

        2. Arachidonic acid (AA)-induced platelet aggregation: LTA in response to 1mM AA.

        3. Simultaneous detection of clopidogrel, 2-oxo-clopidogrel and its thiol metabolite in
           human plasma by the high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry
           (HPLC-MS/MS) method.

        4. GWAS scan or genotyping of ABCB1,CYP2C19, paraoxonase 1 (PON1).

      Sample size: We plan to recruit 1500 patients.

      Clinical follow-up: 1 month, 6 month, and 1 year after the patients' included.

      Major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE): Death, non-fatal MI, ischemic stroke.

      Minor adverse cardiovascular events: Hospitalization, revascularization, stent thrombosis
      (ARC definition) and minor, moderate, and major bleeding (TIMI definition).
