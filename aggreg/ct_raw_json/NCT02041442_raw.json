            "textblock": "This pilot study is looking at the possibility of adapting some of the tools and techniques\n      used by cardiac electrophysiologists (doctors specializing in the electrical activity of the\n      heart) to help diagnose and treat Overactive Bladder.  The rationale for this approach is\n      based on the similarities of the two organs.  In simple terms, the heart and bladder are\n      both hollow muscular organs that expand and contract to hold and move fluid.\n\n      In an electrophysiology study looking at cardiac (heart) arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat),\n      the cardiologist places one or more electrode catheters (thin hollow tube with an electrical\n      conductor on the end) through a vein or artery in the leg or arm to contact heart tissue.\n      By recording the electrical activity at multiple sites of the heart, the catheter allows for\n      mapping of the electrical activity and the arrhythmia mechanism.\n\n      In this study, investigators will use the same electrode catheter to contact bladder tissue\n      and map the electrical activity of the bladder.  It is hoped that the information from this\n      electrophysiological testing of the bladder may eventually lead to treatment of areas of\n      electrical abnormality of interest.  No actual treatment of the bladder will be done as part\n      of this pilot study."
