Currently efforts to treat painful episodes with use of\n      non-steroidal pain relievers and intravenous narcotics offer symptomatic relief only,\n      without targeting the underlying mechanisms of vaso-occlusion.Investigators have found that\n      an arginine deficiency and low NO bioavailability occurs during painful events in SCD. Since\n      arginine is the obligate substrate for NO production, and an acute deficiency is associated\n      with VOE, investigators hypothesized that arginine supplementation may be a safe and\n      beneficial treatment for sickle cell pain."
