In short, the\n      Combo stent combines a drug eluting technique and an endothelial cell attracting layer. The\n      drug coating is designed to prevent re-narrowing of the stent. The endothelial cell\n      attracting layer is designed to ensure rapid coverage of the stent struts with vascular wall\n      cells.\n\n      The REMEDEE REGISTRY evaluates the long-term safety and performance of the Combo stent in\n      routine clinical practice. In total 1000 patients will be registered and followed for five\n      years."

            "textblock": "Registry Investigated Device:\n\n      The OrbusNeich Combo Bio-engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent (Combo Stent) consists of a 316L\n      stainless steel alloy abluminally coated with a biocompatible, biodegradable polymer\n      containing sirolimus. Covalently attached to this matrix is a layer of murine, monoclonal,\n      anti-human CD34 antibody. The antibody specifically targets CD34+ cells in circulation.\n      Endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) are CD34+. The stent is supplied premounted on a 0.014\"\n      guide wire compatible low profile rapid exchange balloon catheter delivery system. The Combo\n      Stent is Conformit\u00e9e Europ\u00e9enne (CE) marked.\n\n      Registry Objectives:\n\n      The REMEDEE REGISTRY evaluates the long term safety and performance of the Abluminal\n      Sirolimus Coated Bio-Engineered Stent (Combo Bio-Engineered Sirolimus Eluting Stent) in\n      routine clinical practice. The primary objective of the registry is to evaluate the one year\n      incidence of target lesion failure in consecutive patients undergoing percutaneous coronary\n      intervention with (attempted) Combo stent placement.\n\n      Registry Design:\n\n      The REMEDEE REGISTRY is an international, prospective, multicenter, cohort post market\n      registry with five years follow-up to evaluate outcomes in patients undergoing percutaneous\n      coronary intervention with (attempted) Combo stent placement. The registry population\n      consists of consecutive patients in whom a treatment with a Combo stent in the setting of\n      routine clinical care is attempted.\n\n      This registry involves the collection of baseline demographic, clinical, and angiographic\n      data, as well as follow-up data in consecutive patients in whom the Combo stent is used to\n      treat (a) coronary lesion(s) in the setting of routine clinical care. Patients are\n      registered in up to 10 European high volume PCI centers. A follow-up is scheduled at 30\n      days, 180 days,1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years post procedure. Follow-up is\n      obtained at a planned regular visit to the out-patient clinic, or by telephone contact with\n      the patient.\n\n      Quality control:\n\n      All data will be entered on-site in an electronic case report (eCRF) form according to Good\n      Clinical Practice guidelines.\n\n      All sites will monitored regularly during the time of the registry. The monitor plan\n      involves a hundred percent procedural information and event monitoring. During data\n      monitoring, all source data will be assessed for accuracy, completeness, and\n      representativeness of registry data by comparing the data to external data sources. Data\n      checks to compare data entered into the registry against predefined rules for range or\n      consistency with other data fields in the registry are implemented in the (eCRF). A data\n      dictionary that contains detailed descriptions of each variable used by the registry,\n      including the source of the variable, coding information if used, and normal ranges if\n      relevant is part of the database and eCRF design. Standard Operating Procedures to address\n      registry operations and analysis activities, such as patient recruitment, data collection,\n      data management, data analysis, reporting for adverse events, and change management are in\n      place. A detailed statistical analysis plan describing the analytical principles and\n      statistical techniques to be employed in order to address the primary and secondary\n      objectives, as specified in the study protocol is available. Missing data is accounted for\n      in the design of the eCRF template, and will be handled according to the statistical plan."
