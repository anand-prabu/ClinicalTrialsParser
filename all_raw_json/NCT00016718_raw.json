For children, this regimen may be too\n      complicated or the drugs may be too difficult to take by mouth. The purpose of this study is\n      to determine the long-term safety and effectiveness of daily didanosine (ddI), efavirenz\n      (EFV), and emtricitabine (FTC) in pediatric patients who have taken few or no anti-HIV\n      drugs."

Few PIs are\n      available in formulations appropriate for pediatric patients, and complex dosing schedules\n      and food requirements may be detrimental to treatment adherence. A once-daily regimen of the\n      NRTIs ddI and FTC and the nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) EFV has been\n      shown safe and well tolerated in adults. This study will evaluate the long-term safety and\n      efficacy of a ddI, FTC, and EFV regimen in pediatric patients.\n\n      Patients will be followed for a maximum of 192 weeks; all patients will receive ddI, EFV,\n      and FTC together once daily. Study visits will occur at study entry, Weeks 2 and 4, and\n      every 4 weeks thereafter. Blood collection, medical history assessment, and a physical exam\n      will occur at all visits; urine collection will occur at selected visits. Intensive\n      pharmacokinetic (PK) studies will be done at Weeks 2 and 12 to determine if dose adjustments\n      are required for any of the drugs. If virologic failure is determined, PK studies will be\n      repeated 4 weeks after adjustments in therapy. Parents or guardians will be asked to\n      complete treatment adherence questionnaires at some visits. Some patients may also be asked\n      to participate in an additional PK study after Week 16 or week 96."
