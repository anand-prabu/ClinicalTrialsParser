Patients undergo a craniotomy\n           after completion of the O6-BG infusion. (closed to accrual 12/19/2000)\n\n        -  Part II: After determination of the O6-BG dose in Part I, patients with recurrent\n           malignant gliomas receive O6-BG IV continuously for 49 hours beginning on day 1.\n           Patients also receive oral temozolomide on day 1. Treatment repeats every 28 days in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of temozolomide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which no more than 1 of 6\n      patients experiences dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20-30 patients (with 14 patients participating in Part II)\n      will be accrued for this study."
