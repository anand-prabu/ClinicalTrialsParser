      The purpose of this research study is to investigate the safety and effectiveness of
      botulinum toxin A (Xeomin) ® injections in patients who suffer from focal pain in areas of
      radiation and/or surgery as a result of cancer treatment. Our hypothesis is that injection
      of incobotulinum toxin A into an area of local pain, at or around the area of a
      post-surgical/post radiation scar, relieves the focal cancer pain.
