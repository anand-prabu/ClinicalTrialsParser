  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to demonstrate the feasibility and tolerability of the use
      of Sativex in cannabis dependent individuals and to assess the effects of fixed or self
      titrated dosages of SATIVEX® (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol /cannabidiol combination in a buccal
      spray) on withdrawal symptoms, craving scores and cannabis consumption during the study
      period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a one year pilot/feasibility study, assessing the effects of fixed or self
      titrated dosages of SATIVEX® (Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol /cannabidiol combination in a buccal
      spray) on withdrawal from cannabis and craving among cannabis dependent subjects.  Subjects
      in this study will undergo an 8-week double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects will
      be regular cannabis-users who are not currently seeking treatment for cannabis dependence.
      Subjects will participate in each of 8 conditions, lasting 5 weekdays each (an ABACADAE
      study design); four smoke as usual conditions (SAU) and four cannabis abstinence conditions.
       During each abstinence condition (B, C, D, E conditions), subjects will be allocated to one
      conditions including self-titration of placebo, fixed dose of placebo, self-titration of
      SATIVEX (up to a max of 40 sprays per day, equal to 108mg THC) or fixed dose of SATIVEX (40
      sprays per day).  Each medication phase will be followed by a washout period where
      individuals will be requested to smoke cannabis as usual (A condition). The experimental
      conditions will be: type of SATIVEX® spray used (active vs placebo), and titration regimen
      (fixed or self-titrated). This pilot study will allow us to demonstrate the feasibility of
      our approach and to determine the sample size to use secondarily for a larger study. Our
      ultimate goal is to determine optimal conditions to use for a subsequent randomized
      controlled trial assessing the efficacy of SATIVEX® in treatment of Cannabis dependence
      among treatment-seeking subjects.
