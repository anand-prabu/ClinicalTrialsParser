Determine the safety and tolerability of intraperitoneal administration of\n      paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) in patients with recurrent or persistent ovarian or\n      primary peritoneal carcinoma. II. Determine and confirm the maximum tolerated dose of this\n      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine plasma paclitaxel concentrations at\n      selected times after intraperitoneal administration of Paclimer microspheres in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive intraperitoneal paclitaxel\n      (Paclimer microspheres) every 8 weeks for 2 courses. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive\n      escalating doses of intraperitoneal paclitaxel (Paclimer microspheres) until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 patients experience dose limiting toxicities. Once the probable MTD is determined, an\n      additional cohort of 8 patients is accrued to confirm the MTD. The MTD is confirmed as the\n      dose level at which at least 6 of 8 patients demonstrate acceptable safety and tolerability.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
