The purpose of this study is to use\n      Beta-CIT and SPECT to study the expression of dopamine and serotonin transporters in vivo in\n      normal controls and various patient populations to address hypothesized abnormalities of the\n      transporters in different disorders and to understand the effects of genetic variations in\n      the genes of these transporters on their in vivo expression."
