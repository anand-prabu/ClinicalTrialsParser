An objective tool to\n      determine the magnitude of the cardiac troponin change is the use of reference change values\n      (RCV). The basis for this tool is that, for a change to be significant, the difference in\n      serial results must be greater than the inherent variation in two test results. The inherent\n      variation of a laboratory test result is composed of analytical and within-subject\n      biological variation. An important requirement to use RCVs is that the concentrations of\n      cardiac troponins fluctuate randomly around a homeostatic set point in cardio-healthy\n      individuals. Verification of this important condition has never been performed, and\n      violation of this condition would preclude the use of RCV's in clinical practice."
