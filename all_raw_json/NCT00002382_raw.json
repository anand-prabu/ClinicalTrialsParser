Drugs, such as\n        rifampin and rifabutin, which induce hepatic enzymes are likely to result in decreased\n        levels of saquinavir and, therefore, should be avoided where possible.\n\n          -  Concomitant therapy and treatment should be kept at a minimum.\n\n          -  Current participation in any study formally excluding concomitant treatment with\n             experimental drugs.\n\n             1. Saquinavir can be used in combination with other registered anti-retroviral drugs\n             such as ZDV, ddC and/or ddl. Other not yet registered anti-retroviral drugs can be\n             used in combination with saquinavir when these drugs are widely available in the\n             respective country or when they are allowed in combination treatment in any on-going\n             clinical study.\n\n          -  Prophylactic treatment for any opportunistic infections."
