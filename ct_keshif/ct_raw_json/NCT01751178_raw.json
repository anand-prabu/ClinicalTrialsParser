(Gradable teeth are those\n             where restorative materials cover less than 25% of the tooth surface graded).\n\n             c) Mild to moderate gingivitis present at the screening visit in the opinion of the\n             investigator.\n\n             d) Positive response to bleeding on brushing exercise at screening visit. e) A total\n             of 20 bleeding sites or greater at baseline visit.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Known or suspected intolerance or hypersensitivity to Chlorhexidine or other study\n             materials (or closely related compounds) or any of their stated ingredients.\n\n          -  5. a) Current or relevant history of any serious, severe or unstable physical or\n             psychiatric illness or any other medical condition (e.g. Diabetes Mellitus) that\n             would make the subject unlikely to fully complete the study or any that increases the\n             risk to the subject or  undermines the data validity.\n\n             b) Subjects requiring prophylactic antibiotic treatment prior to dental therapy.\n\n             c) Use of concomitant medication that, in the opinion of the investigator, might\n             interfere with the outcome of the study or increases the risk to the subject (eg:\n             phenytoin, calcium antagonists, cyclosporine, warfarin, antibiotics,\n             immuno-suppressants).\n\n             d) Use of antibiotics within two weeks prior to the screening visit or throughout the\n             study.\n\n             e) Use of any systemic medication which would have an effect on gingival conditions\n             within 14 days of gingival examinations (eg: ibuprofen or aspirin therapy) 6. a) Have\n             current active caries b) More than 3 pockets with 5mm or over. c) Excessive calculus\n             present that interferes with the probing examination for Gingival Index.\n\n             d) Other severe oral/ gingival conditions (e.g. Acute Necrotizing Ulcerative\n             Gingivitis) that may compromise the study or the subjects in the opinion of the\n             investigator or gingivitis examiner.\n\n             e) Medical conditions which may directly influence gingival bleeding. f) Restorations\n             in a poor state of repair. g) Orthodontic appliances anterior cosmetic restorations\n             and veneers. h) Enamel pitting/irregularities. 7. Subjects using chewing tobacco,\n             pan, pan-masala, gutkha or other chewing tobacco products or subjects who have quit\n             using any of those within the past six months prior to screening.\n\n             8. b) An employee of any toothpaste manufacturer or their immediate family."
