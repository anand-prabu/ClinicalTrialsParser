      The purpose of this trial is to compare incisional pain in patients receiving pre-incisional
      versus post operative Marcaine injection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative pain control is a key component of a patient's experience with surgery. In
      laparoscopic surgery, small (5 to 12mm) incisions are made, usually at the umbilicus and/on
      at either side of the lower abdomen, to allow insertion of a laparoscopic camera (&quot;scope&quot;)
      and various laparoscopic instruments. The advantages for the patient of this approach
      compared to conventional open surgery include faster recovery with a significantly shorter
      hospital stay, less pain and less requirements for pain medication with a better cosmetic
      outcome. In many cases, the patient will go home within 24 hours of surgery. Many
      laparoscopic surgeons administer local anesthesia at the incision sites to assist in
      post-operative pain control. The best method for administration of the local anesthetic for
      optimal pain relief remains unclear. Some research has demonstrated that perhaps preemptive
      administration of local anesthetic improves post-operative pain control although in these
      studies, differences in patient populations and perception of pain between different
      patients makes comparison difficult. Optimizing analgesia protocols would benefit patients
      resulting in better pain relief and less use of narcotic analgesics with their associated
      side effects.
