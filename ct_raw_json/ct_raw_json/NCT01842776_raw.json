Track 3: Work with\n      physicians to develop process to individualize post-hospitalization dialysis orders and\n      improve medication reconciliation. Track 4: Use a renal Care Transitions Case Manager to\n      follow patients in the hospital and 30 days post-hospitalization to facilitate care and\n      patient coaching."
