Certolizumab will be administered in the following fashion: first dose administered at the time of treatment initiation, second dose will be given after 2 weeks of treatment, third dose after four weeks of treatment, and subsequent doses given every 4 weeks thereafter. Patients will be monitored for progression of disease using RECIST 1.1 with scans to be performed every 6 weeks. Posttreatment biopsies will be performed at the time of treatment discontinuation. Two dose levels of certolizumab will be tested, 200mg and 400mg. 200mg was selected for dose level 1 since it is 50% of the dose FDA-approved for certolizumab in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and inflammatory bowel disease."
