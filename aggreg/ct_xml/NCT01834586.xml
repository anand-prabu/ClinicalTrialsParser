  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if applying an anesthetic topical adhesive, Synera®,
      will reduce the injection pain. Relieving injection site pain may improve the tolerability
      of Multiple Sclerosis medications.

      Study Hypothesis: Pre-medication with Synera will have a significant effect on pain ratings
      as measured by the visual analog scale and Local injection site reaction scale.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label prospective study of Synera to reduce injection pain in 30 patients with
      relapsing forms of Multiple Sclerosis taking interferon beta or glatiramer acetate.  The
      duration will be 3-6 weeks (1-2 weeks of baseline observation followed by 2-4 weeks of
      on-drug observation), depending on which Multiple Sclerosis drug product is being studied.
      The study will include down-titration from 60 to 30 minutes of application to assess for any
      difference in responses.  We define one primary outcome measure,&quot;pain upon injection&quot; by
      visual analog scale (VAS).  Secondary measures will include 24-hour ratings of pain by VAS
      and 24-hour local injection site reaction (LISR) scale score.
