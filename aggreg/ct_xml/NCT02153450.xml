      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic radiosurgery and metformin hydrochloride in
      treating patients with pancreatic cancer that may be removed (borderline-resectable) or not
      removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery may be able to send x-rays directly to the
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Metformin hydrochloride, used for diabetes,
      may also kill cancer cells as demonstrated in laboratory studies. Giving stereotactic
      radiosurgery with metformin hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the tolerability of the treatment regimens for patients with A).
      borderline-resectable or B). locally-advanced pancreatic adenocarcinomas.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the clinical/pathological response and resectability rates associated with these
      regimens.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive metformin hydrochloride orally (PO) daily or twice daily (BID) on days -11
      to -1. Patients then undergo stereotactic radiosurgery 5 days a week for 5 weeks and receive
      concurrent metformin hydrochloride* PO BID for 5 weeks. Patients undergo laparotomy on week
      6 (or weeks 5-7). ). Systemic therapy continues as soon as it is considered feasible by the
      treating physicians.

      *NOTE: Metformin hydrochloride should be stopped 2 days before laparotomy.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years.
