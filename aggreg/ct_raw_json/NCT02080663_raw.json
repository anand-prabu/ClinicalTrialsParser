            "textblock": "In cases of severe arthritis of the wrist, surgical removal of the scaphoid, lunate and\n      triquetrum bones or proximal row carpectomy (PRC) is a well-known procedure. This procedure\n      converts the wrist in a simple hinged joint but allows us to preserve a certain range of\n      motion in the wrist. One of the main disadvantages of PRC is the risk of developing\n      arthritis between the head of the capitate and the lunate fossa. The long-term follow-up of\n      this procedure has always been a reason for concern. The investigators set up this\n      retrospective study to evaluate the long-term results of the procedure in the investigators\n      institution.\n\n      Also, the shape of the head of the capitate may play a role in the development of arthritis.\n      A more round shape could distribute the forces more equally and thus prevent the progression\n      of cartilage damage\n\n      The study hypothesis is:\n\n        -  PRC preserves range of motion and force in the long term (more than 10 years\n           postoperatively).\n\n        -  A more round head of the capitate is associated with an increased risk of developing\n           arthritis in the new joint."
