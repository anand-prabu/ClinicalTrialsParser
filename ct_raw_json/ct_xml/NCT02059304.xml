      The aim of this study is to examine the potential value of cervical length (CL) measurement
      with embryo transfer catheter in the prediction of spontaneous preterm deliveries in
      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) cycles.

      Preterm birth is the leading cause of perinatal death and handicap in children. It is clear
      that ICSI pregnancies are at high risk groupfor preterm delivery (PTD). In singletons there
      is an estimated two-fold increased risk following ICSI.

      CL measurement with ultrasound in mid-trimester (22-24 weeks) is the best method for the
      prediction of PTD: The shorter the CL, the higher risk of PTD. Recent evidence suggests that
      at first trimester (11-13 weeks), the risk for PTD is inversely related to CL. It has been
      shown that the measurement of CL on pregnancy is an effective method for identification of
      the group at high risk for PTD.

      In embryo transfer, catheter is placed the through cervical canal. The method we will use in
      this study, CL measurement with transfer catheter, will give more precise results than
      measurement with ultrasound.

      No study has been performed to evaluate the prediction of PTD by analyzing measurements of
      CL, preconceptionally. Our study will be the first in this topic.

      There is a certain disadvantage of measuring CL during pregnancy: The effectiveness of
      prophylactic administrations (progesterone, cervical cerclage etc.) may be inversely related
      to the gestation at which treatment is initiated. If we know the risk of PTD before
      gestation, single embryo transfer will be preferred to avoid from multiple pregnancies that
      also increase the relative risk of PTD, in ICSI pregnancies.

      Cervical length measurement protocol: The physician inserted a sterile Collin vaginal
      speculum; the cervix was exposed and gently cleaned with sterile gauze pads. Cervical mucus
      was gently removed with a syringe if abundant. A nurse concomitantly performed
      transabdominal ultrasound scan. Estimated cervical length is determined before transfer
      procedure. The Sure View Wallace Embryo Replacement Catheter (No. CE118; Smith Medical,
      Hythe, Kent, UK). There are marked lines on the surface of catheter that show distances to
      half centimeters. The catheter has a sliding guide fixed at external cervical os. Correct
      position of the catheter is replaced guide on external os, and guide's endpoint is on
      internal cervical os. In relation to the internal os was verified on the scan. If required,
      re-fixation of sliding guide to external os will also be performed. After loading embryos,
      the length between the guide and the end of catheter will be noted.

      Data collection protocol: We will obtain data on pregnancy outcome from the hospital
      computerized records or the records from family practitioners of the women. We will record
      birth weeks as major outcome. The obstetric records of all patients will be examined to
      determine whether any exclusion criteria are present.
