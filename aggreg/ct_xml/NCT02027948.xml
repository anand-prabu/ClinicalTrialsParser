  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with esophageal and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) cancer often have weight loss,
      swallowing problems, and poor appetite. This may affect their ability to tolerate cancer
      treatment.

      The purpose of this study is to see if the researchers can apply a set of nutrition
      guidelines designed specifically for patients with cancer who are older than 65 years of
      age. The questions will allow them to assess the nutritional status and make appropriate
      referrals. If the patients are having swallowing problems or losing weight, the researchers
      want to address the nutritional problems early in the course of their treatment.

    <description>Various validated assessments of nutritional status have been described. Nutritional status can be evaluated using: 1) anthropometric measures (i.e. weight loss, body mass index (BMI), triceps skin fold thickness, arm circumference), 2) immunological measurements (i.e. absolute lymphocyte count), and 3) serum protein markers (i.e. albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, and retinol-binding protein)</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Treatment toxicity of chemoradiotherapy will be summarized using descriptive statistics. Binomial proportions along with exact 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for proportions. Toxicity during the induction chemotherapy phase will be correlated with the baseline nutritional status (as determined by the MNA assessment) and baseline functional status using Fisher's exact test for categorical measures and Wilcoxon's rank sum test for numeric measures. Similarly, toxicity during chemoradiotherapy will be correlated with baseline MNA and functional status as well as with the malnutrition assessment using Fisher's exact test for categorical measures and Wilcoxon rank sum test for numeric measures.</description>

    <description>The proposed study will be a prospective feasibility study of a nutritional management algorithm with risk-based guidelines in older adults (n=50) with newly diagnosed locally advanced esophageal cancer receiving preoperative or definitive chemoradiotherapy with an induction chemotherapy approach. Eligible patients must be age ≥ 65 years old. While all patients with esophageal cancer may benefit from this intervention, we wish to target the most vulnerable population (older patients who are at highest risk of malnutrition) in this pilot study.</description>

    <description>Patients will undergo nutritional &amp; functional assessments along the continuum of their chemoradiotherapy treatment. The initial assessment will be measurements of height, weight, &amp; baseline weight loss. Patients will receive chemotherapy &amp; radiation as per standard practice at MSKCC, which is induction chemotherapy for approximately 3 weeks, followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. A commonly used regimen is weekly carboplatin (AUC 2) with paclitaxel (50 mg/m2) &amp; radiation consisting of 5040 cGy over 28 fractions. Patients in this study will undergo assessments at three time points (at baseline, after induction chemotherapy, &amp; post-treatment.) At baseline, all patients will complete the functional assessment, dysphagia scale, &amp; Mini- Nutritional Assessment (MNA).  According to the  baseline MNA score, patients will be categorized as &quot;normal nutrition,&quot; &quot;at risk for malnutrition,&quot; or &quot;malnourished&quot; &amp; receive the appropriate intervention.</description>
