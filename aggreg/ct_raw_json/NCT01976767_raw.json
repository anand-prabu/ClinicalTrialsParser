Able to give written informed consent prior to participation in the study, which\n             includes ability to comply with the requirements and restrictions listed in the\n             consent form. Informed consent must be obtained prior to undertaking any study\n             procedures.\n\n          2. Male or female subject aged 18 years or older at screening.\n\n          3. Able to complete the study and all measurements.\n\n          4. Able to read, comprehend, and write at a sufficient level to complete study related\n             materials.\n\n          5. Subjects will be allowed to enrol in other studies while taking part on this study.\n             However, Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enrol or allow the\n             continued participation of a subject enrolled in another study.\n\n        General Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. As a result of medical interview, physical examination or screening investigation the\n             physician responsible considers the subject unfit for the study either because of the\n             risk to the subject due to the study or the influence this may have on the study\n             results.\n\n          2. The subject has a history of recreational drug use or other allergy, which, in the\n             opinion of the responsible physician, contra-indicates their participation.\n\n          3. Subject is female who is pregnant or lactating or up to 6 weeks post partum or 6\n             weeks cessation of breast feeding. If a woman is subsequently found to have been\n             pregnant at the time of an assessment data from that assessment will not be included\n             in the analyses.\n\n          4. The subject has participated within 3 months of the first dose in a study using a new\n             molecular entity, or the first dose in any other study investigating drugs or having\n             participated within three months in a study with invasive procedures. Any U-BIOPRED\n             assessments should be deferred until 3 months after the first dose or invasive\n             procedure. Permission from the Scientific Board must be obtained to enroll or allow\n             the continued participation of a subject enrolled in another study.\n\n          5. Those who, in the opinion of the investigator, have a risk of non-compliance with\n             study procedures.\n\n          6. The subject has a recent history of incapacitating psychiatric disorders\n\n          7.
