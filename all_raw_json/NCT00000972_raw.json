MTP-PE/MF59 is an\n      adjuvant that appears to be particularly promising, and is selected for the studies with\n      this HIV vaccine candidate.\n\n      This study is being conducted in two parts: Part A examines the safety of the adjuvant\n      MTP-PE/MF59 alone; Part B examines the safety and immunogenicity of Env 2-3 in combination\n      with MTP-PE/MF59. In Part A, three volunteers receive MTP-PE/MF59, and one volunteer\n      receives emulsion alone at each dose level. Initiation of each dose level is separated by at\n      least 72 hours. Doses of adjuvant emulsion are administered at day 0 and day 30 for the\n      highest tolerated dose. If significant reactions are encountered, additional subjects may be\n      studied at lower doses. In Part B, six doses of MTP-PE adjuvant (0, 5, 10, 25, 50, or 100\n      mcg) in the MF59 emulsion are studied. Six volunteers receive Env 2-3/MTP-PE/MF59 and two\n      receive MTP-PE/MF59 alone at each dose level. There is a minimum 1-week interval between\n      dose escalations. Per amendment, volunteers may receive an additional dose of Env 2-3 or\n      placebo in MF59 emulsion only, administered 12-18 months post initial inoculation."
