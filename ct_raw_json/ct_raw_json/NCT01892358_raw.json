In the general hospital\n      setting, injection drug users who otherwise might not seek care are accessible and\n      teachable, and the presence of a drug-related illness can set the stage for patients to be\n      more receptive to interventions2. We hypothesize that the Skin intervention will produce\n      better outcomes at 1-, 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month(s) post-intervention."
