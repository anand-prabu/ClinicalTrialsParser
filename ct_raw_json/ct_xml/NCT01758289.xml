  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness, safety; impact on quality of life
      related to health and depressive symptoms when paricalcitol is administered in Venezuelan
      patients on hemodialysis, and who are on risk to develop secondary hyperparathyroidism
      associated, with stage V chronic kidney disease.

      Through this observational, multicenter, non interventional study it will be possible to
      obtain data that will help to improve the better understanding of the clinical conditions of
      these patients who are on risk to develop secondary hyperparathyroidism, due to chronic
      kidney disease stage V and that are receiving hemodialysis, as well as the safety profile of
      the product through the experience with local population. Additionally, it will be obtained
      quantifiable information of impact on the quality of life related to health and depressive
      symptoms of patients, from theirs perspective.
