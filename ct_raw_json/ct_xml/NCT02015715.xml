    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single ascending dose study will assess
      the safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of RO6864018 in healthy, male, asian and
      caucasian volunteers. Volunteers will be enrolled in cohorts and randomized 8:2 to receive a
      single oral administration of RO6864018 or placebo. Total study time, including treatment
      and follow-up, is up to 9 weeks.
