  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A substantial proportion of patients undergoing elective coronary artery bypass grafting
      have a history of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation has adverse
      short-and long term postoperative effects. Pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) seems to be
      effective treatment for paroxysmal atrial fibrillation. PVI can be done concomitantly with
      coronary artery bypass grafting. Procedure is well defined and safe.

      There is a lack of convincing evidence of the effect on postoperative atrial fibrillation
      burden, quality of life and symptoms especially in correlation with atrial fibrillation
      paroxysms.
