If the patient chooses and consents fully to\n      participate, he or she will be randomly assigned to receive one of the previously described\n      local anesthetics for supraclavicular nerve block.\n\n      The following clinical outcome will be assessed for up to 24 hours: Duration of the block,\n      onset of the block, nausea, the number of vomiting, and complications of peripheral nerve\n      block and used medications will be recorded. Pain at rest and movement will be evaluated by\n      using a linear 10-cm visual analog scale (VAS; 0=no pain, 10= worst imaginable pain)\n      immediately before the block, 5, 10, 15 minutes and 6 hrs. after the block and\n      postoperatively immediately at PACU, discharge from the Day surgery Unit, and 24 hrs. later\n      at home via phone call visit.\n\n      Sensory and motor block in the related nerve dermatomes (via pinprick test) will be\n      assessed. Patient will be instructed to document at what time did hand motion (finger\n      movement) return and what time normal sensation (hot/cold) return. Specific time for both\n      events will be asked to patient at phone call visit 24 hrs later. Overall patient\n      satisfaction will be evaluated at the discharge from the day surgery and 24 hours after the\n      block via phone visit.\n\n      At any point in which the patient is not experiencing pain relief after having received the\n      injection, they will be removed from the study and other anesthetic techniques will be\n      applied to resolve their pain along with pharmacological management of their pain. Rescue\n      antiemetic, which is standard of care, will be given to any patient who complains of nausea\n      or vomiting."
