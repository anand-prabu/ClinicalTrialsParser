Preliminary reports suggest that Rifaximin, a\n      poorly absorbed antibiotic used to treat travellers diarrhoea can prevent relapse. We plan\n      to carry out a randomised placebo controlled trial to test the hypothesis that Rifaximin\n      given in a reducing dose over 4 weeks after successful treatment will reduce the relapse\n      rate."
