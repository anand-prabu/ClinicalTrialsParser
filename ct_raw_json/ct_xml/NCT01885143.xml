    <textblock>
      Collect clinical images requested by FDA with GE Breast Tomosynthesis to show they are of
      acceptable quality as defined in the relevant FDA guidance document before and after
      artifact correction and in standard screening images.  Lossy compression will also be
      evaluated to demonstrate that images are of acceptable quality when lossy compression is
      enabled.
