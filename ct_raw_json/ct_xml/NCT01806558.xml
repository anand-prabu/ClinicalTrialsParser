    <textblock>
      A combined molecular breast imaging / ultrasound system will enable coregistration of a
      functional abnormality seen on Molecular Breast Imaging (MBI) with the corresponding
      anatomical abnormality seen on ultrasound.

    <description>Molecular breast Imaging is a new nuclear medicine technique for imaging the breast. It uses small filed of view semiconductor-based gamma cameras that use Cadmium Zinc Telluride detectors. These have superior spatial and energy resolution to conventional sodium iodide detectors.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The pilot study will comprise 12 women age 40 and older who have at least one of the
             following inclusion criteria:

               1. Have a finding of a mass lesion on mammography or breast MRI (BIRADS 0, 4 or 5)
                  that is &gt;0.5 cm and &lt; 2 cm in size and has had or will have additional workup
                  with focused ultrasound.

               2. Have a finding of a mass lesion on ultrasound (BIRADS 0, 4 or 5) that is &gt; 0.5
                  cm and &lt; 2 cm in size.

               3. Have a positive finding on MBI that is &lt; 2 cm in size and requires additional
                  diagnostic workup with focused ultrasound.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are unable to understand and sign the consent form

          2. Are pregnant or lactating

          3. Are physically unable to sit upright and still for 40 minutes
