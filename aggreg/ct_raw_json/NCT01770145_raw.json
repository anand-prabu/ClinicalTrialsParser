At the end of the baseline period, patients will start trimethobenzamide therapy during a minimum 3-Day Anti-Emetic Pretreatment Period.  Patients determined to remain eligible at the end of the required Anti-Emetic Pretreatmetn Period will be initiated on APOKYN therapy by an investigator.  Once the appropriate dose is identified by a study investigator, patients will inject APOKYN at their regularly scheduled levodopa morning dose time (levodopa will be delayed by 40 minutes) daily during a 7-day APOKYN Treatment Period and record \"time to on\" following the APOKYN injection."

The study will also\n      include a sub-group of 8 subjects to evaluate their gastroparesis and assess their gastric\n      empty with other measures to explore if APOKYN has any influence on gastric empty rather\n      than just bypassing the stomach with a subcutaneous route of administration.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to assess the effect of APOKYN treatment in rapid and\n      reliable improvement of motor symptoms in PD subjects suffering from delayed or unreliable\n      onset of L-dopa action (defined below). APOKYN treatment will also be assessed in a\n      sub-group of PD subjects suffering from gastroparesis and delayed onset of L-dopa action.\n\n      Delayed or unreliable onset to L-dopa for the study population is defined as impaired motor\n      function (tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, and/or postural instability) persisting for a\n      minimum of 45 minutes after taking a dose of L-dopa because of its delay in onset of action.\n      The impaired motor function resulting from delay in L-dopa onset is referred to as \"delayed\n      ON\" and when it occurs upon awakening is referred to as \"morning akinesia.\"\n\n      Main Study:\n\n      This is a multicenter, multiple-treatment, open-label, outpatient study to evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of APOKYN in PD subjects with delayed onset of L dopa action.  The study\n      will have:\n\n        -  Screening - 1-5 days (Visit 1);\n\n        -  Baseline L-Dopa Period - 7 days, continuation of L dopa treatment;\n\n        -  Antiemetic Treatment Period - 3-days; initiation of trimethobenzamide 300 mg tid\n           orally;\n\n        -  APOKYN Initiation/optimum dose identification Period (Visit 2)- variable, not more than\n           11 days;\n\n        -  APOKYN Treatment Period - 7 days, immediately upon identification of optimum dose;\n\n        -  Study Discharge (Visit 3)- within 2 days of completion of the APOKYN treatment period.\n\n      Gastroparesis Sub-Study:\n\n      A sub-group of subjects (n=8) from 1 study site that have symptoms of gastroparesis will be\n      admitted to the clinic on 2 occasions to undergo gastroparesis procedures and assessments\n      (once at the conclusion of the baseline L-dopa period and once at the conclusion of the\n      APOKYN treatment period).  Note, to do the second gastroparesis assessment, this sub-group\n      of subjects will have an extension for one extra day beyond the designated 7 day APOKYN\n      treatment period (i.e., it will be 8 days) in order to keep the 7 day diary recording\n      outpatient scope of work the same as the rest of the subjects in the study.  The second\n      inpatient period will be also considered the end-of-study visit for this sub group."
