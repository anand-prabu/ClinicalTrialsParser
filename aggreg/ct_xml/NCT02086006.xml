    <textblock>
      This prospective, consecutive enrolment, single-arm study will enroll up to 15 patients with
      single de novo, Type A lesions &lt; 10 mm in length and located in a native coronary artery
      with a reference vessel diameter of 2.75 mm - 3.0 mm as measured by both offline QCA and
      IVUS. All patients will receive a 3.0 x 14mm DESolve Stent loaded with approximately 40 mcg
      of Myolimus.

        -  Angiographic and intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) will be completed for all patients at
           baseline and at 6 months.

        -  Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) will will be completed for all patients at baseline
           and at 6 months.

        -  Multi-slice computed tomography (MSCT) will be conducted on all patients enrolled at 12
           and 24 months.

          -  Patient must agree to undergo all clinical study required follow-up visits,
             angiograms, IVUS, OCT and MSCT

          -  Patient must agree not to participate in any other clinical study for a period of two
             years following the index procedure

          -  Patient has current unstable arrhythmias Patient has undergone previous percutaneous
             interventions for lesions in either a non-target vessel or target vessel Patient has
             undergone previous percutaneous interventions for lesions in either a non-target
             vessel or target vessel

             waiting list for any organ transplant

          -  Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chemotherapy for malignancy within 30
             days prior to or after the procedure

          -  Patient is receiving immunosuppression therapy and has known immunosuppressive or
             autoimmune disease (e.g. human immunodeficiency virus, systemic lupus erythematosus
             etc.)

          -  Patient is receiving or scheduled to receive chronic anticoagulation therapy (e.g.,
             heparin, coumadin)

          -  Patient has a known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and
             bivalirudin, both clopidogrel and ticlopidine, Myolimus, PLLA polymers or contrast
             sensitivity that cannot be adequately pre-medicated

          -  Elective surgery is planned within the first 6 months after the procedure that will
             require discontinuing either aspirin or clopidogrel

          -  Patient has a platelet count &lt; 100,000 cells/mm3 or &gt; 700,000 cells/mm3, a WBC of &lt;
             3,000 cells/mm3, or documented or suspected liver disease.

          -  Patient has known renal insufficiency (e.g., serum creatinine level of more than 2.5
             mg/dL, or patient on dialysis)

          -  Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or will refuse blood
             transfusions

             attack (TIA) within the past six months

          -  Patient has had a significant GI or urinary bleed within the past six months

          -  Patient has extensive peripheral vascular disease that precludes safe 7 French sheath
             insertion

          -  Patient has other medical illness (e.g., cancer or congestive heart failure) or known
             history of substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause
             non-compliance with the clinical study plan, confound the data interpretation or is
             associated with a limited life expectancy (i.e., less than one year)

          -  Patient is already participating in another clinical study

          -  Women of childbearing potential who have not undergone surgical sterilization or is
             not post-menopausal (defined as amenorrheic for at least one year)
