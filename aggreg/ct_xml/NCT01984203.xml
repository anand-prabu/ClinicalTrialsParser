      This study aims at determine if Progressive Heavy Load Exercises (PHLE) as treatment for
      patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy is superior to &quot;Standard Low-Load
      Exercises&quot; (LLE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will be performed as a multicenter randomised controlled trail, including 260
      patients diagnosed with Rotator Cuff Tendinopathy from four orthopaedic shoulder clinics in
      secondary sector in Denmark.

      The PHLE intervention will consist of progressive strengthening exercises performed with
      heavy load dumbbells, targeting the rotator cuff in a 12 weeks home-exercise program with
      six control visits at a physiotherapy department at the hospitals.

      The LLE exercise program consists of the same exercises as the PHLE, but performed with low
      load dumbbells.

      &quot;Disability of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand (DASH) questionnaire&quot; is used as the primary
      outcome and is measured 12 weeks post baseline.

      12 months post baseline a secondary follow-up will be performed primarily measuring the
      number of patients referred to an operation.

      Patients will be randomised to either PHLE or LLE regime by blocks according to whether they
      have been referred to corticosteroid injection by their orthopaedic shoulder specialist.

      Primary investigator and patients will be blinded towards group assignment.

Two exercises for the rotator cuff: Full Can and Sidelying external rotation
Two exercises for the scapulae stabilizing muscles: Low Row and Push-Up Plus
Two glenohumeral/postural corrective exercises: Posterior GH stretch and Scapular Retraction.
All rotator cuff and scapular exercises are performed with 3 sets of 20 repetitions 3 times per week for 12 weeks. The load is set at around 60% of 1 RM (20 reps).
The glenohumeral/postural corrective exercises are performed with 3 sets of 5 repetitions (The position is held for 15 seconds per repetition).</description>
