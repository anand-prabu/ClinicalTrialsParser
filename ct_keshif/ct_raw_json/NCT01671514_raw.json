Patients with heart failure (HF) and type 2 diabetes (DM2) and\n\n        2. Normal yet sedentary individuals with impaired baseline exercise capacity (as assessed\n           by VO2 max)\n\n      We propose that a 3 month treatment with dark chocolate will lead to a significant\n      improvement in exercise capacity which will be secondary to the improvement in skeletal\n      muscle structure from epicatechin."

NO is thought to be an activator of PGC-1 alpha [PPAR (peroxisome\n      proliferator-activated receptor) alpha coactivator 1] which stimulates mitochondrial\n      biogenesis. In both patients with heart failure and diabetes there is nitric oxide\n      deficiency and mitochondrial dysfunction.  In our proposed double-blinded placebo controlled\n      clinical trial, we will test the hypothesis that chronic administration of epicatechin to\n      patients with both heart failure and diabetes will increase levels of NO and PGC-1 alpha\n      leading to increased mitochondrial biogenesis and improved mitochondrial function. We\n      believe similar changes will occur in sedentary individuals.\n\n      In a preliminary study with 5 patients with heart failure and diabetes (conducted under UCSD\n      IRB protocol number #090688) we have shown that epicatechin enriched dark chocolate improves\n      mitochondrial structure (Taub PR, Ramirez-Sanchez I, Ciaraldi TP, et al.
