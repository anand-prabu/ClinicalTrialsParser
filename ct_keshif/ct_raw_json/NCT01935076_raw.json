Our aim is to understand factors\n      that predispose fetuses to fetal overgrowth in utero, especially in women with obesity.  The\n      objective of the study is to identify miRNA which are differentially expressed in the\n      placenta and cord blood of pregnancies that are affected by fetal macrosomia to determine\n      factors that may predispose fetuses to fetal overgrowth."
