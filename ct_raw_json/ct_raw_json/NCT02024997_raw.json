We hypothesize that INSP and EXP MRI and CT characterization will allow\n      identification of patients who may benefit from the dual instance planning method.\n\n      Specific Aim 2:  Develop, investigate and evaluate plans based on free breathing, single\n      instance breath hold, and the novel dual instance anatomical information.  We hypothesize\n      that use of the dual instance method will lead to improved plans, demonstrated by the\n      ability to increase dose to the target, while maintaining the clinically-accepted normal\n      tissue dose constraints."
