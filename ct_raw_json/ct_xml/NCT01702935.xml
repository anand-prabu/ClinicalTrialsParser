      Background:

      - Primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) is a condition that affects ovary function. It means
      that the ovaries are not able to function at a level appropriate for a woman's age.
      Previously, it was thought that women had only a fixed number of eggs that were lost each
      month until none were left at menopause. However, recently, stem cells have been found in
      the ovaries of adult women. These stem cells may be able to make new eggs. Studying these
      cells may help women with POI in the future. Researchers want to collect ovarian tissue from
      women with POI to investigate ovarian stem cells.

      Objectives:

      - To collect ovarian tissue from women with primary ovarian insufficiency.

      Eligibility:

      - Women between 18 and 50 years of age with primary ovarian insufficiency.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also
           have a full gynecological exam. They will provide blood and urine samples.

        -  Participants will donate ovarian tissue for study. It will be collected through
           outpatient surgery. The surgery will take either half of an ovary or a full ovary.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

    <textblock>
      Early loss of human ovarian function results in a clinical condition known as primary
      ovarian insufficiency (POI) or premature ovarian failure (POF).  This devastating condition
      renders women unable to have their own genetic child in more than 95% of cases, as well as
      failure of hormonal production by the ovary that is critical in maintaining bone health,
      restful sleep, and quality of life.  Indeed, in more carefully designed studies where
      control groups were used, only 1.5% of POI patients became pregnant, which may more
      accurately represent the true fertility rate in this population.  Currently, fertility
      treatments for these patients are primarily to use an egg donated from a young woman.

      Until recently, it was thought that women were born with a limited number of eggs, which
      were slowly depleted each month until exhaustion at the time of menopause.  However, recent
      studies have suggested that new eggs can be made from adult stem cells in the ovary.   These
      ovarian stem cells could be transplanted into a recipient mouse, who then delivered donor
      derived offspring.  Recently, ovarian germline stem cell (i.e., oogonial stem cell)
      isolation has been reported from human ovaries.  However, it is not known if oogonial stem
      cell problems play a part in diseases such as premature ovarian failure or diminished
      ovarian reserve.

      The goal of this protocol is to characterize oogonial stem cells in patients with primary
      ovarian insufficiency (POI)/failure (POF) and diminished ovarian reserve (DOR).  Ovarian
      biopsies from patients with this disorder will be harvested by laparoscopy, and oogonial
      stem cells will be isolated in the laboratory and characterized.
