This knowledge may prove useful in guiding physician practice patterns in the\n      non-surgical management of low back pain.\n\n      Hypothesis:  The investigators hypothesize that there will be suitable (ventral/anterior)\n      epidural contrast spread based on inferior-anterior needle-tip position, particularly with\n      appropriate needle tip position."
