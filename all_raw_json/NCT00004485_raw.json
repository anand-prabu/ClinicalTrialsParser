Bone marrow transplantation, is a procedure\n      in which the soft, sponge-like tissue in the center of bones producing white blood cells,\n      red blood cells, and platelets is replaced by bone marrow from a another person. Bone marrow\n      transplantation may be an effective treatment in relieving the symptoms of sickle cell\n      disease.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation in\n      treating children who have sickle cell disease."

Patients also receive fludarabine IV\n      daily and cyclosporine IV twice a day on days -1 to 1.  Patients then receive oral\n      cyclosporine on days 1-90, and oral mycophenolate mofetil twice a day on days 0-27.\n\n      Patients are followed for 100 days, monthly for 6 months and then annually for 2 years."
