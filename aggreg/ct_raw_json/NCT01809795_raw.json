They will, however, be\n      encouraged to consume other fruits consistent with nutrition guidelines for the Healthy\n      Eating Plan (HEP: reduced glycemic load diet).\n\n      Participants will be instructed and receive educational handout materials on implementing\n      HEP. In addition participants will be introduced to the use of behavioral tools (e.g. goal\n      setting, daily tracking when goals are met, and incentives provided by the family) to help\n      them stay on track with HEP.  Participants will be seen by the dietitian at monthly\n      intervals consistent with programmatic standard of care to review adherence to HEP, use of\n      behavioral tools, and change in weight status.\n\n      Participants will be encouraged to attend group exercise classes five days per week or a\n      minimum of four days per week. At the end of each exercise session, participants will\n      receive a \"sham smoothie\" which contains no blueberries.  The children will be directly\n      observed by a study worker when consuming the smoothies to ensure compliance and measure how\n      much of the smoothie was consumed.\n\n      Group 2 (Blueberry Enhanced): All the features of Group 1 with the exception that the\n      participants will be given a smoothie that contain 1 1/2 cups of freeze-dried whole\n      blueberries crushed into a powder per serving."
