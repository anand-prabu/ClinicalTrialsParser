The final cohort will receive gemcitabine 1000mg/m2 and cisplatin 20mg/m2 week 2 and 3 of a 3 week cycle in combination with MEK162 at the MTD as determined above.

Gemcitabine and cisplatin are two forms of chemotherapy commonly\n      used in combination to treat bile duct and gallbladder cancers. The investigators are\n      looking to improve treatment results. They will attempt to do so by adding the drug MEK162\n      to the treatment plan. MEK162 acts by blocking a protein called MEK 1/2 which helps cancer\n      cells grow and divide. This study will help answer the question of whether MEK162 is a\n      helpful drug in patients with bile duct or gallbladder cancers when given with gemcitabine\n      and cisplatin."
