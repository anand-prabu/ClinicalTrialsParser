      To evaluate the ocular and systemic safety of intravitreal aflibercept injection in patients
      undergoing Pars Plana Vitrectomy for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.

    <textblock>
      Patients who need Pars Plana Vitrectomy surgery, and agree to participate in this study will
      receive an injection of 2.0mg aflibercept 4 to 6 days before Vitrectomy surgery.  Half of
      these patients will be randomized to receive another injection of 2.0mg aflibercept
      immediately after their surgery.  Postoperative patient visits in this study will be at 1
      day, and at weeks 1, 4, 16 and 24, and at any other times as deemed necessary by the
      Investigator.
