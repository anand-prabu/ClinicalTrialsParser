      This study aims to determine the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration of KAE609 in adult male
      patients with acute, uncomplicated  malaria due to  P.falciparum monoinfection after single
      dosing with KAE609

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be a total of approximately 45 patients recruited into this study and six  doses
      of KAE609 will be investigated.The dose groups will run in sequence. Patient will be given a
      single dose of KAE609 and be followed up for 42 days.

    <description>To observe the exposure-response (PK/PD) relationship for a single dose of KAE609. The key parameter is MIC, defined as the concentration at which the relative rate of change in parasitemia is equal to zero. Approximation of MIC will assist in identifying the optimal dose of KAE609, which will be one component of a future combination antimalarial.</description>
