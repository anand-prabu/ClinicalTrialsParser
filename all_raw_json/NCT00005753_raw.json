Subjects were then randomized to one of four interventions: 1) six week\n      Zolpidem intervention (D for drug); 2) six week multifactor behavioral intervention (B  for\n      behavioral); 3) six week conjoint Zolpidem and multifactor behavioral intervention (DB); and\n      4) placebo medication intervention (P for placebo). The main outcome measures were\n      sleep-onset latency as measured by sleep diaries; secondary measures included sleep diary\n      measures of sleep efficiency and total sleep time, objective measures of sleep variables\n      (Nightcap sleep monitor recorder), and measures of daytime functioning."
