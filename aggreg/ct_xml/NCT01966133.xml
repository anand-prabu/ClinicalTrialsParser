  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesise that the use of transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE) after liver resection
      in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma can eradicate residual cancer cells in the liver
      and thus improve survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor. The aim of
      this study is to compare the survival of patients with high risk factors for residual tumor
      undergoing liver resection plus post-operative TACE versus liver resection alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is the mainstay of curative treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
      However, recurrence is common after surgery and most occurs in the liver, especially for the
      patients with high risk factors for residual tumor, such as tumors with a diameter more than
      5 cm, multiple nodules, and microvascular invasion. Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)
      is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the infusion of chemotherapeutic
      agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the hepatic arterial flow using
      small particles. This procedures allows application of smaller dose of chemotherapy
      concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side effects. We conduct a
      randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after hepatectomy in HCC
      patients with high risk factors for residual tumor (tumors with a diameter more than 5 cm,
      multiple nodules, and microvascular invasion).
