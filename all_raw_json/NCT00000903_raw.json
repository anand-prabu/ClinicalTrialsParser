To determine the safety, tolerance, and virologic benefits of either nelfinavir\n      (NFV) or efavirenz (EFV) with indinavir/lamivudine/zidovudine (IDV/3TC/ZDV) vs IDV/3TC/ZDV\n      alone, in the treatment of patients with advanced HIV disease who have received limited or\n      no prior antiretroviral therapy.\n\n      Prior ACTG studies have shown that the 3-drug combination regimen (IDV/ZDV/3TC) resulted in\n      improved clinical outcomes and therefore may prolong the effects of therapy. The enhanced\n      effects seen with combination therapies are likely related to a greater suppression of RNA\n      replication and alterations in resistance patterns. Due to the progressive success of\n      combination regimens, it is possible that more potent regimens will further enhance viral\n      suppression and provide more durable treatment responses. In light of the additive\n      suppression of HIV replication determined by pharmacological, immunological, and virological\n      results, nelfinavir (NFV) as an addition to IDV/ZDV/3TC will be evaluated. Based on the\n      potency of nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) to suppress viral\n      replication and the effectiveness of 3-drug regimens containing NNRTIs, efavirenz (EFV) will\n      also be evaluated as an addition to IDV/ZDV/3TC."
