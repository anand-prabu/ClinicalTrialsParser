These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer\n      cells. ENMD-2076 also works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide\n      the tumor with nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A and\n      tyrosine kinase enzymes from working and stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors\n      may stop growing or shrink."
