To exploit the dependence of tumors on\n      glutamine, CB-839, a potent and selective inhibitor of the first enzyme in glutamine\n      utilization, glutaminase, will be tested in this Phase 1 study in patients with advanced\n      hematologic malignancies.\n\n      This study is an open-label Phase 1 evaluation of CB-839 in subjects with hematological\n      tumors.  Patients will receive CB-839 capsules orally three times daily.  The study will be\n      conducted in 2 parts.  Part 1 is a dose escalation study to identify the recommended Phase 2\n      dose. In Part 2, all patients will receive the recommended Phase 2 dose. Both Parts 1 and 2\n      will enroll patients with advanced and/or treatment-refractory Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma (NHL),\n      Multiple Myeloma (MM), or Waldenstr\u00f6m's macroglobulinemia (WM).  All patients will be\n      assessed for safety, pharmacokinetics (plasma concentration of drug), pharmacodynamics\n      (inhibition of glutaminase), biomarkers (biochemical markers that may predict responsiveness\n      in later studies), and tumor response."
