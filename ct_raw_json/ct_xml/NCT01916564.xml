      This study aims to compare split-dose vs. same-morning whole-dose of 2-litre PEG-ELS plus
      bisacodyl for bowel preparation for morning outpatient colonoscopy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A good bowel preparation regime is one that is not only effective in cleansing the colon but
      should be relatively small in volume and well-tolerated by patients with minimal adverse
      gastrointestinal symptoms. At our centre, reduced-volume 2-litre PEG-ELS plus bisacodyl and
      low fiber diet is used for bowel preparation for patients undergoing colonoscopy. Patients
      undergoing morning outpatient colonoscopy would normally ingest the PEG-ELS and bisacodyl
      the day before. This regime has been shown to be better tolerated by patients without
      compromising the quality of bowel preparation when compared with conventional 4-liter
      PEG-ELS. However, previous study on patient satisfaction found that nearly half of the
      patients attending the outpatient colonoscopy service at our centre were dissatisfied with
      the bowel preparation regime used. Of the seven items considered in the evaluation of
      patient satisfaction, comfort level during bowel preparation was the main cause of
      unfavorable responses. Moreover, a separate study using the same bowel preparation regime at
      our centre found a high percentage of poor quality bowel preparation, which was associated
      with increased technical difficulty and patient discomfort during colonoscopy. There was
      clearly a need for a better bowel preparation regime. Current literature suggests that
      either taking reduced-volume PEG-ELS on the same morning instead of the previous evening, or
      splitting the bowel preparation, would be better. However, whether the former or the latter
      is better, is unknown. The aim of our study was to compare the use of same-morning
      whole-dose reduced-volume PEG-ELS and split-dose reduced-volume PEG-ELS for bowel
      preparation for patients undergoing morning outpatient colonoscopy.
