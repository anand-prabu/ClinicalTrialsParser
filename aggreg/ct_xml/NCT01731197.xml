  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proteins are known to be more satiating than the other macronutrients; however, the type and
      amount of protein needed to induce a significant effect on satiety (fullness between meals)
      is sometimes difficult to determine.  In this study, 2 differentially processed isolated soy
      proteins will be tested for satiety using subjective visual analogue scales.  The amount of
      food consumed following intake of the isolated soy proteins will be measured 3 hours after
      consuming the proteins.  The hypothesis is that differentially processed isolated soy
      proteins will show unique satiety responses.
