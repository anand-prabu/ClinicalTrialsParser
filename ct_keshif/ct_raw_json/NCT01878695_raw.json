It is a\n      common over-the-counter supplement and also is available as an injectable pharmaceutical\n      that protects the liver in cases of acetaminophen overdose. In the exercise physiology\n      literature, both oral and injectable NAC have been shown to reduce fatigue and improve\n      recovery from exertion which has interesting implications for exploring cancer-related\n      fatigue.\n\n      In terms of cancer cell biology, reactive oxygen species (ROS) may play an important role in\n      the development and progression of breast cancer"
