It is not yet known whether radiation therapy plus cisplatin is more effective than\n      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus\n      cisplatin with radiation therapy alone in treating patients with head and neck cancer that\n      has been removed during surgery."

II. Compare the toxicity of concurrent chemoradiotherapy vs.\n      radiotherapy alone in the postoperative setting.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Arm I: Radiotherapy. Involved-field irradiation using Co60, 1-6\n      MV photons, or electrons. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent Chemotherapy. Irradiation\n      as in Arm I; plus Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 438 patients will be entered over approximately 5 years."
