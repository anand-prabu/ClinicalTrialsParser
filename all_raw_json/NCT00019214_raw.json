Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's\n      white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may kill\n      more melanoma cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects and how well giving vaccine\n      therapy and interleukin-2 works compared to vaccine therapy alone in treating patients with\n      metastatic melanoma that has not responded to previous therapy."

Some\n      patients also receive interleukin-2 subcutaneously or IV, over 3-5 days, beginning 24 hours\n      after immunization.\n\n      Cohorts of 2-9 patients receive escalating doses of pulsed dendritic cells IV until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Subsequent cohorts receive cells\n      with or without interleukin-2. One cohort may expand to 15 patients to determine the\n      accuracy of immunologic response to the vaccine.\n\n      One cohort of 11 patients receives cells intralymphatically without interleukin-2 every 3-4\n      weeks for 2 courses. Patients with stable disease or who achieve minor, mixed, or partial\n      response may be retreated.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease undergo a second course of vaccination. Patients\n      who completed treatment with vaccine alone and have stable disease, progressive disease,\n      disease progression after a response, or a partial response with no further improvement may\n      receive 2 additional courses.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-42 patients will be accrued for this study."
