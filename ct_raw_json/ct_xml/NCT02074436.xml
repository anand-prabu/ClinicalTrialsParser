      STUDY BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE:

      Patients with hematological malignancies (blood-related cancers) often develop
      thrombocytopenia (low platelet count), which can be made worse by cancer treatment.

      Preventive (prophylactic) platelet transfusion remains the standard of care for
      thrombocytopenic patients. However, bleeding remains a significant problem in these
      patients, affecting approximately 20% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia and 34-58% of
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. Platelet transfusion refractoriness, the
      repeated failure to obtain satisfactory response to platelet transfusions, is a common
      problem. Alternatives to platelet transfusions are desperately needed for these patients.

      Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) blocks a process called fibrinolysis that is an essential
      step in the bleeding process. EACA is approved by the FDA for the treatment of several
      bleeding-related diseases and complications. A small study has shown EACA to be well
      tolerated and associated with low risk of bleeding in patients with hematological
      malignancies.

      This study will compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion to prevent
      bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.

      STUDY DESCRIPTION:

      This is Phase II study to compare EACA versus standard prophylactic platelet transfusion to
      prevent bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies. Patients who
      are eligible to take part must give their written agreement before they can be enrolled.
      Patients will not receive any treatment as part of this study.

      The study will enroll 100 patients who will be assigned randomly to take EACA twice daily or
      to undergo standard prophylactic platelet transfusion. Patients will be followed for any
      bleeding events, need for platelet transfusion, and any side effects experienced. Patients
      will complete questionnaires to assess their quality of life while on the study.

      Study Treatments: Epsilon aminocaproic acid (EACA) vs. standard prophylactic platelet
      transfusions.

      Study Title: Randomized Trial of Epsilon Aminocaproic Acid versus Platelet Transfusions for
      the Prevention of Bleeding in Thrombocytopenic Patients with Hematological Malignancies.
      (PROBLEMA trial: PRevention Of BLeeding in hEmatological Malignancies with Antifibrinolytic
      agents (epsilon aminocaproic acid).

      Phase: Randomized Phase 2 Eligible Population: Adult patients with acute or chronic
      thrombocytopenia in the setting of  hematological malignancies.

      Summary and Study Rationale: Compare EACA to standard prophylactic platelet transfusion for
      the prevention of bleeding in thrombocytopenic patients with hematological malignancies.

      Study Design: prospective, randomized, controlled trial. Study Endpoints: The primary
      endpoint is to compare the proportion of patients who develop major (grades 3-4) bleeding in
      each arm.

      Diagnosis and Main Inclusion Criteria: Age &gt; 18  with hematological malignancies, Acute or
      chronic thrombocytopenia with platelet counts &lt; 20 x 109/L Number of Patients: 100 patients,
      50 patients in each arm Duration of Patient Participation: 6 months Approximate Duration of
      Study: 3 years Dosage and Administration:1,000 mg twice a day orally Concomitant
      Medications/treatment: Procoagulant agents including DDAVP, recombinant Factor VII or
      prothrombin complex concentrate are prohibited in patients receiving EACA.

      Safety Evaluations, Clinical assessment:  once weekly during the first 30 days and then
      monthly for 6 months, complete blood count and bleeding score twice weekly the first 30
      days, and then according to standard of care.

      Statistical Analysis and Population Analysis:

      Intention to treat (ITT) population: The ITT population includes all patients who are
      randomized to the study. Patients will be stratified and analyzed according to the treatment
      to which they were assigned.

      Safety Population: The safety population includes all patients who have received at least 1
      dose of EACA. Patients included in the safety population will be analyzed according to the
      treatment they received.

      Per-protocol Population: The per-protocol population includes all patients who are
      randomized, receive at least one dose of study drug, and have no major protocol violations
      that could be expected to impact response data.

      Study Endpoints

        -  Primary Endpoint: is to compare at the end of the study, the proportion of patients
           with major bleeding during the study period among patients randomized to receive either
           EACA or standard of care prophylactic platelet transfusions.

        -  Secondary Endpoints include:

             -  proportion of patients with any bleeding during the study period in each arm

             -  the total number of units of platelets transfused in each arm at the end of the
                study

             -  Quality of life as measured  in each arm before the study and at the end of the
                study

             -  Safety in each arm

      Sample Size This randomized, open-label phase II study is designed to compare the proportion
      of patient with major bleeding ever noted during the study. Patients will be assigned to
      receive prophylactic EACA (experimental arm) or prophylactic platelet (standard of care) in
      a 1:1 fashion. Previous studies suggest that the proportions of patients with major bleeding
      will be expected to be 8% and 30% in experimental arm and standard of care arm,
      respectively. With one sided Fisher's exact test, the sample size of 45 patients in each arm
      will achieve a power of 80% at the significance level of 5% to test whether prophylactic
      EACA can prevent major bleeding better than the standard of care. After adjusting for a 10%
      drop out rate, the actual required sample size will be 50 patients per arm. Therefore, the
      total sample size of the study will be 100 patients.

      Efficacy Analysis

        -  Primary Endpoint Analysis will be performed using a one-sided fisher exact test to
           compare the proportions of patients with major bleeding during the whole study between
           the two arms. The significance level is set at 0.05. This primary analysis will be
           based on the ITT population.

        -  Secondary Endpoint Analysis: one-sided t-test will be used to compare the total number
           of any bleeding episode noted during the study between the two arms. Two-sided t-test
           will be employed to compare the total number of units of platelets transfused at the
           end of the study between the two arms. Appropriate statistical tests (Chi-square test,
           t-test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test, etc.) will be conducted to compare the each score of
           the quality of life between the two arms before the study and at the end of the study,
           respectively. The change of each score of the quality of life from before the study to
           the end of the study will also be compared between the two arms.  The safety in each
           arm will be also compared with Fisher's exact test. The analyses of secondary endpoints
           will be performed on the ITT population and the significance level will be kept at 0.05
           for all tests.

      Safety Analysis All patients receiving at least 1 dose of study drug will be considered
      evaluable for safety. Patients will be analyzed for safety according to the treatment which
      they received. Listings of laboratory test results will also be generated, and descriptive
      statistics summarizing the changes in laboratory tests over time will be presented. Exposure
      to study drug over time will also be summarized. The adverse events incidence rates, as well
      as the frequency of occurrence of overall toxicity, categorized by toxicity grades
      (severity) will be described for each treatment arm and be compared between two arms using
      two-sided Chi-square test or t-test.

      Quality of Life Analysis Quality of life and health outcomes measures are being collected
      using EuroQoL instruments before the study and at the end of the study. Means and medians of
      raw scores of these questionnaires will be summarized for each treatment group for each
      domain and be compared between the two arms with t-test or Wilcoxon ranks sum test.

      Interim Analysis An interim analysis is planned after 25 patients in each arm have been
      randomized and their results have been obtained. This interim analysis will focus on the
      primary endpoint, the proportion of patients with major bleeding ever noted during the
      study. To maintain an overall Type I error rate of 0.05 (1-sided), an O'Brien Fleming
      approach will be used which requires a 1-sided p-value &lt; 0.001 at the interim (at 50% of
      total sample size). If this boundary is not crossed at the interim analysis, then the study
      will continue and the final primary analysis will be conducted at the end of the study at
      1-sided significance level of 0.049. If enrollment is sufficiently fast, such that the time
      between when the results of 50% of treated patients have been obtained and when the last
      patient is projected to be randomized is less than 90 days, then the interim analysis will
      not be performed and the final primary analysis will use a 0.05 one-sided significance
      level.
