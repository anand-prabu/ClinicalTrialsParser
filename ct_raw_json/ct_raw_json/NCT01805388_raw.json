Although the protocol addressed in this study is currently being used in clinical\n      practice, there are no prospective clinical trials investigating its efficacy in stimulating\n      continued root development and the nature of the newly formed tissues."

            "textblock": "Twenty subjects with permanent bilateral premolar teeth with incomplete root development and\n      scheduled for extraction due to orthodontic requirement will be treated with a regeneration\n      protocol.  Teeth (n=20/group) will be extracted at 3 months following the regenerative\n      protocol or the pulpectomy control.  The protocol relies on disinfection of the canal space\n      by copious irrigation with common endodontic irrigants and placement of a triple antibiotic\n      paste (regenerative group) or calcium hydroxide dressing (control group) to disinfect the\n      root for a period of one month.  In each patient, both treatment arms will be performed.\n      Thus, each treatment sample will have a contralateral matching control (paired designs). At\n      the end of one month, the intracanal medicaments (triple antibiotic paste) is irrigated out\n      of the canal and a blood clot is stimulated in the canal with the aid of endodontic files\n      that are introduced into the periapical tissues; this blood clot will serve as a scaffold\n      for tissue proliferation within the canal. The regenerative treatment tooth is then restored\n      to prevent bacteria from the oral cavity from re-contaminating the canal space. For the\n      contralateral control tooth, the medication will remain in the tooth until the extraction\n      date. The subjects in this study will have the treated teeth extracted at 3 months after\n      initial treatment. The extracted teeth from each study participant will be placed in storage\n      medium until Immunohistochemical analysis with antibodies to characterize the tissue/cells\n      within the canal."
