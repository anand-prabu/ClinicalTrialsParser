Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy consisting of\n      busulfan and cyclophosphamide followed by bone marrow transplantation in treating patients\n      who have acute or chronic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome."
