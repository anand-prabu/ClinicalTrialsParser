Title: The efficacy of involved-field radiation therapy for residual or locoregionally\n           recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer after definitive treatment; Multi-institutional\n           phase 2 clinical trial\n\n        2. Study period: 2014.04~2018.04\n\n        3. Objective: To determine whether involved-field radiation therapy will prove to be\n           improve 2-year progression free survival for residual or locoregionally recurrent\n           epithelial ovarian cancer patients after definitive treatment.\n\n        4. Patient Selection: primary epithelial ovarian cancer (Required sample size: 70)\n\n        5. Planned number of patients\n\n             -  YUHS database have 149 FIGO stage III patients treated with debulking surgery and\n                adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy 2.\n\n             -  Of these patients, 90 patients experienced locoregional failures, and then the\n                investigators selected 44 patients who could be treated effectively with IFRT\n                based on MDACC suggestion.\n\n             -  Median interval to failure was 9 months in these patients\n\n             -  Hypothesis; IFRT reduces 30% hazard of progression compared with patients without\n                IFRT\n\n             -  Sample size; two-sided, accrual time = 24 mo, f/u time= 36 mo. \u03b1= 0.05, power =\n                0.80 Null progression-free median survival = 9 mo Alt progression-free median\n                survival = 13 mo Calculated sample number = total 64 patients Drop rate = 10% \u2022\n                Total sample number = 70 patients\n\n        6. Radiation therapy: Participants will receive involved-field radiotherapy (external beam\n           radiotherapy or brachytherapy) over 45Gy with 1.8-2.0 Gy fraction, five times per week\n           for residual or locoregionally recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer after definitive\n           treatment\n\n             -  Target volume\n\n                  -  directed to gross disease plus a high-risk clinical target volume (CTV) that\n                     included the postoperative bed or the prechemotherapy extent of disease with\n                     a 1- to 1.5-cm margin, excluding uninvolved clinical structures\n\n                  -  Additional CTVs were designated according to the risks of microscopic disease\n                     spread, proximity to critical structures, and other risk factors for\n                     complications.\n\n                  -  Nodal CTVs included grossly involved lymph node sites, extending to cover\n                     adjacent uninvolved regions.\n\n             -  Modality; 3-dimensional conformal RT including electron, intensity-modulated RT,\n                proton beam RT\n\n        7. Patient assessment: Participants will be followed at 1, 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 month after\n           radiation therapy\n\n        8.
