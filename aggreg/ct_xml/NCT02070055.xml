  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a large variability in people's ability to burn fat during exercise.  It is thought
      that differences in dietary intake can partly explain this variation, however this has not
      been comprehensively studied.  This will be investigated by measuring participant's habitual
      diet and rates of fat oxidation during exercise, and look for associations between the two.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The capacity to oxidize (burn) fat as fuel for exercise may have important implications for
      health and performance. For example, increased fat oxidation could help to induce a negative
      fat balance and over time improve body composition.  Furthermore, increasing the oxidation
      of fat could spare carbohydrate utilization during exercise which should improve endurance
      performance by preserving the bodies limited carbohydrate reserves for the latter stages of
      competition.  Interestingly, there is substantial individual variation in the balance of
      fuels used for energy during exercise and in particular the maximal capacity to oxidize fat
      (MFO).  Whilst habitual diet is known to affect the metabolic response to exercise, the
      influence of nutrition on the individual variability observed in maximal fat oxidation has
      not been comprehensively studied.

      Therefore, the proposed investigation aims to build on current understanding of how various
      nutritional factors influence MFO during exercise. Based on previous small intervention
      studies, it is suspected that energy balance and macronutrient content or distribution may
      exert the strongest influence on MFO during exercise. Specifically, the main hypothesis
      would be that negative energy balance; higher fat intake and/or low carbohydrate intake
      would be the strongest positive influencer's of MFO. Nonetheless, the determination of an
      array of habitual and acute nutrient intake data in a relatively large cohort of healthy
      individuals will enable an insight into the influence of a comprehensive array of nutrients
      on MFO during exercise. With a greater understanding of the nutritional factors that
      influence MFO during exercise, new nutritional interventions can be designed to promote the
      oxidation of fat for improved health and performance.
