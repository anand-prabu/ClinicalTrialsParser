    <textblock>
      The purpose of this mechanism of action study is to evaluate the effect of oral GS-6615 on
      the QTc interval in participants with Long QT-3 syndrome. This study will be performed in
      five cohorts of participants in a sequential manner, four single-dose cohorts followed by
      one multiple-dose cohort.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants in the single-dose cohorts (Cohorts 1-4) will be admitted 2 days prior to study
      drug administration (Day -2), and remain in clinic for predose assessments on Day -1, study
      drug administration on Day 1, postdose assessments for 3 days (Days 2-4), and be discharged
      on Day 4.

      Participants in the multiple-dose cohort (Cohort 5) will be admitted 3 days prior to study
      drug administration (Day -3), and remain in clinic for predose assessments on Day -2 and Day
      -1, study drug administration from Day 1 through Day 7, postdose assessments for 5 days
      (Days 8-12) and be discharged on Day 12.

      Follow-up contact to assess adverse events (AEs) and concomitant medications will be
      performed 3 and 10 days after discharge on the following days:

        -  Cohorts 1-4 follow-up will occur on Day 7 (+2 days) and Day 14 (+2 days).

        -  Cohort 5 follow-up will occur on Day 15 (+2 days) and Day 22 (+2 days).

      Subjects will be continuously monitored using real-time telemetry throughout the in-clinic
      confinement. Physical examinations including vital signs, laboratory analysis,
      electrocardiograms (ECGs), Holter recordings and echocardiography (ECHO) will be performed
      at defined time points throughout the study period. Assessment of AEs and concomitant
      medications will continue throughout the duration of the study.
