            "textblock": "There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating that polyphenols and specially the most\n      investigated Resveratrol contained in the Red Grape Cells (RGC) exert beneficial effects on\n      several markers of metabolic syndrome i.e.   antioxidant, anti-inflammatory,\n      anti-atherosclerotic, vasodilator and antihypertensive activity.\n\n      Many of this beneficial metabolic effects of polyphenols, occurs via activation of sirtuin-1\n      or silent information regulator-1 gene (SIRT1). This  gene  is  expressed in adipose tissue,\n      muscle, endothelium, peripheral  blood  cells, etc  where it plays a pivotal role in the\n      regulation  of  Circadian Clock Genes (CCG)  involved in glucose lipid metabolism,\n      endothelial  function, etc .\n\n      By  activation  of SIRT1 and  CCG the polyphenols, may  influence the circadian secretion of\n      adiponectin, insulin, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and other hormones that  influence\n      insulin sensitivity, muscular  glucose uptake, NO  synthesis, nocturnal  hepatic glucose\n      production, lipolisis  and  endothelial  function It  was  shown  in several  studies in\n      animals and in clinical studies in subjects with metabolic syndrome that  SIRT1 expression\n      and  its  regulation of the CCG, improves insulin sensitivity in skeletal muscle, preventing\n      weight gain; improves pancreatic beta-cell function enhancing insulin secretion and glucose\n      tolerance.  It was associated with increased lipolisis in white adipose tissue, decreased\n      glycolysis, increased fatty acid oxidation in skeletal muscle and with increase Nitric Oxide\n      in the endothelium.\n\n      Given that polyphenols directly on the clock genes or by enhancing SIRT1 expression appears\n      to counter some of the effects of a high-fat diet, obesity and metabolic syndrome, by\n      protecting against insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia and endothelial\n      dysfunction.\n\n      It rise the possibility that the polyphenols contained in Red Grape Cells (RGC)   by\n      activation SIRT1 may also exert beneficial  effects  in subjects affected  by type 2\n      diabetes"
