The groups were: 1) 400 kcal\n      box lunch; 2) 800 kcal box lunch; 3) 1600 kcal box lunch; or 4) no box lunch. Participants\n      were required to pick up a box lunch every week day for six months. Control participants did\n      not receive a box lunch and were instructed to eat their usual lunch. Participants were\n      weighed and dietary intake measured at baseline, one, three and six months. It was\n      hypothesized that at six months, participants in the 1600 kcal box lunch would gain more\n      weight and have higher energy intake than those in the other groups."
