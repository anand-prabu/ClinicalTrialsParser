The diagnostic component will include\n      evaluation of the inflow artery, arterial anastomosis and full length of the fistula vein or\n      graft, plus venous return up to the heart.  The location, vessel size, lesion diameter and\n      percent stenosis for each lesion will be recorded.   Enrollment and randomization will occur\n      at this point.\n\n      All patients will then receive standard therapy for their stenosis.  This will include\n      intravenous heparin administered in a standard dose of 70 units/kg.  Lesions that respond\n      poorly to angioplasty (>30% residual stenosis after angioplasty treatment with 2 inflations)\n      will be stented.  Stent selection will be based on clinical setting.  Initial stent\n      treatment will utilize an uncovered nitinol stent.  Treatment of in-stent restenosis will\n      include initial balloon angioplasty, and use of a covered stent (Viabahn, GORE, or Fluency,\n      Bard).  Documentation of location and type of treatment for each lesion treated will be\n      recorded.\n\n      Once standard treatment is completed, the operating surgeon will be informed of the patient\n      randomization: treatment (paclitaxel) or control.  For subjects assigned to treatment, the\n      whole fistula vein outflow segment of the fistula will be treated with paclitaxel.\n\n      A TAPAS infusion catheter will be used for all paclitaxel dose administrations. The volume\n      of drug to be administered will be calculated by the length of the lesion and size of vessel\n      to be treated.  After the full outflow vein segment is treated, the fistulogram is completed\n      in the standard fashion. Prior to removal of the sheath, a final angiographic study of all\n      areas treated is performed to document patency and lesion appearance.\n\n      For the control group, instead of paclitaxel administration, a sham treatment period of 10\n      minutes is allowed to elapse followed by the performance of the final completion angiogram.\n      Any additional lesions identified with this study are then treated appropriately following\n      standard technique.\n\n      All patients will follow the same follow up evaluation schedule."
