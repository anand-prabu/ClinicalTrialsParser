When analyses focus\n      on patients with ER+/Her2-negative breast cancer, with \u22654N+, 30% had relapsed at 5 years,\n      emphasizing the need for new drugs in this setting (PACS01 data, UNICANCER internal data).\n\n      Strong evidence suggests that cross-talk between the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase\n      (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway and ER signaling is linked to\n      hormone resistance in breast cancer patients.\n\n      In the present study, we plan to evaluate the benefit from adding everolimus to standard\n      endocrine treatments after three years of treatment for patient ER+/HER2- at high risk of\n      relapse due to high nodes involvement (\u22654) and/or persistent node involvement after\n      neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.\n\n      This study is a unique opportunity to prove the efficacy of everolimus in adjuvant setting.\n      The study could be practice changing in case of positive results and could allow improving\n      outcome of breast cancer patients presenting high risk of metastatic relapse."
