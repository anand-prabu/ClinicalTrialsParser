The RG012-01 study will collect data to characterize the progression of\n      renal dysfunction in Alport syndrome patients.\n\n      Patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Alport syndrome who have GFR between 30-75 mL/min\n      (inclusive) will be considered for enrollment.  The sequential sampling of subjects' urine\n      and/or blood will allow an assessment of the rate of change of established clinical\n      endpoints, such as GFR and/or the rate of change of other renal biomarkers (proteinuria and\n      \u03b2-2 microglobulin) in subjects whose renal function is steadily declining.  The\n      identification of surrogate markers that track the decline of renal function and could\n      correlate with time to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is a key goal of the natural history\n      study."

Assessments and blood and urine sample collection\n      will be performed at Baseline and every 6 weeks thereafter, for up to 24 months.  Scheduling\n      of clinic visits will take in to consideration the timing of Standard of Care (SOC) visits.\n      Alternative arrangements may be made to enable subjects to schedule a home nurse visit for\n      study procedures instead of certain clinic visits. Remaining blood and urine aliquots will\n      be stored and may be used in the future for the discovery, analysis, verification and/or\n      validation of other biomarkers or test for renal disease.  The samples will be kept for up\n      to five years.  Each sample will be identified only by it's barcode number and will not be\n      individually identifiable."
