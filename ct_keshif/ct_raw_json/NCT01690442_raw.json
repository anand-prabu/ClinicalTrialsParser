There is a\n      race to develop and implement effective HIV preventive interventions for IDUs and their\n      sexual partners to stem the spread of HIV, HCV and other STIs in Almaty, Shu and other\n      Central Asian towns along drug trafficking routes. The proposed study will test the\n      effectiveness of a couplesbased HIV/STI risk reduction intervention to decrease new cases of\n      HIV and Hepatitis C (HCV) and incidence of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), as well\n      as to reduce unsafe injection practices and increase condom use among injecting drug users\n      (IDUs) and their heterosexual, intimate partners in Kazakhstan."

Central Asia has experienced one of the fastest growing HIV/AIDS\n      epidemics due to a sharp increase in injection drug use. For the proposed study, the\n      participants will be 400 IDUs and their heterosexual intimate partners. These 400 couples\n      will be randomized to one of two interventions: a 5session couplesbased HIV/STI risk\n      reduction intervention or a 5session couplesbased wellness promotion intervention, which\n      will serve as a control condition. Participants will be assessed with repeated measures at\n      baseline, 3, 6, and 12months postintervention. The primary behavioral outcomes are\n      selfreported proportion of injection acts in which needles or syringes are shared in the\n      past 90 days and proportion of condom protected acts of sexual intercourse in the past 90\n      days. The primary biological outcomes are the rate of new HIV and HCV cases, and the\n      cumulative incidence of Chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis over the 12month postintervention\n      period. The proposed study will advance the understanding of HIV/HCV/STI risk reduction\n      among IDUs and thereby may help to stem the rising epidemic of HIV, HCV, and STIs in\n      Kazakhstan and Central Asia."
