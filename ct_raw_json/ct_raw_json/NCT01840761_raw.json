(aSAH) perioperative\n      delayed vasospasm (CVS) is the bottleneck to restrict the long-term effect. Since there is\n      no standard clinical treatment programs, limiting the advantages and characteristics of\n      traditional Chinese medicine to play.Guangdong Provincial Hospital of TCM is the province's\n      Medical Center encephalopathy,  treated 100 brain aneurysm patients each year, more than 80\n      times craniotomies and surgical interventions , with a rich source of patiengs to carry out\n      the study. In this study, on the basis studies on hemorrhagic stroke of a yin and yang\n      syndrome and comprehensive treatment programe of the State 1995,the 15th research , in\n      accordance with  characteristics of the pathophysiology and understanding of cause and\n      pathogenesis in aSAH perioperative period , through expert advice and review of the\n      literature, under the guidance of Liu Maocai who isChinese medicine practitioners of\n      Guangdong province , from diagnosis, diagnosis and treatment,prescription drugs, and other\n      aspects of efficacy evaluation, developmenting a standardized treatment program of  delayed\n      CVS after aSAH . To evaluate the efficacy of the standardized program by prospective,\n      randomized,controlled clinical trial,improving the postoperative results, reducting\n      significantly the mortality and morbidity patients with cerebral aneurysms."
