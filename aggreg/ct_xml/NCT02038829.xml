      This is a randomized, six-way crossover study to determine the efficacy and dose-response
      profile of SUN101. The study population will consist of subjects 40 to 65 years-old
      (inclusive), with a diagnosis of moderate to severe COPD. Aclidinium bromide 400 mcg bid
      will be given as an active comparator. The study will be double-blind for SUN-101 and
      placebo and will be open-label for aclidinium.

             least 1 pack/day for 10 years, or equivalent).

          4. Post bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) FEV1 ≥ 40% and ≤
             70% of predicted normal during Screening.

          5. Post bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) FEV1/FVC ratio ≤
             0.70 during Screening.

          6. Post bronchodilator (following inhalation of ipratropium bromide) improvement in FEV1
             ≥ 12% and ≥ 100 mL during Screening.

          7. Ability to perform reproducible spirometry according to the American Thoracic Society
             (ATS) and European Respiratory Society (ERS) guidelines (2005).

          8. Female of child bearing potential (only) must have a negative serum pregnancy test at

             participation. Females of childbearing potential must be instructed to and agree to
             avoid pregnancy during the study. Female subjects of child bearing potential must use
             an adequate method of birth control from Screening until 30 days after receiving
             study drug and use contraception in addition to their partners using a barrier
             method. Acceptable forms of contraception are as follows:

             assessments/procedures.

             including but not limited to cardiovascular disease, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             failure, uncontrolled hypertension, life threatening arrhythmias, uncontrolled
             diabetes, neurologic or neuromuscular disease, liver disease, gastrointestinal
             disease or electrolyte abnormalities.

          2. Current evidence or history of a clinically significant abnormality of cardiac rhythm

          3. Primary diagnosis of asthma.

          4. History of malignancy of any organ system, treated or untreated within the past 5
             years, with the exception of localized basal cell carcinoma of the skin.

         12. Prolonged QTcF interval (males &gt; 450 msec and females &gt;470 msec) during Screening, or
             history of long QT syndrome.

         13. Recent history (previous 12 months) of excessive use or abuse of alcohol or
             narcotic/illegal drugs.
