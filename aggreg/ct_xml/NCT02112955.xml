      The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a nurse-led self-efficacy enhancing
      stroke self-management program on recovery of community-dwelling stroke survivors.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous systematic reviews showed that theory-based stroke self-management programs had
      potential benefits in improving stroke survivors' quality of life and self-efficacy. However
      there is a lack of evidence evaluating the effectiveness of a nurse-led theory-based stroke
      self-management program among community-dwelling Chinese stroke survivors.

      This is a parallel group, single-blinded, randomized controlled trial to be held in a
      community center. All participants will be assessed at two time-points (baseline before
      randomization, and one month after program completion). Eligible participants will be
      randomly allocated to either the control group (receiving usual care) or the intervention
      group (receiving the self-efficacy enhancing stroke self-management program). Participants
      in the intervention group will receive an additional assessment on usefulness of the program
      immediately after program completion.
