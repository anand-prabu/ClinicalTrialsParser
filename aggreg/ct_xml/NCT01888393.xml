        Inclusion Criteria:

        Group A: Subjects with Moderate Hepatic Impairment

          -  Male and female 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Satisfy the criteria for moderate hepatic impairment defined as a Child Pugh total
             score of 7 to 9 (Child Pugh Class B) at the Screening Visit

          -  Willing and able to comply with schedule visits, treatment, laboratory tests, and
             contraceptive guidelines.

        Group B: Healthy subjects

          -  Male and female 18 to 65 years of age (inclusive)

          -  Healthy subjects with no clinically relevant abnormalities identified by a detailed
             medical history, complete physical examination, including blood pressure and pulse
             rate measurement, standard 12-lead ECG, and clinical laboratory tests

          -  Willing and able to comply with schedule visits, treatment, laboratory tests,
             contraceptive guidelines and other study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Group A: Subjects with Moderate Hepatic Impairment

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the

             subject

          -  Have fluctuating or rapidly deteriorating hepatic function by history or as indicated
             by significant variations in or worsening of clinical and/or laboratory signs of
             hepatic impairment within 6 months before the Screening Visit

          -  Other causes of hepatic impairment not related to parenchymal disorder and/or disease
             of the liver

          -  Severe hepatic encephalopathy

          -  Type 1 diabetes mellitus or evidence of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes

          -  Solid organ or bone marrow transplantation

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption, drug abuse or regular smoking

        Group B: Healthy subjects

          -  History of any illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, might confound the
             results of the study or pose an additional risk in administering study drug(s) to the
             subject
