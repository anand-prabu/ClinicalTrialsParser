  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive disorder of the lung
      parenchyma and airways, which is the third-leading cause of death in the USA.  Current
      therapies for COPD are only partially effective and may also have side effects.  Although
      increasing evidence indicates that quercetin supplementation may be beneficial in treating
      COPD, key methodological issues have not been resolved. The overall objective of this study
      is to determine the dosage of quercetin supplementation, bioavailability of quercetin,
      safety, dose-response relationship and appropriate biomarkers which reflect clinical
      outcomes in patients with COPD that is necessary for conducting large clinical trials in
      this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In our preclinical study, we have demonstrated that 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin
      levels significantly decreased lung inflammation and prevented progression. Clinical studies
      in healthy volunteers 4 fold increase in plasma quercetin levels (0.22 to 1 ÂµM) could be
      achieved by supplementing with 500mg of quercetin/day. However, safety of quercetin
      supplementation and quercetin dose required to achieve 4 fold increases in plasma quercetin
      levels in 'at-high-risk' COPD population is yet to be established. This study involves two
      phases; the first phase examines the safety of quercetin supplementation in subjects with
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and the second phase determines the efficacy of
      quercetin in COPD patients. In this study, we will enroll COPD patients with mild to
      moderate disease between the age group of 40 to 65 years.  During the first phase, we will
      enroll a total of 9 patients to examine the tolerance and safety of three doses of quercetin
      (500, 1000 and 2000 mg/day) in a dose escalation manner. First cohort consisting of three
      subjects will receive placebo or 500 mg of quercetin per day for one week and the safety of
      quercetin supplementation will be assessed by monitoring adverse events and any changes in
      outcomes of blood test that include complete blood counts (CBC)and comprehensive metabolic
      panel prior to after supplementation. If this dose is safe and tolerated, second cohort of 3
      subjects will receive placebo or 1000 mg of quercetin per day quercetin for one week and
      again safety will be assessed.  If the dose is safely tolerated, the third cohort will
      receive either placebo or 2000 mg of quercetin per day for a week and the safety will be
      assessed. Based on this initial study, we will choose the highest quercetin dose tolerated
      with no adverse events and the dose (500 mg of quercetin per day) that was found to increase
      plasma quercetin levels by 4 fold over baseline in healthy volunteers to examine the
      efficacy of quercetin in reducing inflammatory and oxidative stress markers and improving
      lung function in COPD subjects. In the second phase, we will enroll a total of 75 subjects
      and randomized into three arms; placebo (15 subjects) or one of the two doses of quercetin
      (30 subjects per arm). All enrolled subjects will be asked to avoid quercetin rich foods
      throughout the study period. One week after enrollment (run-in), subjects will be either
      supplemented with either placebo or one of the two doses of quercetin for 4 weeks. All
      participants will be blinded for study agents. Plasma and sputum quercetin levels, lung
      function, and markers of oxidative stress and inflammation will be determined at the start
      of the study (following run-in period), at the end of 4 weeks treatment period.
