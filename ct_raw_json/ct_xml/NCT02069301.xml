    <textblock>
      The study evaluates LIFE-DM, an integrated microfinance and collaborative care intervention
      by comparing it to enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline antidepressant care and
      referral to microfinance resources) in Vietnam. Intervention effects at baseline, 3 month,
      and 6 month follow-up on patient outcomes, including depression, anxiety, quality of life,
      functioning, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and income will be compared across the two
      conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is one of the largest contributors to the world's health burden. Prior work in
      the Partners in Care study has shown that evidence-based service delivery programs for
      depression can improve health outcomes in depressed patients, and especially in minorities,
      largely overcoming disparities in outcomes from care between whites and minorities.
      Effective treatments exist, but they do not reach many depressed individuals, especially in
      resource-poor communities--ethnic minorities, rural residents in the United States, and
      individuals in most of the developing world.

      Women, in particular, are at risk for depression and poverty. Integrating programs that
      treat depression and address livelihood concerns may improve engagement in depression
      treatment and improve mental health and functioning for patients in low-resource settings.
      The proposed study would integrate depression care with existing &quot;microfinance&quot; programs,
      which provide poverty-alleviation services including small loans, savings programs, and
      vocational training to women.

      This project will (1) conduct qualitative studies of barriers and facilitators of women's
      successful use of existing depression care and microfinance programs; (2) adapt and
      integrate the depression care and microfinance services; (3) train Women's Union
      facilitators to deliver the integrated depression care and microfinance program; and conduct
      evaluation of LIFE-DM program to assess acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary
      effectiveness. The non-randomized control trial compares the integrated microfinance and
      collaborative care intervention with enhanced treatment as usual (national guideline
      antidepressant care and referral to microfinance resources) at the Women's Union in Danang
      city in Vietnam.
