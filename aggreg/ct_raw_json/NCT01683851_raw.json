Determine changes in pulse rate\n\n        2. Determine changes in SpO2\n\n        3. Recognize breath sound's changes possibly associated with airway blockage\n\n        4. Evaluate if the isolite\u00ae system is well tolerate by the pediatric population for dental\n           treatment under conscious sedation\n\n        5. Relate the use of Isolite\u00ae with the frequency of head reposition to open the airway."

The most commonly used was pedo 65% (13) and small 35% (7). Eighty percent (16) of sedations had a satisfactory experience with Isolite \u00ae, Twenty percent (4) had unsatisfactory outcome due to disruptive behavior. Of these 4 cases 2 patients were medicated with meperidine + hydroxyzine and the other 2 with midazolam.\nFifty percent (8) of the patients successfully treated with Isolite \u00ae experienced snoring and head reposition was performed to open airway. The level of sedation according to the AAPD guidelines was moderate in these events in which snoring occurred. The concentration of nitrous oxide-oxygen was adjusted so that more oxygen was given and the patient would be more alert. No significant changes in SpO2 (mean 99.8) or pulse were observed (mean 90.6).",
