[Lapointe, Vita, and Mendes]. Epidemiologic studies\n      suggest that higher polyphenol intake from fruits and vegetables is associated with\n      decreased risk for cardiovascular disease. Among the numerous plausible mechanisms by which\n      polyphenols may offer cardiovascular protection, improvement of the endothelial function and\n      inhibition of angiogenesis and cell migration and proliferation in blood vessels have been\n      the focuses of recent studies. Antioxidants in polyphenols, in addition to protecting LDL\n      cholesterol against oxidation, may act at a vascular cell level by limiting cellular\n      production of reactive oxygen species, and, thus, cell-mediated LDL oxidation. In\n      traditional Indian medicine, the gooseberry (Phyllanthus emblica) has been used for\n      thousands of years as an effective source of polyphenols and antioxidants. \"P. emblica is\n      considered beneficial against various diseases namely cancer, diabetes, liver treatment, and\n      various other diseases.\"[Hiraganahalli]. Capros\u00ae, from Natreon, Inc., is a cascading\n      antioxidant ingredient derived from Phyllanthus emblica. It has been used in cosmetics and\n      food-and-beverage formulations in many countries, and, based on extensive scientific\n      research, also shows particular promise as a dietary supplement."
