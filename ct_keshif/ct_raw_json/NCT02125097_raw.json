Subject has a life-threatening allergy to contrast media (unless treatment for\n             allergy can be tolerated).\n\n          6. Subject has a known cardiac disorder, likely to be associated with cardio-embolic\n             symptoms such as atrial fibrillation (AFIB).\n\n          7. Subject has any condition, which in the opinion of the treating physician, would\n             place the subject at a high risk of embolic stroke.\n\n          8. Subject is currently participating in another clinical research study.\n\n          9. Subject has had a previous intracranial stenting procedure associated with the target\n             aneurysm.\n\n         10. Subject is unable to complete the required follow-up.\n\n         11.
