Approximately, 24\n      healthy volunteers will be enrolled in the study. Eligible volunteers will be randomly\n      allocated to either Sequence A group or Sequence B group. On Day 1, volunteers from Sequence\n      A group will receive imported mizolastine tablets and volunteers from Sequence B group will\n      receive domestic mizolastine tablets. There will be a washout period (no treatment) of 7\n      Days. On Day 8, the two sequence groups will be switched. Volunteers from Sequence A group\n      will receive domestic mizolastine and volunteers from Sequence B group will receive imported\n      mizolastine tablets. Safety evaluations will include assessments of adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination, which will be\n      measured throughout the study. The maximum study duration for each volunteer will be\n      approximately 16 days."
