      To identify risk factors for aggressiveness in Squamous Cell Carcinoma of the skin in organ
      transplant recipients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous Cell Carcinomas (SCC) are one of the most common skin cancers. They belong to the
      epithelial neoplasm of the skin, which manifest a local aggressive growth and have potential
      for metastasis. Organ transplant recipients have a hundredfold higher incidence of SCC.

      Unfortunately the primary tumor, regional nodes, metastasis (TNM)-Classification for the
      prognosis of SCC in this group of patient has not yet been established. Therefore there are
      no standardised criteria for evaluation of local recurrence or prognosis.

      The aim of this study is to identify criteria, which permit a risk assessment relating to
      aggressiveness of SCC.
