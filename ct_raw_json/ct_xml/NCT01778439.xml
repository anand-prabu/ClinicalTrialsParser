             activation status.

          6. Must have received their last chemotherapy, biologic, radiotherapy, or
             investigational therapy at least 4 weeks prior to enrollment; 6 weeks if the last

                  subjects with Gilbert's syndrome)

               -  AST (SGOT) and ALT (SGPT) &lt;3 X institutional ULN (for subjects with hepatic
                  involvement &lt;5 X institutional ULN but cannot be associated with elevated
                  bilirubin)

               -  PT/INR and aPTT within 1.5 X institutional ULN

               -  Creatinine &lt;1.5 X institutional ULN OR

               -  Creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels
                  above institutional normal

               -  Normal Ejection Fraction (&gt;50%) on ECHO scan or MUGA

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have had a prior hysterectomy or have a negative
             serum pregnancy test and be using adequate contraception prior to study entry and
             must agree to use adequate contraception from study entry through at least 6 months
             after discontinuation of study drug.  Men must also agree to use adequate
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry and from study entry through at least 6 months after discontinuation of
             study drug.  Should a woman enrolled in the study or a female partner of a man
             enrolled in the study become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating
             in this study or within 6 months after discontinuation of study, she should inform
             the Investigator immediately.
