            "textblock": "Control of blood glucose levels is beneficial during pregnancy, however, the ability to\n      effectively monitor patient's blood glucose levels is challenging and time consuming for\n      patients and care providers.  Patients must keep track of their own glucose levels and take\n      the initiative to check blood glucose multiple times per day.  Traditionally, patients\n      record their glucose levels in a logbook, which they bring with them during an office visit\n      or use to report their glucose levels over the phone.  Non compliance and factitious\n      reporting are not uncommon. Obstetricians and or diabetes program staff spend hours\n      communicating with patients to obtain and record glucose values therefore alternatives to\n      phone calls are needed.\n\n      We performed a prospective randomized cross over study comparing a conventional voicemail\n      (control) system for home glucose reporting with a cell phone/internet reporting system\n      (Confidant). The primary outcome measure was compliance with fingerstick blood glucose\n      reporting. Compliance was determined by the number of fingersticks reported / expected (%).\n      The secondary outcome was patient satisfaction. Subjects were participants in the Kapiolani\n      Medical Center for Women and Children's diabetes in pregnancy program known as \"A Sweeter\n      Choice\". IRB approval was obtained before starting the study and all subjects received\n      informed consent. The study was funded by Hawai'i Medical Service Association, a medical\n      insurance company in Hawaii. The Confidant equipment was supplied by Hookele Personal Health\n      Planners, LLC. None of the Ho'okele or Hawaii Medical Service Association staff were\n      involved in data collection or analysis. Subjects were randomized to Confidant or the\n      control system at the entry into the diabetes program during consultation with the Maternal\n      Fetal Medicine physician. After randomization, subjects performed the assigned monitoring\n      system for 3 weeks. After three weeks, they switched to the other monitoring system. A\n      satisfaction survey was completed after three weeks on the second system was completed."
