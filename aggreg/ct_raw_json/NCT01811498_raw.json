            "textblock": "The high-grade malignant brain tumors, glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), comprise the majority\n      of all primary brain tumors in adults.  This group of tumors also exhibits the most\n      aggressive behavior, resulting in median overall survival of only 9-12 months. Initial\n      therapy consists of either surgical resection, external beam radiation, or both.  All\n      patients experience a recurrence after first-line therapy, so improvements in both\n      first-line and salvage therapy are critical to enhancing quality-of-life and prolonging\n      survival.  It is unknown if currently used intravenous (IV) therapies even cross the blood\n      brain barrier (BBB). We have shown in a previous phase I trial that a single Superselective\n      Intraarterial Cerebral Infusion (SIACI) of Bevacizumab (up to 15mg/kg) is safe and effective\n      in the treatment of recurrent GBM.  Therefore, this phase I/II clinical research trial is an\n      extension of that trial in that we seek to test the hypothesis that repeated dosing of\n      intra-arterial Bevacizumab is safe and effective in the treatment of newly diagnosed\n      malignant glioma.  By achieving the aims of this study we will also determine if repeated\n      intra-arterial Bevacizumab improves progression free and overall survival in newly diagnosed\n      patients.  We expect that this project will provide important information regarding the\n      utility of repeated SIACI Bevacizumab therapy for malignant glioma, and may alter the way\n      these drugs are delivered to our patients in the near future."
