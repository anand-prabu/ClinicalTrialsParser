In addition to assessing self-report of pain and\n      other symptoms, the investigators also propose to perform experimental somatic pain testing\n      to determine if there is evidence of peripherally-maintained central sensitization in\n      children with FAP.  The investigators also hypothesize that there will be an increase in\n      somatic pain threshold after completion of a Cyproheptadine course compared to baseline\n      testing prior to treatment, and compared to placebo.  This would allow children with FAP to\n      return to normal function, improve symptoms and overall general well-being"
