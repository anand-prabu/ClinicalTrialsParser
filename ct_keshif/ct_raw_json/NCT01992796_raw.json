In addition to direct effects on vascular tone, ANG II affects\n      multiple aspects of microvascular function through promotion of leukostasis, induction of\n      capillary permeability and depletion of glutathione. Binding of ANG II to its receptors (in\n      particular AT1) mediates intracellular free radical generation that contributes to tissue\n      damage by promoting mitochondrial dysfunction.\n\n      Angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) interrupt renin-angiotensin system (RAS) overactivity\n      by blocking a specific receptor that mediates the pathogenic activity of angiotensin II.\n      Objectives: The clinical question objective of this study is if the antiinflammatory effect\n      of ARBs is relevant in sepsis management and in particular if ARBs are able to improve\n      survival and reduce the incidence of Multi Organ Failure in septic patients.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      STUDY DESIGN: Experimental; prospective, randomized, multicenter, phase III trial.\n\n      STUDY POPULATION: Three hundred adults within 12 hrs of recognition of severe sepsis, with\n      Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II-predicted risk of mortality\n      between 20% and 80% are eligible.\n\n      Settings: 5 Italian Intensive Care Units.
