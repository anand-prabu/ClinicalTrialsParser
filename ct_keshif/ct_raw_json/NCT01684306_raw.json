In our study, we will investigate the use\n      of modafinil which, in recent years, has been proposed as cognitive enhancer.  Modafinil\n      appears to have less side effects compared to amphetamine-like drugs and we will analyzed\n      whether the drug can influence cognitive performances and the brain resting state network\n      activity of healthy young subjects."
