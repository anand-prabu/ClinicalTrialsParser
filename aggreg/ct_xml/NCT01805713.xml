    <textblock>
      Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common autosomal recessive genetic disease in Caucasians.
      It results in lung disease that affects quality of life and causes early death.  Lung damage
      from CF starts in infancy and continues over time.  Lung damage can negatively affect how
      the lung functions.  It would be ideal to measure lung damage in CF patients in three
      instances: (1) During the first year of life after diagnosis by state newborn screening
      programs, (2) In children and adults over long periods of time (years), and (3) During times
      of illness (pulmonary exacerbation), to allow for better treatment and therapy to prevent
      loss of lung function.  The lung is made of elastin, collagen and cartilage.  When the lung
      is damaged by CF, these components break down into pieces that can be measured in urine,
      sputum and blood.  These products may represent markers of lung injury.  We believe that the
      levels of these markers will be increased over time in CF patients and even higher in
      patients who are sick with lung symptoms.  The goal of my research is to measure the amount
      of lung breakdown products in urine, sputum and blood in infants, children and adults with
      CF during times when well and also during times of illness.  I also hope to use new
      technologies involving the study of proteins and metabolites in samples like sputum, urine
      and blood to help provide new information regarding CF lung disease.  These studies will
      help us to better treat CF lung disease.

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational cohort study of two CF populations (and appropriate
      control populations):

      Infants with CF Diagnosed by Newborn Screen:  The purpose of this prospective cohort study
      is to measure concentrations of biomarkers of lung injury in urine, blood and bronchial
      alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from CF infants.  We plan to characterize these concentrations
      during the first two years of life with the goal of determining if their profiles alone or
      in combination are potentially useful biomarkers of early lung disease in CF.

      Each CF infant enrolled has blood, urine and BALF samples, along with an oropharyngeal swab
      (throat culture) in conjunction with infant lung function testing at approximately 6 months
      of age and again at one year.  Our CF Center performs infant Pulmonary Function Tests
      (PFT's), throat culture and a blood draw as part of routine care at 6 months and at one year
      of age, so the bronchoscopy and urine collection are obtained for research purposes only.
      Urine is collected quarterly during routine outpatient clinic visits to the CF Center (4
      samples total/year for two years) which is also for research purposes only.  During the
      second year of the study, urine, blood and throat swab sample collection plus lung function
      testing continue as per year one.  In the event of a hospitalization for pulmonary
      exacerbation, blood and urine samples are obtained at three time points during
      hospitalization and BALF samples are obtained via bronchoscopy upon admission.  An
      oropharyngeal culture is also obtained upon admission.  Subsequent hospitalizations for
      pulmonary exacerbation are recorded with the same samples collected as described above.  In
      the event of an outpatient exacerbation requiring antibiotic therapy, the patient will be
      asked to provide a urine sample at the onset of exacerbation.  Normal CF treatment or care
      is not altered in any way by participation in this study.

      We collect urine only from age-matched healthy infants as a control group for comparison.

      Subjects with CF â‰¥ 8 Years of Age: The purpose of this prospective cohort study is to
      measure concentrations of biomarkers of lung injury in urine, blood and sputum from CF
      patients. This is an observational study that does not involve a specific treatment or
      intervention.   We plan to characterize these concentrations during two years of both
      clinically stable time points as well during hospitalizations and outpatient treatments for
      pulmonary exacerbations. The study goal is determining if these profiles alone or in
      combination are potentially useful biomarkers of early lung disease in CF.

      All study participants (CF Exacerbation Group and CF Non-Exacerbation Group) are asked to
      provide urine, blood and sputum samples, as well as pulmonary function tests, during their
      regularly scheduled quarterly CF Clinic visits over the study period.  Quarterly lung
      function testing is standard of care for all CF patients. For those patients in the CF
      Exacerbation group, subjects are asked to provide three urine, blood and sputum samples as
      well as three sets of pulmonary function before during and after an inpatient
      hospitalization for a pulmonary exacerbation. We incorporate PFT's, and labs done as part of
      their hospital admission whenever possible, to avoid duplicate testing. All hospitalized
      patients will receive their routine, standard-of-care therapies including airway clearance,
      nutritional support, IV antibiotics and other pulmonary medications.  Treatment or care is
      not be altered in any way by participation in this study.  If a patient in the CF
      Non-Exacerbation Group experiences a pulmonary exacerbation during the study period, samples
      will be obtained as described for the CF Exacerbation Group.

      For a control group comparison we collect sputum and urine only from volunteers &gt; 8 years of
      age who do not have CF.
