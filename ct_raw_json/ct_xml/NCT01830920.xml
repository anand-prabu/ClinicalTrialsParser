  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether THR-184 when administered around the time
      of cardiac surgery that requires cardiopulmonary bypass can prevent or ameliorate the
      development of acute kidney injury.

      The study has been designed to include patients scheduled for cardiac surgery who are
      considered at increased risk for developing CSA-AKI. The eligibility criteria are intended
      to enrich the study population with such patients.

      Stage 1 will consist of 140 patients randomized in a 1:1:1:1 ratio (approximately 35
      patients per treatment arm) to Placebo or to one of three (3) THR-184 dose arms:

        -  initial pre-surgery low dose of THR-184 by three (3) post-surgery doses of at the low
           dose, or

        -  initial pre-surgery middle dose of THR-184 followed by three (3) post-surgery doses at
           the low dose, or

        -  initial pre-surgery high dose of THR-184  followed by three (3) post-surgery doses at
           the low dose

      Stage 2 will consist of approximately 210 patients randomized in a 1:1 ratio (approximately
      105 patients per treatment arm) to Placebo or to a dose selected from one of the three (3)
      THR-184 dose arms tested in Stage 1.

      Study treatment (THR-184 or placebo) will consist of one 60-minute IV infusion administered
      prior to surgery, followed by a 60-minute  IV infusion  administered, beginning in the early
      post-operative period, and followed by two (2) additional 60-minute  IV infusions
      administered,  on consecutive  days post-cardiac surgery.

      The primary endpoint for the evaluation of efficacy in patients receiving THR-184, as
      compared to patients receiving Placebo, will be the proportion of patients developing
      CSA-AKI as measured by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, as
      follows:

        -  Increase in Serum creatinine (SCr) by ≥0.3 mg/dl (&gt;26.5 µmol/l) within 48 hours
           post-surgery; or

        -  Increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times a baseline which has been measured in the previous 7
           days; or

        -  Urine volume &lt;0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 hours post-operatively

      If at least one of these measures is present by the 7 day assessment, a patient will be
      considered to have developed CSA-AKI.
