The proposed research program takes a new approach which could lead to an\n      effective, practical and acceptable protocol for preadapting astronauts to space flight. By\n      using the gravito-inertial alterations possible with centrifugation in different body\n      orientations the investigators will quantify an individual's sensory adaptation capability\n      and use it to predict and to minimize the consequences of movement in any other gravity\n      environment - eventually including weightlessness. The investigators will also study whether\n      a drug (promethazine) affects motion perception and motion sickness."
