      The investigator hypothesizes that the eHealth intervention will improve outcomes (eg,
      adherence to recommended effective and low cost medications for CKD) over current practice
      by targeting both the conscious and unconscious/affective processing systems of human
      cognition using theory-based, multicomponent, multichannel materials directed at both
      patients and clinicians.

      Specific Aims:

      2. Specific Aims This project will improve care for patients with chronic kidney disease
      (CKD) by developing an electronic health intervention (combining secure e-mail, text
      message, and online video) that promotes adoption of effective medications.  The
      investigator hypothesizes that the eHealth intervention will improve outcomes over current
      practice by targeting both the conscious and unconscious/affective processing systems of
      human cognition using theory-based, multicomponent, multichannel materials directed at both
      patients and clinicians.  Formative research will develop the intervention, which will then
      be tested in a pilot randomized controlled trial.

      CKD affects over 20 million American adults.  Use of four categories of medications (for
      renal protection, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and hyperlipidemia) can reduce progression.
       Yet these effective drugs remain vastly under-utilized.  Major contributors to the failure
      to initiate these proven drugs are well known barriers for patients and clinicians,
      including the affective barriers of denial, inertia, and uncertainty.  The health
      consequences of this poor level of drug adoption warrant development of new strategies to
      facilitate their use.

      The proposed eHealth intervention containing theory-based, multicomponent, multichannel
      materials sent with the intention of changing physician and patient behavior will be adapt
      empirically supported content from other clinical areas and will be innovatively applied to
      promote effective CKD medication adoption among patients not yet taking them.
      Pharmaceutical advertisements to patients and clinicians have been shown to increase sales.
      Social marketing (marketing for a &quot;social good&quot;) also influences patients, but usually
      targets populations without individual tailoring.  Academic detailing (clinician education
      by non-commercial personnel) can work but generally does not unless intensive and expensive.
      The investigator will adapt effective components of these within a unique behavioral
      framework.  The framework capitalizes on the growing recognition that human cognition uses
      two systems operating in parallel to produce knowledge, attitudes, and behavior.  The
      conscious (explicit) system involves controlled and effortful processing—what has
      overwhelmingly been targeted by behavioral health interventions. The unconscious or
      affective (implicit) system uses rapid, automatic processing—studied in marketing and social
      psychology but infrequently in health care settings.  By targeting both the conscious and
      affective systems among patients and clinicians, the proposed eHealth intervention is
      anticipated to have a synergistic impact on CKD medication initiation.

      Patients are often first identified with CKD on routine laboratory tests searchable in the
      electronic health record (EHR).  Our two healthcare organization partners, Stanford and the
      Palo Alto Medical Foundation, have mature EHR systems, which will allow us to identify
      patients with moderate CKD not yet taking indicated medications and to deliver tailored
      e-messages to them and their primary care clinicians.

      Aim 1: Formative research—Develop the eHealth intervention Challenge: There is good evidence
      on how to target conscious processing for health behavior change but less on affective
      processing.  Research on affective processing related to pharma advertising, social
      marketing, and academic detailing suggests strategies that may be strategically incorporated
      into the eHealth intervention.  Approach: Using a theory-based approach and the latest
      research, The investigator will identify the promising content, minimum effective dose, and
      delivery for an eHealth intervention on effective CKD medication adoption, with a special
      emphasis on targeting affective processing (in addition to conscious processing).  The
      investigator  will use observational, systematic review, and qualitative approaches for this
      formative research.   Impact:  The investigator will develop an e-Health intervention that
      is anticipated to have an effective content, dose, and delivery.

      Aim 2: Evaluative research—Pilot test the eHealth intervention in a small RCT Challenge: The
      eHealth intervention must be piloted and refined prior to a definitive investigation of its
      efficacy.   Approach: The investigator will test the eHealth intervention for feasibility in
      a 2-arm pilot RCT (intervention vs. usual care controls) among patients with stage 3b CKD
      managed in primary care and their clinicians, while also collecting data critical to
      designing a future efficacy trial.  Randomization: clustered by clinician (15/arm) with
      inclusion of five eligible, consenting CKD patients in a clinician's panel.  Primary
      outcome: 4-point metric of CKD metabolic control (proteinuria, blood pressure, plasma
      glucose, cholesterol).  H1: the intervention group will achieve better CKD metabolic control
      than controls.  Secondary outcomes:  new prescriptions for the targeted drug categories, CKD
      progression, feasibility/process data.   Impact:  A new intervention specifically targeted
      at CKD medication adoption to be evaluated a larger efficacy RCT.

      The eHealth intervention the investigator develop and test has the potential to improve
      outcomes for the large number of patients with CKD not receiving effective medications.  Our
      quality preliminary data will guide the formation of well-delineated hypotheses that will
      undergo further rigorous examination in a larger trial, as well as related studies among
      overlapping populations (e.g., racial minorities) and diseases (e.g., diabetes).  The
      awardee will receive invaluable training on behavioral intervention design, qualitative
      research, practical clinical trials, and team science and management, which will galvanize
      her patient-oriented CKD research career.

    <description>A &quot;CKD score&quot; will be assigned to each patient at baseline and 12-month follow-up, which will be the primary outcome of the trial. The clinical targets that comprise the CKD score consist of laboratory or clinical measurements that are routinely performed in primary care settings and, as such, are readily available in the EHR. While apparent face validity and convenience provide a good rationale for introducing the CKD score, we also recognize the need to validate the score, which we will do in stages in both Aims 1 and 2 of the study.</description>
