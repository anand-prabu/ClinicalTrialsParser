Purpose of staging of 2 study arms is just to\n      shorten overall study duration (from screening of first volunteer to 6 months after last\n      immunisation of last volunteer).\n\n      Lastly, 24 patients who also meet all eligibility criteria will be enrolled as controls,\n      will also initiate promptly antiretroviral treatment with Tenofovir/Emtricitabine plus\n      Raltegravir but will not receive the investigational vaccines. Control patients will\n      consecutively be assigned to the 0-24w control arm (ARM C 'long control') or 0-8w control\n      arm (ARM D 'short control') until 12 patients per arm are reached.
