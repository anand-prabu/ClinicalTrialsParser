            "textblock": "The present proposal investigates the influence of energy drinks on the blood oxygenation\n      concentration of the optic nerve on healthy subjects. On a voluntary basis, 15 subjects, man\n      or woman, will be selected to undergo this experiment. Many factors can influence the blood\n      oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve, which will be measured also during this\n      experiment, namely: Intra ocular pressure (IOP), blood pressure, heart rate and systemic\n      hemoglobin saturation.\n\n      The subjects will have to be tested twice to test the two conditions of this experiment:\n\n        1. The effect after the intake of a can of Redbull (250 ml)\n\n        2. The difference with the intake of 250 ml of water\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if the blood oxygenation concentration of the\n      optic nerve varies after having ingested 250 ml of Redbull.\n\n      Our hypothesis are:\n\n        1. The blood oxygenation concentration of the optic nerve measured with OSOME (see\n           detailed description below), decreases due to the consumption of the energy drink\n           Redbull compared to an equal volume of water.\n\n        2. The IOP measured with iCare tonometer decreases after the consumption of the energy\n           drink Redbull compared to an equal volume of water.\n\n        3. The systemic blood pressure, measured with an automatic sphygmomanometer remains\n           constant after ingestion of Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water.\n\n        4. Heart rate, measured with a sphygmomanometer automatic increases after taking a Redbull\n           energy drink compared to an equal volume of water.\n\n        5. The rate of systemic hemoglobin saturation measured with a pulse oximeter remains\n           constant after the ingestion of a Redbull energy drink or an equal volume of water."

The patient is required to rest for 20 minutes to allow a complete dilatation of the\n      pupil before using the OSOME."
