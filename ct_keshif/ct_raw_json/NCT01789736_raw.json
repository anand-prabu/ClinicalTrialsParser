Unmedicated (post-washout) IOP \u2265 22 mm Hg at 2 qualification visits (08:00 hr), 2-7\n             days apart.  At second qualification visit, IOP >21 mmHg at 10:00 and 16:00 hrs.\n\n          4. Corrected visual acuity in each eye +1.0 logMAR or better by ETDRS in each eye\n             (equivalent to 20/200).\n\n          5. Able and willing to give signed informed consent and follow study instructions.\n\n        Subject exclusion criteria\n\n        Excluded from the study will be individuals with the following characteristics:\n\n        Ophthalmic (in either eye):\n\n          1. Glaucoma: pseudoexfoliation or pigment dispersion component, history of angle\n             closure, or narrow angles. Note: Previous laser peripheral iridotomy is NOT\n             acceptable.\n\n          2. Intraocular pressure > 35 mm Hg, or use of more than two ocular hypotensive\n             medications within 30 days of screening.  Note: fixed dose combinations count as two\n             medications.\n\n          3. Known hypersensitivity to any component of the formulation (benzalkonium chloride,\n             zinc, etc.), travoprost, or to topical anesthetics.\n\n          4. Previous glaucoma intraocular surgery or glaucoma laser procedures in study eye(s).\n\n          5. Refractive surgery in study eye(s) (e.g., radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.).\n\n          6. Ocular trauma within the six months prior to screening, or ocular surgery or laser\n             treatment within the three months prior to screening.\n\n          7. Evidence of ocular infection, inflammation, clinically significant blepharitis,\n             conjunctivitis, or a history of herpes simplex keratitis at screening.\n\n          8. Ocular medication of any kind within 30 days of screening, with the exception of a)\n             ocular hypotensive medications (which must be washed out according to the provided\n             schedule), b) lid scrubs (which may be used prior to, but not after screening) or c)\n             lubricating drops for dry eye (which may be used throughout the study).\n\n          9. Clinically significant ocular disease (e.g. corneal edema, uveitis, severe\n             keratoconjunctivitis sicca) which might interfere with the study, including\n             glaucomatous damage so severe that washout of ocular hypotensive medications for one\n             month is not judged safe (e.g., cup-disc ratio > 0.8).\n\n         10. Central corneal thickness greater than 600 \u00b5m.\n\n         11. Any abnormality preventing reliable applanation tonometry of either eye.\n\n             Systemic:\n\n         12. Clinically significant abnormalities (as determined by the investigator) in\n             laboratory tests at screening.\n\n         13. Clinically significant systemic disease (e.g., uncontrolled diabetes, myasthenia\n             gravis, hepatic, renal, endocrine or cardiovascular disorders) which might interfere\n             with the study.\n\n         14. Participation in any investigational study within 30 days prior to screening.\n\n         15. Changes of systemic medication within 30 days prior to screening, or anticipated\n             during the study, that could have a substantial effect on IOP.\n\n         16. Women of childbearing potential who are pregnant, nursing, planning a pregnancy, or\n             not using a medically acceptable form of birth control.  An adult woman is considered\n             to be of childbearing potential unless she is one year post-menopausal or three\n             months post-surgical sterilization.  All females of childbearing potential must have\n             a negative urine pregnancy test result at the screening examination and must not\n             intend to become pregnant during the study."
