For children and adolescents however, there is\n      currently no effective treatment that prevents collapse of the femoral head.  Some patients\n      with proven avascular necrosis of the femoral epiphysis are treated with bisphosphonates\n      (intravenous pamidronate) at the The Hospital for Sick Children.  The main aim of this study\n      is to prospectively collect data on HSC patients receiving bisphosphonate treatment and\n      thereby report the effectiveness of this treatment in the prevention of femoral head\n      collapse."
