In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), active involvement of patients in monitoring\n      their symptoms and their disease activity may facilitate treatment according to current\n      recommendations, which emphasize the need for aggressive treatment to suppress inflammation\n      and for using a \"Treat to Target\" approach where treatment is escalated until a target is\n      reached and is promptly modified when target is no longer met. In this study, the\n      investigators have developed an online tool that aims to help people with RA monitor their\n      symptoms and their disease activity and self-manage their arthritis. The investigators will\n      perform a proof of concept study assessing how the Arthritis Health Journal affects consumer\n      effectiveness, patient self-efficacy, communication with health professionals, shared\n      decision-making, and satisfaction with medical care. The investigators will also evaluate\n      the feasibility and satisfaction with using the Arthritis Health Journal. The investigators\n      will use a stepped wedge study design, in which 50 participants will be randomized to either\n      the intervention group (immediate use of the Arthritis Health Journal) or the control group\n      (waitlisted for 6 months). Due to the nature of the intervention, the study is not blinded."
