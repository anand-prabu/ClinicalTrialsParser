            "textblock": "Up to ten retired NFL players will receive a comprehensive and monitored weight loss program\n      using a protocol that has been established at the TGH+USF Bariatric Center.  A low calorie\n      diet with meal replacements will be used and over the course of the study the participants\n      will be taught to eat low calorie nutritious foods.  The sessions will teach proper eating\n      habits, stress control, and skills to maintain a healthy weight.\n\n      The length of the study is 6 months. Treatment will last 24 weeks, the participants will\n      attend group sessions (60-90 mins.) on a weekly basis for weeks 1-12 and then every other\n      week for weeks 14-24, for a total of 18 treatments. Treatment will include meal replacement,\n      education on nutrition and proper eating habits as well as behavior modification and skills\n      which is known to be effective.\n\n      Participants will be scheduled to come to the Bariatric Center for the first\n      assessment/screening and for the consenting process. TGH+USF Bariatric Center has dedicated\n      clinical space in their suite with private exam rooms, an education classroom, and private\n      testing room."
