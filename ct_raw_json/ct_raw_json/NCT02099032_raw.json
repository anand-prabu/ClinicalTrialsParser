The\n      most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers\n      such as polar lipids.\n\n      The purpose of this research is to study plasma cholesterol variation after daily intake of\n      milk polar lipids-fortified cheese products. The volunteers will have to consume 100 g of\n      cheese product during four weeks instead of their usual cheese products.\n\n      It  is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine\n      Rh\u00f4ne-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine  Auvergne)."
