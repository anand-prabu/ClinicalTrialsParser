  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, national, multicenter, non-interventional study will examine the use of
      triple combination therapy with boceprevir, Pegasys and ribivarin in re-treating patients
      with genotype 1 CHC infection. Dosing and treatment duration are at the discretion of the
      investigator in accordance with local clinical practice and local labeling. Patients will be
      observed for the duration of their triple combination therapy and for up to 24 weeks
      thereafter.
