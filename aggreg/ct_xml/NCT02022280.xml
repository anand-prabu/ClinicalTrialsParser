  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled crossover study, the investigators propose to test the
      hypothesis that proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) increase plasma levels of asymmetric
      dimethylarginine (ADMA), which is a marker of endothelial dysfunction. The authors propose
      to evaluate ADMA concentrations and vascular function analysis in healthy volunteers and
      adults with a history of cardiovascular disease given PPI vs placebo for four weeks each.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Contra-indication to proton pump inhibitor treatment

          -  Current treatment with PPI or H2 antagonist, and not able to tolerate withdrawal or
             washout of medication.

          -  Current or historical evidence of clinically severe cardiovascular, neurological,
             hematological, hepatic, gastrointestinal, renal, pulmonary, endocrinological,
             metabolic or psychiatric disease.

          -  Any other acute or chronic disease which could influence the volunteer's health
             and/or the study results

          -  Presence or history of malabsorption or any gastrointestinal surgery except
             appendectomy or hernia repair

          -  Use of enzyme inducers or enzyme inhibitor drugs within the last three months before
             the first drug administration
