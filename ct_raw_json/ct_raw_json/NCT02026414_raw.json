Two hypothesizes have been made, oral supplementation of PrimaVie twice a day for\n      12 weeks will influence gene expression in the skeletal muscle of pre-obese to obese humans,\n      oral supplementation of PV will act with treadmill exercise training to favorably impact\n      skeletal muscle gene expression.

At this initial visit, the research nurse will meet the potential\n      subject in a private room where the study will be fully explained in lay language, and\n      informed consent will be obtained. Then, appropriate demographic, biometric and\n      health/clinical information will be recorded on the data collection sheet, and 22.5 mL of\n      blood will be obtained via venipuncture in the right or left forearm. A muscle biopsy (using\n      a 6 mm biopsy needle) will also be collected by a trained physician. The blood and muscle\n      biopsy will be used for all lab related study procedures.
