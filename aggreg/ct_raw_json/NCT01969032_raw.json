That's\n      why new approaches to treatment of this aggressive breast cancer subtype are extremely\n      anticipated.\n\n      One of the ways to improve the results of treatment of locally advanced triple-negative\n      breast cancer is intensification of induction preoperative chemotherapy regimens. Elevation\n      of the rate of pathological complete responses after completion of intensification induction\n      preoperative chemotherapy enables to decrease the stage and increase survival of this\n      aggressive breast cancer subtype. We hope to achieve more clinical and pathological\n      treatment responses than with standard chemotherapy regimens and therefore to improve\n      treatment outcomes of this extremely adverse group of patients."
