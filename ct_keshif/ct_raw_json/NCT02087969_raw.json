There have been an increasing number of\n      studies on dry needling as an intervention for pain but none thus far that have studied\n      functional outcome measures of the ankle. The study will include healthy male subjects\n      between the ages of 18-30 years old randomized in to 3 intervention groups of: dry needling\n      of the triceps surae, triceps surae stretching only, dry needling and stretching. The\n      subjects who receive dry needling as an intervention will have the trigger point identified\n      and dry needling performed while under musculoskeletal ultrasound visualization. The\n      subjects will undergo pre and post intervention testing including Lower Quarter Y-Balance\n      test, passive ankle dorsiflexion, closed chain half kneeling dorsiflexion, standing\n      dorsiflexion, deep squat, multisegmental flexion as well as Marx Activity Level Scale. There\n      will be 3 days between the initial testing/intervention and follow up.  These outcomes will\n      be the primary variables of interest.  Ultrasound, Y balance testing, self stretching, and\n      range of motion measurements are safe and pose no risk to the subject.  Dry Needling has\n      been found to be very safe and effective in the hands of physical therapists with a\n      calculated risk of adverse events to be less than 0.04%."
