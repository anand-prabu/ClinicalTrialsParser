  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule
      (SPN), this is a single spot on a CT scan. This is an important group of patients because if
      it is lung cancer, presentation as a SPN represents early disease, which following surgery
      has a high 5 year survival rate. However as not all SPNs are lung cancer it would be
      unethical to biopsy every case. Clinical guidelines recommend that SPNs should undergo an
      initial fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET/CT scan, which may give more information about the SPN
      and may indicate that it is likely to be lung cancer. However in many cases it does not and
      current practice is to monitor the SPN with a series of CT scans over 2 years to look for
      changes or growth which may/ but not always indicate lung cancer. If no changes are observed
      over 2 years the SPN is considered not lung cancer.  This is both expensive for the National
      Health Service (NHS) and worrying for the patient in terms of monitoring CT costs and
      delayed treatment due to length of time to diagnosis.

      In this study the investigators propose to examine the diagnostic capacity of initially
      using a different CT scan Dynamic Contrast Enhanced -CT(DCE-CT). DCE-CT and FDG-PET/CT scans
      give different information about the SPN and the investigators will look to see if
      information from either scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the
      diagnosis of early stage lung cancer.

      The investigators will also undertake a review of previous studies that have been done using
      these scans in the diagnosis of lung cancer and use data from both the review and the trial
      to look at the cost effectiveness of using DCE-CT in the diagnosis of SPN.

      The investigators hope to recruit 375 people who have a SPN detected by a normal CT scan.
      These patients will normally be offered a FDG-PET/CT scan and if they participate in this
      study they will also receive a DCE-CT scan either on the same day or within two weeks of the
      FDG-PET/CT scan. This is the only extra procedure that will take place to normal NHS care,
      however patients will sign a consent form to give us permission to use data from any future
      CT scans or biopsies and any diagnosis that they may have over the next two years.

      The study is coordinated by the clinical trials unit at Southampton University.

      Recruitment began in January 2013. Patients will be recruited from 10 centres throughout the
      UK where they will be treated locally. The investigators expect recruitment to last until
      late 2014 and patient's medical data to be followed for another 2 years.

      The investigators expect to have completed the analysis and made conclusions about the
      usefulness and cost effectiveness of DCE-CT scans in the diagnosis of early stage lung
      cancer in SPN.

      The study is funded by the Health Technology Assessment arm of the National Institute for
      Health research, which is government funded.

      Indication: Lung Cancer

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To determine with high precision, the diagnostic performances of DCE-CT and
           18FDG-PET/CT in the NHS for the characterisation of solitary pulmonary nodules (SPNs).

        -  To use decision analytic modelling to assess the likely costs and health outcomes
           resulting from incorporation of DCE-CT into management strategies for patients with
           SPNs.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To assess, within an NHS setting, the incremental value of incorporating the CT
           appearances of a SPN into the interpretation of integrated PET/CT examinations.

        -  To assess whether combining DCE-CT with 18FDG-PET/CT is more accurate and/or
           cost-effective, in the characterisation of SPNs, than either test used alone or in
           series.

        -  To document the nature and incidence of incidental extra-thoracic findings on
           18FDG-PET/CT undertaken for the characterisation of SPNs and model their impact on
           cost-effectiveness.

      Rationale:

      A small proportion of patients with lung cancer present with a solitary pulmonary nodule
      (SPN) on diagnostic imaging tests. This is an important group of patients because
      presentation as a SPN represents early disease with high 5 year survival rates following
      surgical resection. However, not all SPNs are due to lung cancer and the accurate
      characterisation of SPNs for diagnosis of early stage lung cancer is a diagnostic challenge
      with significant associated health costs.

      Widely adopted clinical guidelines for the subsequent investigation of SPNs recommend serial
      CT scans to look for subsequent growth with biopsy to confirm diagnosis. UK, National
      Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend 18FDG-PET for the
      assessment of SPN in cases where a biopsy is not possible or has failed.

      DCE-CT and 18FDG-PET scans give different information about the SPN.  Information from
      either scan or combined information from both scans may be better in the diagnosis of early
      stage lung cancer.

      Trial Design: Prospective Observational

      Sample size: 375

      Non-CTIMP:Non interventional trial

      Concomitant Therapy: As per local practice

      Primary Trial Endpoints:

      Primary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics (sensitivity,
      specificity, accuracy) for 18FDG-PET/CT and DCE-CT in relation to a subsequent clinical
      diagnosis of lung cancer. The outcome measures used in the economic model will include
      accuracy, estimated life expectancy, and quality adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs will be
      estimated from an NHS perspective. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios will compare
      management strategies with DCE-CT to strategies without DCE-CT.

      Secondary Trial Endpoints:

      Secondary outcome measures will include diagnostic test characteristics for 18FDG-PET/CT
      with incorporation of CT appearances and combined DCE-CT/18FDG-PET. The incidence of
      incidental extra-thoracic findings on 18FDG-PET/CT, subsequent investigations and costs will
      also be determined.
