    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot clinical trial studies chemotherapy before surgery and tissue sample
      collection in patients with stage IIA-IIIC breast cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such
      as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different
      ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride,
      cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells. Collecting and
      storing samples of tissue from patients with breast cancer to study in the laboratory may
      help doctors learn more about how well patients will respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the effects of preoperative neoadjuvant paclitaxel and doxorubicin
      (doxorubicin hydrochloride)/cyclophosphamide (AC) on: senescence; invasion/motility (tumor
      microenvironment of metastasis [TMEM] and 67 kDa laminin receptor [67LR]).

      II. To create a biospecimen repository for future studies derived from patients with breast
      cancer receiving standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients with human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive disease are
      assigned to Stratum A, and patients with HER2-negative disease are randomized to Stratum B
      or C.

      STRATUM A: Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and trastuzumab IV
      over 30-90 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. Beginning 2-3 weeks later, patients receive
      doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes
      every 2 weeks for 8 weeks

      STRATUM B: Patients receive paclitaxel, doxorubicin hydrochloride, and cyclophosphamide as
      in Stratum A.

      STRATUM C: Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 5-10 minutes and
      cyclophosphamide IV over 30-60 minutes every 2 weeks for 8 weeks. Patients then receive
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour weekly for 12 weeks.

      Patients undergo surgery 2-6 weeks after the last chemotherapy dose.

      In all arms, treatment continues in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.

    <description>Paired T-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be performed. Two-sample t-test will be performed to compare biomarker between the two groups. If the data are not normally distributed, a suitable data transformation such as the log or rank transformation will be applied. Logistic regression models will also be fit to the data with treatment sensitive/resistance category as the outcome and baseline as well as pre-post change in biomarker level as the main predictor variable to obtain estimates of odds ratios unadjusted and adjusted for potential confounders including patients characteristics.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the breast associated
             with the following clinical stage: IIA, IIB, IIIA, IIIB, or IIIC; patients with stage
             IV disease are also eligible if there is an intention to perform breast surgery after
             neoadjuvant therapy is completed, or in patients participating in clinical trials
             where surgery after neoadjuvant therapy may be an option (eg. E2108)

          -  Estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2/neu status documented by
             core needle biopsy of the primary tumor and/or regional lymph node must be known
             prior to beginning systemic therapy

          -  Patients must have had a bilateral diagnostic mammogram within 6 months of
             registration, and may also have a targeted sonography of the breast and/or
             ipsilateral axilla and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) if clinically indicated

          -  Patients with clinically suspicious axillary lymph node involvement must have either
             aspiration cytology or biopsy prior to beginning therapy

          -  It is strongly encouraged that all patients have metallic clips placed in the tumor
             prior to neoadjuvant therapy in order to facilitate evaluation for microscopic
             disease at the time of surgery; placement of clips is particularly encouraged for
             patients being considered for breast conserving surgery

          -  No prior chemotherapy, irradiation, or definitive therapeutic surgery (eg, mastectomy
             or lumpectomy or axillary dissection) for this malignancy; patients who have had a
             prior sentinel lymph node biopsy for this malignancy are eligible

          -  Patients who received tamoxifen or another selective estrogen receptor modulator
             (SERM) for prevention or for other indications (e.g., osteoporosis, prior ductal
             carcinoma in situ [DCIS]) are eligible; tamoxifen therapy or other SERMs should be
             discontinued at least 1 week before the patient is enrolled on this study

          -  The patient is medically suitable candidate for preoperative chemotherapy and surgery
             in the judgment of the treating physicians

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document, and willing to provide blood samples before and during preoperative
             therapy; patients are also asked but not required to have research biopsies performed
             before and after therapy
