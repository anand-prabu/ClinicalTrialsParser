The researchers would like to study whether a type of\n      nutritional intervention, called a time-restricted diet or tRD, is easy to maintain using a\n      smartphone application; the researchers also want to study the effect that a tRD has on\n      weight control, hormones, and breast tissue. A tRD is a type of diet that requires people to\n      restrict their daily eating to a specific time frame each day. The researchers think that\n      this might be an effective and manageable way to control weight."
