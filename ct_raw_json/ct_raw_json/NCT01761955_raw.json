A total of 100\n      overweight/obese individuals will be recruited, half recruited in Adelaide, South Australia\n      and the other half from Manitoba, Canada.   At baseline, subjects assigned to HD will be\n      given standard serves of low fat dairy products (eg. 250mL milk, 200g yoghurt) on a regular\n      basis for 6 months and asked to incorporate 4 serves/day into their diet.  Volunteers\n      randomized to the LD will be asked to continue with their habitual diet and consume less\n      than 2 serves of dairy on a regular basis for 6 months. All participants will be asked to\n      complete a food frequency questionnaire, physical activity diary, 3-day food record, and\n      keep a record of dairy serves (food log) consumed each day. In total, participants will be\n      asked to come to the centre 5 times throughout the study.  However, the HD group will be\n      asked to return to the centre every two weeks to receive diary product and return dairy\n      record (food log). At baseline subjects will be asked to attend the Richardson Centre for\n      Functional Foods and Nutraceuticals (RCFFN) fasted for various measurements including: body\n      weight, blood pressure, arterial compliance, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan\n      for measurement of body fat, abdominal fat and bone mineral density, waist and hip\n      circumferences and provide a blood sample for the measurement of blood lipids, insulin and\n      glucose."
