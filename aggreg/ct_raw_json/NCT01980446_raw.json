Decision making to withdrawal\n      of life support will be strictly codified according current knowledge and standardized among\n      the participating centres. In the absence of predictors of non-awakening, care will be\n      continued without limitation. The design of the study will focus on the determination of the\n      capacity of the presence of the mismatch negativity during the cortical auditory-evoked\n      potential to predict awakening. Cortical auditory-evoked potential will be performed bedside\n      in the ICU by qualified neurophysiologists. Results of cortical auditory-evoked potential\n      will remain blinded of bedside clinicians providing care for the patients. Awakening will be\n      assessed bedside daily. CPC score will be evaluated at discharge of the ICU, of the\n      hospital, at 3 months and 1 year by an independent evaluator, blinded of the results of the\n      cortical auditory-evoked potentials."
