  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of performing a larger multicenter
      phase III trial to assess the effects of unfractionated heparin (UFH) in acute chest
      syndrome (ACS). Prespecified feasibility criteria consists of the ability to enroll
      potential study participants, which includes the timely notification of hospitalized
      patients with ACS, the capacity to consent eligible individuals, and the ability to
      appropriately randomize eligible patients within 24 hours of diagnosis. Additional
      feasibility objectives involve ensuring appropriate eligibility criteria, proper
      administration of the study drug, and the ability to completely and accurately collect
      clinical data of interest. The final aim of our pilot study is to provide preliminary data,
      with respect to treatment effect and variance, to allow sample size calculation in a larger
      trial given the lack of data available to help guide this process. The investigators
      hypothesize that the use of UFH in ACS will result in a decrease in the duration of
      hospitalization and improve other clinical outcomes, such as the duration of hypoxemia and
      duration of moderate to severe pain.

    <description>Subjects will be randomized within 24 hours of diagnosis to one of two treatment arms, Arm A, anticoagulation and standard of care, or Arm B, no anticoagulation and standard of care. Weight-adjusted UFH will be given at doses of 80 units per kilogram followed by 18 units per kilogram per hour intravenously for 7 days, or until discharge, if discharge is shorter than 7 days. UFH will be monitored by standard protocol to maintain the activated partial thromboplastin time in the therapeutic range per institutional guidelines.
The experimental arm will receive standard of care, too, which will include the following: intravenous fluids, antibiotics, supplemental oxygen, incentive spirometry, pain management, red blood cell transfusions, and exchange transfusions.</description>
