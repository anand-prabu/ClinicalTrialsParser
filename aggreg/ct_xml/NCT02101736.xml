    <textblock>
      This study, &quot;A Phase II Study of Cabozantinib (XL l84) for Plexiform Neurofibromas in
      Subjects with Neurofibromatosis Type I Age 16 years or greater&quot; is for participants that
      have been diagnosed with Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1) and have a type of tumor called a
      plexiform neurofibroma. Neurofibromas are tumors that develop from the cells and tissues
      that cover the nerves. Plexiform neurofibromas can be disfiguring, painful, and
      life-threatening. These types of tumors typically do not respond well to most treatment
      approaches such as chemotherapy, radiation, and surgery because of their slow growth and
      location near vital structures of the body such as nerves, blood vessels, and the airway.

      The purpose of this Phase II Study is to determine the response rate of NFI patients with
      plexiform neurofibromas treated with Cabozantinib therapy using MRI scans. Cabozantinib is
      thought to work on tumors by blocking pathways that are involved in the growth of tumors and
      blood vessels that supply tumors. Cabozantinib is considered experimental because it has not
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase II open label study will evaluate adolescents and adults with neurofibromatosis
      type-1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas treated with cabozantinib (XL184).  This study will
      enroll subjects who either meet clinical diagnostic criteria or have an identified
      pathogenetic NF1 mutation.  Subjects on study must have clinically significant plexiform
      neurofibroma defined as potentially life-threatening, impinging on vital structures or
      significantly impairing the quality of life from pain or other symptoms.  Patients must not
      have lesions suspicious for malignant tumors such as MPNSTs (malignant peripheral nerve
      sheath tumors) and suspicious tumors must be proven negative by histopathology prior to
      enrollment on study.  This study will be open to patients â‰¥16 years of age that meet
      eligibility criteria.

      The study will be a Simon two-stage study design.  It will be a single-arm open-label study
      of cabozantinib and the primary endpoint is the ORR to cabozantinib at 1 year.  In the first
      stage, 9 evaluable subjects will be accrued.  If there is at least 1 response, accrual will
      continue to the second stage and an additional  8 evaluable subjects will be enrolled.  To
      allow for 10% unevaluable subjects, a maximum of 19 subjects will be enrolled.  Radiographic
      response will be evaluated as the primary endpoint with 20% volumetric MRI response of the
      target lesion being the threshold criteria for tumor response.  A target lesion will be
      selected at time of enrollment and tumor evaluations will occur serially while on study.

      All subjects will start cabozantinib at 40 mg.  The published MTD for Cabozantinib is 140 mg
      and the current recommended dose in Phase 3 clinical trials for subjects with medullary
      thyroid cancer is 100 mg.  Doses of 40 mg and 60 mg continue to show efficacy in on-going
      phase 2 and phase 3 trials with reduced toxicity.  Subjects who tolerate 40 mg for 2 cycles
      will escalate to 60 mg.  The rationale for this is that the majority of subjects who develop
      toxicity do so after &gt;2 weeks on drug as cabozantinib has a long half-life.  Subjects who
      experience dose-limiting toxicity at 40 mg will dose reduce to 20 mg when their toxicities
      resolve. Subjects without toxicity at 40mg will increase to 60mg.  Subjects who experience
      toxicity at 60 mg will dose reduce to 40 mg. This dosing schema is designed to maximize
      safety and tolerability in this new population of patients.

      Subjects entered on the trial will be carefully monitored for the development of
      cabozantinib associated toxicities, and target modifications and interruptions will be
      performed.

      In all consenting subjects entered on this trial a complete pharmacokinetic profile of
      cabozantinib after administration will be evaluated.  In addition, cytokine and endothelial
      progenitor cell biomarkers will be drawn to assess treatment effect and to correlate with
      response.

      In addition, since plexiform neurofibromas may significantly impact the lives of patients
      with NF1, this study will evaluate the effects of the disease and treatment with
      Cabozantinib on the quality of life (QOL) of these subjects by assessing NF1 disease-related
      QOL, pain intensity, and pain interference.
