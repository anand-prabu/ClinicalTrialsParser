There is\n      increasing evidence that in-utero exposure to maternal diabetes is associated with an\n      increased risk of obesity and type 2 diabetes in children and adults. There is an urgent\n      need to reduce these increasing rates of obesity and diabetes in subsequent generations.\n\n      The MiTy Trial (Metformin in Women with Type 2 Diabetes in Pregnancy Trial) is a CIHR-funded\n      multi-centre, randomized controlled trial of women with type 2 diabetes in pregnancy (sample\n      size n=500). The MiTy Trial is looking to determine the effect of the addition of metformin\n      to a standard regimen of insulin in women with diabetes, on perinatal morbidity and\n      mortality.\n\n      The MiTy Kids Trial is a follow-up to the MiTy Trial which will determine whether treatment\n      with metformin during pregnancy in women with type 2 diabetes will lead to a reduction in\n      adiposity and improvement in insulin resistance in the offspring of women with diabetes at 2\n      years of age."
