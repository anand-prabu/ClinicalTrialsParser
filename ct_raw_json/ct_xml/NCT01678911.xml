  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is done to investigate the pain relieving effects of the study drug Gralise (a
      novel long acting gabapentinoid) for people who experience chronic pelvic pain. Subjects
      with Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Interstitial Cystitis, Ulcerative Colitis, and Prostatitis
      will be recruited. The purpose of this research is to look at how the study drug can be used
      to benefit people who experience this type of pain. This is a phase IV study done to study
      the safety and effectiveness of the drug. At this point the drug has been approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration and has been reported to be well tolerated and effective in the
      treatment of various chronic pain conditions, particularly in neuropathic pain. About 36
      subjects will take part in this study.

      As a participant in this study, you will be asked to come to the Rehabilitation Institute of
      Chicago (RIC), Center for Pain Studies (446 E Ontario St. Suite 1011, Chicago, IL 60611).
      Your part in this study will last for 15 weeks and will involve 4 visits to the
      Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago and anywhere from weekly phone calls to phone calls
      every other day.

      If you are in this study, you will be placed in one of two study groups: one group will
      receive the study drug followed by a placebo and the second group will receive a placebo
      followed by the study drug. The amount of weeks on placebo versus the study drug will not be
      equal. You will be assigned a study group by chance using a process similar to the flip of a
      coin. This process is called randomization.  Neither you nor the study staff will select the
      group you will be in. However, if you have a medical emergency, we can get this information.
      A placebo looks like the study drug but is an inactive substance that has no medication.
      Researchers use a placebo to see if the study drug works better or is safer than not taking
      anything.

If intolerable side effects occur, the dose may be reduced to last tolerable dose at the discretion of the PI. A 2-week down-titration will be used. Subjects will have 1 week of &quot;wash-out&quot; before repeating the above procedure for the other arm of the study (placebo or medication).</description>
