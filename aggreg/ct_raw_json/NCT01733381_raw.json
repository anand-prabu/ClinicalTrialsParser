The investigators have selected the ANS as\n      the physiological focus of the current study for several reasons including: 1) running\n      acutely alters ANS activity; 2) running (and aerobic fitness in general) is associated with\n      increased parasympathetic and reduced sympathetic activity at rest; 3) increased\n      parasympathetic tone in the body has been repeatedly associated with emotional well-being\n      and stress resilience, whereas reduced parasympathetic tone has been reliably associated\n      with major depression; 4) given increasing evidence that ancestral humans may have run\n      exceptionally long distances to hunt prey to exhaustion, it is likely that such running was\n      conducted under fairly significant parasympathetic tone to reduce energy expenditure; 5)\n      ancestral humans ran barefoot or minimally shod suggesting that the type of foot strike\n      pattern encouraged by these styles of running may have enhanced parasympathetic tone\n      compared to running with heel strike such as occurs when running shoed; and 6) therefore\n      minimally shod running might differentially impact parasympathetic tone in ways that would\n      make it more effective as a treatment for depression than running shoed."
