Preliminary results, after 3 months of testing, indicate the\n      poles are safe and effective.  Phase 2 will use improved versions of the poles, which are\n      currently in development, with a group of around 125-150 subjects over a longer length of\n      time (12 months). Changes in walking gait quality, balance, strength, body composition,\n      exercise adherence, and subjective perceptions of wellness will be assessed before, during,\n      and after the 12 month exercise session."
