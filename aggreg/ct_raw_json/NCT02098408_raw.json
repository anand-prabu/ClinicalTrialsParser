The cognitive\n      deficits are known to pose a critical barrier to functional recovery. Hence it is of vital\n      importance to find intervention strategies that can alleviate these cognitive deficits and\n      consequently improve daily functioning, and quality of life, as well as the prognosis for\n      UHR-patients. The investigators will examine whether:\n\n        -  Cognitive remediation therapy will be superior to standard treatment in improving\n           cognitive functioning in UHR- patients (null hypothesis: No difference between the two\n           groups).\n\n        -  Cognitive remediation therapy will be superior to standard treatment in improving\n           psychosocial functioning and clinical symptoms in UHR-patients (null hypothesis: No\n           difference between the two groups)."
