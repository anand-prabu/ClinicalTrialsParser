Evaluate the potential benefit of dexamethasone administered prior to\n      denileukin diftitox in terms of avoidance and/or reduction of hypersensitivity type\n      reactions, flu-like symptom complex, and vascular leak syndrome side effects (adverse\n      events) in patients with persistent or recurrent cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. II. Assess the\n      response rate in terms of tumor burden reduction in these patients treated with this\n      regimen. III. Determine the rate of patient withdrawal from the study due to adverse\n      effects.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive denileukin diftitox IV\n      over 30-60 minutes on days 1-5. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone twice daily\n      beginning 24 hours prior to and concomitantly with denileukin diftitox. Treatment continues\n      every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed at 2 or 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
