Review of current literature has identified the following reasons for\n      concern:  increased time required for documentation, deteriorating quality of notes,\n      mindless use of copy-and-paste functions, and fragmentation of clinical work from poorly\n      designed computing workflows. The study of template use has not been done in a large scale\n      or with clear outcome measurements.  The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of\n      Problem Specific Templates on quality, accuracy, and efficiency of physician documentation\n      practices."

For the intervention, participating Hospitalists\n      will be trained on the use of templates for 20 common hospital problems.  Once trained, the\n      Hospitalists will be asked to use these templates for a one-month period.  Pre-intervention\n      and post-intervention medical records will be compared using chart reviews, validated\n      document assessment instruments, physician surveys, and electronic medical record time\n      auditing."
