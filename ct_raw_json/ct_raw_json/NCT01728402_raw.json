Because the causes of these cancers are\n      unknown, current treatments may be unnecessarily harsh and often do not provide a cure.\n      Identifying the causes of blood cancers would allow for the development of treatments that\n      are more likely to provide a cure.  To find the causes of blood and bone marrow cancers, we\n      will look for specific cancer cell abnormalities that are responsible for cancer cell\n      growth.  We will then look to see if drugs that can reverse these abnormalities can kill\n      cancer cells."
