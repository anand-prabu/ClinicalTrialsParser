Primary endpoint is change in LDL levels between the 2 arms.\n      Secondary outcomes include blood pressure control, weight, smoking cessation, and other\n      lifestyle modifications.\n\n      This trial will help us understand whether coronary artery disease risk derived from genetic\n      information would have a significant impact on patients' perception of coronary artery\n      disease risk and motivate healthy lifestyle modifications that reduce their long term risk."
