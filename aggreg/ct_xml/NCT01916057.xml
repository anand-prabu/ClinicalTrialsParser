      The purpose of this study is to determine whether F18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)
      positron-emission tomography scan (PET scan) is useful for the therapy strategy of
      hepatosplenic candidiasis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic disseminated candidiasis, often referred to as hepatosplenic candidiasis (HSC), is
      an infection due to Candida spp. that mainly involves the liver and spleen. HSC occurs
      mostly in patients with profound and prolonged neutropenia, which is more often seen in
      patients with hematologic malignancies. Despite an appropriate antifungal prophylaxis, the
      incidence of HSC in France might be closed to 5% in patients suffering from acute leukemia.
      Early and adequate diagnosis and treatment of HSC are crucial, as treatment delays can
      negatively affect the prognosis of the underlying condition. Current guidelines recommend a
      6-month duration treatment. Prolonged treatments up to 6 months are frequent, leading to
      antifungal toxicity and cost increase. Preliminary study by our team has already assessed
      F18 fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG) positron-emission tomography scan (PET scan) as a
      diagnostic tool for HSC. 18F-FDG PET scan could be helpful in the diagnosis, follow-up and
      therapy strategy of HSC, helping to stop antifungal treatment. Other molecular,
      immunological and serological tools have to be developed in order to avoid hepatic biopsies.
      Actually, mycological evidence of infection is found in only 20% of the cases. The
      pathogenesis of HSC is also not well understood, but it is believed that it may be due to an
      unbalanced adaptive immune response that leads to an exacerbated inflammatory reaction,
      resulting in an Immune Reconstitution Inflammatory Syndrome (IRIS). In that context, a
      better understanding of the disease pathophysiology and of the potential genetic
      susceptibility could have an impact on therapy strategy. For example, new approaches such as
      the use of adjuvant high-dose corticosteroids have been shown beneficial. This study is the
      first step to improve HSC diagnosis and therapy strategy.
