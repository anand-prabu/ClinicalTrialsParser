    <textblock>
      Aim of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of 24 weeks of oral
      Sofosbuvir/Ledipasvir fixed-dose combination (FDC) in subjects with HCV genotype 1 infection
      and HIV co-infection, who have previously failed a NS3/4A protease inhibitor plus Pegylated
      interferon /ribavirin regimen or stopped prematurely their treatment for intolerance.
