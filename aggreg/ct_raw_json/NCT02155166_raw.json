As secondary objectives, the effects of the interventions on the\n      pain scores assessed 2 and 6 hours after the LNG-IUS insertion, the level of discomfort\n      associated with the insertion procedure and the ease of insertion of the LNG-IUS will be\n      evaluated.\n\n      Design: open randomized controlled trial Setting: Outpatient contraceptive services\n      Patients: 100 women who want to use the LNG-IUS Interventions: 100 women will be randomized\n      into two groups: a) use of a NSAID (ibuprofen, 400 mg) 1 hour before the LNG-IUS insertion;\n      and b) 2% lidocaine intracervical injection. These women will be evaluated immediately after\n      the LNG-IUS insertion, and then 2 hours and 6 hours after it.\n\n      Main outcome measures: Two pain scales will be used (the visual analogue scale and the\n      facial pain scale) in addition to assessing the ease of insertion (as rated by the provider)\n      and the level of discomfort from the procedure (as rated by the patient). Multivariate\n      logistic regression will be performed to analyze the predictors associated with\n      moderate/severe pain."
