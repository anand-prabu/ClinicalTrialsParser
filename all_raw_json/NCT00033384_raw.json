Patients are stratified according to tumor type\n      (non-small cell lung vs breast vs colon vs pancreas).\n\n      Patients receive oral CI-1040 twice daily on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 28 days during the first 6 months of\n      study therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 52-172 patients (13-43 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
