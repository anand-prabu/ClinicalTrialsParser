  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In cigarette smokers that are HIV+, one of the most common HIV-associated non-AIDS
      conditions is the accelerated development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a
      disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Based on the knowledge that
      COPD in smokers starts in the small airway epithelium, this study is focused on examining
      the hypothesis that the accelerated development of COPD associated with HIV infection
      results, in part, from an interaction of HIV directly on the small airway epithelium or
      through infection of cellular components of the immune system, with mediators released by
      these immune cells evoking premature biologic aging of the small airway epithelium. By
      identifying the early events in the pathogenesis of the HIV-associated accelerated COPD in
      smokers, we aim to identify biologic targets to which pharmacologic therapies could be
      addressed.

    <description>We examine the pathogenesis of the accelerated development of COPD in smokers with HIV infection and the premature biologic aging of the small airway epithelium (SAE) mediated by the effects of direct HIV infection of the SAE and/or through the interaction of HIV-infected T cells and/or alveolar macrophages (AM) with the SAE, resulting in the disordered biology of the SAE that is central to the pathogenesis of COPD.</description>
