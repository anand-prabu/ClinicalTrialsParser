  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if tablets manufactured at different sites have
      the same bioavailability, that is yield similar blood levels/concentrations of the drugs and
      are handled by the body similarly

      Primary Purpose:

      Other: Protocol designed to demonstrate the bioequivalence of the fixed dose combination of
      5 mg Saxagliptin and 1000 mg Metformin Extended Release Tablet manufactured in Mt. Vernon,
      Indiana and Humacao, Puerto Rico relative to the fixed dose combination tablet manufactured
      in Mt. Vernon, Indiana and the bioequivalence of the fixed dose combination of 5 mg
      Saxagliptin and 500 mg Metformin Extended Release Tablet manufactured in Mt. Vernon, Indiana
      and Humacao, Puerto Rico relative to the fixed dose combination tablet manufactured in Mt.
      Vernon, Indiana in healthy human subjects under fed conditions
