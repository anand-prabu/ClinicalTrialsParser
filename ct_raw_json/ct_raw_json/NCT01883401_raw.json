The\n      investigators propose to examine the effects of low and high doses of freeze-dried\n      strawberries on serum glucose, insulin, and lipid profile, biomarkers of oxidative stress\n      and inflammation, in a 12-week randomized controlled trial. Subjects with abdominal\n      adiposity and dyslipidemia (n=15/group) will be recruited at OUHSC and OSU, and randomly\n      assigned to the low (25g/day) or high (50g/day) strawberry dose, or matched control (fiber\n      and calories) group. The strawberry group will consume freeze-dried strawberry beverage (2\n      cups/day) and the controls will consume 2 cups beverage (fiber +calories) daily for 12\n      weeks. Blood draws, anthropometrics, blood pressure, and dietary data will be collected at\n      screen, 6 and 12 weeks of the study to determine chronic and acute effects of strawberry\n      intervention. Serum or plasma samples will be analyzed for fasting glucose, insulin, lipid\n      profile including total cholesterol, LDL-, and HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, lipid\n      particle size, and levels of oxidative stress (malondialdehyde, oxidized LDL,\n      myeloperoxidase), inflammation (high sensitivity C-reactive protein, adiponectin,\n      interleukins) and adhesion molecules. Repeated measures ANOVA will be performed using a 5%\n      significance level. We anticipate a dose response effect in decrease in lipids, oxidative\n      stress or inflammation following strawberry intervention versus controls."
