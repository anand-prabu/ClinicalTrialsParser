    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata is a common form of hair loss which reportedly occurs in up to 1.7% of the
      population at some time in their life. Alopecia areata is apparently triggered when the
      individual's own immune system attacks hair follicles on the scalp or body resulting in hair
      loss ranging from single patches on the scalp (patch type alopecia areata) to loss of every
      hair on the scalp and body (alopecia universalis). Currently, there are limited treatment
      options for alopecia areata and unfortunately, the treatments utilized have never been
      rigorously tested in a placebo controlled trial.

      Triamcinolone (Kenalog) is a steroid solution that has been used as treatment for alopecia
      areata for over 50 years. It is administered via injection into the scalp and appears to
      have some efficacy for patients with mild to moderate alopecia areata. We currently do not
      have objective data on the frequency of occurrence of successful regrowth, the duration of
      response or the incidence of side effects. In addition, there is disagreement between
      clinicians regarding the dose of intralesional triamcinolone (IL TAC) that is considered
      most effective.

      This study aims to determine the frequency of response to treatment with 3 concentrations of
      IL TAC, 2.5mg/ml, 5mg/ml or 10mg/ml as well as the duration of response and incidence of
      side effects compared to treatment with placebo (sterile saline solution). After the 1st 6
      months non or partial responders may be treated for 6 months with open label triamcinolone
      at the dose deemed appropriate by the investigator.

      We will also perform skin biopsies of the scalp and draw blood at selected time points in
      order to examine the immunohistochemical/pathological response in scalp hair follicles and
      the systemic circulation to treatment with IL TAC for alopecia areata.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alopecia areata (AA) is a major medical problem and is the most prevalent autoimmune disease
      in the US. AA represents the second most common form of hair loss, and causes significant
      disfigurement and psychological distress to affected individuals. AA affects more
      individuals than most other autoimmune diseases combined, including lupus erythematosus,
      type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, multiple sclerosis and rheumatoid arthritis. In contrast to
      these conditions, research into the pathogenesis and the development of innovative therapies
      in AA has lagged behind.  Intralesional steroids (IL TAC) are arguably the most commonly
      used treatments for AA, especially in patients with less than 50% hair loss. Despite this,
      there are no adequately powered, randomized controlled clinical trials (RCTs) examining the
      efficacy, safety and duration of effect of IL TAC. In addition, the dosage or strength used
      varies among practitioners and the efficacy and safety of alternate doses of IL TAC has
      never been examined in a well designed RCT. Quantitative biomarkers for AA are a crucial
      step toward translational research aimed at clinical trials in AA.

      We will evaluate the efficacy of treating patients with moderate AA for 6mths with IL TAC at
      a strength of 2.5mg/ml, 5mg/ml, IL TAC 10mg/ml versus intralesional saline (placebo)
      followed by a 6mth follow-up period to evaluate relapse and to identify a clinical
      correlation between treatment outcome and down modulation of key AA-associated
      immunohistopathological markers and biomarkers in the treated skin; including NKG2DL
      expression in the hair follicle, immune infiltration (CD8+NKG2D+ cells) and expression of
      interferon response genes. After the 1st 6 months non or partial responders may be treated
      with open label triamcinolone at the dose deemed appropriate by the investigator.
