      Prior to a non-urgent blood transfusion, subjects will be randomized to either stopping
      feeds or continuing feeds. The intervention group will be the placement of a subject in the
      NPO group. Subjects in the intervention group will have their feedings stopped for a total
      of 24 hours around the time of the PRBC transfusion. These infants will be given intravenous
      nutrition during the period of time that they will not be fed.  During the transfusion, both
      groups of subjects will have serum cytokine levels obtained at 3 time intervals- 1) 4 hours
      pre-transfusion, 2) 2-4 hours post-transfusion, and 3) 20-24 hours post-transfusion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recently many publications have indicated a potential temporal association between packed
      red blood cell (PRBC) transfusion and the development of NEC in neonates.  Although, to
      date, there is no conclusive evidence indicating a causal role of PRBC transfusion on the
      development of NEC. Given the growing body of data that support the association of PRBC
      transfusions and NEC, a common clinical dilemma arises with regard to feeding infants during
      a blood transfusion. Additionally, it is thought that increased immunomodulation may be
      exacerbated by any other pro-inflammatory process or insult; thereby leading to a rapidly
      increasing cascade of pro-inflammatory cytokines which may ultimately lead to gut
      inflammation and NEC.

      Prior to a non-urgent PRBC transfusion, subjects will be randomized to either the NPO group
      or fed group of patients. The intervention will be the placement of a subject in the NPO
      group. Subjects will be made NPO for a total of 24 hours around the time of the PRBC
      transfusion. During the transfusion, both groups of subjects will have serum cytokine levels
      obtained at 3 time intervals- 1) 4 hours pre-transfusion, 2) 2-4 hours post-transfusion, and
      3) 20-24 hours post-transfusion.
