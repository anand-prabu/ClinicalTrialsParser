  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, single-arm, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      adding Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) to nucleos(t)ide analogue (NAs) treatment in patients
      with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B genotype D showing stable HBV DNA suppression. After
      a 12-week Lead-in period on treatment with NA, patients with a HBsAg decline &lt;0.5 log10
      IU/ml will enter the Add-on period to receive Pegasys 180 mcg subcutaneously weekly for 48
      weeks in addition to their current NA treatment. Follow-up will be a further 48 weeks,
      during which the patients will continue their NA treatment.
