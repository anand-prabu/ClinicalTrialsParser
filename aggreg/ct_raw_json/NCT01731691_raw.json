            "textblock": "This study protocol is designed to investigate the benefit of a well-tolerated, FDA approved\n      biological product that has been extensively used in a different patient population.\n\n      For more than 20 years, \u03b11proteinase inhibitor (\u03b11PI or \u03b11antitrypsin) therapy has been the\n      standard treatment for people with insufficient \u03b11PI blood levels.  This disorder, also\n      known as \u03b11antitrypsin deficiency, was previously thought to be caused only as an inherited\n      trait due to the gene PIzz.  Recent evidence shows that it can also be an acquired disease.\n      Specifically, individuals with HIV-1 disease have been found to have severely low \u03b11PI blood\n      levels (Bristow et al., 2001; Bristow et al., 2010; Bristow et al., 2012).  Many people with\n      the inherited version of \u03b11PI deficiency eventually develop emphysema, and among individuals\n      with HIV-1 disease, 90% have acquired \u03b11PI deficiency.  Whether they go on to develop\n      emphysema is still unresolved.\n\n      HIV-1 infected individuals are the first patient population identified so far in which\n      severe \u03b11PI deficiency is acquired through infection rather than being inherited.\n\n      It was found that a decrease in \u03b11PI blood levels is directly correlated to a decrease in\n      CD4 lymphocytes (Bristow et al., 2001; Bristow et al., 2012):  In a pilot study to determine\n      whether \u03b11PI therapy might benefit the CD4 counts in HIV-1 infected patients\n      (Clinicaltrials.gov NCT01370018), HIV-1 patients with infection-related \u03b11PI deficiency\n      received weekly \u03b11PI therapy (120mg/kg) for a period of 8 weeks and results were compared\n      with those of patients having the inherited version of \u03b11PI deficiency who were\n      simultaneously receiving weekly \u03b11PI therapy (60mg/kg).  None of the patients in the study\n      had ever previously received \u03b11PI therapy.  It was found that CD4 cells rose to normal\n      levels following 2 weeks of intravenous \u03b11PI therapy with no adverse effects observed in the\n      HIV-1 patients (n=3) or the control group of HIV-1 uninfected, \u03b11PI deficiency patients\n      (n=2).  The new crop of CD4 cells were functional, capable of fighting infection, and\n      appeared to be generated from bone marrow-derived stem cells (Bristow et al., 2010).  As a\n      bonus, it was found in the HIV-1 patients that LDL levels (bad cholesterol) decreased and\n      HDL levels (good cholesterol) increased {Bristow et al., in review).\n\n      The information gained from the initial pilot study will be incorporated into this study\n      design to further characterize the mechanism of lymphocyte renewal and to increase the\n      number of patients observed.  Only minor modifications to the pilot protocol are proposed\n      including the sample size, addition of volunteers not receiving therapy, and a double-blind\n      design:  Ten (10) HIV-1 infected patients will be dosed with PROLASTIN\u00ae-C (Grifols\n      Therapeutics Inc.), five (5) will be dosed with placebo, and five (5) uninfected volunteers\n      not receiving therapy will be monitored.\n\n      It has been observed that CD4 counts and cholesterol levels are correlated and that there is\n      cyclic variation in individuals with and without HIV.  To examine whether there are\n      differences due to HIV infection in cyclic variation of CD4 counts, cholesterol levels, and\n      other values monitored during this study, five (5) volunteers, who do not have HIV, will be\n      included in the study for blood collection only.\n\n      In a previous study, we determined that in individuals with abnormally low active \u03b11PI\n      levels, CD4 counts exhibit sinusoidal cycling with 23 day periodicity. Wave form appearance\n      of CD4 cells with a peak every 23 days is a pattern that is indicative of adult\n      thymopoiesis. We showed that in response to \u03b11PI therapy, HIV infected and uninfected\n      individuals exhibited an increased CD4 counts axis of oscillation, but no change in\n      periodicity. In contrast, one uninfected individual who was not receiving therapy, exhibited\n      no change in the axis of oscillation, but periodicity was 27 days. Human adult thymopoiesis\n      is not well characterized, and based on these results, we have two hypotheses.\n\n      One hypothesis is that in response to \u03b11PI therapy, thymopoiesis will increase, manifested\n      by an increased axis of oscillation and increased numbers of recent thymic emigrants. In the\n      proposed study, we will perform weekly TREC analysis which measures recent thymic emigrants\n      and is definitive for thymopoiesis. We will test whether the changes in TREC numbers\n      corresponds with changes in the CD4 counts axis of oscillation in HIV infected individuals\n      receiving \u03b11PI therapy as compared with HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active\n      \u03b11PI levels not on \u03b11PI therapy, and HIV uninfected individuals with normal active \u03b11PI\n      levels not on \u03b11PI therapy.\n\n      The second hypothesis is that in individuals with abnormally low active \u03b11PI levels, the\n      periodicity of CD4 counts is shorter than in individuals with normal active \u03b11PI levels.\n      Although we will measure periodicity in only 5 individuals with normal active \u03b11PI levels\n      and 15 with abnormal active \u03b11PI levels, this will allow us to determine whether active \u03b11PI\n      is a linear determinate of periodicity or whether there are other variables that regulate\n      periodicity. In an 8-week study, only 2 periods can be observed. Thus, following an 8-week\n      regimen of therapy, one study subject may be asked to continue for a second 8-week regimen\n      of therapy to allow the observation of 5 periods.\n\n      In addition to these two primary hypotheses regarding CD4 counts, we have found that HDL and\n      LDL levels are linearly dependent on the balance of active and inactive \u03b11PI levels\n      (manuscript in review). This phenomenon is due the transport of HDL and LDL by CD4 cells. We\n      found that in HIV infected individuals with abnormally low active \u03b11PI and abnormally high\n      inactive \u03b11PI, HDL and LDL increased or decreased differently from individuals with normal\n      active \u03b11PI. Based on these results, our hypothesis is that in HIV infected individuals with\n      abnormally low active \u03b11PI receiving \u03b11PI therapy, LDL levels will decrease and HDL levels\n      will increase as active \u03b11PI levels increase in contrast to HIV uninfected individuals with\n      normal active \u03b11PI levels not on therapy and in contrast to HIV infected individuals with\n      abnormally low active \u03b11PI levels not on therapy.\n\n      Prolastin-C treatment will be given weekly for eight (8) to sixteen (16) weeks by\n      intravenous infusion.  Blood will be collected immediately prior to each infusion.  As in\n      the previous study, complete blood count, lymphocyte phenotype, extended lymphocyte\n      phenotype, lymphocyte function; HIV-1 viral load, lipid levels, blood chemistry, and markers\n      of inflammation will be measured.  The present study will also include measurements for\n      HIV-1 tropism and markers for recent thymic emigrants."
