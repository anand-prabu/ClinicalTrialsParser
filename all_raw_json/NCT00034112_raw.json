            "textblock": "OMT sessions are designed to improve chest wall compliance and diaphragmatic function which\n      produce an immediate positive change in pulmonary function parameters and chest wall\n      mobility. This research project will be a significant step in expanding the understanding of\n      the role of OMT in the treatment of chronic lung disease. It is expected to yield evidence\n      that OMT is an important adjunctive modality that improves pulmonary function, increases\n      exercise tolerance, relieves dyspnea, and improves quality of life in those with COPD, and\n      that would have widespread clinical application plus significant economic benefits.\n\n      Participants in this study will be randomly assigned to receive either OMT or sham\n      treatments once a week for 13 weeks. Outcome measures will be obtained at baseline;\n      immediately following the first treatment; at 4, 8, and 12 weeks after initiation of\n      treatment; and 4 weeks after termination of the treatment. Outcome variables include\n      pulmonary function tests; quality-of-life questionnaires (including emotional functioning,\n      fatigue, and dyspnea); and measurements of exercise tolerance and chest wall mobility."
