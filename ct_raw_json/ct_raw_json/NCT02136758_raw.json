To investigate the effect of lifestyle modification on: (1) physiological measurements of\n      coronary artery disease (CAD) including carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), exercise\n      stress tests, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), and weight; (2) plasma markers\n      associated with development of CAD such as lipids and triglycerides; and (3) molecular\n      characteristics such as gene expression signatures and protein profiles.\n\n      B. To determine if patients with heart disease or risk factors that would promote heart\n      disease can achieve and adhere to the goals of a lifestyle change program in a\n      non-residential, out-patient setting."
