    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see how safe the study drug is and how well it is tolerated
      after dosing. The study will also investigate how the study drug is taken up, metabolized
      (chemically broken down), distributed through the body and excreted. A further aim is to
      look at how this process is possibly altered by food by giving the study drug in the
      presence and absence of meals.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a body mass index (BMI) range of 18.5 - 30.0 kg/m2, inclusive. The
             subject weighs at least 50 kg. [screening]

          -  Female subject must be of non-childbearing potential:postmenopausal (defined as at
             least 1 year without any menses) prior to screening, or documented surgically sterile
             or status post hysterectomy (at least 1 month prior to Screening).

             be using highly effective contraception consisting of 2 forms of birth control (1 of
             which must be a barrier method) starting at screening and continue throughout the
             clinical study period and for 90 days after the final study drug administration.

          -  Male subject must not donate sperm starting at screening and throughout the clinical
             study period and for 90 days after the final study drug administration.

          -  Subject agrees not to participate in another interventional study while in this
             clinical study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to ASP7962 or any components of the
             formulation used.Subject has any history or evidence of any clinically significant
             cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, hematologic, hepatic, immunologic,
             metabolic, urologic, pulmonary, neurologic, dermatologic, psychiatric, renal, and/or
             other major disease or malignancy, as judged by the Medical Investigator.

          -  Subject has any clinically significant abnormality following the Investigator's
             review of the physical examination, ECG and clinical study protocol-defined clinical
             laboratory tests at screening or on admission to the clinical unit on day -1.

          -  Subject regularly uses any inducer of metabolism (e.g., barbiturates, rifampin) in
             the 3 months prior to admission to the clinical unit on day -1.

          -  Subject had any significant blood loss, donated 1 unit (450 mL) of blood or more, or
             received a transfusion of any blood or blood products within 60 days or donated
             plasma within 7 days prior to admission to the clinical unit on day -1.

          -  Subject participated in any interventional clinical study or has been treated with
             any investigational drugs within 90 days or 5 half-lives whichever is longer, prior
             to the initiation of screening

          -  Subject has a history of suicide attempt or suicidal behavior. Any recent suicidal
             ideation within the last 3 months (a level of 4 or 5 for any 1 item on the scale), or
             who are at significant risk to commit suicide, as judged by the Investigator using
             the C-SSRS at screening and on admission to the clinical unit on day -1.
