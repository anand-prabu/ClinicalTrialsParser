      The study is designed to see if lavender aroma therapy reduces pre-operative anxiety in
      breast surgery patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients undergoing surgery experience anxiety in the preoperative setting.
      Pharmacologic anxiolytics require monitoring and cause excess sedation which often
      interferes with the ability to assess and obtain consent from a patient in the preoperative
      holding area. Lavender aromatherapy is an alternative treatment for anxiety which is safe,
      inexpensive, easy to administer, and not overly sedating. In addition to its benefits in the
      preoperative setting, anxiolysis and reduction in sympathetic drive can lead to reduction in
      the intraoperative anesthetic and postoperative analgesic requirements. This in turn can
      lead to faster recovery and expedited discharge from the post anesthesia care unit.

      In the proposed study, we would evaluate the efficacy of aromatherapy with lavender oil in
      reducing anxiety prior to breast surgery. The study group would receive lavender oil
      preoperatively and the placebo group would receive unscented oil preoperatively. Before and
      after treatment, anxiety level would be measured using the Spielberger State-Trait Anxiety
      Inventory. Additionally, vital signs and Bispectral index (BIS) will be measured before and
      after treatment, as further indicators of anxiety level. We hypothesize that lavender
      aromatherapy will decrease anxiety and subsequently will reduce blood pressure, heart rate,
      and BIS.

    <description>By monitoring vital signs, we hope to show that lavender aroma therapy reduces preoperative anxiety in patients undergoing breast surgery. Tests are done before surgery. Tests are done, aromatherapy is given for 10 minutes, then tests are repeated.</description>
