To maximize enrollment, the\n      trial will enroll both symptomatic and asymptomatic GRN mutation carriers. The trial will\n      include a four week, dose-escalation phase followed by 1-month maintenance phase, and a\n      1-week taper. Assessments at the study site will take place prior to starting nimodipine,\n      each week the dose is increased (weeks 1-5), after 4 weeks of maintenance dose, and 2 weeks\n      after completion of the study. These will include blood chemistry tests, ECGs, and blood\n      pressure. Both dose escalation and maintenance will focus on safety and tolerability of\n      nimodipine treatment in this population as well as plasma progranulin levels as a biomarker\n      outcome. The trial will incorporate a variety of other fluid biomarker (blood and CSF) and\n      imaging assessments to determine which will be most sensitive to nimodipine pharmacodynamic\n      effects in this population."
