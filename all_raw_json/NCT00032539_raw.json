The BICEP also offers a method to certify\n      informed consent in routine use.\n\n      Study Abstract: Customized Consent will develop and test an innovative, supplemental method\n      of disclosing information to patients in the informed consent process.  This disclosure\n      strategy is intended to increase patients' understanding and satisfaction with the consent\n      process.  This study has two goals:\n\n        -  to evaluate the effectiveness of an intervention to improve comprehension during\n           informed consent; and\n\n        -  to identify those patients for whom this intervention is most effective.\n\n      The primary goal of EQUIC-CC is to determine whether an intervention, added to usual\n      procedures for obtaining informed consent, is able to improve comprehension.  The second\n      goal of EQUIC-CC is to identify those patients for whom an augmented consent intervention is\n      most effective, as well as to determine which subgroups of patients, if any, are most likely\n      to benefit from visual information added to the usual disclosure phase of obtaining informed\n      consent."
