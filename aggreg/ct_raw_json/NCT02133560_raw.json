Subjects will be asked to monitor their daily iron chelator\n      administration by taking a video recording of preparing it and ingesting at least one sip.\n      Subjects will also use a medication log to record daily administration of medication, and\n      meet with study staff monthly for educational activities. The data collected will be\n      analyzed to describe patient adherence and comfort level with the process of daily recording\n      of medication management.
