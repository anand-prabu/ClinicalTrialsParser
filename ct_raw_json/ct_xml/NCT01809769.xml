    <textblock>
      Two injections in total and 3 ml autologous adipose-tissue-derived progenitor cells(haMPCs)
      for each injection; time-points for intervention: 1) initial injection; 2) 3 weeks following
      initial injection. The trial duration is 3 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adipose (fat) tissue is removed by lipo-aspiration (this may take up to 40 minutes). The fat
      is processed on-site to isolate the cells (this process takes up to 2 hours). The suspension
      of the cells is injected into the knee joint under ultrasound guidance. (about 20 minutes).
