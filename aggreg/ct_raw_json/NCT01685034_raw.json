These symptoms may require emergent endoscopic\n      removal of foods and esophageal dilations due to remodeling causing significant impairment\n      in quality of life.  Treatment options are limited and often not well tolerated or\n      effective.   There is poor understanding of the natural history and long term prognosis.  It\n      has been associated with allergic sensitization; a high percentage of affected individuals\n      having associated atopy and current literature demonstrates a seasonal distribution of\n      incidence and severity of symptoms.  Allergy immunotherapy (AIT) is a well established and\n      effective treatment for allergic rhinitis and asthma which can induce tolerance to\n      environmental allergens.\n\n      Given the efficacy of AIT and the association of aeroallergen sensitization and even\n      seasonal variation of EoE symptoms, we hypothesized that AIT may be a treatment option for\n      patients with EoE."
