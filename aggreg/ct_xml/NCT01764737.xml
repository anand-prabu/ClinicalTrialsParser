  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV administration of
      VX15/2503 in patients with multiple sclerosis.  The escalation part of the study will
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VX15/2503-N-101 is a single ascending dose-escalation, randomized, double-blinded,
      placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of IV-administered
      VX15/2503 in patients with multiple sclerosis.  This will be accomplished by using a dose
      escalation procedure starting at a low dose of VX15/2503 and will continue based on
      predefined parameters until the maximum tolerated dose is identified. Patients will be
      randomized at a 4:1 ratio to receive VX15/2503 to placebo. The patients and the study team
      will be blinded to the treatment that each patient receives.

      The study drug, VX15/2503, is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to the semaphorin
      4D (SEMA4D; CD100) antigen. Experimental evidence suggest that antibody neutralization of
      SEMA4D may represent a new therapeutic strategy for treating multiple sclerosis.
