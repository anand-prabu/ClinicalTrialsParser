             aripiprazole and risperidone or 2) failure of at least three previous clinically
             adequate drug trials targeting irritability (one trial must include aripiprazole or

             available.

             irritability) for four weeks prior to screening visit and during the study.

             measures and shipping control sample for Extracellular Signal-Related Kinase
             biomarker (ERK) assay.
