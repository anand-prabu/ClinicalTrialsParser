  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is an experimental cancer treatment drug. It damages DNA in
      tumor cells. Tumor cells with damaged DNA may die, resulting in cell death. Researchers want
      to see if this drug is a safe and effective treatment for solid tumors and lymphomas that
      have not responded to earlier treatment.

      Objectives:

      - To see if Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is a safe and effective treatment for advanced solid
      tumors or lymphomas.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have solid tumors or lymphomas that have not
      responded to treatment.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Tumor samples may also be collected. The size and location
           of the tumors will be determined with imaging studies.

        -  Indenoisoquinoline LMP400 is given in a  28-day cycle. Participants will receive  the
           drug  by intravenous infusion on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle, followed by a break
           of 13 days without the drug.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies. Tumor
           samples will be optional.

        -  Participants will continue their cycles of treatment as long as the cancer does not
           grow and there are no severe side effects.

      Background:

        -  Indenoisoquinolines are non-camptothecin topoisomerase (Top1) inhibitors that form
           stable DNA-Top1 cleavage-complexes, have a preference for unique DNA cleavage sites,
           and are active against camptothecin-resistant cell lines. Unlike camptothecins,
           indenoisoquinolines are chemically stable and active in cells that over-express
           ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCG2 and multidrug resistance (MDR-1). Top1
           inhibitors are potent anticancer agents because stabilizing cleavage complex formation
           induces replication-and transcription-mediated DNA damage and delays DNA repair,
           leading to apoptosis. Preclinical and clinical data indicate that baseline tumor levels
           of Top1 correlate strongly with ability to respond to Top1 inhibitor therapy.

        -  A first-in-human Phase I study conducted at the NCI of the indenoisoquinoline LMP400
           (NSC 743400) on a QD x 5 q28 schedule in patients with refractory solid tumors and
           lymphomas (10-C-0056) established that this agent is well tolerated. LMP400 shows
           linear pharmacokinetics with evidence of drug accumulation following 5 days of dosing.
           We hypothesize that weekly dosing (days 1, 8, 15 q28-day cycle) will increase LMP400
           peak levels and exposures, improving clinical activity and safety.

      Primary Objectives:

        -  To establish the safety and tolerability of weekly (days 1, 8, 15 q28-day cycle) LMP400
           in patients with refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

        -  To establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly LMP400 in patients with
           refractory solid tumors and lymphomas.

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of weekly LMP400.

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  Evaluate the level of Top1 in tumor biopsies pre- and post- administration of LMP400.

        -  Evaluate the effect of LMP400 on markers of DNA damage and apoptosis, such as  &gt;=H2AX
           and caspase 3, in tumor biopsies pre- and post- LMP400 administration.

      Eligibility:

      -Patients with histologically confirmed metastatic solid tumors and lymphomas; adequate
      organ function.

      Study Design:

        -  This is an open-label Phase I trial evaluating weekly administration of LMP400, on days
           1, 8, and 15, in 28-day cycles.

        -  Starting dose is based on the MTD determined from the QD x 5, q28 day schedule
           currently being evaluated. The study will follow a 3 plus 3 design.

        -  Once the MTD is established, 10 additional patients will be enrolled at the MTD to
           further define the pharmacokinetics and evaluate effect of study drug on DNA damage and
           apoptosis.

             exist or are associated with minimal patient survival benefit.

          -  The Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status less than or equal
             to 2

          -  The effects of indenoisoquinolines on the developing human fetus are unknown. For

             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to
             study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 3 months after
             completion of indenoisoquinolines administration. Should a woman become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she
             should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this
             protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the
             duration of study participation, and 3 months after completion of indenoisoquinolines
             administration

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients must have recovered to at least eligibility levels due to adverse events
             (AEs) and/or toxicity of prior chemotherapy or biologic therapy. They must not have
             had major surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or biologic therapy within 3 weeks (6
             weeks for nitrosoureas and mitomycin C, or 2 months for UCN-01). Patients must be
             greater than or equal to2 weeks since any investigational agent administered as part
             of a Phase 0 study (also referred to as an    early Phase I study    or    pre-Phase
             I study    where a subtherapeutic dose of drug is administered) at the PI   s
             discretion, and should have recovered to eligibility levels from any toxicities.
             However, patients receiving bisphosphonates for any cancer or undergoing androgen
             deprivation therapy for prostate cancer are eligible for this therapy. Prior therapy
             with topoisomerase I inhibitors is allowed.

          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Patients with known active brain metastases are excluded from this clinical trial
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse
             events. Patients with brain metastasis stable for at least 4 weeks following surgery
             and/or radiation are eligible.

          -  Uncontrolled incurrent illness including, but not limited to, symptomatic congestive
             heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.

          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with LMP400. Appropriate studies will
             be undertaken in patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when
             indicated.

        INCLUSION OF WOMEN AND MINORITIES:

        - Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.
