The purpose of this study is to determine whether crystalloid\n      (Lactated Ringer's solution) or colloid (hydroxyethyl starch) intravenous infusion is more\n      effective in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)\n\n      Treatment:\n\n      - Patients are randomly divided into two groups. Depending on the blood pressure of the\n      patients the members of the first group receive 15-50 ml/kg Lactated-Ringer's solution daily\n      as part of the treatment, while the others 15 ml/kg Lactated-Ringer's and 15-50 ml/kg\n      hydroxyethyl starch solution daily.\n\n      Measurements:\n\n        -  Neurological status of patients will be determined by the NIH Stoke Scale Score and the\n           Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on a daily basis.\n\n        -  The mid-term survival and quality of life are evaluated with Barthel Index and Glasgow\n           Outcome Scale (GOS) 14 and 30 days following admission to our clinic.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      -The prevalence of vasospasms, the mortality rate and the medium-term quality of life\n      following subarachnoid hemorrhage is improved if patients are treated with intravenous\n      colloid (hydroxyethyl starch) infusion compared to intravenous crystalloid infusion."

Previous medical history\n           is obtained with particular regard to the onset of the symptoms and the premorbid blood\n           pressure values. Afterwards the Hunt-Hess classification of the patients take place.\n           The neurological condition is recorded with the help of the NIH Stroke Scale on a daily\n           basis. An acute or delayed open surgery or endovascular coiling is carried out by\n           either a neurosurgeon or an interventional neuroradiologist as the definitive treatment\n           of the aneurysm.\n\n        -  Patients are randomized into two groups, either treated with Lactated Ringer's or\n           hydroxyethyl starch solutions. Patients of the Lactated Ringer's are given 15-50\n           ml/kg/day Lactated Ringer's infusion from the beginning of their enrollment, while\n           members of the other group receive 15 ml/kg Lactated-Ringer's and 15-50 ml/kg\n           hydroxyethyl starch solution daily. The blood pressure should not exceed the 160 mmHg\n           systolic and 110 mm Hg mean value prior to the definitive treatment. After definitive\n           care the target blood pressure is set to ensure a clinically optimal state, which\n           should not above 150% of the premorbid blood pressure, and should not exceed 200/120\n           mmHg. In order to achieve and maintain these values additional vasoactive drugs\n           (arterenol, dobutrex) could be administered regardless of the group in a maximum dose\n           of 2.5 micrograms/kg/min arterenol, with an additional dose of 10 ug/kg/min dobutrex if\n           necessary, if the sole intake of intravenous solutions are not sufficient. Blood\n           pressure is measured invasively, continuously after the cannulation of the radial\n           artery.\n\n        -  Neurological status of patients will be determined by the NIH Stoke Scale Score and the\n           Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) on a daily basis. The mid-term survival and quality of life\n           are evaluated with Barthel Index and Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS) 14 and 30 days\n           following admission to our clinic.\n\n        -  The primary outcome measure of the study is the incidence rate of vasospasm in both\n           groups, while secondary outcome measures included 30-day survival, the neurological\n           status and GOS scores after."
