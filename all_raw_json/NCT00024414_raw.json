Treatment repeats every 21 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and off study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
