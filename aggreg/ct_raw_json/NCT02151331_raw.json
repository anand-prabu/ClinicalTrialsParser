            "textblock": "Despite the availability of psychosocial evidence-based practices (EBPs), quality and\n      outcomes for persons with mental disorders remain suboptimal because of organizational\n      barriers to implementation. Replicating Effective Programs (REP), a site-level\n      implementation strategy applied to promote the use of psychosocial treatments in\n      community-based practices, still resulted in less than half of sites actually sustaining the\n      use of these treatments. Based on input from community partners and previous research, the\n      study team subsequently enhanced REP to include Facilitation, a novel implementation\n      strategy which addresses site-level organizational barriers to EBP adoption beyond REP's\n      emphasis on fidelity. Two Facilitation roles were developed: External and Internal\n      Facilitators. External Facilitators (EFs) reside outside the clinic, are supported by the\n      study, and provide technical expertise to providers in adapting and using EBPs in routine\n      practice. Internal Facilitators (IFs) are employed by the sites, have a direct reporting\n      relationship to site leadership, and have the local knowledge to help providers implement\n      EBPs. IFs also address site-specific organizational barriers that may not be observable at\n      baseline or by EFs. The overarching goal of this study is to build the most cost-effective\n      adaptive implementation intervention involving REP and the augmentation of the EF and IF\n      roles to improve patient outcomes and the uptake of an EBP for mood disorders (Life\n      Goals-LG) in community settings. The primary aim of this clustered randomized trial is to\n      determine, among sites not initially responding to REP (i.e., limited LG uptake), the effect\n      of adaptive implementation interventions in sites receiving External and Internal\n      Facilitator (REP+EF/IF) versus External Facilitator alone (REP+EF) on improved patient-level\n      outcomes, including mental health quality of life and decreased symptoms, as well as\n      increased LG use among patients with mood disorders after 12 months. Secondary aims are to\n      determine, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response after 12 months, the effect of\n      continuing Facilitation on patient-level outcomes at 24 months, describe the implementation\n      of EF and IF, and to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of REP+EF/IF compared to REP+EF\n      over the 24-month period. A representative cohort of 80 community-based outpatient clinics\n      (total 1,600 patients) from different U.S. regions (Michigan, Colorado, and Arkansas) will\n      be included in this study. We will use a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial\n      (SMART) design to build the best adaptive implementation intervention. This groundbreaking\n      study design will address three crucial implementation issues: First, IFs are costly for\n      sites since they require additional administrative effort. Second, the extent to which an\n      off-site EF alone versus the addition of an on-site IF can improve patient outcomes in\n      community settings is unclear. Finally, among sites that continue to exhibit non-response\n      after 12 months of Facilitation, the value of continuing the implementation strategy (i.e.,\n      delayed effect) has not been assessed, especially in smaller practices from more rural\n      settings."
