  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thermal injury results in one of the most intense and prolonged forms of pain the body can
      experience. Opioid narcotics are the most powerful drugs for acute and chronic pain, and
      their use in the perioperative period has been the mainstay of treatment; although
      medication requirements in burn patients are often underestimated. More medication may not
      be the answer, as relatively large doses of short acting opioids in the operative theater
      are associated with greater postoperative opioid consumption and higher pain scores.
      Furthermore, extensive use of opioids has resulted in the development of by hyperalgesia and
      allodynia. Lidocaine is an amide local anesthetic that has analgesic, anti-hyperalgesic,
      antiarrhythmic, and anti-inflammatory properties. Over the past 25 years, systemic lidocaine
      has been used for perioperative pain management in a variety of surgical procedures. The
      design of this study will examine if lidocaine will reduce the pain scores and narcotic
      utilization in patients undergoing surgical procedures for burn injuries. The intervention
      group will receive a bolus dose of lidocaine followed by a continuous infusion over 24
      hours. The control group will get an equal volume of saline. We will compare pain scores,
      opioid use, and narcotic equivalents based on body weight and burn surface area (BSA)
      grafted.
