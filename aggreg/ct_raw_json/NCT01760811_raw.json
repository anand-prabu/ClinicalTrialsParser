Twenty five patients will be recruited. Cetuximab treatment\n      will be started (day 0) with 400 mg/m2 followed by two doses of 250 mg/m2 (once weekly on\n      day 7 and 14). Surgery will be performed on day 31 followed by treatment with radiation\n      therapy concurrently with cetuximab (250 mg/m2, once weekly) and cisplatin 35 mg/m2 (days\n      70-112; when indicated by positive margins or lymph nodes with extra-capsular extension).\n      PET-CT and biopsies will be performed before starting with cetuximab, just before surgery\n      and after chemo-cetuximab-RT to determine efficacy of treatment, and to compare the\n      diagnostic properties of the PET-CT with that of the biopsies. The changes, before and after\n      treatment with cetuximab, of protein levels in saliva, and tumor tissue and of microRNA\n      levels in tumor tissue will be studied and correlated with PFS. The quality of life will be\n      assessed. Data from clinical trials RTOG 9501 and EORTC 22931 will be used as historical\n      controls."
