  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the changes in subcutaneous adipocyte size,
      number and gene expression after weight loss and to assess whether those changes contribute
      to decreases in ectopic fat accumulation and insulin resistance in women between ages of
      16-32.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are no studies in young women that have prospectively studied changes in fat cell
      size, gene expression and insulin sensitivity during the transition from overweight/obese to
      normal weight. Our preliminary data suggest that the presence of ectopic fat accumulation
      and insulin resistance in obese children could be considered an &quot;early phase&quot; in the
      development of T2DM. We hypothesize that a 10% weight loss will restore/improve insulin
      sensitivity. Furthermore, we speculate that the decrease in subcutaneous fat mass after
      weight loss is due to a decrease in mean adipocyte cell size, but not cell number.
