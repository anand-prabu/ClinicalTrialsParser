A potential beneficial effect\n      of a diet prior to intervention has been shown in investigations in mammals, therefore this\n      study will investigate if a pre-interventional diet in patients with known kidney disease\n      and scheduled contrast agent examination can attenuate or prevent a post-interventional loss\n      of kidney function."

None of the currently used preventive procedures show a benefit in terms of a\n      CIN-prevention.\n\n      Experimental data suggests, that a pre-interventional caloric restriction might provide\n      kidney protection in this context. This clinical trial investigates if this phenomenon is\n      also applicable in humans. Patients with increased risk for a post-interventional renal\n      failure due to known chronic kidney disease are randomized in 2 groups. Patients of the diet\n      group receive a calorie restriction to 60% of the calculated daily energy rate from day -4\n      until day -1 (included) pre-intervention (day 0 corresponds to day of intervention).\n      Patients of the control group receive alimentation ad libitum.\n\n      Primary objective is the increase of serum creatinine in mg/dl 48 h after begin of\n      intervention in comparison to baseline value obtained in the morning of the day of\n      intervention (day 0) in order to analyse if a pre-interventional calorie restriction as a\n      preventive strategy leads to an attenuation of post-interventioal kidney injury.\n\n      Hypothesis: A four day calorie restriction reduces the increase of serum creatinine after\n      administration of contrast agent in patients with known chronic kidney disease."
