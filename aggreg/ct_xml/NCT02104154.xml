  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To establish the performance characteristics of the Samsung LABGEO PT10 by comparing the
      test results of the PT10 Hepatic assay with results obtained from an FDA-cleared chemistry
      analyzer.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To establish the correlation between measurand values  as obtained from the Samsung LABGEO
      PT10 Hepatic Panel at the point of care, and the corresponding measurand values as obtained
      on a commercial clinical chemistry analyzer, with respect to prospectively collected human
      serum specimens.
