Inadequate LSM\n      will be re-evaluated by experienced operators with the M (standard size) probe. A third\n      register will be performed with XL (obese size) probe in those patients with inadequate M\n      probe determination. Diagnostic accuracy will be estimated in patients with liver biopsy to\n      identify significant fibrosis with a TE cut-off value of 7.6 kPa (kilo pascal)."
