Determine the toxicity profile, dose limiting toxicity, and maximum tolerated\n      dose of UCN-01 administered as a 3, 2, or 1 hour infusion every 4 weeks for patients with\n      advanced solid tumor malignancies and chronic lymphoproliferative disorders. II. Investigate\n      the pharmacokinetics and cellular pharmacodynamics of UCN-01 administered on this schedule\n      in these patients. III. Obtain preliminary evidence of the antitumor activity of UCN-01 in\n      this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is dose escalation study. Patients receive UCN-01 by intravenous infusions\n      over 3, 2 or 1 hour(s) every 4 weeks. The first dose level is administered over 3 hours, the\n      next dose level is administered over 2 hours, and the next and subsequent dose levels are\n      administered over 1 hour. One patient is treated at each dose level until unacceptable\n      toxicity is observed. An additional 2 patients are then entered at that dose level. If dose\n      limiting toxicity (DLT) is experienced in 1 of 3 patients, 3 additional patients are accrued\n      at that dose level. If 2 or more patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose has\n      been surpassed and a total of 6 patients must be treated at the previous dose level. If no\n      patients develop DLT, the dose is escalated in successive cohorts of 3 patients per dose\n      level. Patients are followed for 4 weeks after each drug administration before subsequent\n      patients can be entered at the next higher dose level. Patients are followed for 2 months\n      after their last dose of UCN-01.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued into this study over 18 months."
