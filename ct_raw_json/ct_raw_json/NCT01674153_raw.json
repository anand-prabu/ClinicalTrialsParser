            "textblock": "Hemodialysis is a life-saving treatment for end stage renal disease patients. The chief aims\n      of hemodialysis are solute and fluid removal. Solute removal is  associated with outcome of\n      dialysis patients. Intra-dialytic exercise has been found to improve the toxin removal and\n      it is suggested that exercise increases the cardiac output, thus increases the blood flow to\n      lower extremities. This leads to increased toxin removal from low blood flow regions. On the\n      other hand, exercise can possibly dilate the vasculature and decrease the compartmental\n      resistance. In this study, the investigators aim to investigate the exercise induced\n      physiological changes which enhances the toxin removal. This information combined with\n      patient specific mathematical models will encourage clinicians to opt for Optimal\n      intra-dialytic exercise protocol. On the other hand, Hemodiafiltration is widely accepted\n      renal replacement therapy for improved toxin removal. Hence, we intend to compare the toxin\n      removal outcome for standalone Hemodiafiltration and intra-dialytic exercise in conventional\n      hemodialysis."
