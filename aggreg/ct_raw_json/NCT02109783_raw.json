            "textblock": "Numerous studies have investigated the effect of caffeine on athletic performance, but the\n      findings have not been consistent. This is due, in part, to the differences in response that\n      has been observed both within and between studies. Previous research in our lab has shown\n      that genetic variations affecting caffeine metabolism modify the association between\n      caffeine and heart disease. We hypothesize that the inconsistencies among studies relating\n      caffeine and athletic performance may be due to genetic differences in caffeine metabolism\n      or response. National and Varsity male athletes will take part in an intervention of\n      caffeine versus placebo, using a randomized double-blinded placebo-controlled design, which\n      will test various exercise protocols (power, strength, anaerobic capacity, endurance) that\n      are associated with performance across multiple sports. Saliva samples will be taken for DNA\n      isolation and genotyping various polymorphisms related to caffeine metabolism.  Not only is\n      the outcome of value to determine which genotypes (athletes) are likely to derive an\n      ergogenic effect from caffeine in various sports, but also to identify athletes who may\n      possess a genotype linked to adverse health effects associated with high caffeine intakes."

            "textblock": "Research Methods and Design\n\n      Experimental Design:\n\n      This randomized, double-blinded, placebo controlled, within-subjects counter-measured study\n      design will include 100 national or varsity-level male athletes from a variety of summer and\n      winter Olympic sports. Females will not be included in this study because hormonal\n      contraceptive use, which is common among female athletes, and the time of the menstrual\n      cycle have a significant effect on caffeine metabolism and exercise test performance\n      measures. Controlling for these factors would require a much larger pool of participants and\n      require considerable resources and time. However, if the findings from the proposed research\n      show promising results in men we would then aim to replicate those findings in female\n      athletes.\n\n      Participants will complete 4 visits (~120 min each) in the Human Physiology Research\n      Laboratory in the Athletic Center building at the University of Toronto. All testing will\n      take place between 8:00 AM and noon, and each condition will take place at the same time for\n      each participant to avoid circadian variation. Participants will be instructed to maintain\n      their regular diet (pre-testing meals will be replicated for all visits) and sleeping\n      habits, avoid strenuous activity 48 hours before each visit, and abstain from caffeine one\n      week prior to the first visit and for the duration of the data collection (4 weeks).\n\n      Sample Size Calculation\n\n      Parameters:\n\n      Effect size = 0.25: Although a large effect size for the main treatment effect was found in\n      previous research (0.38), it was decided that to be conservative, this trial would be\n      powered to detect a small-medium effect size which is still of physiological importance.\n      Additionally, we are interested in the effects between the two doses of caffeine which are\n      assumed to be smaller than the main treatment effect. Therefore, a small-medium effect size\n      was needed to ensure sufficient statistical power to make between-caffeine-effect\n      conclusions for the time trial analysis. Finally, other parameters of assessment such as the\n      Vertical Jump for power will likely have a smaller effects size than the time-trial as\n      reported by Tucker et al. (2013) in a study on vertical jump performance in male basketball\n      players. Therefore, a smaller effect size would be required to adequately power the study\n      for all outcome measures (i.e. power, strength anaerobic, aerobic etc.)\n\n        -  Alpha (error probability) = 0.025: In general, an alpha = 0.05 is the standard value to\n           use for this parameter. However, in our study the participants will be enrolled in a\n           number of independent trials, and therefore it was decided to use a lower alpha so as\n           to take into account error that can arise from multiple comparisons such as by sport\n           (power or endurance) plus genotype (risk or common variant).\n\n        -  Power (1-Beta probability) = 0.8: The conventional value of 0.8 was used for power.\n\n        -  Number of groups = 2: Number of stratifications required for genotype subgroup analysis\n\n        -  Number of measurements = 4: The laboratory exercise tests\n\n        -  Correlation among repeat measures = 0: Zero correlation between measurements was\n           assumed.\n\n        -  Sample Size = 74: Based on calculations 74 participants are required. We will recruit\n           100 athletes in order to account for possible withdrawal of up to 25%, without\n           potentially compromising the statistical significance of our results. In addition, if\n           we choose to use multiple comparisons (genotype + sport) we would benefit from a larger\n           sample to minimize the drop in effect size.\n\n      Recruitment\n\n      Recruitment will be carried out at the University of Toronto, Ryerson and York University\n      campuses, the Canadian Sport Institute of Ontario, and at local running/triathlon clubs by\n      flyers posted in appropriate locations. A standardized email with study and contact\n      information will also be sent to head coaches and/or program directors of sports teams/clubs\n      (at all locations listed above) with eligible athletes, who can then choose to make their\n      athletes aware of the study.\n\n      Parameters of Assessment\n\n      Physiological data collected by two trained kinesiologists, a PhD level exercise\n      physiologist, one student assistant and Nanci Guest, the graduate student.\n\n      Anthropometric and Clinical Characteristics\n\n        -  Resting systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure measurements, as well as\n           pulse rate, will be taken twice, one minute apart. The mean of the two consecutive\n           readings will be taken.\n\n        -  Heart rate will be measured before all tests to ensure participant calmness and similar\n           physiological state for all tests and test days.\n\n        -  Heart rate will be monitored throughout the duration of the trials (Visit 2-4) by Polar\n           Heart Rate Monitors (Polar Electro, Finland) and averaged over each segment of work\n           during the exercise protocols, each minute of rest during the exercise protocol, and\n           continuously throughout the recovery period.\n\n        -  Height will be measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a wall-mounted stadiometer and body\n           weight will be measured to the nearest 0.1 kg using a digital scale with participant\n           wearing light clothing and without shoes.\n\n        -  Body weight value will be used to determine 2 and 4 mg per kilogram of body mass\n           dosages for caffeine treatments (plus a placebo dose) that will be ingested in random\n           order (derived by research assistant and blinded to all investigators) during visits 2,\n           3 and 4, over the following three weeks.\n\n        -  Body Composition will be assessed by skinfold thickness as measured by Harpenden\n           skinfold calipers at 4 body sites (biceps, triceps, subscapular, and suprailiac). Body\n           fat will then be estimated from validated equations and fat-free mass calculated.\n\n      Exercise Tests\n\n      Descriptive Characteristics\n\n      Maximal Aerobic Capacity will be assessed by a VO2 max test on a cycle ergometer. This test\n      is part of descriptive data and will be used to determine resistance set in the time trial\n      test (75% peak power). Participants will undergo a graded exercise test on a Monarch cycle\n      ergometer (Groningen, The Netherlands) until volitional fatigue. To determine maximal oxygen\n      consumption (VO2Max), air samples will be analyzed for oxygen and carbon dioxide\n      concentrations via an indirect open circuit spirometry system (Parvomedics, Metabolic Cart,\n      Sandy, Utah). Subjects will be set up with a Polar Heart Rate monitor upon arrival and keep\n      it on for the duration of the procedure (warm-up, test, and cool-down).\n\n      Four main outcome measures (power, strength, anaerobic and aerobic capacity)\n\n        -  Muscular Power will be assessed using the Vertical Jump Test (VJT) as described\n           previously (5). Participants will complete two attempts at each of two vertical jump\n           tests on a force plate (AMTI,Watertown, MA, USA).\n\n             1. squat jump (SJ): from a squatting position (knee angle: 90\u00b0 approximately) in\n                which no preliminary counter movement is performed;\n\n             2. counter-movement jump (CMJ): from an upright standing position with a preliminary\n                 counter movement; There will be a 60 second rest period between jumps and the\n                best score of two will be recorded.\n\n        -  Strength (upper body) will be assessed using a Handgrip Dynamometer (Lafayette\n           Instrument Company model 78010). The highest score after 3 trials will be recorded (in\n           kg).\n\n        -  Anaerobic Capacity will be assessed using the Wingate Anaerobic Test on a cycle\n           ergometer (Ergomedic 849E, Monark, Sweden). Participants will cycle against a fixed\n           resistance of 0.085kg / kg body mass. Three main measures will be recorded during the\n           test:\n\n             -  Peak power (PP): a measure of maximal anaerobic power, or the maximum power output\n                reached for a 5-second period during the first 10 seconds of the test. PP will be\n                recorded in Watts (W) and W/kg.\n\n             -  Mean power (MP): a measure of anaerobic capacity, or the mean power output\n                achieved during the 30-second test. MP will be recorded in W and W/kg.\n\n             -  Fatigue Index (FI): a measure of the rate of power decrease, or the difference\n                between the highest 5-second power output and the lowest 5-second power output,\n                divided by elapsed time. FI will be recorded as a percentage.\n\n        -  Endurance/Aerobic Capacity and power output will be assessed by a Cycling Time Trial\n           (TT). Participants will be instructed to complete a 10 km TT, carried out on a cycle\n           ergometer (Monarch Sports and Medical, Vansbro, Sweden), as quickly as possible with no\n           temporal, verbal, of physiological feedback. Participants' inspired and expired gasses\n           will be measured using a metabolic cart (Cortex, Leipzig, Germany). Time required to\n           complete the test and average power output will be recorded on completion of each test.\n\n      Additional Tests during Exercise Testing\n\n        -  Blood Lactate Testing. Immediately after the Wingate test participants will have their\n           finger pricked with a disposable lancet to puncture the skin and obtain a capillary\n           blood sample for analysis with the Lactate Pro analyzer (LT-1710, Arkray Inc, Kyoto,\n           Japan)\n\n        -  Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) - The Borg scale for RPE will be used to assess\n           subjects' perception of fatigue.\n\n      Genotyping\n\n      Saliva samples will be collected during Visit 1 of exercise testing using the Oragene-500\n      kit for DNA isolation using standard procedures as described previously. Genotyping for\n      candidate genes involved in caffeine metabolism or response will be conducted using the\n      Sequenom MassArray platform.\n\n      Dietary Intake Assessment\n\n      Subjects will complete a 196-item semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire to\n      determine habitual caffeine intake as well as other dietary factors. Dietary intake\n      information will be used to identify potential effect modifiers such as usual caffeine\n      consumption.\n\n      Health, Lifestyle and Physical Activity Assessment\n\n      The General health, lifestyle and physical activity questionnaire (GHLPA) will include\n      detailed questions on caffeine (e.g. intake habits, withdrawal effects etc), previously used\n      in our lab, combined with a validated habitual physical activity/sport history questionnaire\n      previously used to assess sport/physical activity in athletes.\n\n      Statistical Analysis\n\n      Analyses will be carried out using SAS (Version 9.2, NC, USA, 2009) statistical software.\n\n      Briefly, we will report descriptive data (height, weight, age, blood pressure, caffeine\n      intake and habits, body fat %, VO2max, years in sport, training hours per week, dietary\n      assessment data and other lifestyle measures) comparisons between genotype groups using\n      independent t-tests. Potential differences in VO2max, 10 km time trial, anaerobic capacity,\n      lactate threshold, power and strength and rate of perceived exertion will be assessed using\n      repeated measures analysis of variance (RMANOVA) with treatment as a within participants\n      factor and genotype as a between-participants factor. For all RMANOVA procedures, posthoc\n      tests will be performed using independent and dependent t-tests with a Bonferroni correction\n      such that P< 0.05 will be required as the threshold for significance.\n\n      Experimental Procedure\n\n      Initial Screening - phone call or in-person visit\n\n      Potential participants will verify their sports participation and ability to commit to four\n      2-hour visits to the lab 7 days apart. Participants will be reminded of the importance of\n      maintaining their regular diet and eating the same breakfast before each visit. The\n      importance of the required caffeine abstinence, including any caffeine-containing\n      supplements for 7 days prior to the first visit and the duration of the study (4 weeks) will\n      be emphasized and reiterated. Participants will also provide a saliva sample that may be\n      used to confirm caffeine abstinence by measuring salivary caffeine concentrations, which is\n      a good marker of recent caffeine intake.\n\n      Visit 1 (~90 min)\n\n      The first visit to the laboratory will involve familiarization, and obtaining written\n      informed consent from all participants after an explanation about the aims, benefits, and\n      risks involved with the study. Participants will be informed that they are free to withdraw\n      from the study at any time.\n\n      Each subject will complete an \"exercise readiness\" questionnaire (PAR-Q; Physical Activity\n      Readiness Questionnaire) have descriptive and anthropometric data collected, including date\n      of birth, height, body mass, and blood pressure, and they will also provide a saliva sample\n      for DNA isolation and genotyping. During this first visit, maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max;\n      described below) will also be measured for descriptive baseline data, and to derive workload\n      levels for experimental time trials on subsequent testing visits.\n\n      Visit 2, 3 and 4 (~120 min)\n\n      All three visits will be identical with the exception of the 20 min waiting period (then 10\n      min pre-testing warm-up begins) for serum concentration of caffeine levels to reach peak\n      levels, where the participant will complete a different questionnaire or sit quietly with\n      their own activity.\n\n      Upon arrival participants will have been randomly assigned (to maintain blinding) to ingest\n      either the supplement at 2 or 4 mg of caffeine per kg body weight, or dextrose placebo\n      (PLAC). Each participant will ingest the same number of capsules with identical color and\n      size during each visit, whether it is 0, 2 or 4 mg/kg, in order to maintain double-blinding\n      of treatment. Each subject will complete a questionnaire or sit quietly (e.g. reading, using\n      e-devices etc.) while waiting for the first exercise test.\n\n      Exercise test protocol will be identical for visits 2, 3 and 4. After 20 min, participants\n      will warm-up for 10 min and then carry out 4 exercise tests (commencing at 30 min\n      post-caffeine ingestion) to determine different measures of performance:\n\n      i. Muscle power - Vertical Jump Test\n\n      ii. Strength - Handgrip Dynamometer\n\n      iii. Anaerobic Capacity - Wingate\n\n      iv. Endurance/Aerobic Capacity (aerobic power) - 10 km Cycling Time Trial\n\n      Participants may drink water ad libitum throughout the exercise tests."
