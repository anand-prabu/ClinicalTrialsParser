The secondary objective was to describe diet and nutrient intake in this cohort of\n      children. The exploratory objectives were to describe stool microbiota in a subset of this\n      cohort and stool composition (stool soap and nonsoap fatty acids, total fatty acids, and\n      minerals) in a second subset of this cohort.\n\n      (* The mean age of subjects was 33.0 months due to a delay in the study start-up.)"
