The modification of the cast will be done by making an opening where the\n      wound is located in the contact cast system. A contact cast system is a device that will\n      reduce the pressure in the area where the wound is located."

            "textblock": "The accepted care of a diabetic foot ulcer includes cleaning of the wound of the dead and\n      dying tissue around the wound, daily wound care, good nutrition, and adequate relief of\n      pressure. Pressure reduction, commonly known as \"off-loading,\" is most often achieved by\n      having the patient wear an \"off-loading boot\". However, using a cast similar to the cast\n      used to treat broken bones will result in less activity and better wound healing. The cast\n      is considered the best method for off-loading the foot but is not used as often as other\n      methods because the cast covers the foot ulcer and it does not allow you to perform  daily\n      cleaning and examination.\n\n      This study will apply a Total Contact Cast (TCC)System and leave an opening where the ulcer\n      can be treated on a daily basis by the investigators. Patients will be asked to apply an\n      ointment called Santyl \u00ae to their ulcer on a daily basis. Santyl \u00ae ointment is an FDA\n      approved drug that is routinely used on foot ulcers. The Santyl \u00ae ointment cleans wounds to\n      promote a better environment for wounds to heal. It helps remove nonliving tissue without\n      harming the new healing tissue.\n\n      Trial will last 14 days and it will consist of 4 visits. In the first visits, patients'\n      wounds will be cleaned from dead and dying tissue (debridement) and the first modified\n      contact cast will be applied.  Patients will be provided Santyl to apply daily with\n      reapplication of foam dressing.  Patients will return at day 3, and then weekly for 2 weeks\n      for standard evaluation and debridement and wound measurements and at day 3, and week 1\n      visit for reapplication of the modified contact cast."
