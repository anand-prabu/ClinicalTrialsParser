  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label comparative effectiveness clinical trial evaluating the impact of
      three neuromodulation treatment devices to improve the mental health and sobriety status of
      recovering substance abuse patients.  We intend to enroll 200 patients to give us a
      sufficient number of subjects for the planned comparisons.  Following informed consent and
      baseline assessment, patients will be randomly assigned to receive either 1) 15 40-minute
      sessions of Nexalin Brain Stimulator, a cranial electrical stimulation (CES) device,
      once-per-day within a 3-week time-frame; 2) 30 20-minute sessions of the Fischer Wallace
      Stimulator, another CES device, twice-per-day within a 3-week time-frame; 3) 15 40-minute
      sessions of the DAVID Delight, an audio-visual stimulation device (AVS), once-per-day within
      a 3-week time-frame; OR 4) the control-group condition of 15 40-minute relaxation therapy
      sessions once-per-day within a 3-week time-frame. All subjects will then be reassessed at
      the end of the 3 weeks of treatment and again 1, 3, and 6 months later.  In addition to the
      assigned treatments, all patients will also receive the standard array of services that are
      provided by Behavioral Health of the Palm Beaches (BHOPB) including as clinically
      appropriate, psychiatric medication management and Eye Movement Desensitization Response
      (EMDR) therapy.  Patients diagnosed with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) are assessed
      to determine their suitability for EMDR and if suitable, will receive 2 or more EMDR
      sessions.  Patients without PTSD do not receive EMDR therapy.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Adults between the ages of 18 and 75 in early recovery from a substance abuse disorder.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The exclusion criteria are patients diagnosed with 1) an uncontrolled seizure disorder, 2)
        a psychotic disorder with currently active features (e.g., paranoia), 3) a dissociative
        identity disorder, 4) a manic episode within the past month, 5) patients with a pace-maker
        or implanted vagal nerve stimulator, patients prescribed Subocone, Subutext, &amp;/or any
        psychostimulant medication (e.g., Alderol, Concerta, Focalin, Metadate, Vyvance, etc.)
        since these medications interfere with the ability of these neuromodulation devices'
        ability to have the intended effect on patients, and 7) pregnant woman.
