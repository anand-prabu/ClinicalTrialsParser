The survival rate can be further improved uo to\n      50%-75% when they receive HLA-matched HSCT However, the chance of finding a HLA-matched\n      donor is low, especially in China. Alternative donor such as halpo-identical related donor\n      might be an choice.\n\n      Our retrospective analysis showed about 59% overall survival could be achieved when\n      standard-risk adult ALL patients received  halpo-identical HSCT.Therefore, we start this\n      randomization controlled trial  to  compare the efficacy of haplo-identical HSCT with\n      chemotherapy for adult(age:18-39 years old) ALL patients in CR1."
