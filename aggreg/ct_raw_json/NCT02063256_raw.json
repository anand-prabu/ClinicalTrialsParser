Investigate if a modification in nutritional habits may improve  in the short term\n      the qualities of human sperm, testing two hypothesis:\n\n      i) that adding to the diet a  natural whole food rich in polyunsaturated  fatty acids\n      (PUFA)\n\n      OR\n\n      ii) that reducing the intake of saturated fatty acids  and increasing  the consumption of\n      PUFA may affect  beneficially sperm parameters.\n\n      Population. N. 100 hypofertile male subjects attending a fertility clinic.\n\n      Type of study. Interventional study. No drugs or pharmacologic supplementation will be\n      required nor allowed.\n\n      Two different type of  intervention are scheduled:\n\n        -  Supplementation to western style diet with nuts, naturally rich in PUFA\n\n        -  Diet modification  increasing intake of PUFA-rich foods and cutting the consumption of\n           food rich in saturated fats.\n\n      Protocol\n\n        -  Baseline visit and recruiting.\n\n        -  Informed consent\n\n        -  Randomized allocation to treatment group in a 1: 1 manner\n\n      Blinding.

The diet modification\n      is obtained by increasing  intake of nuts and seeds  (walnuts, hazelnuts, almonds, peanuts,\n      sesame, sunflower, flaxseed) and derived oils, fish and vegetables; cutting the consumption\n      of processed meat and dairy products is required as well.\n\n      The type of diet or supplementation is  supported by oral and written information. The\n      compliance to diet will be followed by administration of validated questionnaires.\n\n      The effect of the diet modifications will be followed by  a number of plasma biomarkers we\n      plan to compare at baseline and post intervention.
