This\n      study focuses on breathing control or \"loop gain\" as one of the factors contributing to\n      sleep apnea. Increased levels of oxygen in the air is known to make breathing more stable by\n      lowering \"loop gain\". Here, our goal is to use a new method capable of detecting a reduction\n      in loop gain with oxygen. The investigators also aim to test whether a high loop gain\n      measured at baseline/placebo predicts a greater improvement in sleep apnea with oxygen\n      therapy."

            "textblock": "In a single-blinded randomized crossover study, inspired oxygen/air (40%/21%) is delivered\n      on two separate nights. Loop gain is measured from routine polysomnography using a novel\n      mathematical method. A value of loop gain >1 reflects unstable breathing, and a value less\n      than but approaching 1 denotes a system more prone to oscillate. Loop gain is measured as\n      the changes in ventilatory drive/effort that arises subsequent to changes in ventilation\n      (e.g. due to obstructive apnea). A simple chemoreflex model (gain, time constant, delay) is\n      fit to surrogate ventilation data (derived from airflow) during sleep. The best model is one\n      that best matches the elevated ventilatory drive (measured as ventilation in the absence of\n      airflow obstruction) based on the prior apneic/hypopneic fall in ventilation. Loop gain is\n      calculated from this model. We aim to use loop gain measured on and off oxygen to determine\n      whether a strong response (reduction in apnea severity) can be predicted by a higher loop\n      gain (in the sham arm) using our method. A majority subset of subjects will attend for\n      detailed phenotyping of sleep apnea to assess upper airway anatomy/collapsibility, dilator\n      muscle responsiveness, loop gain and the arousal threshold."
