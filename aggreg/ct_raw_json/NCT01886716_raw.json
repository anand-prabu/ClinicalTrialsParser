The intervention seeks to reduce\n      symptoms by shifting attention away from alcohol-relevant and/or socially threatening cues.\n      The investigators expect that participants receiving alcohol or anxiety training will\n      experience reductions in those specific symptoms compared to participants in a control\n      condition.  The investigators also expect that participants receiving combined alcohol and\n      anxiety training will show the largest reductions in alcohol and anxiety symptoms, relative\n      to participants in any other condition."
