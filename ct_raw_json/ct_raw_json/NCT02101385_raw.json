The resulting sequencing data\n      will be interrogated for known genomic drivers of sensitivity or resistance to existing FDA\n      approved agents.\n\n      CANCER GENOMICS TUMOR BOARD (CGTB):\n\n      Realizing that optimal treatment recommendations cannot be made based on sequencing data\n      alone, the CGTB will be responsible for the final treatment recommendation. The CGTB will\n      consider the genomic data along with the patient's prior treatment history, ongoing\n      toxicities, and comorbidities. Preference will be given to the treatment identified by the\n      sequencing data unless a significant clinical or safety contraindication exists for that\n      therapy. All participants and investigators will be blinded to sequencing results and CGTB\n      deliberations until the time of relapse.\n\n      PARTICIPANTS WITH A CGTB TREATMENT RECOMMENDATION:\n\n      Participants with a CGTB recommendation will be randomized to Experimental Arm A\n      (genomically directed monotherapy) or Control Arm B (standard therapy).\n\n      EXPERIMENTAL ARM A (GENOMICALLY DIRECTED MONOTHERAPY):\n\n      Participants randomized to Experimental Arm A will receive an FDA approved drug at standard\n      dose for four cycles (12-16 weeks total duration, depending on cycle length).  Clinical and\n      laboratory monitoring and dose-reductions will follow the FDA package insert guidelines.\n\n      TOP GENOMIC ACTIONABLE BIOMARKERS/PATHWAYS AND DRUG RECOMMENDATIONS:\n\n        1.

In the\n      event of disease progression on the control arm, patient sequencing results will be\n      forwarded to the treating physician.\n\n      PARTICIPANTS WITH NO CGTB RECOMMENDATION:\n\n      Participants may have no CGTB recommendation either because 1) sequencing did not identify a\n      matched drug or 2) the matched drug was contraindicated. These participants will be assigned\n      to Control Arm B and treated as described above for Control Arm B.

NOTE:  ER, PR and HER2 status will be confirmed by central pathology\n             review prior to randomization. ER and PR will be considered negative if \u2264 1% of cells\n             stain weakly positive. HER2 will be considered negative if scored 0 or 1+ by\n             immunohistochemistry (IHC) or 2+ by IHC associated with a fluorescence in situ\n             hybridization (FISH) ratio of < 2.0 or < 6 copies per cell.\n\n          -  Must have completed preoperative (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy. NOTE: Acceptable\n             preoperative regimens include an anthracycline or a taxane, or both. Participants who\n             received preoperative therapy as part of a clinical trial may enroll. Participants\n             may not have received adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery prior to randomization.\n             Bisphosphonate use is allowed.\n\n          -  Must have completed definitive resection of primary tumor. The most recent surgery\n             for breast cancer must have been completed at least 14 days prior (but no more than\n             84 days prior) to study registration. NOTE: Negative margins for both invasive and\n             ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) are desirable, however participants with positive\n             margins may enroll if the treatment team believes no further surgery is possible and\n             patient has received radiotherapy. Participants with margins positive for lobular\n             carcinoma in situ (LCIS) are eligible. Either mastectomy or breast conserving surgery\n             (including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy) is acceptable.\n\n          -  Must have significant residual invasive disease at the time of definitive surgery\n             following preoperative chemotherapy.  Significant residual disease is defined as at\n             least one of the following:\n\n               1. Residual Cancer Burden (RBC) classification II or III6\n\n               2. Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 2 cm. The presence of\n                  DCIS without invasion does not qualify as residual disease in the breast.\n\n               3. Residual invasive disease in the breast measuring at least 1cm with lymph node\n                  involvement (does not include metastases in lymph node which are only detected\n                  by immunohistochemistry).\n\n          -  Must have an FFPE tumor block with tumor cellularity of 20% or greater. NOTE: Prior\n             to randomization, the tumor cellularity will be confirmed by central pathology review\n             and percent values will be double checked at Paradigm (a Next Generation Sequencing\n             Company).\n\n          -  Whole breast radiotherapy is required for participants who underwent breast\n             conserving therapy, including lumpectomy or partial mastectomy. Participants must\n             have completed radiotherapy at least 14 days prior (but no more than 84 days prior)\n             to study registration.NOTE: Post-mastectomy radiotherapy is required for all\n             participants with a primary tumor \u2265 5 cm or involvement of \u2265 4 lymph nodes. For\n             participants with primary tumors < 5 cm or with < 4 involved lymph nodes, provision\n             of post-mastectomy radiotherapy is at the discretion of the treating physician.\n\n          -  Participants must register within 84 days of surgery (for those participants who do\n             not require radiation) or within 84 days of completion of radiation when radiation is\n             required.\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18 years at the time of consent.\n\n          -  Written informed consent and HIPAA authorization for release of personal health\n             information.  HIPAA authorization may be included in the informed consent or may be\n             obtained separately.  NOTE: Central pathology review may be conducted any time after\n             definitive surgery. Consenting participants may be pre-registered to the study and\n             proceed with central pathology review before full eligibility has been confirmed.\n             However ALL of the eligibility criteria must be met and formal study registration\n             completed prior to submission of the sample for sequencing.\n\n          -  Must consent to allow submission of adequate archived tumor tissue sample from\n             definitive surgery for genomic assessment of tumor.\n\n          -  Must consent to collection of whole blood samples for genomic analysis\n\n          -  Women and men of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of\n             contraception (e.g. hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from the\n             time consent is signed until 4 weeks after protocol therapy discontinuation.\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within 14 days\n             prior to study registration.   NOTE:  Women are considered not of child bearing\n             potential if they are surgically sterile (they have undergone a hysterectomy,\n             bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are postmenopausal for\n             at least 12 consecutive months.\n\n          -  Women must not be breastfeeding.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  No stage IV (metastatic) disease, however no specific staging studies are required in\n             the absence of symptoms or physical exam findings that would suggest distant disease.\n\n          -  No treatment with any investigational agent within 30 days prior to study\n             registration.\n\n          -  No history of chronic hepatitis B or C.\n\n          -  No clinically significant infections as judged by the treating physician."
