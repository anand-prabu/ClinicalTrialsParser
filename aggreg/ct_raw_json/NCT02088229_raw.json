Also, functional assessments\n      such as visual acuity, contrast sensitivity, photostress recovery, dark adaptation,\n      perimetry, and cellular fluorescence will be tested. Adverse events will be recorded and\n      compared with historical controls to ensure that currently accepted interventions are safe.\n      Finally, potential confounding variables for DME including those related to the eye,\n      systemic factors, and patient demographics will be recorded to assess the influence of these\n      variables on treatment response.\n\n      The primary objective is to develop hypotheses that might better explain the retinal\n      structural (anatomical) and/or functional (physiological) mechanisms of visual impairment in\n      eyes receiving treatment for diabetic macular edema (DME)."
