  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dental erosions, the chemical dissolution of enamel without bacterial involvement, are
      considered to be an established complication of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) by
      the Montreal global consensus statement. Given the high prevalence of dental erosions and
      the absence of any pH-impedance data or medical management guidelines for GERD-associated
      dental erosions, reflux characteristics will be characterized using questionnaires,
      endoscopy and esophageal pH-impedance testing, in successive patients dental erosions
      referred by dentists for evaluation of GERD. For assessment of the role of additional
      factors besides H+ activity in the refluxate, a sample of gastric juice will be aspirated
      during endoscopy and frozen for analysis of pepsin and other proteases. Prognostic factors
      for progression of dental erosions will be determined by repeating the evaluation after
      chronic dosing with esomeprazole 20mg twice-daily, which is prescribed to all patients.
