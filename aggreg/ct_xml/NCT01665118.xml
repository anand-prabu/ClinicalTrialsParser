  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the  Trusculpt (Radio
      Frequency) device in the reduction of thigh circumference.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary efficacy variable for this study is the comparison of mean change in thigh
      circumference from baseline to 12 weeks between two arms. The primary research hypothesis is
      that the mean change in thigh circumference is ≥ 1 cm (indicating mean reduction).
