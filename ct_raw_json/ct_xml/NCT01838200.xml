  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalation, non-randomized, phase I study in patients with
      histologically confirmed Stage III or IV melanoma and at least three metastatic cutaneous or
      subcutaneous lesions suitable for: intralesional (IL) injection (1 lesion), accessible for
      biopsy (1 lesion), and response evaluation by RECIST (v1.1) and modified RECIST (irRC) (1
      lesion).  The primary objective is to determine whether IL administration of BCG followed by
      intravenous (IV) infusion of ipilimumab is safe. Ipilimumab (YERVOY®) is the monoclonal
      anti-CTLA-4 antibody approved by the FDA and TGA as anticancer therapy for melanoma.
      Secondary objectives of the study are: a) clinical efficacy, to document whether this
      combination therapy induces tumour responses; and b) immunogenicity, to identify if the
      combination induces immune responses against the tumours.  All patients will be included in
      the analysis of efficacy and immunogenicity.

      Cohort 1 (9 patients with &lt;10mm induration after tuberculin Purified Protein Derivative
      [PPD] test): Group 1 (3 patients) will receive one IL injection of 200 µl BCG containing
      0.16 - 0.64 x 106 cfu followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks,
      starting on day 36. Group 2 (3 patients) and 3 (n=3) will receive 200 µl BCG containing 0.8
      - 3.2 x 106 cfu and 4.0 -16.0 x 106 cfu, respectively, followed by the same ipilimumab
      regimen. Safety will be evaluated in this cohort.

      Cohort 2 (up to 9 patients with ≥10mm induration after PPD test): Enrolment will start after
      the final patient in Cohort 1, Group 1 has reached study week 7. Then enrolment can proceed
      in parallel for Cohort 2 and Cohort 1 Groups 2 and 3.  Patients will receive 0.16 -0.64 x
      106 cfu BCG followed by four IV infusions of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab every 3 weeks, starting on
      day 36.  Evaluation of safety in this cohort will be observational.

    <description>Cohort 1 will include patients with an induration &lt;10 mm in diameter after the pre-study PPD reactivity test. These patients will be enrolled into 3 groups sequentially, each given a single dose IL dose of BCG vaccine into a single selected melanoma lesion on Study Day 1. Each group will include 3 patients to be given a BCG at 16 - 0.64 x 106 cfu BCG (200 µl volume), 0.8 - 3.2 x 106 cfu BCG (200 µl volume), and 4.0 - 16.0 x 106 cfu BCG (200 µl volume)for groups 1, 2, and 3 respectively
All patients in these 3 groups will receive 300 mg daily doses of Isoniazid, commencing 28 days following the BCG injection and continuing for 4 weeks, and Ipilimumab administered intravenously starting 5 weeks after BCG, on Day 36.  Four doses of 3 mg/kg ipilimumab are to be given every 3 weeks.</description>

    <description>Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) is a living attenuated strain of Mycobacterium bovis that stimulates cell-mediated immunity by producing a localized and self-limiting infection.  BCG is used worldwide for vaccination against tuberculosis.  BCG is an immunostimulating agent that has been also shown to have anti-tumour activity in several clinical studies. The exact mechanism of action is not well known, but study data suggest that active non-specific immune responses are induced.  It is probable that BCG invokes a local inflammatory response involving a variety of immune cells, such as macrophages, natural killer cells and T cells</description>
