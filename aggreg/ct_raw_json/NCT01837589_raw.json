            "textblock": "Patients with cystic fibrosis can have a deficit in bone mineralization. This is\n      particularly well described in adults. However, in the pediatric population the results are\n      more heterogeneous. The evaluation is hindered by difficulties in standardization of DXA\n      interpretation.\n\n      This measurement depends from the mass and size of the bone as well as the mass of soft\n      tissue covering the bone area. These two characteristics, intrinsic to the measurement, pose\n      a significant problem of interpretations in children because a change in bone density may\n      reflect both a change in bone mineral content or changes related to growth, for example, the\n      increase in bone size or volume of soft tissue covering the bone of interest.\n\n      Quantitative computed tomography (QCT) provides a direct measure of  bone mineralization\n      densitometry volume. It quantifies bone mineral content in relation to the volume of the\n      bone, in reference to an external phantom. This method therefore overcomes the size size.\n\n      This technique can be considered without an additional radiation exposure to patients during\n      a lung CT because it is usual that lumbar vertebrae are included in the measurement window\n      because of pulmonary hyperinflation. This exam would be ideal for patients with Cystic\n      fibrosis.\n\n      All patients have these two evaluations during their routine management. This study compare\n      study on the bone mineralization evaluated by (QCT) compared to the reference technique by\n      (DXA) for the patient affected by cystic fibrosis for each patient."
