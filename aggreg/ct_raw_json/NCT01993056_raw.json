The 11+ warm-up program was developed by FIFA-experts and\n      consists of several exercises with an overall-length of about 20 min. This study shall\n      investigate the influence of 11+ on injury incidence and Functional Movement Screen\n      (FMS)-Score in male veteran soccer players. Additionally it is to be examined if there is a\n      relationship between FMS-Score and injury incidence. For this purpose the 11+-program is\n      accomplished under supervised conditions over one regular season in a randomized-controlled\n      study design. Injuries are documented via questionnaires in accordance with the\n      FIFA-consensus-statement. FMS-Score is evaluated before and after the interventional period."
