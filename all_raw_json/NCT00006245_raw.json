Courses repeat every 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then every 2 courses\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-37 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-18\n      months."
