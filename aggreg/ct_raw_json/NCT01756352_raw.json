We have defined one\n      primary specific aim, for which we expect to obtain definitive results, and two secondary\n      aims, under which we plan to generate preliminary data to support a future, larger project."

            "textblock": "The PET radiotracer FET provides a measure of large, neutral amino acid transport.  This\n      transport is significantly upregulated in malignant brain tumors. FET rarely gives false\n      positive findings in the setting of inflammation seen after high dose chemotherapy or\n      radiotherapy.  FET labels low-grade as well as high-grade gliomas, in contrast to FDG, which\n      almost exclusively labels only high-grade gliomas. FET imaging may prove to be particularly\n      useful in the setting of infiltrative tumor, which is not contrast-enhancing on MRI and\n      therefore not detectable with FDG. Management of glioblastoma patients with stable\n      contrast-enhancing disease on MRI but increased signs of edema is difficult. This is because\n      it is difficult to distinguish simple edema from infiltrative tumor. The former is managed\n      with steroids and the latter is managed with chemotherapy, and anti-angiogenic drugs.\n\n      FET may be particularly useful in assessing changes after GBM patients receive anti-vascular\n      agents such as Avastin. Avastin is very commonly used in patients after failure of\n      first-line treatment in GBM. Not only is Avastin costly, but it also can have serious side\n      effects such as internal bleeding and gastric perforation, severe hypertension, poor wound\n      healing, and renal toxicity. It is important to know when a patient is failing Avastin\n      treatment so that the drug can be discontinued. Preliminary data in Europe (see figures\n      below) suggests that FET-PET can accurately distinguish Avastin responders from\n      non-responders.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n\n        1. GBM patients with changes on MRI suggestive of recurrence who have not yet initiated\n           antiangiogenic therapy.\n\n        2. Age \u2265 18\n\n        3. Anticipated survival >3 months\n\n        4. Able to give informed consent\n\n        5. Capable of undergoing scan without the need for sedation or general anesthesia.\n\n      Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        1. Active intracranial infection or nonglial brain mass.\n\n        2. Recent large intracranial hemorrhage (<1 month; size to be determined by principal\n           investigator)\n\n        3. Pregnant or nursing. Quantitative serum hCG testing will be performed prior to the\n           initial and each -subsequent FET- PET scan on all females of childbearing potential.\n           Our BWH Radiation Safety Committee and Partners IRB requires stat serum \u00df-hcG pregnancy\n           tests.\n\n        4. Patient lives too far from BWH and/or is unwilling/ unable to return for scheduled\n           imaging visits."
