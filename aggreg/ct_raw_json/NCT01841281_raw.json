This follows our initial 20 subject trial of L-arginine in asthma\n      subjects (Kenyon et al., Pharmaceuticals 2011) that was designed to determine how L-arginine\n      was metabolized (by testing serum markers) and whether certain participants had clinical\n      benefit.\n\n      To do this, we will recruit a total of 50 ATS-defined severe asthmatic subjects with ongoing\n      asthma exacerbations in past two months and enroll them in a randomized, blinded,\n      placebo-controlled, cross-over designed trial of L-arginine and placebo. We will compare 25\n      subjects with \"low\" FeNO < 20 with 25 subjects that have \"high\" FeNO > 25 ppb."
