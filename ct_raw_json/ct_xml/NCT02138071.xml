  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determent whether there is a difference between two types of
      treatments in physiotherapy (individual vs group) for patients with low back pain (LBP), in
      terms of their sensation of how they have been helped and their treatments' outcomes
      measures. The study hypothesizes are: a) Based on the results of literature review which
      does not reveal a clear difference between group and individual treatments' outcomes for
      LBP, it is hypothesized that no difference will be found in treatment results for the two
      types of group treatments in the present study also, b) The assumption is that different
      distribution of therapeutic factors will be found in the two types of treatments
      (individual, group), C) Patients' sensation of how they have been helped will be connected
      to treatment results.

      200 patients with LBP looking for physiotherapy treatment in 15 clinics at Maccabi
      Healthcare Service in Israel will be recruited. (100 after competion individual therapy, 100
      after competion of group therapy). As part of the regular routine in these clinics, patients
      will be asked to fill the LFSQ, a questionnaire which deals with their back functional
      status, their level of pain and fear avoidance of physical activity before and after
      treatment. In the present study, patients will be asked to fill the LFSQ again, 6 months
      after treatment completion. In two weeks from treatment completion, patients will be
      interviewed on the telephone. The interview will focuse on their sensation of how they have
      been helped. It will include an open-ended question and 18 closed questions.

      The main study variables will include: participants' perception of functional status, level
      pain, level of fear avoidance of physical activity, patient-therapist bonding, and helpful
      therapeutic impacts (client's sense of how she or he has been helped).
