            "textblock": "The goal of this Phase II study is to generate pilot data that will allow for the design of\n      a clinical trial of sildenafil (Viagra\u00ae) to treat patients with traumatic vascular injury in\n      the chronic state after traumatic brain injury (TBI).  Injury to small and medium-sized\n      blood cerebral blood vessels is a well-recognized consequence of traumatic brain injury\n      (TBI). Non-invasive imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and single photon\n      emission computerized tomography (SPECT) have long demonstrated deficits in cerebral blood\n      flow in TBI, including in symptomatic patients years after mild TBI (mTBI). Recently,\n      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) methods have been developed which allow reliable and\n      non-invasive measurement of cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR) to vasodilatory stimuli such as\n      hypercapnia in humans.  These techniques have never been applied to symptomatic patients in\n      the chronic stage after mTBI.  These methods are particularly promising due to the recent\n      discovery that phosphodiesterase-5 (PDE5) inhibitors improve cerebral blood flow, induce\n      angiogenesis and neurogenesis, and improve functional recovery in animals after experimental\n      stroke and cryoinjury.   This pilot study will use novel MRI methods (Blood Oxygen Level\n      Dependent (BOLD) response to hypercapnia) to noninvasively measure cerebrovascular\n      reactivity in the chronic stage after TBI, and the first to use sildenafil in patients with\n      chronic TBI.\n\n      The study has one primary objective and 10 secondary objectives:\n\n      Primary objective:\n\n        1. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the\n           global BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage after\n           TBI.\n\n           Secondary objective (Safety and Tolerability):\n\n        2. Sildenafil therapy (25 mg orally twice daily) is well tolerated in symptomatic patients\n           in the chronic stage after TBI, with few adverse effects and treatment discontinuations\n           in less than 10% of patients.\n\n           Tertiary (Exploratory) objectives:\n\n        3. Single dose treatment with sildenafil (50 mg orally) is effective in increasing the\n           regional BOLD response to hypercapnia in symptomatic patients in the chronic stage\n           after TBI.\n\n        4. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in\n           cerebrovascular reactivity compared to uninjured healthy controls.\n\n        5. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have deficits in\n           cerebrovascular reactivity compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI.\n\n        6. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers\n           of circulating EPCs compared to uninjured healthy controls.\n\n        7. Patients with persistent symptoms in the chronic stage after TBI have reduced numbers\n           of circulating EPCs compared to asymptomatic patients after TBI.\n\n        8. The effect on cerebrovascular reactivity of single dose treatment with sildenafil\n           persists after 8 weeks of chronic therapy (25 mg orally, twice daily).\n\n        9. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) increases the number\n           of circulating endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in symptomatic chronic TBI patients.\n\n       10. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) reduces the prevalence\n           of post-concussive symptoms, compared to placebo treatment.\n\n       11. Treatment with sildenafil for 8 weeks (25 mg orally twice daily) improves performance\n           in neuropsychometric tests, compared to placebo treatment."
