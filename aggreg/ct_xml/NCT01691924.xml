  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No clinical trials with PBF-509 in humans have been performed to date. Only preclinical
      studies have been done to assess the pharmacology and pharmacokinetics, the safety and the
      toxicological profile of the PBF-509.

      An initial testing of PBF-509 in humans is planned, starting with the first-into-man
      clinical trial where a single oral, dose-escalating, and placebo-controlled design will be
      implemented.

    <description>The initial dose-escalation scheme includes the following eight doses: 10 mg, 20 mg, 40 mg,80 mg, 160 mg, 320 mg, 480 mg and 620 mg. This dose-escalation scheme has been built with the aim to reach the Minimum Intolerated Dose (MID), i.e. when investigator should stop escalating, and consequently the MTD.</description>
