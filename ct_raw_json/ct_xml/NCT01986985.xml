  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to gather image and associated data to demonstrate usability
      of a pre-market PET/MRI scanner and to use the data for regulatory submission and future
      product development. Clinical data is required in order to test the MR attenuation
      correction of PET data. These aims can only be accomplished through a clinical study.
