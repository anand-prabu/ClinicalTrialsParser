Dose titrations of Tice\u00ae BCG from 2x10^6\n      cfu to 16x10^6 cfu will be delivered intradermally in a dose escalation format to 4 groups\n      of 30 subjects per dose group. In the first dose group, subjects will be immunized\n      intradermally with a single dose of 2x10^6 cfu Tice\u00ae BCG. The Tice\u00ae BCG doses will be\n      increased sequentially from 2x10^6 cfu to 4x10^6 cfu to 8x10^6 cfu to a maximum dose of\n      16x10^6 cfu following assessment of safety and reactogenicity data from previous dose groups\n      and sentinel subjects. Following administration of Tice\u00ae BCG, intradermal (ID) site\n      reactions will be assessed for at least 30 minutes as well as by memory aid on a daily basis\n      throughout the first 15 days.  Subjects will also return to the clinic on Days 22, 25, 29,\n      32, 36, 39, 43, 46, 50, 53, and 57 to evaluate the ID challenge site, assess for\n      lymphadenopathy if indicated based on review of interim medical history and clinical\n      assessment, and review AEs/SAEs, concomitant medications and health status, and collect and\n      dispose of returned biohazard materials.  A final clinic visit will be performed at\n      approximately 3 months (Day 99) following administration of Tice\u00ae BCG to evaluate the ID\n      challenge site, assess for lymphadenopathy if indicated based on review of interim medical\n      history and clinical assessment, and review SAEs and health status. At approximately 6\n      months (Day 181) following administration of Tice\u00ae BCG a telephone call will be performed to\n      query for any SAEs that may have occurred since the last visit. Based on this information,\n      subjects may be asked to return to the clinic to be evaluated. The duration of the study for\n      each subject will be up to approximately 7 to 8 months. Primary Objectives:  1) Evaluate the\n      safety of different doses of intradermal Tice\u00ae BCG for use as a human challenge model for\n      Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. 2) Examine BCG shedding from intradermal challenge\n      sites after administration of different doses of Tice\u00ae BCG in TB naive healthy subjects. 3)\n      Evaluate the reproducibility of BCG shedding over time with both quantitative PCR and\n      culture techniques.
