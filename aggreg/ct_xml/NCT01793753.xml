      Background and Aim:  An anorectal manometry (ARM) is a common test in the evaluation of
      outlet obstruction in constipation.  In children under 6 yo, anesthesia is often used for
      patient comfort and compliance.  The choice of anesthesia for ARM varies from center to
      center and includes the use of ketamine, inhalation agents, and propofol.  With the
      increased use of propofol, our aim is to determine the effects of propofol on resting anal
      sphincter pressure while performing an ARM under general anesthesia.

      Hypothesis: Propofol administration leads to a decrease in internal anal sphincter pressure.

      Methods:  This is a prospective, single center, observational study of the effect of
      propofol on the internal anal sphincter pressure.  Pediatric patients between the ages of
      2-6 years who require an anorectal manometry for chronic constipation will be offered
      enrollment.  Anesthesia was required for patient compliance and comfort and conducted by an
      anesthesiologist.  Sevoflurane was the inhalational agent used for induction.  At
      Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH), 1 mg/kg of propofol bolus is routinely given at
      completion of the ARM test to reduce emergence delirium.  The manometric probe was kept in
      place with continuous measurement of baseline internal anal sphincter pressure while
      propofol was administered.  We measured changes to internal anal sphincter pressure and time
      to return to baseline.

      Results:  The primary outcomes will be change of internal anal sphincter pressure from
      baseline and time to return to baseline.

      Discussion:   The proposed investigation may demonstrate that propofol has an effect on the
      internal anal sphincter pressure which may affect its utility as an anesthetic for anorectal
      manometry.
