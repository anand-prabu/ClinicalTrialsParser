      This trial will be determine the safety and immunogenicity of HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in
      high risk HER-2 high and intermediate expression breast cancers. Subjects will have HER-2
      driven IBC at least Stage IIIA with N2 following chemotherapy with/without trastuzumab or
      recurrence exclusive of new primary tumor b0ut rendered NED. Mammogram, laboratory studies,
      CT, and leukapheresis will be performed, in addition to vaccine administration.
