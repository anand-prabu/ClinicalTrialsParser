  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to implement a sexual health promotion intervention for male sex workers in
      Hanoi and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The study hypothesis is that this intervention will
      increase testing, treatment and vaccination for sexually transmitted infections, including
      intentions of participants to engage in these services beyond the conclusion of the
      intervention. At the community level, the study hypothesis is that male sex workers will be
      more aware of sexual health care and more likely to access these services in the future.
