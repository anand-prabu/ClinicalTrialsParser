The metastatic breast\n      cancer survivors will be recruited from outpatient department of surgical at hospital. The\n      partners will be invited to participate in this study through the survivors. The 120 dyad\n      survivors and spouse will be randomly assigned into an experimental group or a control\n      group. Survivors and spouse partners in an experimental group will receive 2 months time\n      body-mind-spirit group therapy while those in a control will receive usual care in the same\n      period of time. The outcome measures include Experiences in close relationships scale, Moss\n      sleeping scale, Short-form 12 health-related quality of life questionnaires, Meaning of life\n      questionnaire, BDI-II depression scale and salivary cortisol levels. Measurement time-points\n      include pre intervention, post intervention (after 8 weekly group therapy), & then 3, 6, 12\n      months after the end of intervention for the maintenance effect. Univariate analyses will be\n      performed to explore the basic characteristics of participants. The hierarchical linear\n      model will be used to test the hypothesis the improvement is higher in intervention group\n      than the control group in the effects of marital close relationships, sleeping quality,\n      depression, meaning of life, quality of life, and salivary cortisol levels in metastatic\n      breast cancer survivors and partners."
