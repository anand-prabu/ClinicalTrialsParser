    <textblock>
      Clinical trial phase III, double-blind, randomized, controlled with placebo. There is
      sufficient preliminary evidence to consider intracoronary injection of bone marrow
      progenitor cells as a viable, safe and beneficial treatment in patients with dilated
      cardiomyopathy, although the biological mechanism of action of bone marrow cells in the
      myocardium is not known. In this project we propose to investigate comparatively and from a
      biological and clinical point of view the applicability of regenerative therapy with
      autologous bone marrow cells in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.

      The study population correspond to male and female patients with idiopathic dilated
      cardiomyopathy.

      51 patients diagnosed with this disease are included. After inclusion, will proceed to the
      random allocation to study group or control group in a 2:1 ratio, 34 patients in the
      treatment group and 17 in the control group.

      The total duration is expected to be 36 months: The inclusion period is 24 months and each
      patient will be followed for 12 months. Upon completion thereof, the patients will be
      followed in routine clinical practice.

      This is a double blind study, in which all patients were will perform the bone marrow
      harvesting.

      All patients will receive the best medical treatment individualized (ACEIs or Angiotensin II
      receptor blocker, beta-blockers, diuretics and eplerenone) for at least 6 months prior to
      their participation in the clinical trial, so that the situation is stable and
      pharmacological basal condition is the same for everyone.

      The bone marrow cells of patients assigned to placebo group will be cryopreserved, and once
      the trial is completed, the blind will be opened and all the patients who had been
      randomized to the control group, may be processed by the route of compassionate use with
      their own mononuclear bone marrow cells previously frozen.

      Randomization of patients, will be centralized by the sponsor or contract research
      organization designated for such purpose. In both treatment groups will be stratified by a
      condition (age&gt; or ≤ 45 years). The final probability of treatment assignment will be
      conditioned by the number of patients included in each group (2:1) and the number of
      patients who meet the inclusion each condition.

      The main objective is to assess comparative the efficacy of intracoronary injection of bone
      marrow stem cells autologous to improve ventricular function in patients with idiopathic
      dilated cardiomyopathy who receive conventional medical treatment, compared with a control
      group who receive a infusion of placebo and conventional medical treatment. The improvement
      in ventricular function assessed by changes in angiographically determined ejection
      fraction.

      Secondary objectives of the study are:

      - To analyze the predictors of good clinical response, functional and biological treatment
      with adult stem cells autologous mononuclear bone marrow not expanded in terms of functional
      recovery.

      The following parameters were evaluated: Functional class (NYHA), natriuretic peptide B,
      stress test (exercise time) and echocardiographic parameters of ventricular function.

      - To determine, in the light of the obtained results, the application protocol suitable cell
      therapy for the treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy
