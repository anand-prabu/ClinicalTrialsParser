            "textblock": "Mechanical ventilation is among the most common interventions in the intensive care unit\n      (ICU). Over the last two decades, numerous studies have investigated methods to improve\n      outcomes of patients receiving mechanical ventilation. Despite this proliferation of data, a\n      large, multi-national cohort study found clinical outcomes such as duration of ventilation\n      and ICU stay have not improved significantly between1998 to 2004.\n\n      It is recommended that weaning should be considered as early as possible in the patient\n      trajectory and spontaneous breathing trials (SBT) attempted, as SBT are the best diagnostic\n      criteria to determine extubation readiness. The decision of ready to extubate is considered\n      complex because both delayed and failed extubations are associated with increased ventilator\n      time and increased mortality. It is shown that dyspnea occurs among nearly half of\n      ventilator patients and is strongly associated with anxiety and delayed extubation. Between\n      30-75% of ICU patients report anxiety where dyspnea, impaired communication skills, and\n      sleep disturbances may be predisposing factors. The assessments of work of breathing and\n      clinical deterioration are important sub-categories in clinical judgment for determining\n      weaning tolerance.\n\n      There is little evidence whether the patients experiences of work of breathing is\n      correlating with physicians and nurses. Hence, we suggest the need to evaluate the\n      interobserver agreement for clinical assessment in weaning.\n\n      The main objective of the study is to examine the extent of agreement between patient and\n      health care provider assessments of work of breathing and the association of agreement with\n      demographic- and disease-related factors."
