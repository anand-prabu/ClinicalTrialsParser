      This study is a randomized pilot/pharmacodynamic/genomic study of neoadjuvant paricalcitol
      to target the microenvironment in resectable pancreatic cancer to determine the effect of
      targeting the vitamin D metabolic program in the tumors of patients treated with one cycle
      of gemcitabine/abraxane with or without paricalcitol prior to surgery for resectable
      pancreatic cancer through an assessment of cellular and imaging markers.
