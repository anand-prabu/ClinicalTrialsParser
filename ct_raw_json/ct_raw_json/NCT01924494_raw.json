The EndoAlpha system will\n      be integrated in a highly advanced endoscopy procedure room. The system will integrate\n      through LAN with doctor office, clinic conference and lecture room and GI pathologist room.\n      Through either LAN or WAN, connection will be establish to a referral GI center in Denmark.\n      Through WAN, connection will be established to doctor home and to an expert Spanish center."
