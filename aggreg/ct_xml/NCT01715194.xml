  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that the use of telemedicine combined with support interventions by short
      messages, telephone calls and ambulatory visits to control CPAP treatment during the first
      month improves adherence and reduces unresolved side effects of therapy.

      The primary objective of an OSAS treatment program is to successfully implement indicated
      CPAP in the highest possible proportion of patients in order to lower the proportion of
      untreated OSAS in the population. On an individual basis, it has been shown that a longer
      duration of CPAP use is associated with better outcomes in terms of daytime functioning and
      in the control of metabolic and blood pressure effects of CPAP. For our study, we have
      therefore decided to use 2 co-primary endpoints, taking into account both aspects of
      adherence mentioned. Cardiovascular complications are a major concern in OSAS patients.
      Effective CPAP treatment has been shown to reduce surrogate measures of cardiovascular risk.
      We hypothesize that intensified efforts for CPAP adherence with telemedicine has a positive
      impact on a number of surrogate measures of the cardiovascular risk at 1 and 6 months of
      treatment.

    <description>In the telemedicine intervention arm, a telemetry device is instructed and attached to the CPAP. Patients are instructed to use CPAP every night. Data of the CPAP are downloaded to the internet once daily. On week days, a nurse is checking the downloaded data three times per week. The nurse contacts the patient if
CPAP was used &lt;4h/ night for 2 consecutive night
the median leakage was above 0.4 L/sec on 2 consecutive nights The nurse informs the patient of the problem observed, asks for explanations and gives advice on possibilities to solve the problem. The common problems and the respective solutions are discussed according to the ELF facts sheet (Dry mouth/throat, nasal congestion, skin irritation, conjunctivitis, headache, loss of benefits, appendix 1). The patient is encouraged to use CPAP every night. In the case of regular use and acceptable leakage, a congratulatory message is sent to the patient via sms or e-mail (for procedural rules, see appendix 4).</description>
