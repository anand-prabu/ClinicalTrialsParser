Advance Directives (AD)\n      can reduce this effect but various factors limit their adoption.\n\n      A randomized trial will target home health care (HHC) patients with a serious, life limiting\n      illness to test if the behavioral economics principles of endowment (possessing something)\n      and focusing (featuring something important to you) can motivate AD completion. We will\n      investigate if offering patients an AD by default, in combination with framing the rationale\n      for AD completion (emphasizing patient control or caregiver burden) improves AD completion\n      and family conversation compared to a no-intervention group. The study hypothesis is to\n      determine if rates of AD completion and family conversations will be highest among patients\n      receiving the intervention focused on reduced caregiver burden; and if the two intervention\n      groups will have higher rates of both than the control group.\n\n      We suspect that a small change in how patient information is framed (endowment and focusing\n      used in tandem) will potentially leverage large increases in AD completion and that\n      targeting HHC patients allows AD discussions early in the disease trajectory when they can\n      participate in care decisions."

            "textblock": "Primary research question: Does offering patients an Advance Directive (AD) document (by\n      default), in combination with framing the rationale for AD completion (emphasizing either:\n      A. patient control; or B. reduction in caregiver burden) improve AD completion as compared\n      to a no-intervention control group?\n\n      Study Design: The project will conduct a 3-group randomized trial in which ADs are provided\n      to Home Health Care (HHC) patients by default in the two treatment groups. When discussing\n      the benefits of AD completion, intervention group A nurses will focus on ADs' potential to\n      promote patients' control over the care they receive. In intervention group B, nurses will\n      focus on the potential for AD completion to reduce caregiver burden. In the control group,\n      patients will receive ADs only if they actively request them (as in standard practice).\n      Specially trained nurses will be responsible for conducting the intervention. Training of\n      RNs will consist of didactic and experiential learning on applying endowment and focusing\n      effect scripts in a consistent manner that are true to the behavioral economic principles.\n      Intervention will occur on the second home visit during which the patient will be presented\n      with one of three options by the RN depending on their random assignment. Patients in both\n      intervention groups will be given an AD by default.  Patients who elect to complete an AD\n      can have this completed with Home Healthcare (HHC) RN during the home visit or during a\n      separate visit by a HHC social worker who is trained in Advance Care Planning (ACP).\n\n      Methodology\n\n      Home Visit #1 - Patient Eligibility:\n\n      The home health RN who visits patients, will complete the \"Selection of Patient Form\" to\n      determine eligibility for participation in the study (see subjects/sample below).  Patients\n      who are determined to be eligible for the study, will be asked if they are willing to\n      participate in the study and asked to sign a consent form .\n\n      Home Visit #2-#4 (depending on condition of patient) - Intervention:\n\n      Patient is assigned into one of the three intervention groups and is provided one of three\n      packets  (packet includes script , copy of \"Your Health, Your Choice: My Advance Directive\",\n      and self-addressed stamped envelope). The home health RN on the this visit will provide the\n      designated script regarding advance directives (see \"Scripts for Intervention Groups\").  The\n      intervention will occur when reviewing the \"Patient Information for Home Health Care\" under\n      the \"Medical Decision Making\" topic.   Four possible outcomes can occur following this\n      visit: A) patient indicates desire to complete AD at home visit #2; B) patient indicates\n      desire to complete AD with Nurse or Social Worker as separate visit; C) patient elects to\n      complete AD on their own, or D) patient declines to complete AD. A). If patient indicates\n      desire to complete AD at home when script presented: the AD document will be reviewed and\n      the patient will be helped to complete the document.\n\n      Subjects/Sample: Home, Health and Hospice patients who reside in the County will be\n      randomized to one of three groups. Eligibility will be determined at the first home visit.\n      Inclusion criteria are adult patients, 50 years and older, who have a serious, life-limiting\n      illness and require home health care (see below). Eligible patients will be identified and\n      selected concurrently from new intakes to Reverence home care.\n\n      Inclusion Criteria:\n\n      A subject will be eligible for study participation if he/she meets the both 1 & 2 criteria:\n\n      1.1 Age  50 years and older 2.0  Subject must have one or more of the following serious life\n      limiting illness that requires home health care (as determined from review of medical\n      records and clinical judgment) 2.1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or any\n      respiratory (pulmonary) disease that requires home oxygen use (e.g. interstitial lung\n      disease, sleep-disordered breathing), 2.2. End Stage Renal Disease 2.3. Peripheral vascular\n      disease (PVD) 2.4. NYHA Class III or IV Heart Failure (HF) Class III:  Marked limitation in\n      activity due to symptoms, even during less-than-ordinary activity, e.g. walking short\n      distances (20-100 m).  Comfortable only at rest.\n\n      Class IV: Severe limitations. Experiences symptoms even while at rest. Mostly bedbound\n      patients.\n\n      2.5. Cancer as a discharge diagnosis (any type)     Type: 2.6. Neuromuscular/movement\n      disorders: Myasthenia gravis, ALS, Parkinson's, and Multiple sclerosis\n\n      Exclusion Criteria:\n\n      A subject will not be eligible for study participation if he/she meets any of the following\n      criteria\n\n      3.1. Patient cannot sign legal documents such as consent or AD (Impaired decision-making\n      capacity) 3.2. Previously specified written AD 3.3. Home health nurse would not conduct the\n      home visit (open visits such as physical therapy only) 3.4. Patients referred for Palliative\n      Care (where home health nurse would not conduct the home visit and patient might receive\n      additional AD intervention).\n\n      3.5  Patient previously enrolled in this study.\n\n      Data Management and Statistical Analysis:\n\n      Sample Size- Calculated on the primary outcome of AD completion rate, we used an estimated\n      baseline completion of 10% for the control group. A two-tailed test for comparing completion\n      rates between a default option and the standard, as well as, comparing the two framing\n      interventions will require a total of 350 participants (125 in each intervention and 100 in\n      the control). This achieves a minimum of 88% power to detect a 15% absolute difference\n      between the groups at alpha of 0.05 and accounts for a 5% attrition rate. The hypothesis\n      that AD completion rates differ by at least 15% between two groups within each arm (default\n      option compared to control; autonomy framing compared to caregiver burden framing) will be\n      analyzed using Chi-square analysis.\n\n      Expected Outcomes of the Study:\n\n      It is hypothesized that offering patients an AD document (by default), in combination with\n      framing the rationale for AD completion (emphasizing either: A. patient control; or B.\n      reduction in caregiver burden) will improve AD completion as compared to a no-intervention\n      control group."
