While there are medications\n      that are effective at treating positive symptoms, some other symptoms of the disorders are\n      often left only partially treated (cognitive impairment and negative symptoms). This study\n      will begin to address if the medication isradipine might help to treat some of the cognitive\n      problems associated with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. Isradipine is a\n      medication that acts by blocking a specific type of receptor in the brain called a calcium\n      channel. It is currently approved by the FDA for hypertension."
