To achieve this goal, the study will take place in\n      an outpatient setting.\n\n      To test the feasibility of \"bedside\" closed-loop control we will use an approach comprised\n      of standard sensor-augmented pump therapy during the day using off-the-shelf devices and\n      overnight closed-loop control using experimental devices in supervised outpatient setting.\n      We hypothesize that the AAA control system will prevent nocturnal hypoglycemia and will\n      increase time within target (80-140 mg/dl) overnight for 5 consecutive nights compared to 5\n      consecutive nights with CGM-augmented pump alone. Additionally we have an exploratory\n      hypothesis that overnight control will lead to improved time in target during the day."
