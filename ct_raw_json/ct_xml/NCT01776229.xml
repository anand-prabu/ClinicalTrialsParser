  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Untreated trauma-related nightmares and sleep-related disorders are associated with chronic
      health problems, burdening both the suffering individual and the health-care system.  The
      study implements an innovative, cost-efficient, nightmare treatment for trauma-exposed
      children.  It is the first randomized clinical trial with children, adapting an efficacious
      adult therapy to a 5-session nightmare treatment for 5-12 year-olds.  Trauma nightmares are
      a mechanism in development and maintenance of secondary post-trauma psychopathology, medical
      problems and family dysfunction.  Therefore, this treatment may prevent long-term secondary
      health and behavioral problems.  It provides a viable healthcare option to Oklahomans,
      lessening long-term financial medical and behavioral health expenses.  Scientific models
      currently view PTSD treatment as primary, often leaving nightmares untreated.  That approach
      does not address the pernicious impact of trauma-nightmares in individuals with
      sub-threshold PTSD or whose nightmares are a primary condition.  The theoretical innovation
      of this therapy can advance the field's understanding of the development of trauma sequelae.
