  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the sensitivity and specificity of [124I]FIAU PET-CT scanning in detecting osteomyelitis as determined by bone biopsy in patients with diabetic foot infection.</measure>
    <time_frame>30 hours</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects will be dosed with [124I]FIAU. PET-CT scanning will be performed at two time points after dosing.</description>

    <measure>Assess the safety and tolerability of [124I]FIAU</measure>
    <time_frame>30 +/- 2 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety will be monitored for all subjects for the duration of their study participation. Safety will be assessed by monitoring of adverse events,vital signs, physical exams, and clinical laboratory tests including CBC and serum chemistry.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Compare the sensitivity and specificity of [124I]FIAU PET-CT scanning to gadolinium-enhanced (GE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and non-GE-MRI scanning in detecting osteomyelitis in patients with diabetic foot infection</measure>
    <time_frame>-2  to 72 hours post dose [124I]FIAU</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>All PET-CT images will be evaluated centrally and independently by a single radiologist.  Diagnosis of osteomyelitis based on PET-CT will be compared with MRI which is currently the test of choice to diagnose osteomyelitis in diabetic foot infection.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess any additional information that [124I]FIAU PET-CT scanning provides compared to MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>-2 to 72 hours post dose [124I]FIAU</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Additional information on the extent and localization of infection will be compared to MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Explore the performance of [124I]FIAU PET-CT compared to MRI in detecting osteomyelitis by chronic kidney disease (CKD) stage (stage 1+2, stage 3, and stage 4+5).</measure>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female patients &gt;/= 18 years on the day of signing consent.

          2. A diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, type I or II, as evidenced either by HbA1c&gt;6.5% or
             receipt of antidiabetic medication at time of enrollment.

          3. Ability to provide informed consent

          4. An inframalleolar ulcer of perfusion, extent/size, depth/tissue loss, infection and
             sensation (PEDIS) grade 2 or 3.  At the discretion of the Investigator, patients with
             PEDIS grade 4 infections may be included if they are sufficiently stable.

          5. For females of childbearing potential, a negative urine pregnancy test on the day of
             dosing.

          6. For females of childbearing potential, a willingness to use 2 methods of
             contraception for 30 days after receiving [124I]FIAU.

          7. Ability to return for all study assessments.

          8. Clinically euthyroid, or on stable thyroid replacement therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who ar unable to comply with study requirements.

          2. Indication, in the opinion of the principal Investigator for urgent surgery that
             would preclude the time needed for PET-CT scanning, or clinical instability that
             precludes PET-CT scanning.

          3. History of an inherited mitochondrial disorder (eg. Leber's hereditary neuropathy,
             neuropathy, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa and ptosis [NARP], myoneurogenic
             gastrointestinal encephalopathy [MNGIE], myocolonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers
             [MERFF] and mitochondrial myopathy, encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and
             stroke-like syndrome [MELAS])

          4. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT)&gt;5x Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) OR aspartate
             aminotransferase (AST) &gt;5x ULN.

          5. Body mass that exceeds the rating of the CT table.

          6. Hypersensitivity to iodine.

          7. Pregnant or breast-feeding.

          8. Any condition that would put the patient at unreasonable risk in the opinion of the
             Investigator.
