However, there are barriers to hormonal\n      contraception use in younger adolescents.\n\n      Tranexamic acid is taken orally during the first 5 days of menstrual bleeding.\n\n      The purposes of this study include:\n\n      To test the safety and efficacy of Lysteda in adolescent females. To learn how well Lysteda\n      works in decreasing menstrual blood loss. To see if parents and children participating in\n      this study think the drug is improving their quality of life.\n\n      Lysteda has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in patients > than 18\n      years of age but not for the age group that we will be looking at in this study."

Subjects will be monitored over the course of four menstrual cycles (1\n      pre-treatment cycle and 3 treatment cycles).  During all cycles, assessments of menstrual\n      bleeding will be performed using the Menorrhagia Impact Questionnaire (MIQ) and Pictorial\n      Blood Assessment Chart (PBAC).\n\n      The study will begin as a currently funded pilot study to assess the efficacy of Lysteda in\n      32 patients followed to study completion.  If the pilot study is successful and funding is\n      available, additional subjects will be enrolled and followed to completion, with the intent\n      to also enroll a comparison group of young women initiating hormonal contraception to treat\n      HMB."

Clinical evidence of any significant chronic illness, including cardiovascular,\n             renal, neurologic, hepatic, endocrine, gastric, central nervous system, or\n             psychiatric, which could affect the efficacy or safety of Lysteda, or the ability to\n             complete study procedures.
