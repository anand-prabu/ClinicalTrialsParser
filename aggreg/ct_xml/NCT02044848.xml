    <description>In the event an effect is detected at the end of the 1 year treatment period, evaluation of the durability of effect on the amount of C-peptide (a protein that shows how much insulin the body is producing) released in 2 hours during a mixed meal tolerance test once the treatment period is over. The result of the test performed at screening will be compared against that performed at 52 weeks after the start of treatment, and at the following times during the up to 2 year follow-up period: 15, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after the start of treatment.</description>
