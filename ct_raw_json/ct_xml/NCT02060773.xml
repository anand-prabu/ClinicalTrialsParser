      Objective To observe the effect of early goal directed therapy (EGDT) on hepatic perfusion
      in patients with septic shock.

      Methods A prospective observational study was carried out. The eligible patients were
      treated with the standard procedure of EGDT. The hemodynamic data were recorded. Oxygen
      metabolism and hepatic function were monitored. Indocyanine clearance test was applied to
      detect the hepatic perfusion. Hemodynamics, hepatic perfusion, oxygen metabolism and hepatic
      function were compared before treatment, after EGDT and 24 hours after EGDT.
