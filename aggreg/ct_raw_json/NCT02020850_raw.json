The purpose of this study is to determine the\n      more accurate value of TBI and Ankle-Brachial Index (ABI). In this study, all participants\n      will be required to fill out a demographic questionnaire before the blood pressures test.\n      All participants will have their toe, ankle and brachial systolic blood pressure\n      measurements to obtain the TBI and ABI."
