Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to\n      give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells. Colony-stimulating\n      factors such as filgrastim and sargramostim may increase the number of immune cells found in\n      bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's immune system recover from the side\n      effects of chemotherapy. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. It\n      is not yet known which treatment regimen is more effective for multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of filgrastim with that of\n      sargramostim plus chemotherapy, peripheral stem cell transplantation, and interferon alfa in\n      treating patients who have multiple myeloma."

Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: In the priming phase, patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day\n           1, mitoxantrone IV over 1 hour daily on days 1-2, and dexamethasone IV every 12 hours\n           beginning on day 1 for a total of 4 doses. Patients also receive sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n           IV over 2 hours or subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning 48 hours after the last dose of\n           mitoxantrone and continuing until completion of leukapheresis. Peripheral blood stem\n           cells (PBSC) are collected daily on days 11-13 after neutrophil recovery.\n\n        -  Arm II: In the priming phase, patients receive the same treatment as in arm I except\n           these patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV over 15 minutes or SC in place of GM-CSF.\n\n      In the transplant phase, patients who have not received prior radiotherapy receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily on days -6 and -5 and total body irradiation twice\n      daily on days -3 through -1. Autologous PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients also receive\n      GM-CSF IV over 2 hours daily and G-CSF IV over 15 minutes daily beginning on day 0 and\n      continuing until day 28 or until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients who have received prior radiotherapy receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours daily\n      on days -6 through -3, carmustine IV over 1 hour on day -6, and etoposide IV over 4 hours\n      every 12 hours for a total of 6 doses on days -6 through -4. Autologous PBSC are reinfused\n      on day 0. Patients also receive GM-CSF IV over 2 hours daily and G-CSF IV over 15 minutes\n      daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until day 28 or until blood counts recover.\n\n      All patients then receive interferon alfa SC 3 times weekly starting on day 28 and\n      continuing until relapse or disease progression.\n\n      Patients may also undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 2 weeks for residual bony lesions\n      measuring greater than 2 cm.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 28 and 100, and at 6, 9, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3\n      years."
