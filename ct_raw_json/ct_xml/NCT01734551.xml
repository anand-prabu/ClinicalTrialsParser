      The purpose of this study is to compare two different medicines to treat babies with opiate
      withdrawal.  The treatment medicines are morphine, which is an opiate, and clonidine, a
      non-opiate.  Morphine is a narcotic medicine, with is included in most pain killers.
      Clonidine is another drug, but is different from morphine.  It is also used for babies, and
      even adults for withdrawal symptoms.  Both drugs are effective, but the purpose of this
      study is to see if one may be better than the other.

    <textblock>
      Withdrawal from drugs, called Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS), is a group of symptoms
      that occurs to babies whose mother took or used drugs (prescription, addicting, illegal,
      pain pills, or drugs for addiction treatment) during pregnancy. Medicines the mother takes
      while pregnant, the baby also takes. Babies may experience withdrawal after delivery, and
      may need treatment.  There are different ways to treat babies with withdrawal - about 50% of
      doctors use morphine, an opiate, to treat these babies, the rest uses other drugs, like
      clonidine and phenobarbitol.
