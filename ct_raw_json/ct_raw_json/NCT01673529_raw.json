Part A has been designed to establish whether the topical formulation is\n      capable of delivering SB705498 to the proposed site of action, and to select an appropriate\n      dose for Part B. Part B will examine the effects of SB705498 on pruritus initiated by a\n      histaminergic and a non-histaminergic pathway, using two different challenge agents;\n      histamine and cowhage. This may provide important information about the role of TRPV1 in\n      pruritus and the therapeutic potential of SB705498."
