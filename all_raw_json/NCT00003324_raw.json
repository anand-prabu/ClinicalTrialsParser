Combining radiation therapy with surgery may be a more effective treatment for brain\n      metastases.\n\n      PURPOSE: Clinical trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy with or without\n      surgery in treating patients who have brain metastases."

Quality of life is assessed at each followup visit.\n\n      Patients suffering intracerebral relapse are offered further focal therapy if they have no\n      more than 3 metastases, no more than 6 lesions over consecutive scans, and continue to have\n      life expectancy of at least 3 months and Karnofsky performance status of 60-100%. Otherwise,\n      relapsed patients are offered whole brain radiotherapy or supportive treatment with\n      steroids, and may also receive stereotactic boost to the new lesions. Patients who have\n      received prior whole brain irradiation will be offered entry into other protocols if\n      eligible or supportive treatment with steroids. Patients are followed as above.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 60 patients will be enrolled in this study."
