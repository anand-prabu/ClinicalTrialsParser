For these patients, transarterial lipiodol chemoembolization (TACE) is\n      recommended as a palliative therapy.\n\n      On the other hand, many authors still believe that hepatic resection is the only potential\n      curative treatment in these patients because it is still feasible to remove all macroscopic\n      tumors safely at surgery. With advances in surgical techniques, more large/multiple HCCs are\n      now resectable, and long-term results have been reported that ranged from 30% to 58% at 5\n      years; even patients with large bilobar multiple HCC could reach a survival rate of more\n      than 20% at 5 years after hepatic resection.\n\n      Until now, there have been only a few studies that compared the outcomes of hepatic\n      resection and TACE in the treatment of multiple HCCs, and these have reported controversial\n      results. Some studies showed that hepatic resection had survival benefi t over TACE, but\n      other studies showed the opposite result ( 11-15 ). Therefore, the investigators performed\n      this prospective study in consecutive patients with large/multiple, and resectable HCCs to\n      compare the outcomes in patients who underwent hepatic resection or TACE as the initial\n      treatment."
