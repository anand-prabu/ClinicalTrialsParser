    <textblock>
      To conduct a feasibility clinical trial to test a novel patient sensing automated treadmill
      device devised by local engineers for subacute hemiplegic stroke patients for gait
      rehabilitation. This is a phase 1 feasibility and safety trial on the above device for 10
      chronic stroke patients with hemiparetic gait dysfunction to be conducted over a period of 2
      months.

      Research protocol and standardized outcomes measures will be used.

    <textblock>
      To conduct a feasibility clinical trial to test a novel patient sensing automated treadmill
      device devised by local engineers for subacute hemiplegic stroke patients for gait
      rehabilitation. This device incorporates patient automated variable speeds and feedback,
      increased safety features with patient support harness and visual feedback providing
      ambulatory gait monitoring data. Methodology: 10 stable subacute hemiparetic stroke subjects
      will undergo supervised treadmill training using this device targeted at improving gait
      speed and walking independence. Outcomes will be measured at 4 time points pre and post
      training using clinical scales and temporal-spatial gait measurements. Importance of
      research to medicine: This study tests the possibility of patient initiated control and
      closed loop sensing feedback system to provide increased intensity, reduced risk of gait
      destabilisation and fall risk which are associated with current fixed treadmill training.
      Potential benefits with new device: Ability to train at self selected variable speeds
      including fast speeds, improved hemiplegic leg swing initiation and stride length, less
      assistance required from physiotherapist and reduced fall risk due to overhead safety
      harness and treadmill sensing and increased patient confidence. Possibility of ambulatory
      gait speed and force loading during treadmill training. Potential risks: Minor risks of fall
      are minimised as there is a safety harness and supervision by physiotherapist. Anticipated
      risks related to repetitive treadmill training with regards to cardiovascular and
      musculoskeletal side effects will be mitigated with strict patient inclusion and exclusion
      criteria.
