By this means, the luminal site of the esophagus, stomach and\n      duodenum may be visualized after inserting a flexible endoscope through the mouth (transoral\n      access). By the rapid technical development in the last years smaller flexible video\n      endoscopes have been developed allowing also an alternative access to the upper GI-tract via\n      the nose (transnasal access).\n\n      Patients with dysphagia are referred to physicians of different disciplines\n      (gastroenterology, surgery, ear, nose, and throat (ENT) medicine, radiology, neurology)\n      performing a variety of endoscopic and non-endoscopic techniques. Mostly, the endoscopic\n      examination of the esophagus is done in sedated patients in left lateral examination.\n      Typical findings during esophagoscopy might be tumors, strictures, achalasia or diverticula.\n\n      Patients suffering from neurogenic dysphagia often get caught in the trap: they find\n      themselves somewhere in the space between gastroenterologist, neurologist, ENT-specialist\n      and radiologist. This dilemma might be due to a lack of pathophysiological knowledge among\n      many physicians and an inability to directly visualize the esophageal phase of deglutition.\n      In sedated patients lying in left lateral position, endoscopists may receive a very limited\n      impression of the function of the different phases of swallowing since this endoscopic\n      access is a rather static one.\n\n      The focus of our observational study are patients with suspected neurogenic dysphagia. These\n      patients shall be examined by transnasal endoscopy applying an ultrathin video endoscope\n      with an outer diameter of 3.8 mm (BF-3C160, Olympus Europe). Patients are examined in\n      sitting position while ingesting water and food of different consistencies (functional\n      endoscopy). Diagnostic shall be completed and correlated by videofluoroscopy,\n      high-resolution manometry and assessment of the clinical signs. Beside feasibility and\n      safety as primary endpoints, secondary endpoints shall be the assessment of pathologic\n      endoscopic findings in patients suffering from neurogenic dysphagia.
