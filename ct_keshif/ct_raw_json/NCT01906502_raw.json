However, healthy subjects were much\n      younger than glaucoma patients. Additionally, the number of glaucoma patients in Snapfish\n      database was almost twice higher than the number of healthy subjects. As it is generally\n      accepted that intra ocular pressure (IOP) in the aging population is higher than IOP in\n      young adults it is of interest to evaluate the 24-hour IOP pattern of older healthy\n      subjects. Furthermore, improving our knowledge of the \"healthy\" 24-hour IOP pattern in\n      comparison to glaucoma profiles would be beneficial for management of glaucoma."
