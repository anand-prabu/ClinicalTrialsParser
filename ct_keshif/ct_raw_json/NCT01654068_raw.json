This study involves patients who have been diagnosed with metastatic cancer to the\n      thoracic and lumbar vertebral body levels and currently do not have symptoms caused from the\n      area of concern.  The goal is to prove that this is not only a safe form of treatment, but\n      that Conformal High Dose Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy can reduce the risk of cancer\n      coming back in the area that the investigators treat which may reduce the risk of developing\n      symptoms like pain in the future."

For patients with tumors closer than 5mm, inclusion is\n             permissible at the discretion of the treating radiation oncologist such that\n             dosimetric review demonstrates that the total dose to spinal cord is within tolerable\n             range of <10Gy to 10% partial volume or max point dose 18 Gy.\n\n          -  Patients must be able to fit into either the Elekta Stereotactic Body Frame or the\n             Elekta Stereotactic BodyFix immobilization device.\n\n          -  Must be \u2265 18 years of age.\n\n          -  ECOG status 0-2.\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential and male participants must use an effective\n             contraception method.

Patients may be allowed to use hormonal suppression therapy or\n             bisphosphonates for hypercalcemia.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating women.\n\n          -  Any patient with symptoms of pain, compression fracture, neurologic deficit will not\n             be included.\n\n          -  Patients previously treated with radiation therapy to the thoracic or lumbar spinal\n             levels of involved disease will not be included."
