    <textblock>
      This is an observational study to determine the effect of various treatments prescribed by
      healthcare providers for heavy menstrual bleeding on bleeding related quality of life (as
      measured by the Menstrual Bleeding Questionnaire) and to compare electronic and paper-based
      modes of data collection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 10% of women of reproductive age seek medical care each year for evaluation
      and treatment of heavy menstrual bleeding. Women with heavy menstrual bleeding suffer
      diminished quality of life, [1-2] lose work productivity,[3] and utilize expensive medical
      resources.[4] Although hysterectomy is considered the &quot;definitive&quot; treatment for heavy
      menstrual bleeding, many other options are available including endometrial ablation, the
      levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), combined oral contraceptives (COCs), oral
      progestin, NSAIDs, and tranexamic acid.  Better characterization of the relative efficacy of
      commonly used therapies for abnormal uterine bleeding will improve patient counseling,
      facilitate informed decision-making, and reduce the burden of unnecessary procedures on both
      the patient and the health care system. The data comparing these treatments in terms of
      patient-based outcome measures and bleeding-related quality of life are quite limited.   We
      plan to prospectively compare bleeding-related quality of life between treatment methods
      within a cohort of patients receiving clinical care for heavy menstrual bleeding.

      This study is being performed to determine the effect of various treatments prescribed by
      healthcare providers for heavy menstrual bleeding on bleeding related quality of life (as
      measured by the MBQ) and to compare electronic and paper-based modes of data collection.
      Eligible and consenting participants will be randomized to complete the study questionnaires
      electronically on IPad devices or on paper. At enrollment, participants will complete a
      background questionnaire and the MBQ.   The background questionnaire will include
      information on age, race-ethnicity, primary language, income, education, and other medical
      issues. (Background Information Form) This will allow us to evaluate the effect of important
      demographic characteristics and concomitant medical problems on the effectiveness of
      prescribed treatments for heavy menstrual bleeding.  We will also perform a chart review to
      validate the patient-reported medical information.

      This study includes both prospective data collection with randomization of participants to
      mode of data collection. Studies will be conducted at Women and Infants Hospital in the
      Women's Primary Care Center. Approximately 13,000 women are seen for care that is not
      related to pregnancy. If only 10% of these women report heavy menstrual bleeding (which has
      a prevalence of 10-30%), 1300 patients in the WPCC could be eligible for these studies
      annually. Patient charts will be reviewed for potential eligibility in the WPCC in the
      evening and the morning. We plan to approach patients for screening who are presenting for
      gynecologic visits or well-woman examinations who still have an intact uterus and are
      between the ages of 18 and 51 years. The research assistant will make a list of names and
      appointment times to plan recruitment and will place a note on the front of the chart to
      page her when the patient is placed in a room. Lists of names will be destroyed each day.
      The research assistant or principal investigator will approach patients and screen them for
      eligibility. (Screening Form) The study will be described to eligible participants and
      informed consent obtained.
