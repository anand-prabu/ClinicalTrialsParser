            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      In recent years, the benefits of a physically active lifestyle have been well established\n      with respect to chronic health problems such as coronary heart disease, hypertension,\n      obesity and osteoporosis.  However, the extent to which physical activity influences health\n      care utilization is less clear.  If physical activity levels are inversely associated with\n      utilization patterns, then policies encouraging exercise may produce short-term reduction in\n      health care costs.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      A multivariate regression analysis was conducted for a representative sample of more than\n      600 adults who participated in a longitudinal field trial of health risk appraisal\n      instruments.  Using the Harvard Alumni Activity Survey as the physical activity measure, the\n      analysis controlled for a variety of predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics that\n      also influenced utilization behavior."
