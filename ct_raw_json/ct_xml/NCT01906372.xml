  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the study drug, ACTH
      Gel in people diagnosed with dermatomyositis a disease that causes muscle weakness and is
      associated with a rash (DM) or polymyositis (PM) a disease that causes muscle weakness
      without a rash. The study doctors want to evaluate whether ACTH Gel will improve the
      symptoms of this disease. This drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
      for dermatomyositis (DM) and polymyositis (PM). ACTH gel has been an FDA-approved treatment
      for myositis since 1952, and in 2010 the FDA retained PM and DM as diseases approved for
      ACTH gel use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite its FDA approval there is very limited data on its clinical effectiveness in PM and
      DM. There was a recent study published in the peer-review journal Drug Design, Development
      and Therapy on a retrospective case series evaluating Acthar in the treatment of PM and DM.
      Acthar was administered to five patients who had previously failed multiple steroid and
      immunosuppressant treatment regimens. The patients received injections of Acthar over the
      course of 12 weeks or more. Improvement in PM and DM symptoms related to disease
      exacerbations was seen in all five patients. Symptom improvements included increased muscle
      strength, resolution of disease-related skin manifestations and improvements in the ability
      to perform tasks associated with daily living. All of these patients tolerated the treatment
      well with no significant side effects reported. The paper, &quot;Treating refractory
      dermatomyositis or polymyositis with adrenocorticotropic hormone gel: a retrospective case
      series,&quot; was authored by Dr. Todd Levine, M.D., Co-Director of the Neurophysiology
      Department at Banner Good Samaritan Medical Center, Assistant Professor at the University of
      Arizona in Neurology, and Member of Phoenix Neurological Associates.

      H.P. Acthar® Gel, or Acthar, is a prescription medication containing the hormone
      adrenocorticotropin (hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland), also
      known as ACTH. H.P. Acthar Gel is a highly purified preparation of adrenocorticotropic
      hormone (ACTH) in a gel that is designed to provide extended release of the ACTH following
      injection. Acthar was originally approved by the FDA in 1952. It is approved for use in 19
      different conditions including dermatomyositis and polymyositis.

      Acthar is designed to provide a prolonged release of the medication after it is injected.
      Acthar is not a steroid; it works by helping your body produce its own natural steroid
      hormones, such as cortisol, corticosterone, and aldosterone. Acthar is an injection that is
      given intramuscularly (into the muscle). Subjects enrolled in the study will be asked to
      self administer Acthar two times per week. Subjects will be provided training by the
      principal investigator on how to perform the self injections.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Definite or probable PM or DM by Bohan and Peter criteria.

          -  PM patients must either possess a myositis-associated autoantibody or undergo
             adjudication for confirmation of the PM diagnosis by consensus of two experts to
             ensure non-PM patients are not enrolled. This step is necessary since there are
             well-known mimics of PM.

          -  Age ≥ 18 years.

          -  Active myositis as defined by baseline Manual Muscle Testing (MMT-8) no greater than
             125/150 and at least 2 additional CSM meeting the criteria stipulated below:

               1. Patient global with a minimum value of 2.0 cm on a 10 cm visual analog
                  scale(VAS)

               2. Physician global with a minimum value of 2.0 cm on a 10 cm VAS scale

               3. CHAQ/HAQ disability index with a minimum value of 0.25

               4. Elevation of at least one of the muscle enzymes [which includes        creatine
                  kinase (CK), aldolase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alanine aminotransferase
                  (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST)] at a minimum level of 1.3 x the
                  upper limit of normal.

               5. Global extramuscular disease activity score with a minimum value of 1.0 cm on a
                  10 cm VAS scale [this measure is the physician's composite evaluation and is
                  based on assessments of activity scores on the constitutional, cutaneous,
                  skeletal, gastrointestinal, pulmonary and cardiac scales of the Myositis Disease
                  Activity Assessment Tool (MDAAT)].

          -  To ensure that we can enroll active DM patients with a severe rash who may not meet
             the MMT-8 criterion noted above, we propose additional enrollment criteria such that
             the IMACS DOI can potentially be met:

               1. Cutaneous VAS score on MDAAT &gt; 3 cm on a 10 cm VAS scale, and

               2. At least 3 of the above 5 (a through e under 4.) criteria.

          -  Refractory myositis is defined by active disease despite an adequate glucocorticoid
             trial (&gt; 2 months of usual glucocorticoid therapy or intolerance to such therapy)
             and/or ≥ 1 conventional immunosuppressive agent (e.g. methotrexate, azathioprine,
             tacrolimus, cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil, IVIG, anti-TNF or rituximab) for a
             reasonable dose and duration (&gt; 3 months or intolerance to therapy). It is
             recommended to enroll refractory patients failing (or intolerant to) both
             glucocorticoids and at least 1 conventional immunosuppressive agent.

          -  If the enrolling physician is planning to continue current immunosuppressive agents
             or glucocorticoids as concomitant therapy with Acthar gel during the trial, then
             patient must be on a stable glucocorticoid and/or immunosuppressive dose 2 weeks
             prior to visit 1. The patient should have been on that immunosuppressive medication
             for at least 8 weeks (and at least 4 weeks for glucocorticoids) prior to visit 1.

          -  If the enrolling physician is planning to discontinue current immunosuppressive agent
             or glucocorticoids, then following wash out period is required prior to visit 1.

          -  If previous concomitant medications were discontinued, the following wash out periods
             are required prior to Visit 1

          -  Methotrexate -4 weeks

          -  Other IS agent (e.g. azathioprine, cyclosporine, tacrolimus, leflunomide,
             mycophenolate mofetil)  - 4 weeks

          -  IVIg or cyclophosphamide - 2 months

          -  rituximab -6 months

          -  infliximab or adalimumab -8 weeks

          -  glucocorticoids - 2 weeks

          -  etanercept -2 weeks

          -  anakinra -1 week

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Juvenile DM or PM, myositis in overlap with another connective tissue disease, cancer
             associated myositis, inclusion body myositis, or any other non immune-mediated
             myopathy.

          -  Hypersensitivity to Acthar

          -  Severe cardiac or pulmonary involvement

          -  Severe muscle damage defined as a baseline global muscle damage score on the MDI
             (Myositis Damage Index) of ≥ 5 cm on a 10 cm VAS.

          -  Patients with malignancy within 3 years of screening (except basal cell cancer or
             squamous cell cancer of skin).

          -  Uncontrolled diabetes, hepatic or renal disease.

          -  Ongoing active or chronic infections.

          -  Pregnant or lactating females.

          -  For any medical or physical or socio-psychological reasons that PI feels would not
             allow the subject to complete the study.
