            "textblock": "There is accumulating research evidence that Human Endogenous Retrovirus (HERV) and herpes\n      viruses (in particular Epstein-Barr Virus) are involved in the pathogenesis of multiple\n      sclerosis. People with active MS have higher levels of HERVs than people either without MS\n      or who have other neurological conditions. It has been shown that HERVs may produce\n      neurotoxic proteins/antigens associated with MS activity and disease progression. This is\n      the first clinical trial investigating the hypothesis that the antiretroviral drug\n      raltegravir may suppress HERV activity and ameliorate progression of relapsing remitting MS.\n      Raltegravir is an integrase inhibitor which blocks retroviral replication. A recent\n      experimental study suggests that raltegravir may also be active against herpes viruses.\n\n      Eligible participants (see Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria) will be observed for 3 months\n      having monthly brain Gadolinium enhanced MRIs and blood/urine/saliva sampling (baseline).\n      Then they will be treated with raltegravir (one 400mg pill  taken twice a day) for 3 months.\n      During treatment period participants will continue to have monthly MRIs and\n      blood/saliva/urine sampling. Participants will have monthly clinical and neurological\n      examinations and they will complete questionnaires assessing response to treatment.\n      Participants will have screening and study visits at The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel.\n      Monthly MRIs will be performed at the Institute of Neurology at Queens Square, London."
