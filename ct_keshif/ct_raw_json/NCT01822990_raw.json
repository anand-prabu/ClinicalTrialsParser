Loss of endothelial normal function causes vasoconstriction, local\n      coagulation alterations and an increase arterial wall proliferation. This situation s been\n      attributed to a reduction in nitric oxide bioactivity, and to an increase oxygen-free\n      radical formation in the context of the pro-inflammatory status found in atherosclerosis.\n\n      Hypothesis: Circulating Anti-beta2-glycoprotein I antibodies could be associated with\n      endothelial dysfunction and nitric oxide metabolism disruption en patients with peripheral\n      arterial disease."
