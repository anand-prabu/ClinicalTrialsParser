            "textblock": "Children diagnosed with ADHD, now comprising nearly 9% of American children and a similar\n      proportion of Indian children, are at risk for failure or drop out from school, prone to\n      developing addictions, having driving accidents, committing felonies later in life and\n      suffer from an overall poor quality of life. Rescuing the cognitive faculties of these\n      children is thus of immediate importance, not only from the perspective of the individual,\n      but also from the urgency posed by the large socio-economic and health-care burdens\n      associated with this disorder.\n\n      The investigators have recently developed an efficient, state-of-the-art, web-based,\n      cost-effective and highly scalable cognitive training program for ADHD ('Rewired') that can\n      translate into real-life functional gains for the affected children. The novel program\n      targets the fundamental neurobehavioral/ cognitive deficits identified in this disorder.\n      These include deficits in general alertness, selective attention and working memory of\n      goal-relevant information, control of impulsive actions and suppression of distracting\n      information - a panoply of problems that have not been comprehensively addressed by any\n      intervention in this population to-date.\n\n      Recent advances in neuroscientific research have provided key insight into the application\n      of brain-based methods to behavioral training to drive substantial functional gains. This\n      research forms the mechanistic basis of the development approach. Moreover, the principal\n      exercise forms in the training program have independently demonstrated significant benefits\n      in other attentionally-impaired populations towards remediation of the core cognitive\n      deficits that intersect with the deficient domains in ADHD. Here, the core exercise forms\n      have been tailored and elaborated into a comprehensive program suite of 26 engaging,\n      performance-adaptive, and rewarding training modules that provide 30 hours of rigorous\n      neuroplasticity-based cognitive training for children with ADHD. The investigators propose\n      to validate the usability and feasibility of this novel training program in a randomized\n      controlled trial (RCT) setting. It is hypothesized that improvements in the specific core\n      cognitive domains deficient in ADHD, shall translate to better overall cognitive function in\n      daily life as well as significant reduction of ADHD symptom severity. The current\n      intervention ultimately projects a better life quality for children with ADHD, and has the\n      potential to substantially reduce the large personal, familial, societal and economic burden\n      associated with the disorder worldwide."
