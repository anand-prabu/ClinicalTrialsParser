The participants will receive a careful medical examination, including a neurological\n      examination, as part of the inclusion process. The subjects also have an MRI scan of the\n      brain. The PET/CT scans with [11C]donepezil are conducted - once for the upper abdominal\n      region and once for the head region.\n\n      PERSPECTIVES: The study will potentially result in the development of a PET ligand for\n      imaging the parasympathetic nervous system. This will have applications for research in\n      Parkinson's disease, diabetes, heart disease and other disorders, in which the autonomic\n      nervous system is involved"
