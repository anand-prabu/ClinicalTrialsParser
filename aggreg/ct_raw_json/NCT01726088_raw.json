Unfortunately, currently\n      available treatments for combat-related PTSD have produced modest treatment gains at best.\n      New treatment strategies that can be directed toward objectively measured correlates of PTSD\n      are urgently needed.\n\n      Specific Aims: 1) To determine if there is evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability\n      of adjunctive modafinil in the treatment of combat-related PTSD.  We hypothesize that\n      OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to modafinil 100mg/day for four weeks will experience\n      more improvement in PTSD symptoms than OEF/OIF veterans with PTSD randomized to placebo\n      treatment for four weeks.  2) To determine if PTSD symptom severity is associated with\n      electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and attention and if\n      these measures change to a greater degree in participants randomized to modafinil versus\n      those randomized to placebo.  We hypothesize modafinil treatment will result in greater\n      changes in electrophysiological and neuropsychological measures of pre-attention and\n      attention than placebo treatment."
