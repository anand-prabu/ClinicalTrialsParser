To assess whether SLM reduces the incidence of grade 3 or 4 mucositis in head and neck\n      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) patients treated with concurrent chemoradiation (CRT) over 7\n      weeks.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess the impact of SLM on tumor complete response rate, relapse-free survival,\n      overall survival and quality of life.\n\n      II. To assess whether SLM reduces the incidence and severity of treatment-related toxicities\n      including xerostomia, renal impairment and myelosuppression.\n\n      III. To assess whether SLM improves chemoradiation dose delivery. IV. To determine safety of\n      SLM at this dose. V. In New Zealand (NZ) patients only, to assess the impact of SLM on\n      plasma free cisplatin and plasma selenium pharmacokinetics (PK) and on pharmacodynamic (PD)\n      markers of biological activity of selenium.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive placebo orally (PO) twice daily in week 1 and then once daily in\n      weeks 2-11. Patients also receive cisplatin intravenously (IV) over 3 hours once in weeks 2,\n      5, and 8 and undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week in weeks 2-8.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive selenomethionine PO twice daily in week 1 and then once daily in\n      weeks 2-11. Patients also receive cisplatin and undergo radiotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
