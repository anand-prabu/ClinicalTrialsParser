      The  objective of this randomized, single center, parallel clinical research study is to
      evaluate the comparative efficacy performance of three dentifrices -Colgate Total
      Toothpaste, Parodontax Toothpaste and Colgate Cavity Protection Toothpaste in controlling
      gingivitis and dental plaque in adults.
