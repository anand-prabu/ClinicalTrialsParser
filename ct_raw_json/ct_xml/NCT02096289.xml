      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have a diagnosis of AML according to the WHO Classification1

          -  AML is refractory or relapsed (requiring at least 5% leukemic blasts in the bone
             marrow, regardless of the presence of other features such as new or recurrent
             dysplastic changes or extra medullary disease) according to the following
             definitions:

               -  Relapsed (defined as ≥ 5% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow) after three months
                  from receiving up to two prior induction regimens.

               -  Refractory (defined as ≥ 5% leukemic blasts in the bone marrow) to not more than
                  one prior induction regimen (defined as failure to achieve a CR or CRi following
                  induction therapy).

          -  55 years of age or older.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Receiving any other systemic anti-leukemic therapy (standard or investigational).

          -  Having received more than two prior chemotherapy lines for AML.
             Induction/consolidation therapy and bone marrow transplant are each considered a line
             of therapy.

          -  Having received previous AML therapy within four weeks of the first dose of study
             drug, with the exception of hydroxyurea.

          -  Clinical evidence suggestive of CNS involvement with leukemia unless a lumbar
             puncture confirms the absence of leukemic blasts in the CSF.

          -  Acute promyelocytic leukemia.

          -  An ECOG performance status of 3 or more.

          -  Inadequate renal function (i.e., estimated GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2).

          -  Inadequate hepatic function (i.e., serum bilirubin &gt; 1.5×ULN; AST, ALT and alkaline
             phosphatase &gt; 2.5×ULN).

          -  Presence of acute or chronic GVHD.

          -  Presence of a systemic fungal, bacterial, viral or other infection not controlled
             (defined as exhibiting ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection and without
             improvement, despite appropriate antibiotics or other treatment).

          -  Having any other severe concurrent disease, or have a history of serious organ
             dysfunction or disease involving the heart, kidney, liver or other organ system that
             may place the patient at undue risk to undergo induction therapy.

          -  Diagnosed with a condition that can prolong the QT interval (e.g., long QT syndrome)
             or have a QTc interval ≥ 470ms if male, or ≥ 480ms if female.

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction less than 45%.

          -  History of uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia.

          -  Known severe hypotensive or hypertensive heart disease.

          -  Prior malignancy, unless the patient has been disease-free for at least five years
             following curative intent therapy, with the following exceptions: Patients with
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ carcinoma, or cervical intraepithelial
             neoplasia, regardless of the disease-free duration, if definitive treatment for the
             condition has been completed; or patients with organ-confined prostate cancer with no
             evidence of recurrent or progressive disease based on prostate-specific antigen (PSA)
             values if hormonal therapy has been initiated or a radical prostatectomy has been
             performed.

          -  Known HIV positivity.

          -  Known pregnancy or lactating female.

          -  Presence of a psychiatric disorder that would interfere with consent, study
             participation, or follow-up.

          -  Unable to provide informed consent.
