Are\n      included women from 35 to 50 years presenting with deep endometriosis infiltrating at least\n      the muscular layer of the rectum and not having pregnancy intention.\n\n      The main outcome concerns the quality of digestive function 24 after the onset of the\n      treatment, assessed using a composite variable: patient considering that digestive function\n      is normal AND the Knowles-Eccersley-Scott-Symptom Questionnaire (KESS score) <7 AND the\n      Gastrointestinal Quality of Life Index (GIQLI) score >100.\n\n      Secondary outcomes are: presence of severe constipation, increased frequency of daily bowel\n      movements, anal incontinence, postoperative dysuria, Biberoglou & Behrman score, quality of\n      life SF36 score,  KESS score, GIQLI, Wexner score of anal continence, Bristol stools score,\n      the rate of postoperative complications, medical treatment adverse outcomes, the rate of\n      additional endoscopic and surgical procedures.\n\n      The randomization is central, once the physician asses the diagnosis, explain the study's\n      principle and rece In the arm A, the patients received triptoreline and add back therapy by\n      estradiol during 6 months, followed by daily intake of cyproterone acetate and add back\n      therapy during 18 months.\n\n      In the arm B, patients are managed by rectal surgery (depending on the surgeon choice:\n      rectal shaving, rectal disc excision or colorectal resection) followed by the prevention of\n      recurrences by daily intake of cyproterone acetate and add back therapy during 18 months.\n\n      The number of subjects required is 78 (39 on each arm). Inclusions period is estimated at 24\n      months. The length of the follow up is 24 months. The patients have 8 visits in the arm A,\n      and 7 visits in the arm B.\n\n      Eleven French tertiary referral centres will enrol patients in the trial."
