            "textblock": "Necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) is a devastating picture that all the neonatologists are\n      afraid of facing during the follow up of newborns. During the last years, investigators ran\n      retrospective observational  studies abut NEC developing within the 48 hours after red blood\n      cell transfusion. In the previous studies, the incidence of transfusion associated NEC\n      (TANEC) was found to be 20-35%.Multiple transfusions potentially cause an increased risk for\n      retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and NEC. Investigators have also proposed a hypothesis\n      about transfusion related acute gut injury (TRAGI), an adverse reaction of transfusion,\n      similar to transfusion related acute lung injury (TRALI) seen in adults.In most of the\n      neonatology clinics, withholding feeds during transfusion is not preferred. But several\n      recent studies show an increase in the incidence of TANEC if the newborn goes on feeding\n      before, during and after the transfusion process, especially if it is fed with a formula.\n      The main aim of this study is to investigate the effect of withholding feeds during\n      transfusion, on the development of TRAGI."
