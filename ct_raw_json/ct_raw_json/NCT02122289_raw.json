Moreover exacerbation treatments\n      present health costs burden leading to important physical psychological and social impact.\n      Preventing exacerbation and early detection of these exacerbations may decrease intensity\n      and freqauency of exacerbation leading to increase clinical status and QoLwith a decreased\n      health cost.\n\n      Patients actually follow in CRCM track exacerbations when visits out patient clinic and\n      during phone call. If patients did not call or did not  present regularly to out patient\n      clinic, exacerbation detection came later and so increasde the burden and therapeutic\n      pressure.\n\n      The objective of our study is to identify earlier the potential exacerbations and so\n      decreased the health costs and increased the patient's QoL. Forthis purpose we propose to\n      use modern technologiessuch as smartphone in order to create alert when patients report\n      weekly health satatus. We will compra patients randomize in control group with standart\n      follow-up to patients randomize in the smartphone group.Moreover we will study the\n      compliance and satisfactory degree of the use of this device in the interventional arm."
