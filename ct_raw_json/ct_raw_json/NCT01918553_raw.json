            "textblock": "Age-related Macular Degeneration is the most cause of blindness in the industrialised\n      countries. There are few French epidemiological data on this disease. Worldwide, studies\n      have included a small number of very old subjects. Thus, it is important to estimate the AMD\n      incidence in an elderly French population, in order to evaluate more precisely the number of\n      cases in the French population. Besides, some clinical, genetic and modifiable parameters\n      predisposing to the AMD are under study. The aim of the ECLAIR project is to study the\n      8-year incidence of AMD in an elderly French population and to identify the predisposing\n      factors. It is based on an existing cohort study (ALIENOR) in which some clinical, genetic\n      and modifiable data were collected at baseline, 2 and 4 years. It is the only cohort study\n      performed in France in this field since fifteen years in parallel with another one performed\n      in Dijon according to the same methodology. It is important to extend the study to 8 years\n      in order to have a sufficient statistical power for the identification of predisposing\n      factors. In the ECLAIR study, there is no treatment. The subjects will be followed during 2\n      years (6 and 8 years after baseline of the Alienor study). The visit 1 (A0) will be the\n      inclusion visit where the subjects will sign the inform consent and will perform\n      ophthalmological examinations. The subjects will come back 2 years later for the visit 2\n      (A2). In this second visit, the ophthalmological examinations will be the same that is:\n      measure of clinical parameters, measurement of visual acuity exams,\n      retinophotography,spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), intraocular\n      pressure, retinal imaging (OPTOMAP), axial length (IOL master)"
