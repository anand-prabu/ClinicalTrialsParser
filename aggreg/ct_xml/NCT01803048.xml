  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in structural and functional connectivity between brain regions have been
      suggested as putative biomarkers of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and significant
      contributors to neuropsychological functioning and injury outcome.  The purpose of this
      study is to use two advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques called
      diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and resting state functional MRI to compare structural and
      functional connectivity between individuals with documented mild TBI and healthy controls.
      To evaluate the significance of structural and functional connectivity for behavior, the
      brain imaging data will then be related to measures of cognition and emotion. Over a 4-year
      period, 150 adults with documented mild TBI and 30 healthy controls will participate in the
      study.

      The study will investigate the following questions and hypotheses:

        1. Evaluate the DWI metric fractional anisotropy (FA) as a measure of white matter
           integrity across multiple stages of recovery following mild TBI relative to healthy
           controls.  It is hypothesized that mild TBI will be associated with greater white
           matter abnormalities than healthy controls.

        2. It is hypothesized that there will be a relationship between FA, cognition and emotion
           as a function of the injury.

        3. It is hypothesized that functional connectivity will be related to FA.

        One hundred eighty participants aged 20-45, including 150 adults with documented mild TBI
        and 30 healthy controls (HC) will participate in this study.  Participants in the TBI
        group will include 30 individuals who will be tested at two weeks post-TBI; 30 individuals
        who will be tested at one month post-TBI; 30 individuals who will be tested at three
        months post-TBI; 30 individuals who will be tested at six months post-TBI; and 30
        individuals who will be tested at 12 months post-TBI. Participants will be recruited from
        the local area of Boston, MA, via IRB-approved flyers and advertisements placed in
        newspapers, on the radio and within vehicles of the local public transport system (e.g.
        buses and subway cars).
