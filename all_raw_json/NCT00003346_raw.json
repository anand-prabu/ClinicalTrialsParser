This treatment is repeated 3 weeks later. On day 1 of the first\n           treatment, patients also receive carmustine IV over 1 hour, before the acetylcysteine.\n           Courses repeat every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of acetaminophen to determine the\n      optimal biological dose (OBD). The OBD is defined as the lowest dose at or preceding the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) that results in maximal depletion of glutathione. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose at which no more than 1 to 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity\n      (DLT).\n\n      Once the OBD is established for acetaminophen, cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive\n      escalating doses of carmustine. The MTD is defined as for acetaminophen. Dose escalation\n      does not proceed until all patients are observed for 6 weeks after receiving carmustine.\n\n      Once the OBD for acetaminophen and MTD for carmustine are determined, 3 more patients are\n      treated at 3 week intervals instead of 6 weeks. If no DLT is observed, this is the dose and\n      schedule for the phase II portion of the study.\n\n        -  Phase II: A cohort of 14 patients receives oral acetaminophen and acetylcysteine IV\n           every 3 weeks. Another cohort of 14 patients receives oral acetaminophen and\n           acetylcysteine IV, then oral acetaminophen, carmustine IV, and acetylcysteine IV 3\n           weeks later. Patients continue therapy in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30-80 patients will be accrued for this study within 40\n      months."
