After 24 months from the last procedure, all serial questionnaires and\n      physician-filled-SSS sheets were gathered and analyzed by a one-way analysis of variance and\n      Scheffe post-test. A value of p<0.01 was considered statistically significant."

The primary mechanism of action of prolotherapy is to induce a small inflammatory response to promote adequate healing or more viable scar tissue formation that results in stronger fibrous tissue at the lateral epicondyle, which leads to improved function and reduced pain.",
