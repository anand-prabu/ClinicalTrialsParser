            "textblock": "1. General Design\n\n           This is a randomized, double blind, mono-centric, placebo-controlled interventional\n           study of the effects of oral vitamin D supplementation on self-reported fatigue.\n           Overall 80 non-anemic patients with proven vitamin D deficiency (20-Hydroxy-Vitamin D \u2264\n           20 \u00b5g/L) who fulfil all the eligibility criteria will be randomized and enrolled to\n           receive vitamin D or placebo in 1:1 ratio. All patients must sign an informed consent\n           prior to enrollment and meet eligibility criteria. All patients will be recruited at\n           the Medical Outpatients Department of University Hospital Z\u00fcrich.\n\n           Screening. Consecutive patients complaining of fatigue will be asked to participate in\n           the study and sign an informed consent. Basic questionnaire for fatigue will be applied\n           to confirm fatigue symptoms.\n\n           In positive case Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Mini International Neuropsychiatric\n           Interview (M.I.N.I.) and Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) will be administered to exclude\n           depression, sleep disorders and major psychiatric disorders respectively. Thereafter\n           blood will be tested. Patients with vitamin D levels below 20 \u00b5g/L will undergo\n           randomization. Participants will be informed about their results of vitamin D levels by\n           the telephone, a treatment appointment in 2 weeks time after screening will be arranged\n           for participants with vitamin D levels \u2264 20 \u00b5g/L.\n\n           Visit A (week 2. after randomisation \u00b13 days): Routine clinical examination will be\n           performed. Baseline Fatigue assessment scale (FAS) score will be documented, following\n           by blood samples to measure the baseline vitamin D-, PTH- and Calcium  levels. Blood\n           samples will be frozen after centrifugation.\n\n           Oral Vitamin D preparation or placebo will be administered according to the protocol in\n           a double blinded manner. The drug administration will be done by an independent person\n           e.g. a physician assistant or study nurse directly observing the drug intake. During\n           the administration, procedures are implemented which ensure that the subjects cannot\n           distinguish between placebo and verum (identical appearance, taste and smell).\n\n           Visit B (week 6. after randomisation \u00b13 days): Patients will undergo the same\n           Assessment of Fatigue by filling out FAS questionnaire. Additionally, a short\n           self-developed test Fatigue course assessment (FCA) will be applied to evaluate\n           symptomatic response. Thereafter blood and urine samples will be taken to document\n           biochemical response: Vitamin D-, PTH-, phosphate and calcium levels.\n\n           The Vitamin D status of the subjects will be monitored by standard clinical chemical\n           parameters. Safety assessments will include pre- and post-treatment measurement of\n           vital signs, clinical laboratory assessments, and the recording of adverse clinical\n           events.\n\n           An overview of the study design is presented in Figure 1, scheduled study tools in\n           Table 1:\n\n        2. Selection of study population / Subject recruitment\n\n           Patients will be informed about the study at a regular medical visit at the medical\n           outpatients department USZ.  Potential subjects will be provided with the participant\n           information sheet. After informed consent has been obtained all study-specific\n           information will be collected to determine if a patient meets the inclusion criteria\n           without violating any of the exclusion criteria. A total number of 80 subjects will be\n           enrolled, with an enrolment goal of 8 subjects per month. Recruitment will take place\n           in the medical outpatient department (Klinik und Poliklinik f\u00fcr Innere Medizin) of the\n           University Hospital in Zurich.\n\n           Patients will receive no financial compensation.\n\n           The specific inclusion and exclusion criteria for enrolling subjects in this study are\n           described in the following sections.\n\n        3. Prior and Concomitant Therapy According to the inclusion/exclusion criteria (see\n           above), chronic intake of concomitant medication is not allowed, except oral\n           contraceptives. Intake of Vitamin D preparations during the last 8 weeks before the\n           start of the trial protocol and during the trial is not allowed. Vitamin preparations\n           or herbal medicine should be withheld during the study period.\n\n           Sporadic medication with e.g. NSAID or paracetamol for symptomatic treatment of\n           intercurrent viral infections or occasional headaches is allowed. All concomitant\n           medications have to be recorded on the CRF. Subjects taking additional vitamin D\n           preparations drugs the study course will be excluded from the study.\n\n        4. Randomization and blinding Overview A randomization procedure will be used to avoid a\n           bias in the assignment of the study subjects to the two treatment groups (oral vitamin\n           D, oral placebo). Randomization lists, preparation of study drugs and placebo,\n           labelling and drug accountability will be done by the hospital pharmacy\n           (Kantonsapotheke Z\u00fcrich). The randomisation list will be preserved by the hospital\n           pharmacy. The oral intake will be directly observed by a physician assistant or study\n           nurse. As placebo and verum are manufactured having identical appearance, taste and\n           smell, study participants can not differ between placebo and verum.\n\n           Procedure Patients will be assigned to treatment groups based on a randomization\n           list/schedule prepared by the hospital pharmacy prior to the trial. Patients will\n           receive a randomization number. Randomized patients who terminate their study\n           participation for any reason regardless whether the study medication was taken or not,\n           will retain their randomization number. The next patient will be given the next\n           randomization number.\n\n           An Emergency Code Break preserved in a sealed Emergency Code Envelope will be available\n           to the investigator. This envelope with the Code Break should only be opened in\n           emergency situations when the identity of the investigational product must be known by\n           the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment.\n\n        5. Treatment / Dosage and administration\n\n      The patients will be randomized to one of the 2 treatment groups (40 participants in each\n      group): Group I: oral vitamin D; Group II: oral placebo.\n\n        -  Group I (oral vitamin D): 100 000 E Vitamin D (Colecalciferol) will be applied as a\n           single dose as two capsules containing 50 000 E each.\n\n        -  Group II (oral placebo): 2 placebo capsules will be applied as a single dose The drug\n           preparations will be delivered and labelled by the hospital pharmacy according to\n           standard operating procedures and GMP guidelines.\n\n      After the study finalisation, the placebo group will be offered a treatment with Vitamin D.\n\n      5. Study drug information Vitamin D used in this study is 2 capsules containing 50 000 E\n      Cholecalciferol each,  prepared by the university hospital pharmacy.\n\n      Placebo will be prepared by the university hospital pharmacy in a capsule of identical\n      appearance, taste and smell.\n\n      6. Packing and Labeling Study medication (oral Vitamin D and placebo) will be provided by\n      the hospital pharmacy, labelled and packaged according to Swiss guidelines and EU-GMP\n      guidelines."
