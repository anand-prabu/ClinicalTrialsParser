Course 1 is 28 days and all other subsequent courses are\n      21 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients who achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses of treatment.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of CAI is followed by sequential dose escalation of paclitaxel.\n      Dose escalation in cohorts of 3 to 6 patients each continues until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study."
