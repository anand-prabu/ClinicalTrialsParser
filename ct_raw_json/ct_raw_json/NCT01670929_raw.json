Age 18-39 years at randomisation (likelihood of miscarriages due to chromosomal\n             aberrations is higher in older women; such miscarriages are unlikely to be prevented\n             by progesterone therapy).\n\n          3. Spontaneous conception (as confirmed by urinary pregnancy tests).\n\n          4. Willing and able to give informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Age above forty years old.\n\n          2. Antiphospholipid syndrome (lupus anticoagulant and/or anticardiolipin antibodies [IgG\n             or IgM]); other recognised thrombophilic conditions (testing according to usual\n             clinic practice).\n\n          3. Intrauterine abnormalities (as assessed by ultrasound, hysterosonography,\n             hysterosalpingogram, or hysteroscopy).\n\n          4. Fibroids distorting uterine cavity.\n\n          5. Abnormal parental karyotype.\n\n          6. Other identifiable causes of recurrent miscarriages (tests initiated only if\n             clinically indicated) e.g., diabetes, thyroid disease and systemic lupus\n             erythematosus (SLE)."
