            "textblock": "This was a within group, randomised, repeated dose, placebo- and octreotide controlled study\n      in a target population of 45 healthy male subjects. Subjects were required to attend the\n      clinical for screening procedures between 3 and 28 days before dosing commenced. The study\n      was conducted in 4 groups of subjects; Groups 1 to 3 were a double-blinded, randomised\n      design, each consisting of 12 subjects. Group 4 was an open-label design and consisted of 9\n      subjects. There was a minimum interval of 96 h between dosing of Groups 1, 2 and 3 to allow\n      for interim analyses of PK and safety/tolerability data for dose escalation purposes. Group\n      4 (the active control group) was still to proceed if the decision was taken to prematurely\n      stop dosing with ITF2984 (somatostatin analogue) following review of the PK and safety data\n      presented at the interim decision meeting; dosing of this group was conducted independently\n      from Groups 1 to 3. On Days 1 to 6, subjects in Groups 1 to 3 were to receive 2 doses of\n      investigational medicinal product (IMP) approximately 12 h apart; subjects in Group 4 were\n      to receive 3 doses of IMP approximately 8 h apart. For all groups, subjects were scheduled\n      to receive their final dose of IMP on the morning of Day 7.\n\n      In addition, subjects were to receive exogenous test administrations(stimulation test) on\n      Day -1, Day 1 and Day 7 at the same time on each day (ie for Day -1, 23.5 h before the first\n      dose of IMP, and for Days 1 and 7, 0.5 h after the first dose of IMP on the respective day).\n      Blood samples for PD and PK analyses were taken at specified time points after each dosing.\n\n      Subjects remained on site for 10 days (ie 36 h after the final dose of IMP on Day 7)\n      providing that discharge conditions had been met, and returned to the clinic between 5 and\n      10 days after the last IMP administration for a follow-up visit."
