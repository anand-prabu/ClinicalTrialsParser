  <brief_summary>

      Objectives:

      Goal of the study is to investigate the potential benefit that transcatheter interventions
      such as Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI), MitraClip, Left Atrial Appendage
      Closure and catheter Ablation can gain from multimodal image fusion techniques as they are
      available in the Hybrid suite.

      Both the HeartNavigator and the EchoNav aim at decreasing the exposure to radiation and
      contrast agent, to shorten the operation time (efficacy), and to increase the quality of
      care (safety).

      This pilot study aims at observing these aims on a small patient population and a control
      group.

      Number of Subjects:

      140 patients total in 6 groups:

        -  MitraClip, Left Atrial Appendage Closure or catheter Ablation with EchoNav (20, lead-in
           stage).

        -  MitraClip randomized with EchoNav (25), MitraClip randomized without EchoNav (25).

        -  TAVI with HeartNavigator lead in (10)

        -  TAVI randomized with HeartNavigator (30), TAVI randomized without HeartNavigator (30).
