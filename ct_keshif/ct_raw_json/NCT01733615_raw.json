These unusual chemicals were recently discovered in the\n      urine from patients with MPSIVA.  The investigators would like to study these chemicals\n      before a specific enzyme replacement therapy is used.  If the investigators understand how\n      these chemicals change, the investigators may be able to use them to monitor this condition\n      in the near future as well as help doctors know whether certain therapies work well in their\n      patients."
