Sirolimus may stop the\n      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as gemcitabine hydrochloride, and cisplatin, work in different ways to\n      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Giving sirolimus with gemcitabine hydrochloride and cisplatin may be an effective\n      treatment for patients with a high risk of cancer recurrence after a liver transplant or\n      surgery."
