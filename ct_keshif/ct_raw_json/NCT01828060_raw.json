            "textblock": "From past history, case studies in Nigeria, as well as testimonials from all over the world,\n      have shown a robust increase in hemoglobin within a few weeks in people with serious cases\n      of anemia present under disease conditions such as sickle cell, Malaria, HIV, or cancer. In\n      parallel, improvements in red blood cell health were also seen in many healthy people with\n      general low blood counts due to undetermined factors.\n\n      A clinical study on anemia is currently ongoing in Nigeria. The study population is focused\n      on women and aims at evaluating whether Jobelyn\u2122 consumption can help increase hemoglobin\n      and thus reduce risk factors associated with gynecological surgery in a Nigerian cohort of\n      gynecological patients (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01670955).\n\n      As a parallel to the ongoing study in Nigeria, this study protocol will help to\n      systematically examine the effects of Jobelyn\u2122 on anemic conditions in an otherwise healthy\n      North American population, and help document the speed and magnitude of improvements in a\n      population without concomitant infections or sickle cell anemia.\n\n      Twenty-four human subjects of both genders will be tested over a period of 8 weeks. Both\n      genders may enroll in the study, but we expect more women to be eligible, due to effects of\n      menses and prolonged consumption of birth control pills.  Recruiting of volunteers will\n      happen via NIS Labs. A screening blood draw will be used for CBC/differential and the\n      hemoglobin level help determine eligibility.\n\n      Enrolled subjects will randomized to consume placebo or Jobelyn\u2122 for 8 weeks, during which\n      time subjects are monitored at baseline, and after 3 days, 7 days, and 2, 4, and 8 weeks. A\n      fasting blood sample will be taken at each visit, and used for hemoglobin and fasting\n      glucose measurements."
