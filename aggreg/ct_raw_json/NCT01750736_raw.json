Clinical tests and measurements as well as patient questionnaires\n      will be completed and compared between groups.\n\n      A secondary purpose is to determine if self report of activity is correlated with functional\n      improvements. We hypothesize that a specifically applied home exercise that augments the\n      effects of the manual therapy intervention will lead to improvements in outcomes in patients\n      with neck pain. We hypothesize that higher reports of self activity will be correlated with\n      improvements in outcomes."
