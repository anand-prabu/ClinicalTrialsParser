  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of
      ranibizumab (either monthly injections or injections as-needed based on the stability of a
      patient's vision) in Chinese patients with wet AMD . This study is to provide long-term
      safety data in the treatment of Chinese patients with wet AMD.

    <description>Visual acuity (VA) was assessed at every study visit using best correction determined from protocol refraction. VA measurements (number of letters correctly identified) were performed with the patient in a sitting position using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like VA testing charts at a testing distance of 4 meters. This outcome measure describes the difference between the VA averaged across all visits from Month 4 through 12 and the Month 3 Level of Visual Acuity (Letters) of the Study Eye. The treatment regimen up to Month 3 is the same in both treatment groups.</description>
