Six peer leaders from 2 primary care clinics\n      will be recruited and trained to conduct the intervention. Overweight and obese patients\n      (n=80) will be recruited (randomized by individual) to determine weight loss at 3 months\n      (primary outcome). The program consists of 12 weekly weight loss sessions led by a\n      successful volunteer peer leader using an adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program to\n      help participants lose weight."

The remaining sessions, conducted by co-peer leaders, will utilize an adaptation\n      of the Diabetes Prevention Program. This adaptation allows for use in a group setting and\n      facilitation by a lay individual.\n\n      Control Condition: Participants in the control condition will be given written information\n      at the baseline visit from the NIH website \"Aim for a Healthy Weight\" to provide a basic\n      understanding of weight loss and access to basic online resources. We expect that use of the\n      website may result in some weight loss. However, similar information-only interventions have\n      had a very small effect, which is accounted for in the sample size calculation."
