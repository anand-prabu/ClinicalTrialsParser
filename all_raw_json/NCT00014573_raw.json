Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow or peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells. Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells and tumor cells may make\n      the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a\n      person's white blood cells to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and vaccine\n      therapy followed by bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation and interleukin-2 in\n      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory brain cancer."

Patients\n      also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 3 and continuing\n      until peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) or bone marrow collection is completed.\n\n      After the collection of PBSC or bone marrow, patients receive autologous tumor cell vaccine\n      and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC once every 2 weeks for up to 5 vaccinations. Two weeks after\n      the last vaccination, patients undergo a second leukapheresis to collect lymphocytes.\n\n      After completion of the second leukapheresis, patients receive high-dose chemotherapy\n      comprising cisplatin IV continuously over 24 hours on day -5, cyclophosphamide IV over 1\n      hour on days -5, -4, and -3, and carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -2. Patients undergo\n      autologous bone marrow or PBSC transplantation on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF IV daily\n      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Approximately 12 weeks after bone marrow or PBSC transplantation, patients receive\n      autologous lymphocytes IV over 2-5 hours. Patients also receive interleukin-2 IV once every\n      other day for 10 days.\n\n      Patients are followed at 18, 24, 36, 40, and 52 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
