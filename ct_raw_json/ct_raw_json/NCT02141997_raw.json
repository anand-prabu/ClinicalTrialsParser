Diagnosis of RA based on the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European\n             League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria (as defined in the definition of terms).\n\n          3. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) diagnosis at least 3 months from the date of first\n             Screening.\n\n          4. Documented positive Rheumatoid Factor (RF) or Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide\n             (Anti-CCP) Antibody levels prior to or at Screening:\n\n             \u2022 If RF and Anti-CCP Antibody tests are negative, documented evidence of prior\n             erosions on radiographs or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) of\n             hands is an acceptable alternative for meeting this inclusion criterion.\n\n          5. Have active RA defined by minimum disease activity criteria:\n\n               -  \u2265 6 Swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) at Screening,\n\n               -  \u2265 6 Tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening,\n\n               -  hsCRP > Upper limit of normal at Screening.\n\n          6.

Subject can also be on stable doses of\n             sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine, so long as they are also on methotrexate.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subject has previous exposure to Humira, other Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors\n             or other biological DMARDs.\n\n          2. Current treatment with traditional oral Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs\n             (DMARDs) (except for concomitant treatment with sulfasalazine and/or\n             hydroxychloroquine in addition to MTX). Oral DMARDs must be washed out 5 times the\n             mean terminal elimination half-life of a drug apart from MTX prior to Day 1.\n\n             \u2022 Subject could have been exposed to prior Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors so long as\n             they have been off therapy for 5 half-lives.\n\n          3. Stable prescribed dose of oral prednisone or prednisone equivalent > 10 mg/day within\n             the 30 days of first dose of study drug.\n\n          4. Intra-articular or parenteral administration of corticosteroids in the preceding 4\n             weeks of first dose of study drug. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical\n             conditions are allowed.\n\n          5. Laboratory values of the following at the Screening Visit:\n\n               -  Confirmed hemoglobin < 9 g/dL for males and < 8.5 g/dL for females,\n\n               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) < 1500 mm3,\n\n               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) > 1.5 \u00d7 the\n                  upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin \u2265 3 mg/dL,\n\n               -  Serum creatinine > 1.5 \u00d7 the ULN,\n\n               -  Platelets < 100,000 cells/[mm3] (109/L),\n\n               -  Clinically significant abnormal screening laboratory results as evaluated by the\n                  Investigator."
