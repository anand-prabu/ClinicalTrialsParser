This type of psoriasis is\n      characterised by sharply dermatcated, erythematous, scaling plagues that typically affect\n      the elbows, knees, scalp, and intergluteal cleft. Estimates of the prevalence of psoriasis\n      is vary from 0.5% to 4.6%, with rate varying between countries and races. The prevalence of\n      psoriasis was about 2% in Taiwan. The cause of psoriasis remains unknown; however, it has\n      been linked to complex interactions between predisposing genes and the environment. Current\n      treatment of psoriasis included topical therapy (eg. topical corticosteroids, tars,\n      anthralin, vitamin D analogues, Retinodes), phototherapy and systemic therapy (eg.\n      Methotrexate, cyclosporine, Retinoids, Biologics). Although beneficial, all have undesirable\n      adverse effects."
