            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      This project\ufffds goal is to improve the quality of care and reduce treatment costs for\n      veterans with substance abuse and psychiatric problems.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      This project is evaluating a patient-treatment matching strategy to improve residential\n      treatment for substance abuse patients with psychiatric disorders.  Its immediate objective\n      is to examine whether the matching strategy results in more effective and cost-effective\n      treatment in VA programs.  We hypothesize that patients with severe clinical problems will\n      have better outcomes when they are matched to service-intensive programs; patients with\n      moderate problems will have better outcomes when they are matched to programs having a lower\n      intensity of services.  For both patient groups, community treatment should prove to be more\n      cost-effective than hospital treatment.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      The project utilized a stratified randomized design.  We paired each of three VA hospital\n      programs that treat dual diagnosis patients and are high on intensity with a nearby\n      high-intensity community residential facility (CRF) that contracts with the VA.  We also\n      paired four VA hospital and four CRFs that are low on intensity.  Veterans who applied for\n      substance abuse treatment at VA facilities were randomly assigned to either the VA hospital\n      or CRF.  Patient assessments have been conducted at intake (N=230), discharge, and a 4-month\n      follow-up.  Primary outcomes are patients\ufffd severity of substance abuse and psychiatric\n      problems.  Secondary outcomes are patients\ufffd functional status and their VA and non-VA health\n      care utilization and its costs.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed."
