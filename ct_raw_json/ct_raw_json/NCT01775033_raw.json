The investigators will implement the intervention in a\n      sample of rural hospitals in Pennsylvania using a staggered roll-out design, and compare\n      outcomes of children seen in these hospitals to similar matched hospitals in the state,\n      using Pennsylvania state Medicaid data to evaluate the impact of the intervention."
