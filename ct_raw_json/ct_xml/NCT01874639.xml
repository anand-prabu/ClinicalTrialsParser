    <textblock>
      Blood loss in hepatic surgery is the main factor of postoperative morbidity. The use of the
      most effective possible tool for hemostasis allows a bleeding decrease during liver
      transection and thus could reduce postoperative morbidity.

      In the past decade, the improvement of techniques of transection of the hepatic parenchyma
      was one of the most important factors to ensure the hepatectomy safety. But the clinical
      performances of these technological innovations (ultrasound dissectors, monopolar
      radiofrequency probes and dissection devices using pressurized water) remain still unclear.

      The medical device of hemostasis Aquamantys® (Salient company, Innopath) use the technology
      of &quot;transcollation&quot; combining a source of radiofrequency associated with a conductive liquid
      (NaCl 0.9% solution). The system consists of a specific generator (Aquamantys Pump
      Generator®) and single-use probes (Aquamantys 2.3 BipolarSealer®). The energy of
      radiofrequency is delivered by two bipolar electrodes. The innovative aspect of this device
      consists in maintaining the tissue to a temperature of 100°C, while using a conductive
      liquid which acts as process of cooling and avoids the drying out of tissues, smoke, risks
      of electric arc and overheating met with conventional electrosurgery. This device allows the
      coagulation of blood vessels but also bile ducts. The Aquamantys® system could decrease the
      postoperative morbidity and mortality due to a decrease of blood loss and biliary leak.
      These clinical benefits could be translated by an improvement of the direct and indirect
      costs associated to the surgery. However the Aquamantys® technology has not been
      scientifically validated in the context of the hepatic surgery, and this technology is
      expensive due to the purchase of single-use bipolar probes (Aquamantys 2.3 BipolarSealer®)
      and to the investment in a generator (Aquamantys Pump Generator®).

      Consequently, it is essential to realize a study measuring the clinical and medical economic
      impact of the transcollation technology (Aquamantys® device) in the hepatic surgery.

      After validation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the patients include in this
      clinical trial will be randomized between the two arms of the study:

        -  Control group: hepatectomy with conventional hemostasis using standard bipolar
           coagulation

        -  Test group: hepatectomy with Aquamantys®
