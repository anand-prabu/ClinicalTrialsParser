  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population continues to age, the prevalence of spinal deformity surgery for older
      patients is increasing. Questions regarding the suitability of these patients to undergo
      large spinal procedures and whether the outcomes merit the risks involved are not well
      known.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome is the absolute change in the SRS-22r total score between baseline and 24-months follow-up (FU) values in patients at age 60 or older treated with major spinal reconstruction.
The SRS-22r is a patient-reported outcome instrument and has a range from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). It contains 22 questions covering five domains: function, pain, self-image, mental health (each with 5 items), and satisfaction with treatment (2 items) and each item is scored from 1 to 5.</description>

    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline and the 24-months FU values.
The ODI is a patient-reported outcome measure used most commonly in patients with low back pain. It consists of 10 questions and each of the items can be scored from 0 (no disability) to 5 (maximal disability), leading to a maximum score of 50.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline and the 24-months FU values as measured by the European Quality of Life 5 Dimensions (EQ-5D).
The EQ-5D is a standardized instrument designed for self-completion to assess quality of life. It has 5 items with a three-point categorical response scale. A unique EQ-5D health state is defined by combining one level from each of the five dimensions.</description>

    <description>The outcome measure is the absolute change between baseline and the 24-months FU values.
Lower back and leg pain will be assessed on a visual analogue scale (NRS) which ranges from 0 (no pain) to 100 (severe pain).</description>
