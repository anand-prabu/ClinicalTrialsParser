  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see if we can select patients based on their cancer
      characteristics, to determine if Triciribine (TCN) and carboplatin are safe and tolerable
      when given together, and to determine if this combination of drugs can help people with
      recurrent ovarian cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A portion of the patient's cancer tissue, previously removed, will be analyzed for a
      specific protein (phosphorylated BCL-2 antagonist of cell death).  If the patient is found
      to have high levels of this protein in their tumor, they may qualify to be in the study.

    <description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of TCN-PM when combined with carboplatin in a Phase I clinical trial of biomarker-selected women with platinum-resistant, recurrent or persistent epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube and primary peritoneal cancer (OVCA).</description>

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The best overall response is the best time point response recorded from the start of the treatment until disease progression/recurrence (taking as reference for progressive disease the smallest sum recorded since baseline).
Complete Response (CR): Disappearance of all target lesions. Any pathological lymph nodes (whether target or non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm.
Partial Response (PR): At least a 30% decrease in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum diameters.
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Progression Free Survival (PFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from study entry to time of progression or death, whichever occurs first.
Progressive Disease (PD): At least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study (this includes the baseline sum if that is the smallest on study). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm. (Note: the appearance of one or more new lesions is also considered progressions).
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

    <measure>Duration of Stable Disease (SD)</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Stable Disease (SD): Neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for Partial Response (PR) nor sufficient increase to qualify for Progressive Disease (PD), taking as reference the smallest sum diameters while on study.
Response and progression will be evaluated using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST version 1-1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria.</description>

    <description>Phase I/II Clinical Trial Doses: The starting dose for this phase I study (dose level 1) will be TCN 15 mg/m2 on days 1, 8 and 15 and Carboplatin AUC 5. TCN will be escalated to 25, 35, then 45 mg/m2 if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are not encountered. Phase II: Treat 18 additional patients at the recommended Phase II dose of triciribine + carboplatin to confirm safety and tolerability and assess response rate and Progression Free Survival (PFS)</description>
