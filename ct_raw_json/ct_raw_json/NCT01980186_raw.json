A recent study\n      (Shen et al. 2013) demonstrated increased EAF was predictive of risk of autism.  We believe\n      TUS is capable or rapid, safe, low cost, non-invasive measurement of EAF spaces.  Where\n      prior imaging, ie., MRI or CT exist they will be used as comparisons. Both individuals with\n      autism and their siblings will be screened to create a database and standard for TUS\n      measurements. It is further believed that TUS may be able to detect areas of cortical\n      abnormalities called dysplasias. The procedure requires no sedation and only takes a few\n      minutes to perform. If validated, this would make TUS an ideal screening test for autism\n      risk and allow for early referral and more definitive imaging with MRI where necessary."
