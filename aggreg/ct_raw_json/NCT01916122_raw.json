A bolus of 5 mCi (+/- 10%) of FES PET/CT will be injected intravenously. 60 (+/- 10) minutes following tracer injection, the patient will be positioned on a GE Discovery PET/CT scanner. A low milliampere CT of from the mid skull to mid thigh will be acquired first, 60-80mAs, 120-140kVp, with a 5mm slice thickness while the patient was free breathing. PET will be acquired at 3-5 minutes per bed position using the 3D mode, approximately 6-7 bed positions. FES PET/CT imaging will take less than 60 minutes. Scans will be reconstructed with iterative reconstruction.\nIf a follow-up FES PT/CT scan is performed on a patient, then the same parameters will be used as the initial FES PET/CT scan."

Estrogen receptors are found within\n      breast cancer cells and are an important marker of which medicines may best treat a breast\n      cancer. This study is being performed to imaging the amount of estrogen receptors expressed\n      in the tumor. A research agent named 16\u03b1-18F-fluoroestradiol (FES) finds estrogen receptors\n      and binds to them. Then tumors with estrogen receptors can be imaged by a PET/CT scanner, a\n      machine that can take pictures of where the FES is and how much FES is present. The results\n      of this study may help researchers know whether FES can be used to monitor changes in\n      estrogen receptors in tumors during treatment."
