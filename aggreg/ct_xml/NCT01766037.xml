  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is being performed to find out if a new device, AspireAssist Aspiration
      Therapy System, can help people with obesity to lose weight without causing too many side
      effects.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Aspiration process works by &quot;correcting&quot; meal portions after eating by removing the food
      left in your stomach 20 minutes after your meal, reducing the number of calories absorbed by
      your body. This is done through a tube placed through the abdomen into the stomach with a
      small valve attached at the surface of your skin. An aspiration system will attach to that
      valve after each major meal of the day and allow you to remove a portion of that meal.

      During this study you will also be provided with Lifestyle therapy which includes behavioral
      therapy, diet and physical activity education.  This Lifestyle therapy will also be provided
      to the participants who do not receive the AspireAssist so that the two groups can be
      compared and the benefit of aspiration for weight loss can be determined.
