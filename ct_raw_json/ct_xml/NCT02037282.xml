  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite currently available antivirals, influenza causes significant morbidity and
      mortality, with 226,000 excess hospitalizations and 30,000-50,000 deaths each year in the
      United States alone, and more therapies are needed in the armamentarium of anti-influenza
      medications including humoral immunity-based agents.

      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics of an anti-influenza hyperimmune intravenous
      immunoglobulin. Beginning with a low dose, subjects will receive anti-influenza intravenous
      immunoglobulin (FLU-IVIG) and evaluated on Study Days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 28. The safety and
      tolerability is evaluated using symptoms, clinical laboratory tests, and pharmacokinetics.
      Utilizing serum antibody responses as determined by hemagglutination inhibition (HAI)
      assays, the dose will be escalated as immunogenicity is established.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

               2. Weight less than or equal to 100 kg

               3. Patients must be willing to forgo the seasonal influenza vaccine for 28 days,
                  and the MMR and varicella vaccines for 3 months post infusion of the study drug

               4. Females who are able to become pregnant (i.e., are not postmenopausal, have not
                  undergone surgical sterilization, and are sexually active with men) must agree
                  to use at least 1 effective form of contraception from the date of the subject
                  s signing of the informed consent form through 28 days after the dose of the
                  study drug

        EXCLUSION CRIATERIA:

          1. Any chronic medical problem that requires daily oral medications (except Tylenol,
             oral contraceptives, vitamins, and seasonal allergy medications), or other medical
             history that in the opinion of the investigator significantly increases the risk
             associated with IVIG

          2. Women who are breast-feeding

          3. Positive urine or serum pregnancy test

          4. Known sensitivity to IVIG

             as cryoglobulinemia, hyper-triglyceridemia, or monoclonal gammopathies

          9. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt;  60 mL/min at screening, calculated
