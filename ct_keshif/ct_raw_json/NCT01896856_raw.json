See section 10\n             for the evaluation of measureable disease.\n\n          -  Patients must have received irinotecan therapy in the metastatic setting.  There are\n             no limitation on number of prior therapies in the metastatic setting.\n\n          -  Age minimum of 18 years.\n\n          -  Life expectancy of greater than 12 weeks.\n\n          -  ECOG performance status <1\n\n          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function\n\n          -  The effects of SGI-110 on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason and\n             because oncological agents are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing\n             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier\n             method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of\n             study participation. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while\n             participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n             document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for\n             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not\n             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n\n          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.\n\n          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic\n             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse\n             events.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to irinotecan, decitabine or SGI-110.\n\n          -  Subjects who have received prior therapy with any hypomethylating agents.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because SGI-110 is a/an hypomethylating\n             agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is\n             an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with SGI-110, breastfeeding should be discontinued. These\n             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study.\n\n          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible except for the\n             following circumstances. Individuals with a history of other malignancies are\n             eligible if they have been disease-free for at least 5 years and are deemed by the\n             investigator to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy. Individuals with\n             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years:\n             cervical cancer in situ, and basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.\n\n          -  HIV-positive individuals on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because\n             of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with SGI-110. In addition, as these\n             individuals are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in participants\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n\n          -  Previous treatment with regorafenib"
