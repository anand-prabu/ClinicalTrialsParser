  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine if medication adherence is improved by a
      transitional care pharmacy practice model designed to integrate hospital and community
      pharmacists in the care and education of patients with heart failure or COPD who are
      discharged from a community hospital to home. The hospital and community pharmacists will
      collaborate with each other, the patient, and other practitioners including the primary care
      physician, nurse, and case manager to prevent and correct medication-related problems and
      attempt to improve patient outcomes especially during the error-prone transition from
      hospital to home.

    <description>The primary endpoint will be medication adherence as measured by the Proportion of Days Covered (PDC) calculation. This is calculated by dividing the total days' supply dispensed by 180 days.  Medications considered in this calculation will include those used for the treatment of heart failure or COPD and known to improve outcomes.  The composite PDC will be an average of the individual PDC for each drug class.</description>

    <description>The Care Transitions Measure (CTM-3) is a validated survey to assess the patient's satisfaction with the quality of transitional care during hospitalization and will be completed by the patient following hospital discharge. The patient's satisfaction with the services provided by the community pharmacies will be assessed with the Consumer Experience with Pharmacy Services survey (Â© Pharmacy Quality Alliance).</description>

    <description>The control group will receive the current standard of care including medication reconciliation during hospitalization performed by a nurse or physician and education about discharge medications provided by the inpatient nurse. There will not be a pharmacist discharge care plan developed for this group. The patients will not be required to choose a participating community pharmacist and no counseling and education appointments will be scheduled. Any medication-related problems identified by the pharmacists and will be communicated as appropriate and resolved as is the standard of care.  Any other interaction between the patient and their pharmacist will be according to the current standard of care.</description>

    <description>The hospital pharmacist will meet with the patient and complete medication reconciliation, assess the patient's understanding of the medications, and identify medication-related problems. The hospital pharmacist will complete a pharmacist discharge care plan and a copy will be sent to the participating community pharmacist. The patients will be scheduled for the first meeting with their community pharmacist within 1 week of hospital discharge. The community pharmacist will interview the patient about their general health and any current symptoms of heart failure or COPD, identify any additional medication-related problems, follow-up on any issues as described in the pharmacist discharge care plan, and provide patient education. The patients will then meet with their community pharmacist for counseling and patient education at monthly intervals for 6 months following hospital discharge.</description>
