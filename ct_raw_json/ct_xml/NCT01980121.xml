  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food residue in the stomach of patients scheduled to have surgery is considered a major risk
      factor for pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. The resulting respiratory compromise
      after aspiration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The risk of
      pulmonary aspiration is especially important in pregnant women, as they may often require
      surgery without having observed appropriate fasting. In pregnant patients scheduled for
      elective surgery, standard preoperative guidelines apply as the general non-pregnant
      surgical population (8-hour fasting of solid food and 2-hour fasting of clear fluids). A
      bedside ultrasound assessment of the status of the gastric content and volume would be of
      great value for the clinician. This technique has recently been shown very promising in
      fasted non-pregnant patients scheduled for elective surgery. Therefore, it is important to
      study its feasibility in the pregnant population scheduled for elective Cesarean Delivery.

      We hypothesize that no residual solid contents will be found in the gastric sonography, and
      a small volume of gastric fluid will be observed in the antrum in both supine and right
      lateral decubitus.

      The aim of this prospective study is to provide a qualitative and quantitative description
      of the sonographic appearance of the gastric antrum in fasted pregnant undergoing elective
      Cesarean delivery.

      We expect that the information obtained from the systematic ultrasonographic
      qualitative/quantitative assessment of the gastric content may help anesthesiologist to
      better assess aspiration risk and guide anesthetic and airway management, particularly in
      pregnant women scheduled for elective Cesarean delivery after standard preoperative fasting
      guidelines.
