            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to see if an enzyme in the body (5-alpha reductase, 5\u03b1R) is\n      important in controlling how the body handles sugar and fat. The investigators believe that\n      5\u03b1R is a crucial step in regulating these actions as well as controlling how insulin works\n      in the body but regulating the amount of steroid hormones including cortisol and\n      testosterone in the body. In previous clinical studies, the investigators have shown that\n      the activity of 5\u03b1R increases as you gain weight and decreases with weight loss. In\n      addition, work that the investigators have performed in the laboratory has shown that if you\n      increase 5\u03b1R levels in liver cell grown in the laboratory, the amount of fat that they\n      contain increases. The investigators would therefore like to demonstrate the effect of\n      inhibition 5\u03b1R on the regulation of insulin, glucose and fat in the body."
