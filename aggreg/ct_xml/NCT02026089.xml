    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn more abou how the immune system responds to the
      chickenpox vaccine in adults who had never had chickenpox as a child and were then
      vaccinated as an adult.  The study aims to learn more about the strength and duration of the
      protection provided by the vaccine in adults, and to observe the immune response to an
      additional dose of chickenpox vaccine in adults who had received the vaccine at least 5
      years earlier.  This is especially relevant to workers in a hospital who may be exposed to
      chickenpox.
