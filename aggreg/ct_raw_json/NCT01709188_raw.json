This Musical Dual Task Training protocol is structured with musical content and\n      patients are required to do musical tasks including singing and playing instruments\n      contingent on visual or auditory cues while walking. This paradigm is designed to include\n      music making because it involves great demands on attention and memory that might elicit\n      experience-dependent plasticity in the brain. Musical Dual Task Training is proposed to\n      strengthen brain networking for attention control that consequently may improve the gait\n      performances in patients with dementia, as indicated by reducing dual task cost on gait."
