Each site recruits about 50-150 patients.\n\n      The primary variable will be distribution of severity based on GINA definition (GINA 2006\n      update) at baseline in the total population.\n\n      There will be 4 visits for this study, Informed consent and following study procedures\n      (ACQ-5(asthma control questionnaire), severity assessment) will be done at visit 1. After\n      that, according to clinical practice in China patients usually go to the clinic every 4\n      weeks. Asthma control status, ACQ-5 and sever exacerbation will be assessed at each clinic\n      visit till 12 weeks (visit 2, 3, 4)."
