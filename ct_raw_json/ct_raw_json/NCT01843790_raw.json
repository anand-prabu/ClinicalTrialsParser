Animal models with genetic knockout of galectin-3\n      demonstrate a reduction in structural and functional deficits in the kidney (Dang et. al.,\n      2012, Fernandes Bertocchi et. al., 2008, Henderson et. al., 2008). GCS-100 is a galectin- 3\n      antagonist that has been shown to reduce fibrosis pre-clinically. Based on the role of\n      galectin-3 and fibrosis in kidney disease, the Sponsor believes GCS-100 may be effective at\n      treating patients with CKD."
