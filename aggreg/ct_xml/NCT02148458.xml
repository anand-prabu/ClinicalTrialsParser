    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate the effects of intermittent fasting in
      subjects that are eating a Mediterranean diet or a Western diet. This study is part of
      ongoing research in the prevention and treatment of age-related diseases at Washington
      University School of Medicine.

      The primary objective of this study is to determine whether or not IF, independently of
      changes in quality of diet, reduces the level of chronic inflammation as evidenced by a
      decrease in high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), as the main outcome measure.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. - The participants in this study will be 40 men and women in the 30 to 65 year age
