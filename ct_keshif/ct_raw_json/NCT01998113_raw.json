Investigators aim to update the\n      evidence on RCTs comparing glyburide and metformin vs insulin or between them and summarize\n      this evidence using meta-analysis tools. Specifically, investigators aim at producing\n      distinct meta-analyses for each one of the three drug comparisons. This information is not\n      available in the literature since the most recent systematic reviews specifically dealing on\n      oral agents for the treatment of GDM have addressed a single drug comparison (Gui 2013) or\n      have combined different drug comparisons into a single meta-analysis (Dhulkotia 2010)"
