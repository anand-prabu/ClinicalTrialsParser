  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The trial will test the equivalence of a repeat bolus protocol of magnesium sulfate
      administered by the Springfusor® controlled pump to the Pritchard intra-muscular regimen,
      the standard magnesium sulfate regimen used in the MAGPIE trial and many hospitals where IV
      infusion pumps are not available.  The goal of this pharmacokinetic study is to assess the
      pharmacological equivalence of the serum magnesium sulfate concentrations obtained in the
      treatment of severe preeclampsia with the MAGPIE and Springfusor repeat bolus regimens.  The
      study will also document the clinical outcomes, efficacy and acceptability of each treatment
      for patients and staff.

    <description>Blood draw times will be structured so as to perform a robust population PK analysis.  Time zero is the end of the bolus administration.  In the Springfusor arm, samples will be collected at the following times: 00:00, 00:20; 00:40; 1:20; 2:20; 3:00; 4:40; 5:20; 6:00; 6:20; 7:00; 8:00; 9:40; 10:00; 10:40; 12:00.  In the IV/IM or Magpie arm, samples will be collected at the following times: 0:00; 00:20; 00:40;1:00; 1:40; 3:20; 4:00; 4:20; 5:00; 6:00; 8:00; 8:40; 9:20; 10:40 and 12:00.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Exhibit systolic blood pressure &gt; 160mm Hg OR a diastolic pressure &gt; 110 mm Hg (at two
        times over 30 minutes) (A single higher pressure could be accepted if the clinical team
        felt that magnesium sulfate therapy should be initiated without waiting 30 minutes).

        Exhibit proteinuria &gt; 1+; Have not given birth, or be &lt;24h postpartum Be assessed by
        enrolling physician to benefit from magnesium sulfate therapy Agree to comply with study
        procedures Be &gt; 18 years of age Give informed consent for study participation

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Eclamptic or seizing at the time of enrollment Received magnesium sulfate therapy 24h
        prior to study enrollment Known serum creatinine &gt;1.2 mg/dL. (Subject may be enrolled
        prior to knowledge of serum creatinine but would be withdrawn if &gt;1.2 mg/dL in order to
        have a proper dose adjustment.
