More and\n      more surgeons pay attention to the rationality of this surgical approach. However, the\n      clinical application researches are still few, in particular the prospective controlled\n      study is still none. This clinical trial will compare the CME group and non-CME group to\n      evaluate the outcome and safety of CME for apply in clinic."

The observations\n      were recorded during the operation and on the postoperative specimens. Intra-operative\n      photographs were taken at various stages, as were photographs of the postoperative specimen.\n      According to the CME operation keypoints, all the photographs will accept third-party\n      assessment of the expert group, while the third-party expert group will not participate in\n      the management of patients. Both of The evaluators and research doctors are double-blind\n      state. The postoperative patients will divided into two groups according to the results of\n      the assessment. The clinical and pathological data of the patients as well as follow-up\n      information will be recorded and collected.\n\n        1. Outcome of CME By comparison to clinicopathologic variables, and precise tissues\n           morphometry of two groups, the prognosis, lymph nodes harvest and removal of the\n           mesocolic area were investigated. Outcomes of interest also include disease-free\n           survival, local recurrence-free survival, recurrence rate. In addition, we analyzed the\n           correlation between mesocolic area and height, weight, body surface area and body mass\n           index.\n\n        2. Safety of CME CME group and non-CME group were compared the differences of security,\n           included operation time, blood loss, postoperation complications, flatus restoring\n           time, defecation restoring time, drainage removal time, Diet restoring time, drainage\n           volume in three days after surgery, hospital deaths, the exhaust time, hospitalization\n           time and hospitalization costs. In addition, the feasibility of CME techniques as the\n           surgical approach of choice for elderly patients was also evaluated."
