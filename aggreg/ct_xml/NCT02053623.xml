  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one billion people suffer from hypertension worldwide. At least 10% of this
      population, that is, 100 million people, also suffers from associated chronic conditions
      namely, atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, arterial stiffness (AS), and heart failure (HF).
      Personal interaction with medical practitioners (doctors) and review of published clinical
      research confirms that current non-invasive automatic blood pressure (BP) monitors that rely
      on BP pulse analysis alone cannot provide accurate measurement due to the unpredictable/weak
      nature of BP pulses in the above-mentioned chronic conditions. Lack of accuracy in BP
      estimation can lead to wrong diagnoses and hence to complications such as stokes and heart
      attacks.

      The Sponsor is developing a novel non-invasive BP monitor that is similar to existing
      automatic monitors yet is capable of acquiring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) data in
      conjunction with BP pulse data to provide better and more accurate measurements in the above
      chronic conditions.

      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the performance of this ECG-assisted BP
      monitor against invasive BP measurements in a small group of patients who suffer from the
      above conditions.

        We will recruit a minimum of 20 qualified adult patients who come to the catheterization
        lab at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute for an angiography. The patients will have
        at least one of the following chronic conditions: atrial fibrillation, obesity,
        atherosclerosis, and heart failure.
