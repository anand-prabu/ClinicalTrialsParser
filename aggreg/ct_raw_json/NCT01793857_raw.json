During the interview, the primary caregivers will be asked\n      what they did for the child during that episode and whether they sought medical care or not.\n      They will be also asked about the demographic characteristics (such as age range) of the\n      child who experienced that episode and the household environment of the child at the time of\n      the episode (such as number of household members), etc.\n\n      No questions will be asked about the episode itself if the primary caregiver does not recall\n      that the child had one in the last six months.\n\n      Approximately 1300 primary caregivers will be interviewed in multiple clinics / well-baby\n      clinics in Panama.\n\n      The clinics will be stratified into 'former clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial\n      sites' in urban areas of Panama, based on participation in the COMPAS trial. Both 'former\n      clinical trial sites' and 'non-clinical trial sites' will include private and public\n      facilities. Sites will be selected by convenience sampling and eligible subjects will be\n      enrolled on an on-going basis, in proportion to the population coverage of each site. The\n      participating sites have thus been stratified to be able to assess whether the healthcare\n      seeking behaviour of primary caregivers enrolled at former clinical trial sites are\n      different from those enrolled at non clinical trial sites."
