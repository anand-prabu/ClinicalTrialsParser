    <textblock>
      Investigators will conduct a 2-year clinical trial on  auricular acupuncture (AA) for
      primary insomnia (PI), which is a double-blind ( patient-blind and assessor-blind) and
      double-dummy RCT. 288 patients will be randomly assigned into 2 groups: the treatment group
      (Group A) and the control group (Group B). Group A will be treated with AA pressure plus
      oral placebo, while Group B will be treated with sham AA pressure plus oral Eszopiclone. All
      patients will receive a continuous 4-week treatment and 28-week follow-up. The data will be
      analyzed by the third party who is not clear about allocation and treatment.
