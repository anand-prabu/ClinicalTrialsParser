  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a dexamethasone-implant alone or in combination with
      bevacizumab. 64 eyes are prospectively investigated. Group 1 (22 CRVO and 16 BRVO) is
      treated with dexamethasone-implant alone, Group 2 (14 CRVO 12 BRVO) with three consecutive
      bevacizumab injections followed by a dexamethasone-implant. Recurrences are treated with
      dexamethasone-implant only. Patients are seen preoperatively and thereafter in monthly
      intervals. The primary endpoint was BCVA at twelve months.
