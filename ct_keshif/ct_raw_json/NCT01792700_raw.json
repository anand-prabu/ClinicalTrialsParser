In patients who maintained continuous H. pylori negativity for the first\n      year after eradication therapy, H. pylori status was assessed every year. For the evaluation\n      of risk factors of reinfection, gender, age, clinical diagnosis, histological atrophic\n      gastritis or intestinal metaplasia were analyzed."
