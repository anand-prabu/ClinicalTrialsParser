  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of OSAS is estimated at 2% and 4% for adult women and men respectively, most
      of whom are undiagnosed and untreated. The severity of the disorder is expressed  by the
      Apnea Hypopnea Index (AHI) which is the number of Apnea/Hypopnea episodes per hours of
      actual sleep and the Respiratory Disturbances Index (RDI)  which is an extended index
      incorporating in addition to the previous episodes also respiratory effort related arousal
      episodes. The high cost of in-lab full night PSG, together with long waiting lists for sleep
      studies, have led to the development of a variety of ambulatory sleep study systems.

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the newly developed WP200 with the unified
      probe (WP200U) compared to the currently used configuration of WP200 that uses an
      incorporated Nonin oximetry module in the sleep lab or in the home sleep environment.
