Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC), brief periods of\n      ischemia followed by reperfusion, can provide systemic protection from prolonged ischemia.\n      Our previous study found no significant protection to the patients who received once RIPC\n      before Carotid Artery Stenting. In order to investigate whether long-term RIPC before\n      Carotid Artery Stenting can protect these patients from perioperative and long-term\n      complications, a randomized controlled trial will be performed in the current study.\n\n      DESIGNING about 90 patients will be randomized to Carotid Artery Stenting with RIPC\n      group,sham RIPC group and conventional Carotid Artery Stenting group (control). Remote limb\n      ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm\n      ischemia/reperfusion, which was induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right\n      upper arm which was inflated to 200 mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins,\n      each RIPC group patients did it twice a day for two weeks,sham RIPC group patients received\n      sham RIPC, consisted of five 5-min cycles of right upper arm ischemia/reperfusion, which was\n      induced by an automated cuff-inflator placed on the right upper arm which was inflated to 20\n      mmHg for 5mins followed by deflating the cuff for 5mins, each sham RIPC group patients did\n      it twice a day for two weeks. The control group patients received conventional Carotid\n      Artery Stenting without RIPC. Cerebral injury was assessed by S-100b, NSE, hs-CRP and MMSE\n      test in different time points."
