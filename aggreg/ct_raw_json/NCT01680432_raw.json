One way to reduce constipation through nutritional management of\n      affected individuals is through consumption of probiotic products, which beneficially affect\n      the development of microbial flora in the intestine, helping to improve the symptoms of\n      constipation. Among these foods, the market is a fresh cheese, plus Bifidobacterium lactis,\n      which according to its maker, when consumed as part of a healthy diet, presents beneficial\n      effects in improving symptoms of constipation.\n\n      Hypothesis: The fresh cheese enriched with Bifidobacterium lactis relieves symptoms\n      constipation."

To verify the effectiveness of\n      these new products on the market is one way to ensure that they have health benefits. Thus,\n      they may be indicated as a treatment for constipation, as part of a healthy lifestyle that\n      includes nutrition and physical activity practice. For this reason, this search is\n      justified.\n\n      Type Search:\n\n      The research is quantitative, exploratory and experimental. This is a clinical trial\n      randomized and controlled trial.\n\n      Population and study sample:\n\n      The study population comprised of individuals who will use the Unified Service Health\n      System, the Family Health Strategy,Brazil, participating groups of Nutritional Education.\n      This population is comprised of approximately seventy individuals, but this number is quite\n      relative, it depends on the participation. The approach of research subjects will be done\n      through an invitation, conducted orally through the Community Health Agents (CHA), during\n      home visits monthly. During the period of one month, the CHA invite to attend a lecture\n      given by the student Diane Favretto, who will speak constipation on the subject and propose\n      the participation of stake holders in the research. The stakeholders respond to a\n      questionnaire administered by the student and those who 24 showing symptoms of constipation\n      (according to Rome III criteria), will be part of study, and the sample.\n\n      Methodology:\n\n      For individuals in the population are classified as constipated, they will responding to a\n      structured questionnaire with closed questions based on criteria Rome III that characterizes\n      the symptoms of constipation. Will be considered constipated individual who has at least two\n      of six symptoms in the questionnaire, 25 at least 25% of the evacuation, in that alternative\n      corresponds to the questionnaire \"Often\".\n\n      Being able to participate in this study, a structured questionnaire, with open and closed\n      questions to assess the lifestyle (dietary habits, intake of net) associated diseases and\n      medications will be made to collect these data.\n\n      The weight of the participant will be measured using portable scale brand and the individual\n      is placed standing bare foot in the center of scale with light clothing, with arms out\n      stretched to the side, with out moving. To measure the height measuring tape will be set at\n      flat wall with no baseboard and individuals will be placed in an upright position, standing\n      with bare feet parallel and heels, shoulders and buttocks touching the wall. The Body Mass\n      Index is calculated from data on weight and height (kg / m\u00b2) and classified according to the\n      Organization World Health Organization.\n\n      Both data will be collected at the neighborhood community hall, where the meetings monthly\n      nutrition education groups are held. Agreeing to participate in the study, the group will\n      receive all necessary instructions and will sign the informed consent. Each participant\n      receives two copies of the word, anda copy shall be given to the student and a copy will be\n      with the participant. Individuals selected to participate in the study will be randomized\n      into two groups: treated group and control group. The treatment group will receive the fresh\n      cheese plus Bifidobacterium lactis Bi-07, with 108 colony forming units per serving. In the\n      placebo group, individuals will receive a fresh cheese, the same brand, with out the\n      addition of probiotics. The products will be packaged or numbered so that neither the\n      researcher nor the participants know what is cheese and what is probiotic cheese placebo.\n      The two groups will be oriented eating a slice of cheese per day (30 grams) for 30 days.\n      This cheese will part of the breakfast. Patients will be advised that, according to the\n      manufacturer's product, both cheeses not present any risk to health. Some patients may not\n      like the taste of cheese. That may be minimized by the use there of in food preparation\n      involving other,as sandwiches and salads, as long as the cheese is not heated, because this\n      way he loses probiotic your property. During this period, all participants will be\n      instructed to continue their normal dietary habits, physical activity and fluid intake. It\n      will also be directed to participants do not make use of other products containing\n      probiotics.\n\n      After the intervention period, the questionnaire on the symptoms of constipation is applied\n      again in order to determine whe ther there was a change in bowel habits."
