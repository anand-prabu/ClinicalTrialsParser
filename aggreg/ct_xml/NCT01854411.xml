      The purpose of this study is to determine whether ibuprofen and ketoprofen do not enter into
      mature breastmilk that could allowed breastfeeding during a long time

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Analgesics are frequently used to prevent and treat pain and inflammatory disease.

      Due to a lack of information on drug's human milk transfer, breastfeeding is sometimes
      contraindicated. Mothers are advised to either stop breastfeeding or if they don't, not to
      treat themselves. Since the fatal neonatal case with codeine during breastfeeding,
      analgesics are being reviewed. Ibuprofen seems to have the best benefit-risk ratio during
      the post-partum period. However there are no pharmacologic data about the use of ibuprofen
      during breastfeeding, after the colostrum phase.

      This study aims to determine the relative infant dose (RID) of ibuprofen in human mature
      milk. Considering the increased interest in NSAIDs in light of the codeine case, this is an
      important information. It will help health practitioners when advising and treating
      breastfeeding women.
