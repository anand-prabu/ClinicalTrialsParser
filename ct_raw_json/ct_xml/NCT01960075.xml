    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the trial is to determine the most effective and/or the least
      effective treatment of benzodiazepine-refractory status epilepticus ( established status
      epilepticus)  among patients older than 2 years.  There are three active treatment arms
      being compared: fosphenytoin (FOS), Levetiracetam (LEV) and Valproic acid (VPA).  Secondary
      objective is to measure the impact of the three drugs on secondary outcomes:  time to
      termination of clinical seizures, intubation or admission to ICU within 24 hrs. of
      enrollment, and mortality. Final objective is to determine the effectiveness, rate of
      adverse reactions of these drugs in children with established status epilepticus.

      The primary hypothesis is that the most effective ( or least effective) treatment can be
      identified.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any patient aged 2 or older who is witnessed to have clinically apparent recurrent or
             ongoing convulsive activity in the emergency department and has already received
             adequate dose of benzodiazepines in the past 5-30 minutes for a witnessed generalized
             tonic-clonic seizure. The seizure and its initial treatment may have occurred prior
             to arrival in the ED.

        4.1.2 Adequate doses of benzodiazepines for this study are determined to be: diazepam 10
        mg IV, lorazepam 4 mg IV or midazolam 10mg IV or IM for those above 40 Kg. For children
        between 10-40 Kg adequate doses are: diazepam 0.3 mg/kg IV, lorazepam 0.1 mg/kg IV and
        midazolam 0.3 mg/kg IV or IM.  These drugs may have been administered in two or more
        divided doses. A benzodiazepine given at home(such as rectal diazepam, buccal midazolam)
        will be included in defining &quot;adequate doses&quot; but it is recommended that another round of
        benzodiazepine be administered to the patient to qualify for the study unless this
        administration is considered unsafe. Although these doses are considered minimum adequate
        dose based on common clinical practice, it is recommended that the best practice is to
        administer 20 mg of diazepam or 8 mg lorazepam or 20 mg of midazolam in adults.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Table 2 Criterion Measure  Rationale

             propofol, etomidate, ketamine or another sedative with anticonvulsant properties
             (except benzodiazepines) after initial seizure 4) Intubation 5) Acute post traumatic
             seizures . 6) Known Metabolic disorder 7Liver Disease 8) Contraindication to
