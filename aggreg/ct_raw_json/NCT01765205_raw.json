These studies have shown that the occurrence of\n      critical congenital cardiac malformations among asymptomatic newborns is high; the technique\n      of pulse oximetry is reliable for detection of ductal dependant left-sided lesions, simple\n      to operate(requires little time and can be done in the newborn nursery) and is cost\n      effective; there is effective follow-up test (heart ultrasound) and available interventions\n      have an effect on outcome for diagnosed newborns.  The importance of this research project\n      is to examine the overall helpfulness of measuring oximetry in newborn infants using somatic\n      oximetry, as well ast to prepare for a population based study in the state of Florida."
