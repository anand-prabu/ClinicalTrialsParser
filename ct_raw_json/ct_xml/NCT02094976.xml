  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Increased intra-abdominal pressure(IAP) might influence on perioperative morbidity related
      to increased CVP, PVWP, SVR, PAP and decreased venous return and cardiac output. Prone
      position has been known to increase IAP. In clinical field, various apparatuses has
      developed to minimize IAP elevation during prone position operation.

      In this study, we would compare the changes of IAP and respiratory system compliance
      according to positional apparatus in prone position.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical field, Wison frame, chest rolls and Jackson table have been widely used for
      prone position surgery. Among those apparatus, Jackson table has padded supports under the
      chest and pelvis, so that the abdomen can hang freely and prevent the abdominal compression.
      By reducing abdominal and thoracic pressure, Jackson table would reduce blood loss, and less
      effects on pulmonary mechanics. But few studies has known to compare IAP with other
      positioning apparatus such as Wilson frame or chest roll.

    <description>After genearal anesthetic induction, arterial blood gas analyssis (ABGA)was done at supine position. And then the position was changed to prone. 5minutes after prone position change, ABGA repeated, and calculated the dead space ventilation at each point.
Dead space ventilation (Vd/Vt) = [PaCo2-PETCO2]/PaCo2
Finally, we would compare changes of dead space ventilation after position change.</description>
