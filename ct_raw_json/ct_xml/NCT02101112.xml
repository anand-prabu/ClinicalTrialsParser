  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the bioavailability of Apixaban crushed tablets
      suspended in water or mixed with applesauce is similar to the bioavailability of Apixaban
      whole tablets administered orally.

      Primary Purpose: Other: This study will investigate the bioavailability of Apixaban when
      administered as crushed tablets suspended in water and as crushed tablets mixed with
      applesauce compared to whole tablets. The results of this study may allow enhancement of the
      Apixaban label to include alternative methods of administration of Apixaban tablet; this may
      be of benefit to patients who have difficulty swallowing
