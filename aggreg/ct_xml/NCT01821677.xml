  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of ultra low dose danazol (Optina) for the treatment
      of diabetic macular edema versus placebo.  Optina has already been granted 505(b)2 status by
      the FDA and will incorporate all safety data from prior FDA approvals.  Additional safety
      data will be collected specifically for this low dosage.

      A portion of 505(b)2 drugs are approved based on a single clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female 18 years or older with Type 1 or 2 diabetes mellitus (defined as a
             self report of diabetes accompanied by treatment (insulin or diet) or a history of
             fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0mmo/l (126 mg/dl) or 2-hr plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmo/1
             (200 mg/dl)]

          -  Stable diabetic and metabolic control (no major changes in diabetic or lipid reducing
             medications for 3 months prior to start of this study as determined by the
             Investigator)

          -  Change in VA within previous 12 months reasonably believed to be associated with DME
             in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  BCVA in accordance with ETDRS letter score of ≥ 24 (e.g., 20/320 or better) and ≤ 78
             (e.g., 20/32 or worse)

          -  Definite retinal thickening ≥ 275 microns on spectral-domain OCT due to DME involving
             the center of the macula on clinical exam in the opinion of the Investigator

          -  Media clarity, pupillary dilation, and patient cooperation sufficient for adequate
             fundus photographs

          -  Assessment by the Investigator that focal photocoagulation can be deferred safely for
             16 weeks

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known allergy to any danazol (Cyclomen or Danocrine) or any other non-medicinal
             component of the danazol test drug (cornstarch, lactose, magnesium stearate, gelatin,
             and talc) (Note: Lactose intolerance is not a contraindication to ingesting the small
             amount of lactose contained in oral medications)

          -  History of systemic (e.g., oral intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous,
             intrauterine, epidural, bursal, or implanted) androgens, progesterone or
             corticosteroids (including topical ophthalmic corticosteroids preparations within 4
             months prior to randomization (topical non-ophthalmic corticosteroids are not
             excluded)

          -  Blood pressure &gt;160/90 mm Hg (in cases where either or both of the systolic or
             diastolic limits are exceeded, blood pressure can be re-measured after 10 minutes
             rest period for inclusion in the study)

          -  HbA1c greater than 11%

          -  Carcinoma of the breast

          -  Unstable cardiovascular disease or a history of significant heart disease (including
             unstable angina, acute coronary syndrome, myocardial infarction, or history of
             coronary revascularization procedure) within 6 months before randomization

          -  Macular edema considered to be due to a cause other than DME; e.g., cataract
             extraction, vitreo-retinal interface disease (a taut posterior hyaloid or epiretinal
             membrane)

          -  An ocular condition is present such that, in the opinion of the Investigator, VA
             would not improve from resolution of macular edema (e.g., foveal atrophy, closure of
             juxafoveal capillaries, dense subfoveal hard exudates)

          -  An ocular condition (other than diabetic retinopathy) that, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, might affect macular edema or alter VA during the course of the study,
             e.g. vein occlusion, uveitis or other ocular inflammatory disease, Irvine-Gass
             Syndrome, etc.

          -  History of treatment for DME at any time in the past 3 months (such as focal/grid
             macular photocoagulation, intravitreal or peribulbar corticosteroids, anti-vascular
             endothelial growth factor [VEGF drugs], or any other treatment

          -  History of panretinal scatter photocoagulation (PRP) within 4 months prior to
             randomization or anticipated need for PRP in the 6 months following randomization
