  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capecitabine is a drug that produces dermatologic toxicity frequently  (palmoplantar
      erythrodysesthesia, rash , alopecia , erythema , dryness, pruritus, hyperpigmentation ,
      rash, peeling , dermatitis , abnormal pigmentation, and less often blistering, skin ulcers ,
      photosensitivity reactions, swelling of the face and purple) . The impact in patients'
      quality of life is great, so We had decided to conduct a randomized clinical trial to
      evaluate the effectiveness Mary D' uol  balm preventing dermatologic toxicity in patient
      treated with capecitabine .

      Design: Randomized clinical trial phase II, in parallel and double-blind groups

      Target population : Patients with colon cancer stage II or III ( Dukes' C ) , who will
      initiate treatment with capecitabine monotherapy.

      Inclusion criteria: Over 18 years, II or III colon (Dukes' C) colon cancer,  primary
      diagnosis, capecitabine monotherapy, sign the informed consent.

      Primary endpoint: Dermatologic toxicity (yes / no) Statistical analysis: The primary
      endpoint (percentage of patients that develop dermalogic toxocity in both groups) will be
      analyzed  by a logistics regression model
