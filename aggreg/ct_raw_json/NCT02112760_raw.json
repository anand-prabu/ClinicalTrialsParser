Specific aim 1:Identify factors that influence muscle performance by use of ultrasound\n           imaging.\n\n           Hypothesis: Gender, age, and BMI affect the muscle performance of deep trunk muscles.\n\n        2. Specific aim 2. To compare the performance of trunk deep muscles (transversus abdominis\n           and multifidus) and the sensation and pain thresholds of patients with recurrent low\n           back pain with asymptomatic subjects.\n\n           Hypothesis: patients with recurrent low back pain have:\n\n           (A) less activation of the transversus abdominis and multifidus, (B) peripheral and\n           central sensitization, with decreased sensation and pain thresholds in the lumbar and\n           foot areas.\n\n        3. Specific aim 3. To determine the performance of the transversus abdominis and\n           multifidus, and the sensation and pain thresholds by use of ultrasound feedback\n           training in asymptomatic adults, and to compare these results with the traditional\n           training protocols for trunk stabilization.\n\n           Hypothesis: Specific stabilization exercise using ultrasound feedback training is more\n           effective in activating deep trunk muscles and increasing sensation and pain thresholds\n           than the traditional stabilization training protocol in asymptomatic adults.\n\n        4. Specific aim 4. To determine the performance of the transversus abdominis and\n           multifidus, and the sensation and pain thresholds by using the ultrasound feedback\n           training in adults with low back pain, and to compare these results with the\n           traditional training protocols for trunk stabilization.\n\n      Hypothesis: Specific stabilization exercise using ultrasound feedback training is more\n      effective in activating deep trunk muscles and increasing sensation and pain thresholds than\n      the traditional stabilization training protocol in adults with low back pain."
