Determine the dose-limiting\n      toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Assess any\n      responses in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive intravesical\n      gemcitabine that is left in the bladder for 2 hours and then removed on day 1. Treatment\n      continues every 7 days for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intravesical gemcitabine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
