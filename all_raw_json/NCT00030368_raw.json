Determine the maximum tolerated dose of bortezomib when given in combination with\n      paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of bortezomib.\n\n      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 2 and 9 and paclitaxel IV over 1 hour on days 1 and\n      8. For the first course only, patients do not receive paclitaxel on day 1. Courses repeat\n      every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity or greater than 80% 20S proteasome\n      inhibition. Once the MTD is determined, an additional 6-9 patients are accrued and treated\n      at that dose.\n\n      Patients are followed at 21 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45 patients will be accrued for this study."
