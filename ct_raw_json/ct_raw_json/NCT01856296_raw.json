Because patients will be enrolled in the study while they are still on treatment (before progression), we expect that PFS for the previous treatment is fully observed. If patients withdrew from the treatment due to treatment related toxicity and lost to follow-up, it is considered that the PFS endpoint is reached. If patients are lost to follow up due to other reasons, PFS is censored at the time of last follow up.",
