            "textblock": "'Neglect' is a common neurological syndrome that affects approximately 50% of\n      right-hemisphere stroke patients.  It is a complex multi-faceted syndrome, but its core\n      defining feature is that patients lose the capacity to voluntarily control attention in the\n      left half of space. Neglect has a significant debilitating effect on patients' functional\n      independence and everyday life and indicates a poor prognosis for long-term functional\n      recovery.\n\n      To date, there is no effective rehabilitation intervention available for routine clinical\n      use. One of the most promising experimental strategies for neglect rehabilitation is prism\n      adaptation, a form of motor training that induces short-lived improvements in a variety of\n      cognitive domains. However, its major limitation is that the benefits are transient. The\n      investigators aim to test the hypothesis that by combining prism therapy with transcranial\n      direct current stimulation (tDCS), this will boost learning/memory processes, resulting in\n      larger and longer-lasting therapeutic effects.\n\n      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled clinical trial to test the efficacy\n      of multi-session prism therapy combined with real versus sham tDCS for the rehabilitation of\n      chronic post-stroke neglect. Baseline neuroimaging data will be used as predictor variables\n      to explain inter-individual variation in therapeutic response. Contrasts between pre- and\n      post-intervention imaging data will be performed to identify neural structures that mediate\n      therapeutic effects."
