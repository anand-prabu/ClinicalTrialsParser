      This study aims to evaluate off-label XGEVA use in Denmark using data linked from registries
      and other sources in Northern Jutland Region of Denmark. This will allow for accurate
      assessment of prescriptions and diagnoses, especially those related to cancer patients
      during the first year post the initial market availability of XGEVA.
