    <textblock>
      This cohort study is the sequential expansion of the comparative effectiveness study of oral
      anticoagulants and plans to identify initiators of oral anticoagulants using electronic
      claims data from a commercial insurance database to quantify associations between
      anticoagulant choice (warfarin and dabigatran) and the occurrence of selected outcomes in
      patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation at risk for stroke.
