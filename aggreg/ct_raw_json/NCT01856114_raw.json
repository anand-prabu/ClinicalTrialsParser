Researchers also want to learn if the study drug\n      can help to improve your physical function.  In this study, fentanyl will be compared to a\n      placebo.\n\n      Fentanyl is commonly used for treatment of cancer pain.\n\n      A placebo is not a drug.  It looks like the study drug but is not designed to treat any\n      disease or illness.  It is designed to be compared with a study drug to learn if the study\n      drug has any real effect."

You will have an equal\n      chance of being assigned to either group.  Neither you nor the study staff will know if you\n      are receiving the study drug or the placebo.  However, if needed for your safety, the study\n      staff will be able to find out what you are receiving.\n\n      Study Visit:\n\n      During your study visit, the study staff will collect information from your medical record\n      about your age, sex, race, disease type, how well you are able to perform the normal\n      activities of daily living, any drugs you are taking, and possible causes of shortness of\n      breath.\n\n      You will complete 2 questionnaires.  One (1) of them will have questions about any breathing\n      symptoms you may be having, and the other asks about any other symptoms you may be having.\n      It should take about 10 minutes to complete these questionnaires.\n\n      The study staff will then record your vital signs (heart rate, breathing rate, and the level\n      of air breathed out using a measuring device that will be clipped onto your finger).  You\n      will also be asked how hard it is to catch your breath and to rate your level of tiredness.\n\n      You will then walk back and forth in an indoor corridor for up to 6 minutes.  This is called\n      a walk test.  You may slow down, stop, and rest at any time you need to.\n\n      After that, you will sit down and rest for up to 1 hour.  During this time, the study\n      drug/placebo will be prepared and you may be asked several times how hard it is to catch\n      your breath.\n\n      You will then be given a study drug/placebo tablet to put it in between your upper gum and\n      cheek.  You will then wait for another 30 minutes, be asked about any side effects you may\n      be having, and repeat the walking test.  Then the study staff will ask you again about any\n      side effects you may be having, your level of tiredness, and how hard it is to catch your\n      breath.  Your vital signs will also be measured.\n\n      During each walk test, you will be asked 6 times how hard it is to catch your breath.  How\n      often you stopped and for how long will be recorded.  The total distance you walked will\n      also be recorded.\n\n      After each walk test, you will also be asked to complete 4 tests of your mental abilities,\n      including finger tapping, simple mathematics questions (addition, subtraction,\n      multiplication, division), recall of numbers, and recall of objects.  It should take 15\n      minutes to complete these tests.\n\n      At the end of the study visit, you will fill out 1 questionnaire that asks if you think the\n      study drug/placebo is helping you, how satisfied you are with the study, and which treatment\n      you think you received.  It should take about 5 minutes to complete the questionnaire.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your active participation in this study is over after you complete the last questionnaire.\n      You will be taken off study if intolerable side effects occur or if you are unable to follow\n      study directions.\n\n      Follow-Up:\n\n      Thirty (30) days after your study visit you will be called by the study staff and asked how\n      you are feeling and about any side effects you may be having.  This call should last about\n      10 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Fentanyl is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of pain.  Its use to control shortness of breath is investigational.\n\n      Up to 20 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
