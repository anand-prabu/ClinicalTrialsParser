  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading and still increasing cause of
      disease and death worldwide, affecting those in both developed and developing countries.
      This imparts a massive burden of ill health, in turn imposing huge healthcare costs to
      society.

      For effective treatment of COPD (as opposed to providing short term relief) early disease
      must be targeted. The small airways of the lung (those less than 2mm) are the first affected
      in COPD, but current methods to assess their function are relatively insensitive. There is
      therefore a need for new, accurate methods for detection of small airway dysfunction with
      sensitivity to shortterm change and regional discrimination.

      In previous studies with hyperpolarised (HP) 3He MRI in smokers with normal pirometry and
      patients with early stage COPD, we showed sensitivity to early changes in lung ventilation
      and structure. The hyperpolarised gas MRI technique is safe. In particular, the lack of
      ionizing radiation permits patients to be imaged on multiple occasions. This and its
      inherent sensitivity to regional lung ventilation and function make it an ideal imaging tool
      for the assessment of novel lung therapies for diseases of the small airways.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine short and long term reproducibility of a
      comprehensive set of functional imaging data; using hyperpolarised gas MRI, conventional MRI
      and lung physiology measurements in patients with moderate to severe COPD.

      In addition,how sensitive the imaging techniques are to changes in lung function after
      treatment with a standard (bronchodilator) inhaler will also be assessed.

      This pilot study will serve as a platform for future larger scale studies, aimed at better
      understanding of and intervention in early COPD.

        Patients will be recruited from COPD clinics in Sheffield, the surrounding area and the
        nurse-led clinics running alongside them, by open advertisement, after pulmonary
        rehabilitation, and via invitation by their local GP. The target is to recruit 6 subjects
        within 4 months.

             to initiation of study related procedures.

          -  Current or exsmokers who have a smoking history of at least 10 pack years. (Ten pack
             years are defined as 20 cigarettes a day for 10 years, or 10 cigarettes a day for 20
             years etc.)

             predicted, according to GOLD (Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease)
