Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology assessment will\n           result in adequate diagnostic concordance.\n\n        2. Compared to in-person assessment, store-and-forward teledermatology results in adequate\n           management concordance.\n\n        3. The sensitivity and specificity of store-and-forward evaluation to detecting lesions\n           that are either premalignant or malignant will be similar to that of in-person\n           evaluation."
