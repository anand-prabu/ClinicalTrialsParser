      The purpose of this research study is to test the use of new Magnetic Resonance Imaging
      (MRI) coils. An MRI takes pictures of body parts using a large magnet and a computer. A coil
      is the part of the MRI system that collects data to make the MR images.   The investigators
      have designed, developed, and built two child-sized coils to use when imaging elbows,
      wrists, knees, and ankles.  These new coils will be better suited to fit infants through
      teenagers rather than the conventional coils used which were created for adults These MRI
      coils have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and are considered
      investigational devices.

    <textblock>
      The safety and the clinical efficacy/equivalence of two pediatric 1.5T coils will be
      evaluated/demonstrated in two phases.  Patient safety and image quality will be
      evaluated/demonstrated in Phase One by collecting images on healthy participants using a
      combination of the existing commercially available coils and the new coils.  Clinical
      efficacy/equivalence will be evaluated/demonstrated in Phase Two by collecting standard MRI
      exams in pediatric patients. In Phase Two, the imaging data for a given patient will be
      collected by one of the two following scenarios : 1)  the clinically ordered exams will be
      completed using a combination of the existing commercially available coils and new coil,
      with the images from each directly compared, or 2) the clinically ordered scans will be
      collected using one of the new coils and the images compared to historical de-identified  MR
      exam, age and gender matched patient data (which were acquired using the existing
      commercially available coils). Results of Phase One will be reported to the IRB.  Phase Two
      will not begin until the IRB has reviewed the results of Phase One and approved the
      commencement of Phase Two.
