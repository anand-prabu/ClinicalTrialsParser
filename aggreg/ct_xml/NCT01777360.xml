      To determine, from patients presenting severe asthma and an increase in bronchial smooth
      muscle mass, those who would be the best candidates for bronchial THERMOPLASTY. THERMOPLASTY
      should improve control of the asthma, reduce day-to-day symptoms and severe exacerbations,
      and improve respiratory function

      Bicentric prospective study, evaluating bronchial THERMOPLASTY in patients with severe
      uncontrolled asthma and significant bronchial smooth muscle mass. Primary Objective is to
      determine patients who would be the best candidates for bronchial THERMOPLASTY which should
      improve control of the asthma, reduce day-to-day symptoms and severe exacerbations, and
      improve respiratory function. Primary Endpoint will be the reduction in smooth muscle
      surface area, objectified on bronchial biopsies before and after THERMOPLASTY in patients
      presenting severe asthma and secondary criteria are:
      
      
               - number of severe exacerbations (with oral corticosteroids, emergency room visits,
      hospitalizations)

        -  time until the first exacerbation

        -  respiratory function

        -  control of the asthma (ACQ - Asthma Control Questionnaire)

        -  quality of life (AQLQ - Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire)

        -  fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO)

        -  measurement of the thickness of the bronchial wall using tomodensitometry (scan).
           
                                                                  The inclusion of period of 28
           months is limited to a maximum of 80 subjects. The actual number will be determined
           using the two-stage stop method. An intermediate analysis will be carried out following
           the evaluation and statistical analysis of the 40 patients.

        -  If the primary endpoint p-value is &lt;0.0294, success will be declared and the inclusions
           will cease.

        -  If the p-value is &gt;0.0294, additional patients will be recruited up to a total of 80
           patients included and assessed.
                                                                At inclusion, sociodemographic
           data will be collected, number of exacerbations per year, date of fibroscopy, data on
           asthma control (ACQ), data on quality of life (AQLQ), respiratory function (EFR),
           fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), thickness of the bronchial wall evaluated
           using scanner and surface area of smooth muscle in the bronchial sub-mucous layer will
           be evaluated.   At 3 months post-THERMOPLASTY, same data will be collected. One year
           after THERMOPLASTY, number of exacerbations, data on asthma control (ACQ),and quality
           of life (AQLQ), respiratory function (EFR), fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO),
           thickness of the bronchial wall and possible complications will be collected.
