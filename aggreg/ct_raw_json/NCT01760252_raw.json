            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      This is a phase II study evaluating the treatment adherence rate, efficacy and safety of\n      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with capecitabine, oxaliplatin and irinotecan (CAPOXIRI) in\n      patients with resectable (able to be cut out), borderline resectable and locally advanced\n      pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Neoadjuvant CAPOXIRI chemotherapy is an innovative strategy that\n      builds on the advancement associated with oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil, and\n      folinate (FOLFIRINOX regimen) chemotherapy in patients with metastatic disease. Building on\n      the FOLFIRINOX regimen the use of CAPOXIRI is among the most clinically relevant projects\n      for patients diagnosed with earlier stage pancreatic adenocarcinoma with the goal of\n      improving patient outcomes and advancing our knowledge and understanding of this devastating\n      disease.\n\n      The primary end point is the treatment adherence rate (TAR) which is the percentage of\n      patients who complete 75% of the planned treatment (dose) for their diagnostic strata\n      (resectable disease and borderline resectable/locally advanced disease).\n\n      Secondary end points are: Overall survival (OS), Disease-free survival (DFS; for those\n      patients who are rendered disease-free by surgical resection), Progression Free Survival\n      (PFS), Response Rate (RR), toxicity, and R0 resection rate (for patients stratified as\n      having resectable disease and borderline resectable disease).\n\n      Background and Study Rationale:\n\n      It is estimated that 36,800 people will die of pancreatic cancer in the United States in\n      2010. Surgical resection offers the only chance of cure, but only 15-20% of cases are\n      potentially resectable at present.  Furthermore, prognosis is poor, even for those\n      undergoing complete resection. Reported five-year survival rates following\n      pancreatic-duodenectomy (surgery of the small intestine and pancreas) for node-negative\n      disease is 25-30% and for node-positive disease is 10%.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of the combination of capecitabine,\n      oxaliplatin, and irinotecan (CAPOXIRI) on the disease.  This research is being done because\n      we think that this combination, CAPOXIRI, may be better than other combinations used to\n      treat your stage of pancreatic cancer.\n\n      A research study like this one has been done which shows that a similar combination of drugs\n      including oxaliplatin, irinotecan and 5-fluorouracil (which is in the same class as\n      capecitabine) can be effective in treating patients with pancreatic cancer who have more\n      advanced disease than you.  All of the drugs that are being used in this study have been\n      approved by the FDA (Food and Drug Administration)."
