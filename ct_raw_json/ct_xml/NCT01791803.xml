  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking-related cardiopulmonary diseases account for a large number of hospital admissions.
      We investigated the efficacy of hypnotherapy as an aid to a counseling-based smoking
      cessation program in improving quit rates of hospitalized smoking patients at 12 and 26
      weeks after hospital discharge. We compared outcomes with hospitalized patients who received
      more conventional therapy, namely nicotine replacement therapy, or patients who decided to
      quit on their own. We also compared smoking cessation rates at 12 and 26 weeks after
      hospitalization among patients admitted with a cardiac or pulmonary diagnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized patients with a cardiopulmonary diagnosis who were contemplating quitting were
      recruited into 4 groups: Hypnotherapy, Nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), both hypnotherapy
      and NRT, and self-quit group. all patients received self-help brochures and in-hospital
      counseling. Intervention groups received more extensive counseling, free NRT supply for a
      month and/or a 90 minute hypnotherapy session within 2 weeks of discharge. They also had
      follow up telephone counseling at 1,2,4,8 and 12 weeks after discharge.
