  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      No serum biomarker has qualified for clinical use until now. However several biomarkers,
      especially markers of inflammatory or proteolytic activity seem to promising in the
      identification of vulnerable plaques. Moreover, recent study confirmed that
      contrast-enhanced ultrasound imaging(CEUS) can visualize intraplaque neovascularization and
      represent the plaque vulnerability. In this study we try to identify indicators through
      analysis of the relationship between plaque neovascularization seen by CEUS and well known
      biomarkers such as serum matrix metalloproteinase(MMP)-2, MMP-9, cathepsin family(L,S,V),
      cystatin C, lipoprotein phospholipase A2, and hs-crp
