These\n      questionnaires aim to assess the impact of an iPro2 evaluation on the physicians\n      understanding of their patient's metabolic fluctuations and its support of therapeutic\n      interventions. They will also investigate the subjects understanding (both pre & post iPro2\n      evaluation) of the concept of glycemic variability and the importance of compliance to HCP\n      recommendations."
