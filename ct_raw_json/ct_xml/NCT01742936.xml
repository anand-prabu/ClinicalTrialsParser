      The current study proposes to investigate Point of Care Testing (POCT) (Coagcheck®) and
      compare obtained results versus standard laboratory coagulation parameters prothrombin time
      (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The time difference in obtaining the two results
      will also be examined. A total of 100 pediatric patients undergoing spinal surgery will be
      enrolled and consented per protocol. Blood samples will be obtained simultaneously tested on
      both the standard laboratory apparatus and the Coagcheck® device. If the two results are
      comparable, this could have immediate clinical application and impact in the operating room
      as POCT results are available within 2-3 minutes compared to 1-2 hours for standard
      laboratory samples.
