In-vitro results showed a\n      promising recovery of Bifidobacteria combined with an increase of Short Chain Fatty Acids\n      (SCFA) upon Galacto-oligosaccharides (GOS) supplementation to amoxicillin-treated\n      microbiota. As the microbiota is nowadays considered as a key factor in human health, a\n      further understanding of the gut microbiota functioning in-vivo is essential. This\n      understanding of the use of specific prebiotics may possibly be beneficial in the prevention\n      or recovery of antibiotic-disturbed microbiota. As the effects of GOS supplementation on the\n      microbiota composition and activity from healthy adults receiving amoxicillin have never\n      been tested in-vivo, the investigators propose the current study as a proof of principle.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      To explore whether the promising effects of GOS supplementation on the composition and\n      activity of gut microbiota from healthy adults as found by in-vitro, can also be observed\n      in-vivo.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      10 healthy men and women volunteers, 18 - 40 yr old"
