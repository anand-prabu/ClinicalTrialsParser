The accuracy of the signal is dependent on the\n      degree of vascular unloading, which takes an period before optimal unloading is reached. The\n      evolution of the degree of inaccuracy caused by inclomplete unloading is quantified, and the\n      absolute and relative inaccuracy of the nexfin as a function of the time is determined\n      compared to the invasive blood pressure (IBP).\n\n      Secondly, the accuracy of the Nexfin to predict the IBP is compared with the accuracy of\n      noninvasive blood pressure to predict the IBP."
