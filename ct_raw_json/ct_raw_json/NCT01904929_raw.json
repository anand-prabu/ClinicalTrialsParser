The psycho-metric properties of the 400m walk\n      test at a self-selected speed will be evaluated. Such tests, made at a self-selected\n      (\"comfortable\", \"free\") speed particularly assess the endurance capacities. The results of\n      the physiological measurements during the tests will be compared with those of TM6min of\n      Test of Fast Walking of 200m (TMR200m) and a maximal treadmill exercise. Stable coronary\n      patients, aged over 55 years old, will be included.\n\n      This study should permit a simplification and a better understanding of the clinical-use of\n      walk tests. In the future, two kinds of tests might be proposed with different distances, 1-\n      200m-fast-walking-test aimed to evaluate the performance closed to the maximum capacity, 2-\n      self-selected-walk-test on a doubled distance (400m) aimed to evaluate the aerobic\n      capacities of the adaptation of the body in response to effort."
