Highly effective\n             contraception is defined as either:\n\n               1. Total abstinence: When this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of\n                  the patient. [Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,\n                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of\n                  contraception].\n\n               2. Sterilization: have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without\n                  hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking study\n                  treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of\n                  the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment.\n\n               3. Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation of\n                  the absence of sperm in the ejaculate). [For female study patients, the\n                  vasectomised male partner should be the sole partner for that patient].\n\n               4. Use of a combination of any two of the following (1+2 or 1+3 or 2+3):\n\n                    1. Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception.\n\n                    2. Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS).\n\n                    3. Barrier methods of contraception: Condom or Occlusive cap (diaphragm or\n                       cervical/vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal\n                       suppository.\n\n        In case of use of oral contraception women should have been stable on the same pill for a\n        minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment.\n\n          -  Liver disease or liver injury as indicated by abnormal liver function tests such as\n             SGOT (AST), SGPT (ALT), \u03b3-GT.\n\n          -  Hemoglobin of \u2264 9 g/dL in male, and \u2264 8 g/dL in female patients.
