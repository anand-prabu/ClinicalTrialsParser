            "textblock": "Chronic Rhinosinusitis (CRS) is a common inflammatory condition of the upper respiratory\n      tract lasting more than 8 to 12 weeks.  Major symptoms include facial congestion/fullness,\n      facial pain/pressure, nasal obstruction/blockage, purulent nasal drainage, and reduction or\n      loss of smell.  The diagnosis must include two major symptoms and either endoscopic evidence\n      of polyps, edema or mucopurulent discharge from the middle meatus and/or CT changes in the\n      mucosa of sinuses or ostiomeatal complexes.\n\n      CRS has an estimated prevalence of 5% in the Canadian population, and up to 16% in some\n      adult populations in the United States.  Sinusitis is associated with a major societal\n      health care burden, costing billions of dollars a year in North America. The medical\n      treatment of CRS includes topical saline and corticosteroid sprays, systemic steroids and\n      antimicrobials.  Specifically, sinonasal saline irrigation is a safe, nonpharmacologic\n      treatment, and an important and efficacious component in the management of CRS.  Sinonasal\n      saline irrigation can vary by concentration (e.g. hypertonic, isotonic, hypotonic), pressure\n      (e.g. passive or active), and volume (e.g. high and low).\n\n      A recent evidence-based review by Rudmik et al. recommended sinonasal saline irrigation in\n      the early postoperative period following endoscopic sinus surgery. Although 'daily'\n      sinonasal saline irrigations are recommended, the ideal frequency is unknown since there\n      have been no studies evaluating this topic.\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized, single blind study evaluating the subjective and\n      objective outcomes of different sinonasal saline irrigation frequencies in patients who\n      receive ESS for medically refractory CRS.  Both disease-specific quality of life (QoL) and\n      endoscopy scores will be measured at 1 week, 3 weeks, and 2 months postoperatively.  The\n      expected total number of patients to be enrolled in this study is approximately 75 (25 per\n      arm), with a planned completion time of two years."
