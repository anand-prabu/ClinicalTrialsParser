Nausea and vomiting are some of the more common of these\n      complications.  Several medications can be used for prevention of these specific\n      complications, but treatment remains more cost-efficient.\n\n      Haloperidol is anti-psychotic which, at low doses, can prevent the occurrence of nausea and\n      vomiting. Its usefulness for prophylaxis has been demonstrated in several studies. However,\n      its use for treating established postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) has not been\n      properly studied.\n\n      In a prospective randomized clinical trial involving adult patients undergoing elective\n      surgery under general anesthesia, investigators will enroll 120 patients, and compare the\n      effect of a dose of 1 mg Haloperidol  versus Ondansetron 4 mg and document the varying\n      degrees of success in treating nausea and vomiting as well as possible side effects.\n\n      Investigators expect to observe that Haloperidol is as effective as treatment with\n      Ondansetron."
