Eligible men will have\n      recurrent PSA-only prostate cancer within 4 years of prostatectomy, and a PSA of 0.2 - 4 in\n      the absence of metastatic disease on CT and bone scans. In addition to standard ADT and\n      radiation therapy, research participants will take enzalutamide once daily for six months.\n      It is primarily hypothesized the 2 year PFS rate will be improved with the combined therapy\n      compared to the historical control data in a similar patients setting."

This\n             requires 2 consecutive rises in PSA, at least 1 week apart, over the\n             post-prostatectomy nadir or one PSA value above 0.20 ng/mL if the patient failed to\n             achieve a post-prostatectomy nadir of < 0.2 ng/mL.\n\n          -  Age \u2265 18 years\n\n          -  Karnofsky performance status \u2265 70\n\n          -  Adequate laboratory parameters\n\n          -  Adequate bone marrow function:  ANC \u22651.5 x 109/L, Platelets \u2265100 x 109/L, Hb >9g/dL\n\n          -  AST/SGOT and ALT/SGPT \u2264 2.5 x Institutional Upper Limit of Normal (ULN)\n\n          -  Serum bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x Institutional ULN\n\n          -  Serum creatinine \u2264 1.5 x Institutional ULN or 24-hour clearance \u2265 50 mL/min\n\n          -  A minimum of 4 weeks from any major surgery prior to registration.\n\n          -  Ability to swallow, retain, and absorb oral medication.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n             document.\n\n          -  Must use a condom if having sex with a pregnant woman.\n\n          -  Male patient and his female partner who is of childbearing potential must use 2\n             acceptable methods of birth control (one of which must include a condom as a barrier\n             method of contraception) starting at screening and continuing throughout the study\n             period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.
