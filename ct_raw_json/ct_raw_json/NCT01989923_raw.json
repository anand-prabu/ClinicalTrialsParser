Women choosing NRT will receive a 6-week intervention of a daily nicotine patch\n      plus either nicotine gum or lozenges to use (as needed) throughout the day.  The ENDS group\n      will receive an electronic cigarette device with refills to last the 6-week duration of the\n      study. Both groups will receive identical tobacco cessation counseling.  As part of the\n      study, each subject will complete a survey conducted at baseline, 6-weeks into the study\n      during intervention, and upon completion of a 6 week follow-up period in which participants\n      receive no intervention.  At the 12-week measurement period we will add a qualitative\n      interview that will allow us to ask the women whether the methods were acceptable, caused\n      any problems, and if so, what the problems entailed."
