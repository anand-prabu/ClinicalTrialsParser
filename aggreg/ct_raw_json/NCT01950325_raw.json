This is a dose-escalation\n      study to examine safety, tolerability, dose and pharmacokinetics of VRC01. The hypothesis is\n      that VRC01 will be safe for administration to HIV-1 infected adults by the intravenous (IV)\n      and subcutaneous (SC) routes and will not elicit hypersensitivity reactions. Samples will be\n      collected to learn if VRC01 is detectable in mucosal secretions and blood of participants\n      and how long VRC01 can be detected in the blood after it is given.\n\n      Between 15 and 25 HIV-1 infected adults, ages 18-50 years will be enrolled. There are 4 dose\n      escalation groups for IV administration; the doses are 1 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg and 40\n      mg/kg. There is 1 group for SC administration at 5 mg/kg. Each group is expected to include\n      at least 3 participants. Each participant will receive two infusions of VRC01 with about 1\n      month between doses. Infusions are administered in an inpatient unit and an overnight stay\n      at the NIH Clinical Center is required. No more than one subject per day per group will\n      receive a first infusion of the VRC01 product by the IV route and no more than one subject\n      per week will receive a first infusion of the product by the SC route. Study participation\n      lasts for 24 weeks. Participant health and effect on CD4 count and HIV viral load will be\n      monitored. Samples will be collected and stored for research purposes."
