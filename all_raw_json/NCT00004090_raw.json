Determine the toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of gemcitabine and\n      cisplatin in patients with metastatic or recurrent nonhematologic malignancies.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients receive gemcitabine IV on\n      days 1 and 8, followed immediately by cisplatin IV over 2 hours on day 8. Courses repeat\n      every 3 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which\n      at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed every 3\n      months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
