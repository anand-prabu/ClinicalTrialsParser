  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malnutrition priori a major abdominal surgery is frequent and increases morbidity and
      mortality. The management of malnutrition has an impact in reducing postoperative
      complications. However malnutrition is rarely detected and Guidelines infrequently followed.

      Recovery time and nutritional evaluation in elderly patients are major criteria in their
      postoperative management. Identifying malnutrition or malnutrition risk is fundamental to
      its treatment. It is therefore unsurprising that many validated tools for nutrition risk
      screening and nutrition assessment exist for the clinician to use in assisting with the
      accurate identification, referral and treatment of patients who are malnourished or at risk
      of malnutrition.

      And nutritional management must be adapted and based on this evaluation and evolution of the
      general status (Guidelines Grade A).

      A geriatric evaluation based on a screening of preoperative malnutrition should allow a
      better implementation of the European Society of Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition (ESPEN)
      guidelines.
