            "textblock": "Adolescent risk behaviours, such as violence and substance use, are prevalent public health\n      concerns in Canada. Further, these behaviours often co-occur, and are associated with poor\n      mental health. However, the majority of prevention programs focus on preventing single\n      issues and do not consider mental health, and also neglect the importance of relationships\n      when promoting positive youth development. To address this gap, the Centre for Addiction and\n      Mental Health (CAMH) Centre for Prevention Science designed the Fourth R Healthy\n      Relationships Plus Program, a small group program focused on the promotion of positive\n      mental health and the reduction of violence and substance use, via the development of\n      improved communication, interpersonal and help-seeking skills. The purpose of this study is\n      to evaluate the Fourth R Healthy Relationships Plus program using both outcome (randomized\n      controlled trial design with follow-up at pre-test, post-test, and 4, 8 and 12 months) and\n      process evaluation tools.\n\n      The primary study hypothesis is that participation in the Fourth R Healthy Relationships\n      Plus program will be associated with positive growth in treatment participants'\n      psychological well-being from pre-test to 12-month follow-up, as compared to control\n      participants. In secondary analyses, the study will explore if treatment participants report\n      less substance use, peer violence, bullying and dating violence at 12-month follow-up than\n      control participants. Since certain person-level (e.g., sex, personality, executive\n      functioning) and program-level (e.g., implementation quality) variables may moderate\n      treatment-outcome relationships, these associations will also be explored. The final\n      hypothesis is that treatment participants will report better attitudes, knowledge and\n      assertive communication at post-test compared to control participants, and that these\n      improvements will mediate the association between program participation and 12-month\n      outcomes."
