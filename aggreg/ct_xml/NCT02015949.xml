    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the most common cause of death and disability in young
      adults. Patients can experience significant problems with concentration, attention, and
      memory (so called 'cognitive impairments') following TBI. These cognitive impairments can
      drastically impact on a patient's well-being, and can lead to significant economic and
      social consequences. Roughly a quarter of TBI patients improve but an equal number
      deteriorate over time. The investigators know little about why patients vary so much in how
      they recover. Crucially, the investigators have no treatments to improve brain functioning
      or recovery after TBI.

      Trials investigating ways of protecting the brain just after injury have been disappointing.
      An alternative strategy, however, is to improve the function of brain regions that remain
      intact, but that function inefficiently after TBI. The investigators know that dopamine (a
      chemical in the brain) is known to influence many brain functions and the investigators know
      that pathways in the brain that use dopamine are affected by TBI.

      In humans, drugs that increase dopamine in the brain, such as methylphenidate, are sometimes
      used to enhance cognitive function after TBI, but the response to treatment can be highly
      variable between patients. Therefore, what is needed in the clinic is a way to target the
      use of these drugs to patients who are likely to respond.

      In a single centre study, the investigators will use SPECT (Single Photon Emission
      Tomography) imaging to measure dopamine levels in the brain. MRI (Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging) scans will assess brain structure and function. The investigators will test whether
      treatment with methylphenidate improves cognitive functions in TBI patients who have ongoing
      cognitive problems, whether the mechanism involves a normalisation of brain functioning and
      whether brain dopamine levels can predict the magnitude of any improvement in symptoms.
