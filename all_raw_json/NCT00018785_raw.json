Successful solid organ transplantation in the absence of chronic\n      immunosuppressive therapy (specific acquired immunological tolerance) is a desirable\n      therapeutic option.  This project extends recent observations supporting the use of\n      concommitant donor bone marrow cell infusion as a means of modulating the immune response in\n      kidney transplantation, thereby allowing a substantial decrease or withdrawal of potentially\n      toxic immunosuppressive drugs."
