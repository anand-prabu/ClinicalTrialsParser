To estimate the response rate and toxicity to low-dose IL-2 with intermediate-\"pulse\"\n      dose interleukin 2 (IL-2) and trastuzumab in patients with uni-dimensional measurable\n      metastatic breast cancer and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive (3+\n      overexpression by immunohistochemistry [IHC] method or positive by fluorescent in situ\n      hybridization [FISH]) who either have had evidence of progressive disease while receiving a\n      trastuzumab-containing regimen, or have had progressive disease within 12 months of\n      receiving a trastuzumab-containing regimen.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To perform correlative immunologic assays to determine the degree of natural killer (NK)\n      cell expansion in response to low-dose IL-2, and the effectiveness of patients' peripheral\n      blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in a standard antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity\n      (ADCC) assay directed against a HER2 target cell.\n\n      II. To determine the pharmacokinetics of trastuzumab using an every 2-week schedule.\n\n      III. To determine Fc-gamma receptor polymorphisms from study patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1 and 8 and\n      aldesleukin subcutaneously (SC) on days 2-7 and 9-21. Beginning on day 22, patients receive\n      trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes every 14 days. Patients also receive aldesleukin SC daily on\n      days 1-14. Treatment continues for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for at least 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 17-37 patients will be accrued for this study."
