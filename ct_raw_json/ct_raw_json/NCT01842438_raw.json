Our previous\n      research shows that couples are not often supported to cope with the effects of surgery on\n      their sexual relationships. In this study, the investigators will design a way of supporting\n      couples, and test how well it works.\n\n      The investigators will decide what the support should include (e.g. duration, frequency and\n      timing of the support). The investigators will do this by looking at available literature on\n      the subject.\n\n      The investigators will recruit 68 couples to the study, half will receive standard care and\n      the other half will be invited to attend six sessions of psychosexual support with specially\n      trained professionals (trained by men affected by prostate conditions and a cancer/couple\n      support specialist). Before and after the support, men and their partners will be asked to\n      complete questionnaires which measure quality-of-life, emotional needs, and their\n      relationship. The investigators will ask the couples to fill out the questionnaires again\n      six-months later to see if the support has long-term benefits. At the end of the study the\n      investigators will also interview 10 couples to find out their views of the support, and\n      another 10 couples about standard treatment.\n\n      When the investigators have tested this support, they expect to see men and their partners\n      tell us that their quality of life has improved, and they have higher satisfaction with\n      their relationship. The investigators will calculate the overall cost of providing this\n      support, and the benefits it has on reducing the need for other health-care services (like\n      GP use)."

Men in outpatient\n      surgical follow-up clinics will be screened using EPIC, and recruited if scoring under the\n      clinical threshold for potency. 68 couples will be randomised to two arms, one receiving six\n      sessions of couple-support from specially trained counsellors and the others receiving\n      standard care. The primary outcome measure is health-related quality-of-life. Pre, post and\n      6-month follow-up outcomes will be measured in both individual (quality of life;\n      anxiety/depression) and in relational terms (relationship between couples). An economic\n      analysis will identify population costs."
