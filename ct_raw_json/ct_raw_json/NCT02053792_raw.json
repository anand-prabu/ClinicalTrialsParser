After this initial 6 months, subjects will continue to administer rIX-FP as prophylaxis treatment using either the same treatment interval or a different treatment interval, as determined by the investigator. The treatment interval may be changed at each 6-month follow-up assessment.\nOn-demand treatment with rIX-FP will be used for all bleeding episodes requiring treatment.\nSubjects may participate in a surgical 'substudy' in which rIX-FP may be administered before, during and after surgery.\nThe dose of rIX-FP administered will be based on the subject's previous rIX-FP use and pharmacokinetic data."
