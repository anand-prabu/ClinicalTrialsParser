  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the research project is to determine how aging and inactivity reduce the muscle
      anabolic effect of nutrients and lead to muscle and functional loss.  The central hypothesis
      is that aging reduces mTORC1 signaling and the expression of skeletal muscle amino acid
      transporters in response to anabolic stimulation leading to reduced muscle adaptation to
      increased intracellular amino acid requirements. The investigators further hypothesize that
      inactivity exacerbates this effect with significant muscle and functional loss, and
      rehabilitation restores muscle signaling, metabolism and function to baseline values.

    <description>Muscle biopsies will be sampled from the vastus laterals before amino acid ingestion and then 1 and 3h after amino acid ingestion. Muscle biopsies will be processed using western blotting and gene expression to assess the expression of specific amino acid transporters. The investigators are interested in the change in expression of amino acid transporters in response to amino acid ingestion from baseline. The response before bed rest will be compared to after bed rest.</description>
