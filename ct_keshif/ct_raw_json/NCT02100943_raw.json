The investigators will use the Watch-PAT200\u00ae\n      device as their accepted standard for diagnosis of obstructive sleep apnea.\n\n      When enrolled, women will be taught how to use the Watch-PAT200\u00ae via a company produced\n      video that will be shown in the clinic and will be available via YouTube for review later if\n      needed. They will also complete the Berlin Questionnaire. The patient will then use the\n      Watch-PAT200\u00ae device overnight to evaluate for obstructive sleep apnea. This will be\n      performed between 32-36 weeks gestation. Apnea-hypopnea indices (AHI) will be calculated and\n      an AHI>5 will be considered diagnostic for OSA.\n\n      The next morning when the patient returns the Watch-PAT200\u00ae device they will exhale into the\n      NIOX MINO\u00ae to assess their exhaled nitric oxide levels. This will be performed between\n      800-1000 am by one of the study personnel.\n\n      The patient will also wear the Watch-PAT200\u00ae device the first postpartum night. The entire\n      process will be repeated between 6-8 weeks postpartum."
