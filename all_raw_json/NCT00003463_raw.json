At the time of surgery, up to eight Gliadel wafers\n      (containing carmustine) are implanted in the resected tumor cavity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients each receive escalating doses of irinotecan IV over 90 minutes once\n      weekly within 3 weeks after Gliadel wafer implantation. One course of treatment consists of\n      4 weeks of irinotecan and 2 weeks of rest. If 1 patient experiences dose limiting toxicity\n      (DLT) at a dose level, an additional 3 patients are entered at that same dose level. If 2\n      patients experience DLT, the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been surpassed and a total of\n      6 patients are treated at the previous dose level. The MTD is defined as the highest dose in\n      which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences DLT.\n\n      Treatment continues for up to 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity and disease\n      progression.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 4 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 18 patients will be accrued into this study over 9 months."
