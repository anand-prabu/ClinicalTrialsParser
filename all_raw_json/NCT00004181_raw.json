Allogeneic bone\n      marrow is infused on day 0.\n\n      Patients who have undergone prior radiotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days\n      -7 to -4 or -6 to -3 and cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Allogeneic bone\n      marrow is infused on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed at days 30 and 90, at 6 months, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
