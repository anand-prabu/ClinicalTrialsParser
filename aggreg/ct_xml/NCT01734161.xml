  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women having cesarean sections commonly experience post-operative nausea and vomiting
      (PONV). This can be partly attributed to the long acting morphine (duramorph) given in the
      anesthetic (either through the epidural or in the spinal anesthetic). Intravenous
      dexamethasone is a widely used steroid medication with a well-established safety profile
      which is the standard of care for the prevention of PONV for general anesthesia in both
      adult and pediatric surgical patients. Many studies have shown that when intravenous
      dexamethasone is administered before duramorph in the epidural, the incidence of nausea and
      vomiting following cesarean section is significantly reduced. However, when patients receive
      intravenous dexamethasone after duramorph in a spinal anesthetic, it does not reduce the
      incidence of nausea and vomiting. There are not any published studies where dexamethasone
      was administered before a spinal anesthetic. The investigators believe that if dexamethasone
      is given intravenously before duramorph in a spinal anesthetic it may reduce the incidence
      of nausea and vomiting. Patients who present for scheduled (non-emergent) cesarean section
      will be given either intravenous dexamethasone or placebo prior to receiving a duramorph
      containing spinal anesthetic. The investigators will then compare the incidence of nausea
      and vomiting and the use of rescue anti-nausea medications in both groups.  Our hypothesis
      is that patients receiving dexamethasone prior to duramorph containing spinal anesthesia for
      cesarean section will have a significantly lower incidence and severity of PONV at 0, 1, 3,
      6, and 24 hours following surgery.
