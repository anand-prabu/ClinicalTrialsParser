Sometimes the transplanted cells\n      are rejected by the body's normal tissues. Treatment with donor white blood cells may\n      prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of donor peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation followed by infusions of donor white blood cells in treating patients who\n      have AIDS-related lymphoma."

Patients who have not\n      received prior mediastinal radiotherapy receive thymic radiotherapy on day -1. Allogeneic\n      peripheral blood stem cells are infused on day 0. Patients also receive anti-thymocyte\n      globulin IV over 10-12 hours on days -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclosporine IV beginning on day\n      -1, switching to oral when possible, and tapering until day 35.\n\n      In the absence of active acute graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and at least 2 weeks after\n      completion of cyclosporine, patients receive an infusion of donor leukocytes on or before\n      day 49. Patients may receive a second donor leukocyte infusion if there is evidence of\n      persistent malignancy and no GVHD.\n\n      Patients are followed through day 100, on days 120, 180, 270, and 365, and then every 6\n      months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-4\n      years."
