Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. Peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by\n      chemotherapy and radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients with refractory or relapsed Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Carboplatin is administered on day 2. Etoposide IV is administered once daily\n           on days 1-3. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously or IV on days\n           5-12. Patients receive another course of ICE chemotherapy 2-3 weeks after the first\n           course.\n\n      Leukapheresis is performed once WBC reaches at least 3000/mm^3 and continues until enough\n      peripheral blood stem cells are collected.\n\n      Patients who have never received prior radiotherapy will receive accelerated\n      hyperfractionated total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) twice a day for 5 days (days -10 to -6).\n      Cyclophosphamide IV is then administered on days -5 and 4. Etoposide IV is administered by\n      continuous infusion over 4 days (days -5 to -2).\n\n      Patients who have had prior radiotherapy receive high dose chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide IV\n      is administered on days -6 and -5. Etoposide IV is administered by continuous infusion over\n      4 days (days -6 to -3). Carmustine IV is administered on day -2.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells are infused 24-36 hours after high-dose chemotherapy. G-CSF is\n      administered beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Arm II (2 adverse prognostic factors): Patients receive the first course of ICE as in\n           Arm I.\n\n      Apheresis is performed once WBC is greater than 3000/mm^3 and continues until enough cells\n      are collected. The second course of ICE is then administered.\n\n      Ifosfamide is administered by 48 hour continuous infusion on days 1-2. Carboplatin is\n      administered on day 3. Etoposide IV is administered every 12 hours for 3 doses beginning on\n      day 1. Patients receive G-CSF on days 5-14.\n\n      Patients who have never received prior radiotherapy will receive accelerated\n      hyperfractionated TLI for 5 days (days -10 to -6). Cyclophosphamide IV is then administered\n      every 12 hours on days -5 to -2. Etoposide IV is administered by continuous infusion over 4\n      days (days -5 to -2).\n\n      Patients who have had prior radiotherapy receive high-dose chemotherapy. Cyclophosphamide IV\n      is administered every 12 hours on days -6 to -3. Etoposide IV is administered by continuous\n      infusion over 4 days (days -6 to -3). Carmustine IV is administered on day -2.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells are infused 24-36 hours after high dose chemotherapy. G-CSF is\n      administered beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Arm III (3 adverse prognostic factors): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV daily for\n           2 days, then G-CSF beginning on day 4 until blood stem cells are collected.\n\n      Patients then undergo apheresis until enough cells are collected.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose chemotherapy. Ifosfamide IV is administered for 1 hour. Etoposide\n      is administered by continuous infusion for 12 hours. Carboplatin IV is administered for 1\n      hour. Etoposide is again administered by continuous infusion for 12 hours. Treatment is\n      repeated daily for 5 days.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused 24-36 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy.\n      G-CSF is administered beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients who have never received prior radiation will now receive accelerated\n      hyperfractionated TLI twice daily for 5 days. Patients receive a second course of high dose\n      chemotherapy 45-90 days after reinfusion of cells. Etoposide IV and cytarabine IV are\n      administered every 12 hours for 4 days (days -6 to -3). Melphalan IV is administered on day\n      -2.\n\n      Patients who have received prior radiation therapy receive a second course of high-dose\n      chemotherapy. Carmustine IV is administered on day -7. Etoposide IV and cytarabine IV are\n      administered every 12 hours for 4 days (days -6 to -3). Melphalan IV is administered on day\n      -2.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells are reinfused 24-48 hours after completion of second course\n      chemotherapy. G-CSF is administered beginning on day 1 and continuing until blood counts\n      recover.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 4 months during years 3-5,\n      and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 80 patients within 4 years."
