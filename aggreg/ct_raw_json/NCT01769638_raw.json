            "textblock": "-  Background: An orally disintegrating film (ODF) formulation of sildenafil was recently\n           developed in Korea. This formulation is expected to enhance the dosing convenience and\n           increase patient compliance while yielding pharmacokinetic profiles comparable to the\n           conventional film coated tablet (FCT) formulation.\n\n        -  Objective: The goal of present study is to compare the pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles of\n           a newly developed ODF formulation with a FCT formulation of sildenafil in healthy\n           Korean male volunteers.\n\n        -  Methods: This is a randomized, open-label, 2-period cross-over, single-dose study\n           conducted in 2 parts. Eligible subjects were healthy male volunteers between the ages\n           of 20 and 50 years and within 20% of their ideal body weight, and are equally divided\n           into parts 1 and 2. Each subject will be received a single -dose of ODF and FCT\n           formulations of sildenafil orally in a fasted state (part 1, 50mg; part 2, 100mg), with\n           a 7-day washout period between the formulations. Blood samples are collected up to 24\n           hours. Pharmacokinetic parameters are determined for sildenafil and its active\n           metabolite (N-desmethyl sildenafil). Adverse events will be also evaluated based on\n           subject interviews and physical examinations."
