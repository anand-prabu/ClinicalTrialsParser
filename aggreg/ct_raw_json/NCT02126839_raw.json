The ICS, LTM, and cromone doses must have been stable for at least 4\n             weeks prior to the SV and should be maintained for the duration of the study\n\n          8. Can self-perform peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) measurements with a handheld peak\n             flow meter\n\n          9.

Otherwise in general good health, defined as free of any concomitant conditions or\n             treatment that could interfere with study conduct, influence the interpretation of\n             study observations/results, or put the patient at increased risk during the trial,\n             and with a clinically acceptable 6-month medical history, physical examination,\n             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG), and vital signs\n\n         11. Parents consenting are capable of understanding the requirements, risks and benefits\n             of study participation, and, as judged by the investigator, capable of giving\n             informed consent and being compliant with all study requirements (eg, visits,\n             record-keeping)\n\n         12. The patient is able to correctly use the MDPI device, either alone or with assistance\n             by a parent/guardian.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Known hypersensitivity to albuterol or any of the excipients in the inhaler\n             formulations (eg, lactose, ethanol)\n\n          2. Participation (receiving study medication) in any investigational drug trial within\n             the 30 days preceding the SV or planned participation in another investigational drug\n             trial at any time during this trial\n\n          3. History of severe milk protein allergy\n\n          4. History of a respiratory infection or disorder (including, but not limited to\n             bronchitis, pneumonia, acute or chronic sinusitis, otitis media, influenza) that has\n             not resolved within 4 weeks preceding the SV\n\n          5. Any asthma exacerbation requiring oral corticosteroids within 3 months of the SV. A\n             patient must not have had any hospitalization for asthma within 6 months prior to the\n             SV.\n\n          6. Initiation of immunotherapy during the study period or dose escalation during the\n             study period. Patients being treated with immunotherapy prior to the SV must be using\n             a stable (maintenance) dose (90 days or more) to be considered for inclusion.\n\n          7. History of life-threatening asthma that is defined for this protocol as an asthma\n             episode that required intubation and/or was associated with hypercapnea, respiratory\n             arrest, or hypoxic seizures\n\n          8. Use of any prohibited concomitant medications within the washout prescribed per\n             protocol prior to study visits\n\n          9.

Intranasal corticosteroid and/or cromones have not been stable for at\n             least two weeks prior to the SV. Allowed corticosteroid, LTM, and cromone asthma and\n             allergy medications should be continued at the same doses during the conduct of the\n             study.\n\n         11. Presence of any non-asthmatic acute or chronic condition, including but not limited\n             to bronchitis, emphysema, active tuberculosis, bronchiectasis, cystic fibrosis,\n             clinically significant cardiovascular disease (including but not limited to cardiac\n             arrhythmias and uncontrolled hypertension), clinically significant hepatic, renal, or\n             endocrine dysfunction, stroke, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism,\n             convulsive disorder, and malignancy other than basal cell carcinoma. Significant is\n             defined as any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the\n             safety of the patient at risk through participation, or which could affect the safety\n             or efficacy analyses\n\n         12. Any other medical or psychological condition that in the investigator's opinion\n             should preclude study enrollment\n\n         13.
