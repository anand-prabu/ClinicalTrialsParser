Optionally, dynamic PET imaging over a chosen index lesion (based on size and/or high FDG-avidity on preceding CT and/or FDG PET/CT scans done for clinical purpose such as staging), may be performed. Otherwise, static PET images are obtained at approximately 60 min (+15 min) post FLT injection. In general this \"body\" scan will cover at least the region from skull base to the upper thigh for extracranial malignancies; depending on the specific location, extremities maybe also be scanned (e.g., extremity sarcoma), or the scan may be restricted to the brain (e.g. glioma)."

Radioactive\n      substances are used with PET/CT scans to \"see\" cancer cells, and are also called\n      radiotracers. FLT is a new radiotracer that has been given to people in prior studies. FLT\n      PET/CT is an experimental scan unlike FDG (fluorodeoxyglucose) PET scan which is a standard\n      clinical scan and is commonly used. The investigators would like to know if there is any\n      evidence of early treatment response by obtaining FLTPET/ CT scans before and after\n      treatment."
