There is still, however, paucity of data using light therapy\n      for the treatment of this condition. Blue light therapy using the Multiclear device has been\n      used successfully in the treatment of acne. In contrast, there is little data to suggest its\n      use in the management of striae distensae.\n\n      We aim to study the effects of blue light on the treatment of striae distensae and whether\n      this can be used safely to manage this condition."

If mild to\n      moderate erythema develops, the same dose (i.e. 1 MED) will be used.If severe erythema/\n      blisters develop, treatment will be stopped and the patient wil be invited one week later\n      and treatment will be offered at 50% of the last dose.\n\n      During the first consultation, patients will be assessed for the presence of striae\n      distensae (SD). Duration and previous treatments of SD will be recorded.  The width of the\n      widest striae and the length of the longest straie will be measured at baseline and after 2\n      months of treatment.
