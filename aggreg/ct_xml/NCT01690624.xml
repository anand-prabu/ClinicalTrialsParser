  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with acute myeloid leukemia who experience a relapse after at least one prior
      regimen may be enrolled in this trial.  The trial will examine whether monotherapy with BI
      836858 is safe and tolerable at escalating dose levels.

        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML with at least one prior treatment for acute
             myeloid leukemia.

          2. Expression of CD33 on more than 30% of bone marrow blasts.

          3. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status 0, 1 or 2

          4. Age 18 years or older

          5. Written informed consent which is consistent with International Conference on
             Harmonization ¿ Good Clinical Practice (ICH-GCP) guidelines and local legislation.

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Patients with acute promyelocytic leukemia according to WHO definition.

          2. Patients with &gt; 5.000 leukocytes/µl in the peripheral blood

          3. Anti-leukemia therapy within two weeks before first treatment with BI 836858, 4 weeks
             for biologics

          4. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation within the last 3 months or with evidence of
             graft versus host disease

          5. Patients who are candidates for allogeneic stem cell transplantation.

          6. Second malignancy currently requiring active therapy.

          7. Symptomatic central nervous system involvement

          8. Aspartate amino transferase (AST) or alanine amino transferase (ALT) greater than 2.5
             times the upper limit of normal (ULN), or AST or ALT greater than 5 times the ULN for
             those with Gilbert syndrome.

          9. Prothrombin time (PT) &gt;1.5 x ULN for subjects not on therapeutic vitamin K
             antagonists (phenprocoumon, warfarin)

         10. Bilirubin greater than 1.5 mg/dl (&gt;26 µmol/L) unless elevation is thought to be due
             to hepatic infiltration by AML, Gilbert syndrome, or hemolysis.

         11. Serum creatinine greater than 2.0 mg/dl

         12. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or active hepatitis B virus or
             hepatitis C virus infection.

             Investigator, would compromise safe participation in the study, e.g. active severe
             infection, unstable angina pectoris, new onset of exacerbation of a cardiac
             arrhythmia

         14. Psychiatric illness or social situation that would limit compliance with trial
             requirements

         15. Concomitant therapy, which is considered relevant for the evaluation of the efficacy
             or safety of the trial drug

         16. Female patients of childbearing potential who are sexually active and unwilling to
             use a medically acceptable method of contraception during the trial and for 6 months
             after the last administration of BI 836858

         17. Male patients with partners of childbearing potential who are unwilling to use
             condoms in combination with a second effective method of contraception during the
             trial and for 6 months after the last administration of BI 836858

         18. Pregnant or nursing female patients

         19. Treatment with another investigational agent under the following conditions:

               1. Within two weeks (4 weeks for biologics) of first administration of BI 836858;
                  or

               2. Patient has persistent toxicities from prior anti-leukemic therapies which are
                  determined to be relevant by the Investigator.

               3. Concomitant treatment with another investigational agent while participating in
                  this trial.

         20. Prior treatment with a CD33 antibody

         21. Patient unable or unwilling to comply with the protocol.
