  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, noncomparative study evaluates two oral formulations of
      raltegravir (MK-0518) in combination with other antiretroviral agents for safety,
      tolerability, and antiretroviral activity in treatment-inexperienced or
      treatment-experienced Russian children and adolescents infected with human immunodeficiency
      virus-1 (HIV-1).

      As raltegravir is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral therapies (ARTs) for
      the treatment of HIV-1 infection in pediatric patients in the United States (US), this study
      is designed to gain local treatment experience on the use

      of raltegravir in the pediatric HIV-infected population in Russia.
