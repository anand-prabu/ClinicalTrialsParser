        We diagnosis PFO through contrast-enhanced transcranial Doppler (c-TCD) and Transthroracic
        Echocardiography (TTE). The migraine patients who should undergo a patent foreman ovale
        closure and would like to will be selected to Transcatheter closure group, while those who
        refuse such procedure will be selected to Contrast group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Clinical history of migraine diagnosed by a neurologist according to the
             International Classification of Headache Disorders

          -  Transcranial Doppler evidence of right-to-left shunt(RLS) and echocardiographic
             evidence of PFO，of which the degree is moderate to large RLS

          -  Subjects who have not responded to or cannot take common migraine preventive
             medications

          -  Willing to participate in follow-up visits

        Additional Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Transcatheter closure group: Closure of PFO is performed

          -  Contrast group: Subjects who meet the Inclusion Criteria, but refuse to undergo
             closure procedure

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Seizure disorder

          -  Other organic central nervous system disease

          -  Subjects whose headaches are other than migraine, such as a result of traumatic head
             or neck injury

          -  Evidence of alcohol, drug or substance abuse within the previous year

        Additional Exclusion Criteria for Transcatheter closure group:

          -  Subjects with intracardiac thrombus or tumor

          -  Subjects who have an acute or recent (within 6 months) myocardial infarction or
             unstable angina

          -  Subjects with left ventricular aneurysm or akinesis

          -  Subjects with atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter (chronic or intermittent)

          -  Subjects with another source of right to left shunt identified at baseline, including
             an atrial septal defect and/or fenestrated septum

          -  Subjects with contraindication to aspirin or Clopidogrel therapy

          -  Pregnant or desire to become pregnant within the next year
