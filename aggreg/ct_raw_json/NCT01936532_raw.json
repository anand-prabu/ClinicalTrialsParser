The patient population will consist of adult men and women younger than 66\n      years, who have a confirmed diagnosis of MM who meet eligibility criteria.\n\n      Following the screening period, patients will be enrolled and treated then, they will\n      receive induction therapy (3 cycles), a systematic Peripheral Blood Stem Cell harvest. After\n      Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplantation, patient will enter in the consolidation phase\n      (early and late one) 2 months after transplantation.
