  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective registry is to collect real world, post-marketing data on
      the use of Stryker Target® 360° and Target® 2D coils for the embolization of ruptured or
      unruptured intracranial saccular aneurysms. Up to 150 patients presenting with intracranial
      aneurysms suitable for coil embolization  will be enrolled at approximately 10 sites. A post
      hoc analysis comparing Target® 360° and Target® 2D coil technical and clinical endpoints
      will be performed.
