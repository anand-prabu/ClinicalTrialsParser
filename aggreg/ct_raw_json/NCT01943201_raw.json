It was the aim of the study to examine the effects of a specially developed\n      low-friction hospital bed sheet  on skin physiology as well as it's acceptance by patients\n      with SCI.\n\n      Method:\n\n      Prospective, randomised crossover study. Patients with a subacute spinal cord injury will be\n      recruited. Each patient spends five consecutive nights on the new, respectively,\n      conventional bed sheet. After the five nights, patients are asked  to complete a linear\n      questionnaire (VAS) concerning well-being, odour, perspiration and wrinkling. In addition,\n      the patients are examined daily while still fasting, for skin redness, skin moisture, skin\n      elasticity and skin blood circulation in the parasacral region."
