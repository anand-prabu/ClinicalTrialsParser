  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the effect of exenatide on myocardial injury in patients
      undergoing emergent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for ST segment elevation
      myocardial infarction or heart attack (STEMI).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of patients with
      STEMI. Those who agree to participate will be immediately randomized to one of two groups: a
      24-h infusion of exenatide; or a 24 h infusion of placebo. We will assess the ability of
      exenatide to reduce ischemic injury. This study will serve as safety evaluation study as
      well as a pilot for a larger multicentre trial powered for clinical outcomes.

    <description>o Exenatide at a dose of 1.5 µg IV over 30 min followed by 1.2 µg/hr IV for 1.5 h (Rate1), followed by 1.9 µg/hr IV* for 22 h (Rate 2), or
*Once the creatinine clearance is available, if the value is &lt;60 mL/min, the rate at 2 hours will be maintained at Rate 1 for the duration of the infusion. If the value becomes available after the 2-hour point, and the rate has already been changed to Rate 2, the infusion will be titrated back down to Rate 1 if the creatinine clearance is &lt;60 mL/min.
If the creatinine clearance is &lt;30 mL/min, the infusion will be discontinued and the patient will otherwise continue with all study procedures.
A bolus administration of study medication is initiated preferably prior to reperfusion, or, if not possible, up to 30 minutes after the start of reperfusion to avoid delays in door-to-door balloon times.</description>

             pain or an elevation of cardiac enzymes. For non-anterior MI: ST-segment elevation =
             1mm in 2 or more limb leads and at least one of the following high-risk
             characteristics: systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mm Hg, heart rate &gt; 100 bpm, Killip
             class II or III, ST-segment depression ≥ 2 mm in the anterior leads, or ST-segment
             elevation ≥ 1 mm in right-sided lead V4 (V4R)

             acute severe mitral regurgitation)

          -  Need for hemodialysis

          -  Malignancy, HIV, or central nervous system disorder

          -  Cardiopulmonary resuscitation &gt;15 min and compromised level of consciousness.

          -  Cardiogenic shock

          -  Current participation in any research study involving investigational drugs or
             devices

          -  Inability to give informed consent

          -  Inability to safely undergo cMRI (presence of cardiac pacemaker, implanted cardiac
             defibrillator, aneurysm clips, carotid artery vascular clamp, neurostimulator,
             implanted drug infusion device, bone growth/fusion stimulator, cochlear, otologic, or
             ear implant, severe claustrophobia)

          -  Women of childbearing potential who are known to be pregnant or lactating or who have
             a positive pregnancy test on admission

          -  History of pancreatitis
