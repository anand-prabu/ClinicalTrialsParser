      Influenza viruses are significant causes of human illness and death in developed and
      developing countries.  This study will measure the ability of influenza vaccine given to
      children in India to protect both the children and unimmunized persons around them from
      influenza.  It will also determine whether the best time to immunize in a country like India
      that has both summer and winter outbreaks of influenza is in the fall, as is done now, or
      whether immunization should be in the spring to protect against influenza infections in the
      summer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although influenza vaccines are used routinely in the United States, including in young
      children, influenza vaccines have not seen widespread use in India. This is likely
      contributed to by the lack of information from India about disease burden due to influenza
      and because influenza vaccines have not been tested for efficacy in India. In addition,
      because young children are thought to be important in the spread of influenza in families,
      it is possible immunization of children against influenza will reduce influenza infections
      among older children and adults in the home. The study described here is an extension of an
      earlier study (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00934245) that tested the use of immunization against
      influenza in the fall.  The current study will administer influenza vaccine in the spring
      prior to the summer monsoon rains that are associated with peaks of influenza activity in
      parts of India. Reduction of influenza infections among the influenza immunized children and
      their household members will be compared to the children and household members in the
      control vaccine group.
