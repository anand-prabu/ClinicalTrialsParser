Two (2)\n      intradermal injections of either vaccine or placebo will be administered to qualified\n      subjects (one in each arm) on Day 0 of the study.  A subsequent injection will also be given\n      on Day 90 with either vaccine or placebo (in one arm only).  Subjects will be evaluated for\n      safety, measurement of viremia for all four dengue serotypes and dengue neutralizing\n      antibody to all four serotypes.  All subjects will be evaluated for injection site\n      evaluations and have blood drawn for viremia, neutralizing antibodies, cell mediated\n      immunity and innate immunity.  Subjects will be required to participate for approximately 10\n      months from recruitment and collection of data for primary outcomes (through Day 120)\n      including collection of additional samples for measurement of longer term antibody titers\n      (Day 270)."
