    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to obtain cerebrospinal fluid from healthy children already
      undergoing a lumbar puncture procedure at New York Presbyterian Hospital, to act as healthy
      controls when compared to children with late infantile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis
      (LINCL), a fatal neurodegenerative disease.

    <description>The primary study endpoint is the metabolic profiling of 32 samples of cerebrospinal fluid from healthy subjects, in comparison to 32 samples of CSF from children with LINCL, to determine whether there are biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal fluid that are associated with LINCL.</description>
