The hypothesis is that starting directly on OX219\n      works equally well (e.g. not significantly worse) as starting on buprenorphine only and\n      switching to OX219 on day 3.\n\n      Patients will be screened and eligible patients will be randomized within 0-14 days after\n      screening, and followed for 28 days of treatment. Effectiveness of treatment will be\n      assessed, including:\n\n        -  How long patients retain in treatment\n\n        -  Assessment of opioid withdrawal symptoms\n\n        -  Assessment of cravings for opioids\n\n        -  Assessment of urine drug screens negative for opioids"
