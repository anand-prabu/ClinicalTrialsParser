             (i.e., more severe prolapse)

          -  At least one symptom associated with prolapse (e.g., any of the following including
             but not limited to vaginal bulge, vaginal pain/discomfort, voiding dysfunction,
             manual reduction (digitation) needed for defecation, fecal incontinence, dyspareunia)

             effectively treated.)

          -  Prior placement of synthetic mesh or biologic graft for pelvic organ prolapse

          -  A history of  cervical, ovarian, uterine, endometrial, vaginal, vulval, colon, rectal

          -  Ongoing participation in an investigational device or drug trial

          -  Currently undergoing evaluation or treatment for chronic pelvic pain (e.g., pain as a
