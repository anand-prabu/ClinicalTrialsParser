The POEM procedure will be performed in the operating room under general anesthesia and a scope will then be inserted into your mouth and down your throat and measurements will be taken. With the use of this lighted flexible scope the surgeon will make a small incision in the inner lining of your esophagus (throat), create a tunnel and then cut the muscle between the esophagus (throat) and the stomach. The initial little opening will be closed with a small clip.  This procedure will allow easier passage of food into the stomach."
