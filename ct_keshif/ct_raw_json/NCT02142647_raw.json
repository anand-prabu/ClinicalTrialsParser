Healthy\n      infants at approximately 5 months of age will be randomized to either a meat protein, or a\n      dairy protein group with complementary protein mainly from meat or dairy. Infants will\n      consume one of these diets for 7 months (6-12 months of age) and infant growth, body\n      composition, growth biomarkers and gut microbiome will be measured to compare between groups\n      and over time."
