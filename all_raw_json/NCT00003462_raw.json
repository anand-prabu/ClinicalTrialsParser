Giving drugs into the thin space between the lining of the\n      spinal cord and brain may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of intrathecal busulfan in treating\n      patients with recurrent, refractory, or metastatic leptomeningeal tumors."

Any patient with objective or significant clinical response\n      may continue treatment by receiving the same dose once a week for 2 consecutive weeks, once\n      a week every other week for 3 weeks (2 treatments), and then once a month thereafter until\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of intrathecal busulfan until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2 years."
