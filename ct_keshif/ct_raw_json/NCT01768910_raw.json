NNOAB patients might undergo an additional fMRI session\n      after receiving overactive bladder (OAB) treatment (such as antimuscarinics, intradetrusor\n      injections of botulinum toxin type A). Spinal cord injury (SCI) patients with neurogenic\n      detrusor overactivity will undergo an additional fMRI session 5-7 weeks after intradetrusor\n      injections of botulinum toxin type A.\n\n      High-resolution anatomical images and functional blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)-signal\n      sensitive images will be acquired. In addition to the fMRI, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)\n      sequences will be recorded after the anatomical scans to provide information about the\n      structural supraspinal connectivity.\n\n      Study endpoints are changes of the BOLD signal in regard to location and intensity,\n      structural and functional connectivity (FC) between previously described supraspinal centers\n      involved in LUT control, and statistical differences of changes in BOLD signals, structural\n      and functional connectivity between patients and healthy controls.\n\n      All acquired fMRI data will be transferred to an off-line workstation running BrainVoyager\n      QX or Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM) Version 8. The functional data will be\n      pre-processed for motion correction, spatial smoothing, linear trend removal, and temporal\n      high-pass filtering. With both programs statistical analysis and graphical presentation of\n      the results can be performed.\n\n      The DTI records will be evaluated with SPM8, BrainVoyager QX or other programs like\n      Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Software Library (FSL) and\n      DTI-Studio. To estimate FC we will use SPM8 or the brain connectivity toolbox. Both\n      softwares allow the estimation of rest- and task-related connectivity on single subject and\n      group level with corrected statistical threshold.\n\n      Overall, 96 subjects for the main study are estimated to be sufficient to demonstrate\n      significant differences between groups."
