            "textblock": "There are limited therapeutical options for patients with secondary dystonia due to cerebral\n      palsy. Pharmacotherapy is often without effect, or side effects are severe. Meanwhile deep\n      brain stimulation (DBS) has proven to be a safe and effective therapy for patients with\n      parkinson\u00b4s disease or primary / idiopathic dystonia. Experiences with DBS in patients with\n      dyskinetic cerebral palsy are limited with heterogeneous data.\n\n      With STIM-CP we investigate the effect of DBS on quality of life in young patients with a\n      dyskinetic movement disorder (dyskinetic cerebral palsy) due to perinatal hypoxic brain\n      injury. Additionally, the effect of DBS on motor development, speech, memory, attention,\n      cognition and pain perception will be assessed. In total, 20 patients aged 7-18 years\n      diagnosed with dyskinetic cerebral palsy, who will receive DBS, should be included. 11\n      German DBS-centres will participate in the trial.\n\n      We assume that DBS reduces the severity of dystonia and improves the quality of life in\n      these patients."
