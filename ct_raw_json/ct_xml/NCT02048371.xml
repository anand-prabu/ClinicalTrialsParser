  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although regorafenib was approved for use in patients who had progressive GIST despite
      imatinib and/or sunitinib on the basis of phase II and phase III data, it has not been
      examined in a systematic fashion in patients with other forms of sarcoma.

      Given the activity of sorafenib, sunitinib and pazopanib in soft tissue sarcomas, and
      evidence of activity of sorafenib in osteogenic sarcoma and possibly Ewing/Ewing-like
      sarcoma, there is precedent to examine SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) such
      as regorafenib in sarcomas other than GIST. It is also recognized that SMOKIs (small
      molecule oral kinase inhibitors)such as regorafenib, sorafenib, pazopanib, and sunitinib
      have overlapping panels of kinases that are inhibited simultaneously. While not equivalent,
      most of these SMOKIs (small molecule oral kinase inhibitors) block vascular endothelial
      growth factor and platelet derived growth factors receptors (VEGFRs and PDGFRs), speaking to
      a common mechanism of action of several of these agents.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically or cytologically confirmed advanced/metastatic
             liposarcoma, osteogenic sarcoma, or Ewing/Ewing-like sarcoma of soft tissue or bone.
             This study will accept the diagnosis made at the investigator's center.

          -  WHO Performance Status 0, 1 or 2. A maximum of 1/3 of patients in cohorts A &amp; B may
             be WHO performance status 2.

          -  At least one prior line of systemic therapy for the sarcoma diagnosis (neoadjuvant,
             adjuvant or metastatic disease).

          -  All acute toxic effects of any prior treatment have resolved to NCI-CTCAE v 4.0 Grade
             1 or less (except alopecia) at the time of signing the Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subject must be able to swallow and retain oral medication.

          -  At least one site of measurable disease on x-ray/CT/MRI scan as defined by RECIST
             1.1.  Baseline imaging must be performed within 28 days of Day 1 of study.

          -  Adequate organ function within 14 days of registration INR (International Normalized
             Ratio) : patients with no prior evidence of underlying abnormality in coagulation
             parameters exists, according to the written documentation of the treating physician

          -  Evidence of progression of disease as defined by RECIST 1.1 (i.e. new disease sites
             or 30% growth of index lesions) within 6 months of registration

          -  Patients with central nervous system disease are eligible for enrollment if they have
             received prior radiotherapy or surgery to sites of CNS (central nervous system)
             metastatic disease and are without evidence of clinical progression for at least 12
             weeks after therapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with documentation of well differentiated liposarcoma only (of the well
             differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma family) are specifically excluded, owing
             to its characteristically slow growth. If high grade areas are suspected
             (dedifferentiation), but not proved by pathology analysis (e.g. after primary
             resection of a well-differentiated liposarcoma), a biopsy must be performed to
             demonstrate the high-grade dedifferentiated disease.

          -  Prior systemic therapy with a small molecule oral kinase inhibitor, including but not
             limited to: pazopanib, sunitinib, sorafenib, everolimus, sirolimus, vemurafenib,
             dasatinib.

          -  Previous assignment to treatment during this study.  Subjects permanently withdrawn
             from study participation will not be allowed to re-enter study.  Patients who
             progress on placebo are specifically allowed to enroll on the treatment arm of the
             study if they meet all other entry criteria.

          -  Concurrent, clinically significant, active malignancies within 12 months of study
             enrollment

          -  Patients with severe and/or uncontrolled concurrent medical disease that in the
             opinion of the investigator could cause unacceptable safety risks or compromise
             compliance with the protocol.

          -  Major surgery within 28 days prior to study registration or those patients who have
             not recovered adequately from prior surgery

          -  Patients who have received wide field radiotherapy ≤ 28 days (defined as &gt; 50% of
             volume of pelvis bones or equivalent) or limited field radiation for palliation &lt; 14
             days prior to study registration or those patients who have not recovered adequately
             from side effects of such therapy.

          -  Patients who have received prior systemic therapy &lt; 14 days prior to study
             registration or have not recovered adequately from toxicities to CTCAE v. 4.0 grade 1

             Hg [NCI-CTCAE v 4.0] on repeated measurement) despite optimal medical management.

          -  Active or clinically significant cardiac disease including: Congestive heart
             failure-New York Heart Association (NYHA) &gt; class II, Active coronary artery disease,

             digoxin, Unstable angina (anginal symptoms at rest), new onset angina within 3 months
             before randomization, or myocardial infarction within 6 months before
             randomization3.2.11

          -  Evidence or history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy
