      appetite and hunger given on the same day of testing.

    <textblock>
      Four hours after breakfast a small amount of liquid to drink will be given to a participant
      that will contain either the Appethyl™ or placebo. You will be given a lunch of about 750
      calories and 40% fat prepared by the Metabolic Kitchen and be asked to eat all of it. You
      will have food choice testing performed 4 hours after starting your lunch meal. This will be
      done in two ways.  You will be given a list of two foods that are made of carbohydrate like
      bread and pretzels and be asked which you prefer most.  You will also be given a list of
      foods that differ in the amounts of fat, carbohydrate and protein that they contain and you
      will be asked to mark the ones that appeal to you.

      You will be presented with a pizza in a quantity more than you could reasonably be expected
      to eat 5 hours after the start of your lunch meal and be asked to eat to your satisfaction
      over 30 minutes. You are not expected to eat all of the pizza.
