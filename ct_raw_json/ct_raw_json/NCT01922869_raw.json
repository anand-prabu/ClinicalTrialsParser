Within a decade it is believed that doctors will be able to take profiles of\n      their patients, identify specific diseases for which they are at risk and create\n      personalised nutrition plans accordingly. At the University of East Anglia, UK the\n      investigators are interested in particular food compounds known as flavonoids which can be\n      found in foods such as chocolate, orange juice and blackberries (COB). The study will\n      determine if factors such as age, gender, genetics and the bacteria present in our guts\n      contribute to variability between individuals in their absorption, metabolism and excretion\n      of flavonoids."
