Nearly 80%\n      of lung cancers are diagnosed in an advanced stage (IIIB, and IV). Circulating tumor cells\n      identification and monitoring these cells after treatment could help the clinicians to\n      detect relapse or be a prognostic factor.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE : Circulating tumor cells identification, and monitoring in advanced stage\n      lung cancers (IIIB and IV).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES : Predictive value of the monitoring of circulating tumor cells on the\n      therapeutic response. Prognostic value of identification of circulating tumor cells at the\n      time of diagnosis.\n\n      STUDY DESIGN : This study is a prospective, monocentrique trial analyzing the identification\n      of circulating tumor cells in stage IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers.\n\n      Duration of the inclusions: 18 months.\n\n      Duration of the study: 30 months.\n\n      PROCEDURES : Detection of circulating tumor cells with CellSearch system (Veridex), and a\n      cut-off of 5 cells/7,5 ml of blood.\n\n      SAMPLE SIZE : 200 patients\n\n      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS : Detection of circulating tumor cells is predicted in 20% of stage\n      IIIB, and IV non-small cell lung cancers included in this study. The cut-off is 5\n      circulating tumor cells per 7,5 ml of blood."
