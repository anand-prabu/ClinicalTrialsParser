            "textblock": "The goal of antiretroviral therapy is maximal suppression of HIV-1 replication. Yet studies\n      show that there is ongoing replication of latent virus in the blood and lymphoid tissues of\n      some patients receiving potent antiretroviral therapy who have had suppressed plasma HIV-1\n      RNA levels for prolonged periods of time. This continued viral persistence and replication\n      could eventually result in virologic failure and clinical progression as well as selection\n      and transmission of resistant HIV-1. There is a need to identify, quantify, and determine\n      significance of viral reservoirs in compartments other than blood. A5077 is designed to\n      evaluate the relationship between viral load in blood and nonblood compartments and time to\n      virologic failure in patients initiating or changing potent antiretroviral therapy.\n\n      Patients contribute samples of blood at study entry (prior to changing or initiating potent\n      antiretroviral therapy), Week 8 and every 8 weeks thereafter until Week 96, and (if\n      applicable) within 30 days of confirmed virologic failure. Samples of saliva and either\n      genital secretions or lymphoid tissue, or both, are collected at study entry (prior to\n      changing or initiating potent antiretroviral therapy), Weeks 16, 48, and 96, and within 30\n      days of confirmed virologic failure. Clinical assessments and medication updates are done at\n      study visits. Blood samples are tested for HIV-1 genotypic resistance studies, HIV-1\n      proviral DNA studies, and HIV-1 quantitation. If total blood volumes exceed safe limits,\n      blood samples will not be drawn for A5077 but the A5077 protocol team will request access to\n      plasma and PBMC samples from any coenrolled study if applicable."
