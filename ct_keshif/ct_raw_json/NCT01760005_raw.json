            "textblock": "The mutations in presenilin 1 (PSEN1), presenilin 2 (PSEN2) and amyloid precursor protein\n      (APP) that are associated with autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease have very high\n      penetrance (near 100%).  This study will target individuals who are either known to have a\n      disease-causing mutation or who are at risk for such a mutation (the child or sibling of a\n      proband with a known mutation) and unaware of their genetic status.   Because the age of\n      onset of cognitive changes is relatively consistent within each family, an age of onset is\n      determined for each affected parent as part of the DIAN longitudinal study protocol.\n      Subjects will be eligible for enrollment in the DIAN-TU-001 study when they are between 15\n      years younger (-15) to 10 years older (+10) than the age of onset of their affected parent.\n\n      The ability to identify individuals destined to develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) within the\n      next 10-15 years with a high degree of confidence provides a unique opportunity to assess\n      the efficacy of therapies at asymptomatic and very early stages of dementia.  Although there\n      are differences between dominantly inherited AD and the more common age-associated sporadic\n      disease, the results of the early intervention in this study will have implications for\n      future studies and treatments in sporadic AD.  Families with known disease-causing mutations\n      are extremely rare and are geographically dispersed throughout the world.  These constraints\n      necessitate a specialized study design.  Many of the subjects in this study will not yet\n      have any cognitive symptoms of AD; they will be \"asymptomatic\" carriers of mutations that\n      cause Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer's disease and would be expected to perform normally on\n      standard cognitive and functional testing.  Imaging and fluid biomarkers will be used as the\n      primary study endpoints to demonstrate that the treatment compounds have engaged their\n      therapeutic targets.  A set of cognitive measures designed to assess the very earliest, most\n      subtle cognitive changes will be collected, but will not be primary endpoints as many of\n      these clinically asymptomatic individuals are likely to have minimal changes in cognitive\n      measures during the study.  Additionally, because many at-risk individuals decide not to\n      know whether they have the disease-associated mutation or not, some of the at-risk\n      individuals enrolled in this study will not have the disease causing mutations; they will be\n      \"mutation negative\".  It is important to enroll non-carrier subjects to avoid coercion\n      (e.g., potential subjects may be pressured into genetic testing to learn their genetic\n      status in order to be eligible for the trial). These mutation negative individuals will be\n      assigned to the placebo group; subjects and site study staff will remain blinded as to these\n      individuals' active or placebo group assignment and mutation status.   Thus, the study will\n      be double blinded for placebo and for mutation status, except for mutation positive subjects\n      who are aware of their genetic status.  Two different therapies will be tested in order to\n      increase the likelihood that an effective treatment will be discovered.  They were selected\n      for this trial based on mechanism of action and available data on efficacy and safety\n      profile.\n\n      This study design is possible because the biomarker endpoints are relatively robust.  The\n      study design includes a pooled placebo arm shared by all treatment groups.  Mutation\n      positive subjects will be randomized to one of the three study arms (placebo, gantenerumab,\n      solanezumab).  Mutation negative subjects will all receive placebo, but will be randomized\n      to receive matching placebo for gantenerumab or solanezumab.   Importantly, subjects and\n      study staff will not be blinded as to which treatment group each subject has been assigned;\n      they will be blinded as to whether subjects have been randomized to active drug or placebo\n      arms.  Biomarker endpoints will be specified for each treatment arm.  Biomarker endpoints\n      will be assessed at least annually.  Biomarker data will be analyzed for pre-specified\n      endpoints consistent with the drug's mechanism of action and known effects on the tested\n      biomarkers.  At the end of the study period, the Sponsor will consider developing an\n      extension study that would allow subjects enrolled in this study to rollover to a longer\n      therapeutic trial with cognitive endpoints."
