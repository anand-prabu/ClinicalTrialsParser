  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the amount of compound present in the blood
      (relative bioavailability) after a single administration of GLPG0634 as a tablet versus a
      capsule in fasted conditions in male healthy subjects.

      Also, the effect of food on the bioavailability of the tablet formulation will be studied as
      well as the safety and tolerability of single oral doses of GLPG0634 given either as capsule
      or tablet.

    <description>To characterize and compare the amount of GLPG0634 and metabolite in plasma (relative bioavailability) in male healthy subjects after a single administration of either a capsule or tablet formulation in a fasted condition. For the tablet formulation, also the amount of GLPG0634 and metabolite in plasma will be evaluated after fasting and in fed condition.</description>
