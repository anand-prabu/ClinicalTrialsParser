            "textblock": "We propose to study the impact of BIA screening on anxiety and primary prevention strategies\n      for lymphedema development among patients with recent surgery for breast cancer.  Currently,\n      professional societies recommend scheduled follow-up visits to screen for lymphedema after\n      recovery from breast cancer (e.g., 6-week, 3-month, 6-month visits with a certified\n      lymphedema therapist).  Screening involves a discussion of lymphedema symptoms and risk\n      reduction strategies, measurement of the affected limb with a tape measure, and physical\n      inspection for physical changes consistent with lymphedema.  In the proposed study, patients\n      will be randomly assigned to the addition of BIA screening vs. usual care.  At each\n      screening visit, all patients will be assessed for their current lymphedema risk behaviors,\n      as outlined by the National Lymphedema Network (7).  To evaluate anxiety levels, all\n      patients will be asked to fill out the Beck Anxiety Inventory, a validated screening tool\n      used in prior studies of patients with breast cancer (8,9).  This questionnaire will be\n      administered at each follow-up lymphedema screening visit, and the baseline will be\n      administered at the preoperative visit.  For patients randomly assigned to BIA screening,\n      this involves the placement of adhesive electrodes on the each wrist and an ankle, followed\n      by connection of the electrodes to the BIA machine, which then uses a painless electrical\n      impulse to measure impedance of flow and thus asymmetry in the extracellular lymphedema\n      volume between the 2 upper limbs (6,10).  Statistical analysis will involve comparison of\n      lymphedema risk behaviors and anxiety levels between those patients with vs. without BIA\n      screening."
