  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalization for kidney stones in the Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) population is
      common, particularly among Crohn's patients who had a small bowel resection. This patient
      population experiences a lifetime occurrence of kidney stone formation as high as 25%
      accompanied with a high rate of recurrence (the typical rate of stone formation is ~10% in
      the non IBD population). Giving oral calcium is used to bind oxalate in the intestine in an
      attempt to reduce the amount of oxalate that is absorbed into the body and to reduce urinary
      oxalate levels. However, there are no defined guidelines for the optimum dosing of calcium.
      This study's primary objective is to scientifically define an appropriate range of calcium
      supplementation that reduce the level of oxalate found in the urine of patients living with
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      The primary objective of this study is to establish optimal oral calcium supplementation in
      Crohn's patients who have had an ileal bowel resection. This population is at high risk for
      calcium oxalate kidney stones, a direct consequence of extensive gut malabsorption and
      enteric hyperoxaluria. The benefit of providing oral calcium in this patient population (as
      a means to reduce intestinal oxalate absorption) is known, however, there are no appropriate
      targets for calcium dosing, which is presently performed empirically or not at all. Our goal
      is to establish simple, safe and practical guidelines for calcium supplementation.

    <description>Molar ratio of urinary calcium:oxalate in relation to the supersaturation product of calcium oxalate will be calculated from the 24-hour urine test.
The patient will take dietary calcium for 4 days and then we will evaluate their urine chemistry. Previous studies indicate 4 days is an acceptable period to allow for metabolic and urinary equilibration of calcium. Additionally, 24-hour urine collections are considered the standard for urinalysis in comparison to spot urine chemistry.  The initial data, prior to calcium supplementation, will serve as the control, providing the patient's baseline risk for kidney stone formation.</description>
