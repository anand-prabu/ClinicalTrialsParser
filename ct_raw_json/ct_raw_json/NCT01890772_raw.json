This pilot study is designed to test whether the addition of\n      vitamin D, to the three drugs (Incivek (telaprevir), Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a), and\n      ribavirin) that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of\n      hepatitis C, can help eliminate the HCV from the body. Currently, doctors are unsure if the\n      addition of vitamin D to prescribed hepatitis C therapy will have any effects on how the\n      body clears the virus.\n\n      Once enrolled, participants will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to receive\n      telaprevir + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin + vitamin D3 (treatment group) or telaprevir\n      + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin (control group).  A total of 80 participants, of all\n      races/ethnicities, will be included in this study, at 5 to 10 VA hospital study sites (10 -\n      20 participants/site).\n\n      Participants assigned to the treatment group will begin a lead-in phase where they will\n      receive 5,000 IU of vitamin D3 per day. Every two weeks during the lead-in phase,\n      participants will be tested to determine the Vitamin D level in their blood, as well as\n      other tests, including HCV RNA (to determine the amount of virus present) and calcium\n      levels. Once an adequate level of Vitamin D is detected in participants' blood, participants\n      will begin treatment with telaprevir + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin + vitamin D3\n      (15,000 IU/week) for 12 weeks.\n\n      Participants randomized to the control group will immediately begin treatment with\n      telaprevir + peginterferon alfa-2a + ribavirin for 12 weeks.  At the end of Week 12 the\n      participants' involvement in the study will be complete.\n\n      Adverse events and effects of vitamin D3 will be obtained by assessing participants' medical\n      history, physical examination, and blood tests at clinic visits. HCV RNA will be assessed at\n      Screening, Day 1, Week 2, 4, 8 and 12."
