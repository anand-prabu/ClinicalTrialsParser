Peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed by therapy used to\n      kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody\n      plus peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have refractory or\n      recurrent ovarian epithelial cancer."

Determine the normal organ and tumor dosimetry with yttrium Y 90 monoclonal\n      antibody MN-14 using indium In 111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 as pretherapy in patients with\n      advanced ovarian epithelial cancer. II. Evaluate the extent and duration of antitumor\n      response in these patients on this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody MN-14 (90Y\n      hMN-14). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) on days -17 to -13,\n      followed by leukapheresis on days -14 to -12. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not\n      harvested, bone marrow is also collected. Patients receive pretherapy targeting consisting\n      of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody MN-14 over 30 minutes on day -7. At least 1 confirmed\n      tumor site must be targeted. Patients receive 90Y hMN-14 IV over 30-45 minutes on day 0.\n      PBSC is reinfused within 7 to 14 days after 90 hMN-14 administration. Patients receive G-CSF\n      SQ or IV until blood counts recover. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of 90Y\n      hMN-14 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as either\n      the dose at which no more than 1 of 6 patients experiences dose limiting toxicity or the\n      threshold radiation doses to lungs, kidney, and liver are reached. Patients are followed\n      weekly for 1 month, every 2 weeks for 2 months, monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 2\n      years, and then every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 48-51 patients will be accrued for this study within 5\n      years."
