Determine the qualitative and\n      quantitative toxic effects of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine the duration of\n      response and survival following bryostatin 1 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive bryostatin 1 by 72-hour continuous infusion every 2 weeks\n      until disease progression or 2 courses beyond complete remission. Response is assessed after\n      every 4 courses. Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be entered into this study over\n      1.25 years."
