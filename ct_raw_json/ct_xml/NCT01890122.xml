    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of alogliptin and metformin
      fixed-dose combination (FDC) as compared with alogliptin alone or metformin alone on Type 2
      Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).

      The drug being tested in this study is a fixed-dose combination tablet of alogliptin and
      metformin to treat people who have diabetes. This study will look at glycemic control in
      people who take alogliptin and metformin FDC compared with alogliptin or metformin alone.
      The study will enroll approximately 640 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need):

        -  Alogliptin 12.5 mg twice daily (BID)

        -  Metformin HCL 500 mg BID

        -  Alogliptin 12.5 mg and Metformin HCL 500 mg FDC BID

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient.

      All participants will be asked to take 2 tablets and 1 capsule twice a day at the same time
      each day throughout the study. All participants will be asked to record any hypoglycemic
      events in a diary. This multi-centre trial will be conducted in China, South Korea, and
      Malaysia. The overall time to participate in this study is 34 weeks. Participants will make
      11 visits to the clinic.
