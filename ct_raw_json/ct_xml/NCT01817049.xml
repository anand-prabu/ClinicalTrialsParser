  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Soccer accounts for more than 10% of all sport injuries in youth requiring medical
      attention. The injury rates in youth soccer where there is no established injury prevention
      program are estimated at 22-30 injuries/100 participants/year, or 3.4-5.6 injuries/1000
      participation hours. Risk reductions ranging from 32-43% have been found for youth players
      participating in neuromuscular training programs, such as the FIFA 11+, that include
      agility, balance training, and strengthening components. Although studies have shown that
      the FIFA 11+ is effective at reducing injuries, there is poor uptake of the program in the
      youth soccer community. It is therefore important to develop ways of delivering the program
      to soccer coaches and players in order to maximize its protective benefit. The Health Action
      Process Approach (HAPA) is a behavior change theory that has been used to successfully
      predict the uptake of health behaviours in a number of populations, such as cancer screening
      and exercise, but has not been tested in sport injury prevention settings.

      The primary objective of this study is to examine the effect of a HAPA-based coach education
      intervention on adherence to the FIFA 11+ in a group of female youth soccer players over the
      course of one outdoor and one indoor season. The secondary objective is to examine the
      dose-response relationship between program adherence and injury, comparing program adherence
      and injury rates in outdoor and indoor soccer. Our hypothesis is that teams whose coaches
      receive a HAPA-based intervention will have greater adherence to the program than teams
      whose coaches do not receive the intervention, and that that injury incidence will decrease
      as adherence to the program increases. It is expected that program adherence will be lower
      and injury rates will be higher in indoor soccer compared to outdoor soccer.

      The first wave of 16 teams will be recruited in spring 2013, and will be followed through
      the 2013 outdoor season, followed by the 2013-2014 indoor season. The second wave of 16
      teams will be recruited in fall 2013, and will be followed through the 2013-2014 indoor
      season, followed by the 2014 outdoor season.

    <description>An injury sustained during soccer participation will be recorded.
