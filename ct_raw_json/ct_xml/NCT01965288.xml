  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the clinical performance of the Biofinity Toric
      (comfilcon A) contact lens, versus Air Optix for Astigmatism (lotrafilcon B) over 1 month of
      daily wear.

    <textblock>
      Single masked, open label, randomized, bilateral, crossover study design comparing comfilcon
      A against lotrafilcon B lenses over 1 month of daily wear for each study lens.  Each subject
      will be randomized to wear the test lens (comfilcon A) or the control lens (lotrafilcon B)
      for one month of daily wear before repeating the schedule for the second pair without a
      washout period.

          -  Has had a self-reported visual exam in the last two years

          -  Is an adapted soft toric contact lens wearer

          -  Has a contact lens spherical prescription between +6.00 to - 10.00 (inclusive)

          -  Have no less than 0.75D of astigmatism and no more than 2.25D in both eyes.

          -  Can achieve best corrected spectacle distance visual acuity of 20/25 (0.10 logMAR) or
             better in each eye.

          -  Can achieve a distance visual acuity of 20/30 (0.18 logMAR) or better in each eye
             with the study contact lenses.

          -  Has clear corneas and no active ocular disease

          -  Has read, understood and signed the information consent letter.

          -  Patient contact lens refraction should fit within the available parameters of the
             study lenses.

          -  Is willing to comply with the wear schedule (at least 5 days per week, &gt; 8 hours/day
             assuming there are no contraindications for doing so).

          -  Is willing to comply with the visit schedule

        Exclusion Criteria:

        A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:

          -  Has a CL prescription outside the range of the available parameters of the study
             lenses.

          -  Has a spectacle cylinder less than -0.75D or more than -2.25 D of cylinder in either
             eye.

             either eye.

          -  Presence of clinically significant (grade 2-4) anterior segment abnormalities

          -  Presence of ocular or systemic disease or need of medications which might interfere
             with contact lens wear.

          -  Slit lamp findings that would contraindicate contact lens wear such as:

               -  Pathological dry eye or associated findings

               -  Pterygium, pinguecula, or corneal scars within the visual axis

               -  Neovascularization &gt; 0.75 mm in from of the limbus

               -  Giant papillary conjunctivitis (GCP) worse than grade 1

               -  Anterior uveitis or iritis (past or present)

               -  Seborrheic eczema, Seborrheic conjunctivitis

               -  History of corneal ulcers or fungal infections

               -  Poor personal hygiene

          -  Has a known history of corneal hypoesthesia (reduced corneal sensitivity)

          -  Has aphakia, keratoconus or a highly irregular cornea.

          -  Has Presbyopia or has dependence on spectacles for near work over the contact lenses.

          -  Has undergone corneal refractive surgery.

          -  Is participating in any other type of eye related clinical or research study.
