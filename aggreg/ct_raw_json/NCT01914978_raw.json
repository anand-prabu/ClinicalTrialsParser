Parents of children newly diagnosed with food allergy\n      (within the past year) will be randomized into either the treatment condition (handbook) or\n      a control condition (management of food allergy as usual).  Participants will complete study\n      questionnaires online at three time points: baseline (this will be before receiving the\n      handbook for the treatment group), post-intervention (2-3 weeks after baseline), and\n      follow-up (2-3 months after baseline).  Data will be analyzed for change on study outcome\n      measures and satisfaction with the handbook.  Parents in the control group will receive the\n      handbook following the conclusion of their participation in the study."
