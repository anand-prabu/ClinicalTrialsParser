Patients hospitalized in the period from the 1st of September\n      2013 to the 31st of March 2014 will be tested by an occupational therapist for dysphagia\n      within the first 24 hours of their hospitalization. The endpoints will be number of\n      hospitalization days, rehospitalisation and mortality. If the test is positive, the patient\n      will get a diet of a manageable consistency to avoid dysphagia."

Occupational therapists will be responsible for the\n      screening and the management of the dysphagia program. The nurses at the Lung Unit are all\n      introduced to the importance of the diet and the postural changes to prevent dysphagia, and\n      they will take over when the program has been implemented. In this project there will be\n      focus on dietary adjustments and postural changes. There is weak evidence for the effect of\n      preventing dysphagia by using thickened liquids and changing the posture, but even then\n      there is consensus for this practice among experienced occupational therapists (22). When\n      discharged the patients will receive a brochure about the importance of maintaining the\n      diet, it will be noted what diet they have to follow, and primary caregivers will also be\n      informed. Three weeks after discharge the patient will be visited by a primary occupational\n      therapist and a dietrist. The occupational therapist will retest the patient and the\n      dietrist will make sure the patient keep weight. Both will have a dialogue with the patient\n      about the importance of maintaining the diet.\n\n      There has not yet been made a calculation about how many patients to include, but according\n      to experiences from study 1 we expect to include 200 patients.\n\n      Outcome: number of hospitalization days, rehospitalisation within 30 days and within 180\n      days and mortality during hospitalization, within 30 days and within 180 days.\n\n      The study is a cross-sectional study. The collected data will be demographic data, level of\n      pneuonia, comorbidity, BMI, tooth-status, number of hospitalization days, rehospitalisation\n      and mortality. The study is registered by the Danish Data Protection Authority\n      (2008-58-0028)"
