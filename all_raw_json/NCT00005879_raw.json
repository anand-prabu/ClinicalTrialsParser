The use of LY353381 may be an effective way to prevent\n      the development of breast cancer in women who have hyperplasia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of LY353381 in preventing\n      breast cancer in women who have hyperplasia."

Patients are stratified according to cytologic status (hyperplasia with\n      atypia vs hyperplasia without atypia), mutation status (known carrier for BRCA1 or BRCA2\n      genes vs known not to be a carrier of mutant genes), menopausal status (premenopausal vs\n      postmenopausal), estrogen-receptor status, and participating center. Patients are randomized\n      to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral LY353381 hydrochloride once daily for 6 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo once daily for 6 months. Patients in both arms\n           then receive oral LY353381 hydrochloride for an additional 6 months.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then at 6 and 12 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks and then annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 210-220 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.5-3\n      years."
