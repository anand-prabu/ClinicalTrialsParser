We hypothesize no significant change in any of the endpoints listed in #1 from the\n           first to the second wait-list (pre-treatment) conditions.\n\n        3. We are interested in concordance between genital and subjective sexual arousal as\n           another endpoint. It is unknown if participation in the MIND group will significantly\n           increase concordance"
