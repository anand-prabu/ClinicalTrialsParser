The fourth group (control) receives the background\n      antiretroviral regimen alone. For each treatment group, 17 patients are enrolled. Treatment\n      is administered for 16 weeks, followed by a 32-week treatment extension, and a 2-week\n      follow-up period. The following are assessed throughout the trial: safety parameters (as\n      measured by hematology, clinical chemistry, urinalysis, and treatment-emergent adverse\n      events); virologic and immunologic activity; phenotypic and genotypic resistance; T-20\n      plasma levels; and pharmacokinetics of T-20 and oral antiretrovirals.
