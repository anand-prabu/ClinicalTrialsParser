Any concurrent intraocular condition in the study eye that, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, could require either medical or surgical intervention during the 90 day\n             study period.\n\n         18. Any concurrent ocular condition in the study eye which, in the opinion of the\n             investigator, could either increase the risk to the patient beyond what is to be\n             expected from standard procedures of intraocular injection, or which otherwise may\n             interfere with the injection procedure or with evaluation of efficacy or safety.\n\n         19.
