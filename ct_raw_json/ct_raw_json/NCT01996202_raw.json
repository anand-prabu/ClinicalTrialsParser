Persons of reproductive potential must agree to use an adequate method of\n             contraception throughout treatment and for at least 26 weeks after ipilimumab is\n             stopped. Sexually active WOCBP must use an effective method of birth control during\n             the course of the study, in a manner such that risk of failure is minimized. Before\n             study enrollment, WOCBP must be advised of the importance of avoiding pregnancy\n             during study participation and the potential risk factors for an unintentional\n             pregnancy. All WOCBP MUST have a negative pregnancy test before first receiving\n             ipilimumab. If the pregnancy test is positive, the patient must not receive\n             ipilimumab and must not be enrolled in the study."
