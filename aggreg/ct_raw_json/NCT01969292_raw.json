In the second phase, technological and machine user interface refinements will be\n      identified and completed. Finally, the third phase will be a sham controlled prospective\n      study of Colometer versus standard care in 100 consented average risk patients undergoing\n      screening colonoscopy as performed by 10 consented endoscopists."
