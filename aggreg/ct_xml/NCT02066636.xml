        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Target Population

          -  Subjects with histologically-or cytologically-documented NSCLC [squamous (SQ) or
             nonsquamous (NSQ)] who present with Stage IIIB/Stage IV disease (according to version
             7 of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer Staging Manual in
             Thoracic Oncology), or with recurrent or progressive disease following multimodal
             therapy (radiation therapy, surgical resection or definitive chemoradiotherapy for
             locally advanced disease)

          -  Subjects must have experienced disease progression or recurrence during or after at
             least one systemic therapy for advanced or metastatic disease

          -  First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease. Each
             subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch of an agent
             within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new line
             of therapy

          -  Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based chemotherapy is not considered
             as a separate regimen of therapy

          -  Subjects who received platinum-containing adjuvant, neoadjuvant or definitive
             chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease, and developed recurrent
             (local or metastatic) disease within 6 months of completing therapy are eligible

          -  Subjects with recurrent disease &gt;6 months after platinum-containing adjuvant,
             neoadjuvant or definitive chemoradiation therapy given for locally advanced disease,
             who also subsequently progressed during or after a platinum doublet-based regimen
             given to treat the recurrence are eligible

          -  Subjects with progression or recurrent disease during or after Epithelial Growth
             Factor Receptor (EGFR) or Anaplastic Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
             (TKI) regimen are eligible

          -  Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered as separate line
             of therapy

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Arm (ECOG) performance status (PS)

          -  PS 0 to 1

          -  PS 2

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Target Disease Exceptions

               -  Subjects with active central nervous system (CNS) metastases are excluded

               -  Subjects with carcinomatous meningitis

          2. Medical History and Concurrent Diseases

               -  Subjects with a history of interstitial lung disease

               -  Subjects with active, known or suspected autoimmune disease

               -  Subject whom participated in either arm of the following clinical trials
                  CA209-017, CA209-057, CA209-026, and CA184-104 or received prior treatment with
                  anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1) or anti-programmed death-ligand 1 (PDL1)
                  experimental agents
