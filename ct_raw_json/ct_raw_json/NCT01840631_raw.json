In this prospective\n      parallel arm, randomized trial, we will study the impact of nutritional counseling in an\n      individual vs. group setting.  We will enroll 80 patients, ages 9-17 years over a 6 month\n      period. There will be a total of four groups. Obese pre-adolescents (ages 9-12) and\n      adolescents (ages 13-17) will be randomized into two interventions: individual nutrition\n      counseling or group nutrition counseling.  Subjects will receive the same information in\n      both interventions.  All content will be developed prior to starting the intervention.  Each\n      group session will have a maximum of 7 children with 1 parent/caregiver per child and a\n      minimum of 5 children with a caregiver.  Group sessions will be one time a month for 60\n      minutes (30 minutes for dietetic session and 30 minutes for discussion/questions) and\n      individual sessions will be one time a month for 30 minutes.  There will be 6 sessions for\n      each group.\n\n      All groups will receive our standard of care for physical fitness counseling which includes\n      recommending 1 hour of physical activity a day and limiting screen time to less than 2 hours\n      a day.  All groups will be evaluated for depression and appropriately referred if found to\n      be depressed.  Behavioral strategies, like mindful eating, will be included in the nutrition\n      education."
