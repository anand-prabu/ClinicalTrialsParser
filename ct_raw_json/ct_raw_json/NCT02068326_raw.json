            "textblock": "Background: Although it is now possible to diagnose Borderline Personality disorder (BPD) in\n      adolescents younger than 18 years according to the DSM-V, and studies indicates that BPD can\n      be reliably diagnosed in adolescence only a few evidence based treatment programmes for\n      adolescent BPD exists. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT), including group psychotherapy,\n      has repeatedly shown to be effective in treating adult BPD, but in the case of adolescents,\n      only individual MBT have been tested and found to be effective.\n\n      Aims/hypotheses: We will test whether group based MBT (MBT-G), including an introductory\n      programme for patients (MBT-I) and their parents (MBT-P) is more effective than Treatment As\n      Usual (TAU) fin treating adolescents with emerging BPD. Further, we hypothesise that the\n      ability to mentalize will have a mediating effect on the relation between initial BPD\n      pathology and both primary and secondary outcome measures.\n\n      Methods/Design: 150 patients referred to child and adolescent psychiatric clinics in Region\n      Zealand will be randomized to either MBT-G or TAU. Inclusion criteria: Meeting DSM-V\n      BPD-criteria at the threshold (five criteria) or sub threshold level (4 criteria). Follow-up\n      will be at three and 12 months.\n\n      Discussion: Early intervention is especially important in relation to personality\n      psychopathology and has long-term benefits for patients, their families and society. In\n      addition to being cost effective, using the group modality in the treatment of BPD may have\n      several advantages. This is the first Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the\n      effectiveness of group based MBT for adolescents."
