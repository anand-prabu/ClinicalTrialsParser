There is a minimum 28-day washout between periods.\n      Part A will last approximately 16 weeks. Part B - multiple doses of dulaglutide administered\n      to participants with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Part B will last approximately 15\n      weeks.\n\n      Doses of 0.5 mg, 0.75 mg, and 1.5 mg of dulaglutide will be evaluated in this study."

Such participants will not be required to use contraception but must\n             test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment. Postmenopausal is defined as\n             at least 1 year post cessation of menses (without an alternative medical cause) or at\n             least 1 year of spontaneous amenorrhea, with follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) \u226540\n             milli international units per milliliter (mIU/mL).\n\n          -  Female participants who have undergone sterilization by tubal ligation: agree to use\n             a condom in conjunction with spermicidal gel, foam, cream, film or suppository from\n             the time of screening until 3 months after the last dose of investigational product.\n             Such participants must also test negative for pregnancy at the time of enrollment.\n\n        Participants with T2DM:\n\n          -  Have T2DM controlled with diet or exercise alone or with a single oral agent\n             antihyperglycemic medication (OAM) (metformin, sulfonylureas, meglitinides, acarbose\n             [or other disaccharidase inhibitors] or thiazolidinediones) for at least 3 weeks (3\n             months for thiazolidinediones) before admission Note that participants receiving\n             sulfonylureas, meglitinides or acarbose may participate only if this treatment is\n             stopped and metformin substituted.
