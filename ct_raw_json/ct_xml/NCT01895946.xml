    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a new
      drug, AZD5363, in patients with advanced cancer . This study will investigate how the body
      handles AZD5363 (ie, how quickly the body absorbs and removes the drug), the comparison of a
      capsule and a tablet formulation and the effect of food on AZD5363 tablet formulation.
