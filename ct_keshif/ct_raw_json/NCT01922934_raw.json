The initial assessment will use a computer program to take a diet and physical activity history and help patients choose personal treatment goals. Interested patients will be given a \"starter kit\" including self-monitoring tools and samples of meal replacement products. Subjects will be required to demonstrate self-monitoring of diet and physical activity to be eligible for the more intensive therapies. Patients will pay a 25% \"co-pay\" for the higher cost therapies. Patients will select a primary intensive therapy, but will be able to add or change depending on results, adherence and budget availability."

            "textblock": "Background: Obesity is common and it causes many medical problems in adults such as\n      diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, sleep apnea, heart attack, and stroke.  A\n      range of treatments have been shown to be effective to treat obesity.  These treatments\n      include intensive lifestyle modification, meal replacements, and weight loss medication.\n      However, most primary care settings do not provide very much obesity treatment.  This is\n      because primary care providers (PCPs) are not well trained and because reimbursement for the\n      treatments is not consistent.\n\n      Hypothesis: If PCPs have training in weight management and if most of the cost of treatment\n      is reimbursed, we believe that a \"toolbox\" of treatments can produce a clinically important\n      amount of weight loss in a large group of patients.\n\n      Design:  We are proposing to establish a registry of patients who have obesity and at least\n      one common medical condition related to their weight.  From the registry, we will randomly\n      select 350 people who will be offered treatments to assist with weight loss.  The remainder\n      of the patients in the registry can still receive treatment for obesity but will not have\n      reimbursement for the treatments.  We will conduct the study at Denver Health, which is a\n      large public health care system that treats a low income, ethnically diverse population. All\n      350 patients will be offered some self-monitoring tools for weight management and the chance\n      to take a computer assessment to select the right treatment for weight loss.  Patients who\n      complete this and who record their food intake and physical activity for 1 week will be\n      offered a \"Level 2\" treatment to help with weight loss.  The Level 2 treatments will\n      include: a voucher for a commercial weight loss program; an intensive group behavioral\n      weight loss program; meal replacements; fitness center membership; or weight loss\n      medication.  Patients will be able to choose which treatment they want, with the approval of\n      their PCP.  A Patient Navigator at Denver Health will help with the computer assessment and\n      with accessing the treatments.  Each patient who completes the self-monitoring will be\n      offered the Level 2 treatment for one year.  We are interested to see what percentage of\n      patients lose at least 5% of their starting weight.  We will also look at changes in blood\n      sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol, and we will look at how much it costs to do this\n      intervention and whether patients need less medication for their weight-related conditions\n      at the end of the study.\n\n      Impact: If the study is successful, we plan to take the results to the leaders at Denver\n      Health to see if they will make obesity treatment more broadly available for all patients\n      there."

            "textblock": "Background: Obesity is prevalent and is a root cause of many common medical conditions\n      affecting U.S. adults.  A range of treatment options have demonstrated efficacy in producing\n      weight loss and reducing health risks in randomized controlled trials.  However, very little\n      obesity treatment is currently delivered in most primary care settings.  Inadequate\n      reimbursement for treatment modalities and a lack of systematic training of primary care\n      providers (PCPs) are two of the major barriers to more widespread treatment.\n\n      Hypothesis:  If PCPs are given training and support for weight management, and if treatment\n      options with proven efficacy are offered to obese adults with weight related co-morbidities\n      with the majority of the treatment cost reimbursed, then clinically meaningful weight loss\n      will be produced in a significant number of these individuals at a reasonable cost.\n\n      Design:  This application proposes a 12 month intervention trial among obese adults cared\n      for at 4 primary care clinics affiliated with Denver Health (DH), an integrated health care\n      system serving an ethnically diverse medically underserved population.  From among a large\n      population of patients (~8,000) with obesity and at least one co-morbid condition, 350\n      individuals will be randomly selected to be offered a \"toolbox\" of treatment options.  The\n      remainder will be assigned to a control condition.  The \"toolbox\" will include: 1) meal\n      replacements; 2) group weight loss counseling; 3) membership at recreation centers; 4)\n      pharmacotherapy with phentermine; and 5) other options.  Patients in the intervention arm\n      will undergo an initial evaluation using an \"expert systems\" computer program.  They will\n      then be required to self-monitor diet and physical activity before gaining access to the\n      higher cost weight management services in the toolbox.  Primary care providers will help\n      patients choose treatment approaches, encourage adherence, and monitor success.  Patient\n      Navigators will assist patients in accessing prescribed treatments.  The primary outcome\n      will be the fraction of patients in each group who achieve a 5% weight loss after 12 months\n      of intervention.  Secondary outcomes will include uptake and utilization of treatment\n      options, changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors, and other health care utilization,\n      in particular outpatient medications for diabetes, hypertension, and lipids.  While the\n      treatment modalities to be used in this trial are not new, an intervention delivering a\n      toolbox of weight management services in a safety net clinical setting and examining the\n      effect on health care utilization is innovative.  The submitted letters of support attest to\n      the need for more data so that health care providers and payers can make evidence-based\n      decisions regarding the provision of obesity treatment to large patient populations.\n\n      Impact:  A positive result would encourage the broader adoption of a toolbox approach to\n      weight management in primary care settings.  A negative result would strongly suggest that\n      even with a \"best case scenario\" of training and support for obesity treatment, the primary\n      care clinic is not an effective route of delivery for weight management.  Either result\n      would be important in shaping future policy decisions about obesity treatment."
