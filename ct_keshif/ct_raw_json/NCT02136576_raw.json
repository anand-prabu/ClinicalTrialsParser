            "textblock": "Dentinal hypersensitivity commonly occurs in patients with gingival recession, resulting\n      from a reduced periodontium or in patients who have undergone non-surgical and surgical\n      periodontal therapy. When the gingiva recede, the root surfaces of the teeth are exposed. In\n      addition, after a non-surgical or surgical periodontal procedure, the cementum of the root\n      surface is removed as a result of scaling and root planing.  This leaves dentin exposed on\n      the root surface with open dentinal tubules.  In addition, dentin is less mineralized than\n      enamel and has a greater susceptibility to and a faster progression of root caries and\n      dentinal hypersensitivity. Root caries commonly occurs in patients who have undergone\n      periodontal therapy and extensive root caries often results in the extraction of the tooth.\n\n      Dental professionals often make a variety of recommendations to remedy dental\n      hypersensitivity, including the application of fluoride varnishes, anti-hypersensitivity\n      toothpaste, gingival grafting procedures and various restorative procedures, aiming to\n      occlude the dentinal tubules or desensitize the pulpal nerve endings.\n\n      Since the introduction of Caries Management By Risk Assessment (CAMBRA) in the Journal of\n      the California Dental Association in 2007, the marketplace for anti-caries products has\n      surged.  As a result, many approaches to the management of dental caries have been\n      introduced and dental practitioners and sales representatives have promoted several\n      anti-caries products.  In addition, the reduction or the abatement of the progression of\n      dental caries (coronal, root and interproximal) as a result of a caries management program\n      has been reported. Many caries management products have ingredients that include fluoride\n      and calcium phosphate (Amorphous Calcium Phosphate-Casein Phosphopeptide (Recaldent \u2122),\n      Tri-Calcium Phosphate \u2122 or Novamin \u2122).  Moreover, encouraging clinical findings have been\n      reported, including, but not limited to the reduction of white spot enamel lesions and\n      dentinal hypersensitivity.\n\n      The topical application of \"antihypersensitivity\" materials is a common recommendation\n      (least invasive of the \"standard of care\" recommendations) to diminish dentinal\n      hypersensitivity and will serve to provide data for the research study.  The study will\n      evaluate which of these products result in the greatest reduction of dentinal\n      hypersensitivity. The application of the experimental products for the reduction of dentinal\n      hypersensitivity is for research purposes.\n\n      The methods used to test sensitivity in this study have been used in published studies. The\n      VAS scale used in this study has also been used for tooth sensitivity studies. A 30%\n      decrease in VAS score has been shown to be clinically meaningful.\n\n      This pilot study would investigate the ability of anti-caries products to reduce dentinal\n      hypersensitivity when compared to a sensitivity-reducing dentifrice.  It would be a novel\n      contribution to the dental community if a material that is proven to reduce tooth decay is\n      also proven to reduce dentinal hypersensitivity.  The results may potentially have a\n      tremendous impact on the dental community because it may provide dental professionals a\n      scientifically-supported approach to improve the comfort and quality of life of periodontal\n      patients (patients who are treated for gum disease/ bone loss around teeth) and increase the\n      lifespan of teeth that undergo periodontal treatment."
