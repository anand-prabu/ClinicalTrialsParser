Treatment courses are\n      repeated every 28 days. In the absence of disease progression and toxicity, patients receive\n      up to 4 courses of treatment prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy, patients\n      demonstrating partial or complete response may receive an additional 12 courses of\n      treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8-12 weeks for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 50 patients."
