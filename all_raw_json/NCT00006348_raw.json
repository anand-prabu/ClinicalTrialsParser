Compare the antiemetic effect of ondansetron vs placebo in patients with\n      advanced cancer who suffer from chronic nausea and emesis that is not due to antineoplastic\n      therapy (i.e., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic therapy). II. Determine\n      the toxicity of ondansetron in these patients. III. Evaluate the use of other concurrent\n      antiemetics in these patients when treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to abdominal carcinomatosis (yes vs no), renal insufficiency\n      (creatinine less than 2.0 mg/dL vs creatinine at least 2.0 mg/dL), type of cancer (brain vs\n      gastrointestinal vs other), and narcotic use (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral ondansetron twice daily on days 1-7 and\n      oral placebo twice daily on days 8-14 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Arm II:\n      Patients receive oral placebo twice daily on days 1-7 and oral ondansetron twice daily on\n      days 8-14 in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients (50 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 1 year."
