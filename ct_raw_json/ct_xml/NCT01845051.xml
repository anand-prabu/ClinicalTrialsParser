    <textblock>
      The researchers investigated the relationship between migraine and allergy. For this
      purpose, the researchers designed a controlled study to evaluate nasal symptoms and signs;
      and to perform Specific Immunoglobulin E  (IgE) measurements in migraine patients and
      healthy subjects. According to these results the prevalence of allergic rhinitis in migraine
      group was planned to be compared to that of the healthy controls, statistically.

    <description>Blood samples were taken from study and control group for the determination of Specific IgE panel against six different allergens: (1) fungi, (2) grass pollens, (3) tree pollens, (4) wild herbs, (5) mite 1, (6) mite 2. For all of specific IgE panels, &lt;0,7 RU/ml was negative; and &gt;0,7 RU/ml was Positive.</description>

    <description>Symptoms were assessed with a questionnaire for the presence and severity of allergic rhinitis (AR) symptoms on a scale of 0-3 (0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). Symptoms of AR (Nasal discharge, nasal congestion, itching and sneezing) were graded between 0-3.</description>
