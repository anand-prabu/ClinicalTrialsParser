    <textblock>
      This is an expanded access programme to make Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) available to
      patients with HBeAg-negative chronic hepatitis B in Morocco. Patients will receive Pegasys
      180 mcg subcutaneously weekly for 48 weeks and efficacy and safety will be recorded during
      treatment and for 24 weeks of follow-up.
