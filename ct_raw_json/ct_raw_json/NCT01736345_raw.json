            "textblock": "Basic science advances in genomics have provided great promise for improving human health\n      and reducing the burden of cancer in the United States. The recent successes in genome-wide\n      association studies (GWAS) and related technologies in identifying genetic changes\n      associated with a variety of common diseases have fueled the rapidly growing field of\n      personalized medicine. The promise of personalized medicine is the ability to tailor the\n      treatment or screening of individual patients based on their genotype. Many have highlighted\n      the urgent need for multidisciplinary translational research that focuses on how to advance\n      gene discoveries into effective clinical applications. Genetic screening for cancer\n      susceptibility, one application of personalized medicine, has become a standard\n      evidence-based practice in cancer prevention. Given the complexity of genetic information\n      and the potential social and psychological sequellae, two in-person visits (e.g. pre-test\n      and post-test counseling) with genetic specialists are recommended for delivery of genetic\n      testing for cancer susceptibility. With an increasing demand for genetic services, the two\n      in-person visit delivery model presents barriers to widespread dissemination of genetic\n      testing for disease susceptibility. Innovative delivery models for effective, efficient\n      genetic risk communication that result in behavior change are needed. Telephone delivery of\n      genetic services is one innovative and efficient delivery model that has the potential to\n      expand genetic services to diverse clinical systems and address the insufficient genetic\n      workforce as an increasing number of genetic applications enter clinical practice. While\n      providers and patients identify advantages to telephone delivery of genetic services, they\n      also recognize potential disadvantages particularly in the setting of a positive test\n      result. Thus, evaluation of the psychosocial and behavioral impact of innovations to genetic\n      service delivery (i.e. telephone communication) in diverse populations and among vulnerable\n      subgroups are needed to optimize the health benefits, and minimize the risks of broad\n      dissemination of clinical genetic testing for cancer susceptibility.\n\n      The goal of this research is to evaluate the psychological, behavioral and economic outcomes\n      (i.e. risks and benefits) of an innovative and efficient delivery model of genetic services,\n      telephone communication, as compared to the current standard, in-person communication of\n      genetic test results. The investigators expect this research to inform evidence based\n      practice guidelines and potentially change the paradigm of delivery of genetic services for\n      disease susceptibility."
