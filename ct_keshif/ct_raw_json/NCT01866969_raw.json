Identify patient and caregiver factors associated with increased caregiver burden and\n      decreased quality of life in caregivers of older adults with cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine characteristics of informal caregivers of older adults with cancer admitted to\n      hospital.\n\n      II. Determine type and amount of care informal caregivers provide for older adults with\n      cancer admitted to hospital.\n\n      III. Determine quality of life in informal caregivers of older adults with cancer admitted\n      to hospital.\n\n      IV. Identify caregiver needs, both informational and resource related. V. Explore the\n      association between re-admission to the hospital within 30 days and caregiver burden.\n\n      VI. Explore whether feedback of information attained from the assessment of the caregiver\n      influences services implemented by the health care team.\n\n      VII. Determine reasons for non-participation.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Caregivers complete a questionnaire about their sociodemographics, physical health, social\n      supports, social activity, mental health and caregiver burden. They will also provide an\n      assessment of the person they care for."
