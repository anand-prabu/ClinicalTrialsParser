These samples will enable investigators to optimize\n      laboratory methods and explore implementation challenges associated with the ex vivo\n      challenge model. The first objective is to assess which HIV virus is best for use in the\n      model. The second objective is to determine the best endpoint for the assay.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to collect an adequate number of cervical and vaginal\n      biopsies to support the optimization of an ex vivo challenge model. This ex vivo challenge\n      model has been and will continue to be used in topical microbicide clinical trials to\n      predict the efficacy of candidate drugs."

            "textblock": "The development of surrogates to predict HIV prevention product safety and efficacy is a\n      high priority. An ex vivo challenge model is one such promising surrogate. Colonic tissue\n      exposed to rectally applied microbicides in vivo and then challenged with HIV in the lab\n      showed significant reduction in HIV replication when compared to tissue exposed to placebo\n      gel. Currently, the ex vivo challenge model for ectocervical and vaginal tissue is being\n      developed at the Dezzutti lab at the Magee Womens Research Institute in Pittsburgh, PA.\n      Questions which need to be addressed in order to optimize the model include which HIV virus\n      is most appropriate to use to challenge the tissue, is qPCR a more appropriate endpoint and\n      marker of infection, and can frozen tissue perform as well as fresh tissue in the challenge\n      model.\n\n      In this study, we will collect vaginal and cervical biopsies to use in the optimization of\n      laboratory procedures. We will obtain the sample(s) from healthy HIV negative women. Samples\n      will be collected and taken to Magee-Womens Research Institute as laboratory specimens.\n      Written consent will be obtained by an investigator or co-investigator prior to the\n      collection of any samples."

Willing and able to give informed consent to take place in the study\n\n          5. Willing to undergo a pelvic examination and genital biopsies\n\n          6. Willing to provide contact information\n\n          7. Agree to be sexually abstinent for two weeks beginning one week prior to the\n             enrollment visit\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Menopausal\n\n          2.

Reports a course of antibiotic therapy in the 14 days prior to enrollment\n\n          6. Known history of platelet disorder or coagulapathy.\n\n          7. Participation in another microbicide or contraceptive study or a study involving\n             cervical and/or vaginal biopsies within one month of enrollment\n\n          8. Use of any spermicide or spermicide-lubricated condom within one week of enrollment.\n\n          9. Use of any internal vaginal device or product with the exception of tampons within\n             one week of enrollment\n\n         10.
