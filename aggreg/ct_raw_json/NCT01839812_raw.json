The investigators hypothesized that postoperative\n      dexamethasone levels are highly variable, and that the infant stress response is inversely\n      related to the amount of dexamethasone measured in the blood.  To test this theory the\n      investigators simultaneously measured blood levels of dexamethasone and cortisol at critical\n      time points during the perioperative period for infants undergoing CPB for CHD surgery."

At each of the 7 time points blood was\n      analyzed for levels of the following; dexamethasone, cortisol, ACTH, Interleukin (IL) 10, IL\n      8, and IL 6.  In addition, the innate stress response was evaluated with a cosyntropin\n      stimulation test.  Each patient received a 1 mcg/1.73 m2 intravenous dose of cosyntropin at;\n      anesthesia induction, prior to dexamethasone (time 1), ICU arrival (time 3), and 24 hours\n      after ICU arrival (time 7).  Cortisol levels were measured before (time 1, 3, and 7) and 30\n      minutes after cosyntropin administration (time 1a, 3a, and 7a)."
