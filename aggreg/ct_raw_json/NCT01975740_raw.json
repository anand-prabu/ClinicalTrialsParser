Positioned behind the head of the volunteer, the therapist performed manual contact (pisiform, ulnar edge and the last three fingers) with the underside of the costal cartilage of the 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th rib, and guiding forearms toward the shoulders of the corresponding side. In the inspiratory phase, the therapist gently pulled the points of contact with both hands, in the direction of the head, yet slightly lateral, accompanying the elevation movement of the ribs. During exhalation, the therapist deepened contact toward the inner costal, maintaining resistance throughout the inspiratory phase. In the breaths following, the therapist sought to gain traction and smooth increase in the deepening of contacts. This maneuver was performed in two sets of ten deep breaths, with a one minute interval between them.",

The device emitted an infrared light on the reflective markers which was captured by eight cameras around the room, allowing the spatial determination of each marker. Thus, changes in lung volumes were calculated at each of the three compartments of the rib cage: pulmonary or upper ribcage (Rc, p), abdominal or lower ribcage (Rc, a) and abdomen (Ab). After the first OEP evaluation, a nontoxic, hypoallergenic pen was used to mark the placement of the dorsal reflective markers allowing the patient to lay in supine for the manual technique or the sham. The markers were then placed at the exact same anatomical points for reevaluation.",
