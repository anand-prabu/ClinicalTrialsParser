In addition, topical treatment methods are compared with\n      the most effective 'drug of choice' for onychomycosis according the current guidelines i.e.\n      oral medication with terbinafine.\n\n      Altogether 90 patients (30 patients per group) who have culture or KOH stain verified\n      onychomycosis are randomly allocated into three treatment groups to receive either topical\n      treatment or oral medication for toe- or fingernail onychomycosis classified according to\n      the current guidelines as follows:\n\n        1. White superficial onychomycosis (WSO)\n\n        2. Distal and lateral subungual onychomycosis (DLSO)\n\n        3. Proximal subungual onychomycosis (PSO)\n\n        4. [Total dystrophic onychomycosis) (TDO)] [Excluded]\n\n        5. [Candidal onychomycosis] [Excluded]\n\n      Participants are randomized into three groups to receive:\n\n        1. Topical treatment: 30 % resin lacquer (Abicin\u00ae)\n\n        2. Topical treatment: 5 % amorolfine lacquer (Loceryl\u00ae)\n\n        3. Oral medication: 250 mg terbinafine\n\n      All patients visit at outpatient department before the launch of the study, and three and\n      nine months thereafter. Clinical examination is done by four physicians. At every visit, the\n      panel of laboratory tests (S-Krea, S-GT, B-TVK), nail samples for mycological culturing and\n      KOH staining (Sk-SienVi), and digital photographs are taken from the most severely affected\n      onychomycotic nails. At the end of the study, all patients are ordered to discontinue using\n      the resin- or amorolfine lacquer four weeks before the last visit (washout period). During\n      the trial, all participants are contacted at least twice by phone in order to monitor the\n      patient's compliance and willingness to continue in the trial.\n\n      In order to control safety and assess potential contraindications for terbinafine,\n      amorolfine or resin, blood samples regarding kidney and liver function are taken in the\n      beginning of the study, as well as at three and nine months, thereafter. The patients'\n      permanent medication is verified against terbinafine, amorolfine and resin in order to\n      exclude potential cross-reactions between the patient's permanent medication and current\n      antifungal treatment. Sensitivity or allergy for terbinafine, amorolfine or resin is taken\n      into account, and if any symptoms of allergic reactions appear, the study is discontinued\n      for this particular patient."
