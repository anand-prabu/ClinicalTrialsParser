The biopsies are scheduled using a dedicated Microsoft Access database (\"Biopsy\n      Database\"), that is maintained on the central servers of the University Hospitals Leuven.\n      Patients who have an unexplained change in renal allograft function, undergo additional\n      clinically indicated indication biopsies. These biopsies are also recorded in the\n      aforementioned Microsoft Access Database.\n\n      All clinical data, including pretransplant donor and recipient characteristics, and\n      post-transplant follow-up data are directly stored and maintained in a prospectively\n      collected electronic database (CCL database until 06/2012, transferred to the central KWS\n      database in 2012). This electronic database is the only existing clinical database for these\n      patients, and contains all clinical patient charts. No written records are collected.\n\n      All renal allograft biopsies will be scored by a single renal pathologist according to the\n      most recent Banff classification, blinded for the clinical parameters and timing of the\n      biopsy. These rescoring data are directly entered in the dedicated Microsoft Access database\n      (\"Biopsy Database\")."
