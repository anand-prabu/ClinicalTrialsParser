Recent studies indicate that the rate of\n      kidney volume increase is hastened by excess dietary protein, salt, and potential net acid\n      precursors, and slowed by increased water intake sufficient to lower plasma vasopressin\n      levels.\n\n      Diets are commonly prescribed to treat ADPKD and other renal patients with disease near the\n      end-stage, but there is currently no specific diet prescription that takes potentially\n      harmful dietary elements into account for ADPKD patients in the earliest stages of the\n      disease. This study will examine a novel diet for ADPKD created by the researcher termed the\n      ADPKD diet."
