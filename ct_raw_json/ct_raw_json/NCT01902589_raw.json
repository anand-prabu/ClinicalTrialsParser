The treatment is\n      usually empiric and includes antibiotic treatment usually Amoxycillin and Clarithromycin or\n      Metronidazole. Between 40 to 70 % of the pathogens are resistant to those drugs, and it is\n      important to characterize the specific sensitivity of the pathogens in any specific area and\n      in pediatric population. The aims of this study is to assess the sensitivity of HP in\n      pediatric population in Northern Israel."

The second aim was to\n      determine if in vitro resistance is being reflected  in vivo too.\n\n      Should  the investigators find high rates of H pylori resistance to Clarithromycin,  the\n      investigators will have to reconsider the recommendation to use Clarithromycin as the first\n      line treatment for H pylori.\n\n      Our research group will conclude 100 children in the ages of 1-18 years, evaluated for\n      recurrent abdominal pain, iron deficiency anemia, failure to thrive by an upper  endoscopy,\n      biopsy specimens taken for a rapid urease test, for histology, for culture and for\n      antibiotic susceptibility testing.\n\n      Biopsy specimens for histology will be fixed in formalin, embedded in paraffin and sectioned\n      and stained with hematoxylin and eosin.\n\n      The microbiological workup will include an imprint of the biopsy on a slide followed by a\n      gram stain for the purpose of demonstrating H. pylori in situ.
