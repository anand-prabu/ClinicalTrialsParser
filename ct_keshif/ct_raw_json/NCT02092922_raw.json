Received at least 2 prior lines of therapy (induction therapy and stem cell\n                  transplant \u00b1 maintenance are to be considered a single line of therapy).\n\n               2. Received at least 2 cycles of a bortezomib-containing regimen and 2 cycles of a\n                  lenalidomide-containing regimen, unless intolerant to these agents (defined as\n                  requiring discontinuation due to toxicity).\n\n               3. Disease refractory to a carfilzomib-containing regimen and/or a pomalidomide\n                  containing regimen. Refractory is defined as either failure to achieve a minimal\n                  response (MR) or better while on therapy, or development of progressive disease\n                  (PD) while on therapy or within 60 days from last dose of therapy.\n\n          -  Measurable multiple myeloma disease, defined as meeting at least one of the following\n             criteria within 14 days prior to first dose of study drug:\n\n               1. A monoclonal Ig (M-protein) concentration on serum protein electrophoresis\n                  (SPEP) of \u2265 1.0 g/dL.\n\n               2. Measurable urinary light chain secretion by quantitative analysis using urine\n                  protein electrophoresis (UPEP) of \u2265 200 mg/24 hours.\n\n               3. Involved serum free light chain (FLC) level \u2265 10 mg/dL, provided the serum FLC\n                  ratio is abnormal.\n\n          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0, 1 or 2 within 14\n             days prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n          -  Adequate hematology, hepatic and renal function laboratory values within 14 days\n             prior to first dose of study drug.\n\n          -  Additional criteria exist.\n\n        Key Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Prior treatment with filanesib (ARRY-520) or any other KSP inhibitor.\n\n          -  Past or current plasma cell leukemia.\n\n          -  Primary amyloidosis (amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma is allowed).\n\n          -  POEMS syndrome (polyneuropathy, organomegaly, endocrinopathy, monoclonal protein and\n             skin changes).\n\n          -  Autologous or allogeneic stem cell or bone marrow transplant within 3 months prior to\n             first dose of study drug.\n\n          -  Concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies (other than multiple myeloma) with\n             less than a 2-year disease-free interval at the time of first dose of study drug.\n             Patients with adequately resected basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin,\n             carcinoma in situ of the cervix or breast, or Stage 1 prostate cancer are eligible\n             irrespective of the time of diagnosis.\n\n          -  Use of an investigational agent that is not expected to be cleared by the time of\n             first dose of study drug or that has been demonstrated to have prolonged side\n             effects. Patients must have recovered from all side effects to a Grade 0 or 1 (except\n             alopecia and neuropathy).\n\n          -  Any severe concurrent disease or condition (including severe graft-versus-host\n             disease, requirement for dialysis, symptomatic congestive heart failure [New York\n             Heart Association Class III or IV], unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia)\n             which, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for\n             study participation.\n\n          -  Known positive serology for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), active hepatitis\n             B and/or hepatitis C.\n\n          -  Acute active infection requiring treatment.\n\n          -  Additional criteria exist."
