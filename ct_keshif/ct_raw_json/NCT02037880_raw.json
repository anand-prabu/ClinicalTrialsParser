In MPSIII the predominant symptoms occur due to accumulation within the central\n      nervous system (CNS), including the brain and spinal cord, resulting in cognitive decline,\n      motor dysfunction, and eventual death.\n\n      In anticipation for future therapeutic studies for MPSIIIA and MPSIIIB, we are performing a\n      natural history study with the following goals:\n\n        1. To identify individual rates of decline in motor and cognitive function in a cohort of\n           potential clinical trial patients.\n\n        2. To study the natural history of outcome measures in order to assess their\n           appropriateness as outcomes in an eventual trial.\n\n        3. To establish baseline functional data in patients who will be potential candidates for\n           an eventual trial.\n\n        4. To identify biomarkers of disease progression over a 12-month interval, including\n           changes in brain MRI and in cerebrospinal fluid.\n\n      This study will last a year. Patients in this study will need to come to Nationwide\n      Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio three times: at enrollment (visit 1), at 6 months\n      (visit 2), and at 12 months (visit 3). During visits 1 and 3, an MRI and a lumbar puncture\n      will be performed."
