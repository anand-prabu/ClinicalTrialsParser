The amount of proteases ( plasmin/plasminogen ) excreted in urine predicts the\n      development of preeclampsia  at pregnant  patients with type 1 diabetes.\n\n      If we see a correlation between the excretion of plasmin/plasminogen in urine in patients\n      with type 1 diabetes and the development of preeclampsia, the proteases might be used as a\n      marker for these patients in the diabetes group that develop the disease and eventually also\n      as a marker for the severity.\n\n      In these high risk groups it is possible that we would be able to optimize their outpatient\n      visits even more in trying to lower the amount of preterm births.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      The study is an observational, longitudinal - prospective study. Women with pregestational\n      type 1 diabetes are included when they show up for their first outpatient pregnancy visit\n      around the 9th weeks gestation.\n\n      Selection of patients:\n\n      The selection of patients is based on pregnant outpatients with Type 1 diabetes, over 18\n      years, from Gynecological- obstetric department, Aarhus University hospital - Skejby, and\n      Gynecological- Obstetric department, Odense University Hospital.\n\n      Background information:\n\n      Registration of date of birth, sex, weight, height, hip-waist ratio, and smoking status will\n      be noted.\n\n      Furthermore, we will register current medical treatment, duration of diabetes,\n      pregestational bloodpressure, parity and HbA1c.\n\n      Also post-partum registration of length of gestation, weight of placenta, way of delivery\n      (natural birth or cesarean section), umbilical cord  pH, apgar score and the infant weight\n      will be noted.\n\n      Effect variable:\n\n      Clinical:\n\n      Weight, height, BMI, smoking status,  microalbuminuria/proteinuria . Blood pressure\n      (systolic, diastolic, mean arterial pressure). Weight of placenta\n\n      Measurements in blood tests:\n\n      Se-creatinine, p-Na+, p-K+. P-plasminogen, P-albumin, Aldosterone.\n\n      Measurements in 50 ml newly \"spot urine\":\n\n      Plasmin, plasminogen, ENaC peptide fragment (analyses in location of development,)\n      Proteolytic activity, Prostatin, Creatinine, Na+, K+, Aldosterone, Albumin\n\n      Study process:\n\n      Visits, including bloodsampels and spoturine collection:\n\n      Women with pregestational type 1 diabetes are included. In first trimester, around pregnancy\n      week 9-14 an urinesampel is collected. Blood pressure is measured and urine\n      plasmin/plasminogen, albumin and aldosterone are analyzed.  After that urine- and blood\n      samples are collected in pregnancyweek 20, 28,32, 36 and perhaps 38. Plasmin/plasminogen\n      analyses, regarding to detect the excretion compared to the development in PE, are made.\n      Around pregnancy week 28 a single 24 hour blood pressure measurement are done according to\n      observe the daily variation.\n\n      Following outcomes are observed: The development of preeclampsia, defined by hypertension (\n      > 140/90 mmHg), and proteinuria ( >0,3 g/24 hour). Preterm delivery and light for\n      gestational age.\n\n      Data- analysis methods:\n\n      This is an observational longitudinal-prospective study which includes approximately 130\n      pregnant patients with Type 1 diabetes. Patients are included from Skejby and Odense\n      University Hospitals in cooperation.\n\n      Results are evaluated statistically by uni - and multivariate logistic regression analysis.\n\n      Population size evaluation:\n\n      Similar (Danish) observational prospective studies of urine- biomarkers (including albumin)\n      ability to predict preeclampsia/preterm delivery in patients with pregestational type 1\n      diabetes have achieved high significance data with spotsamples at 130 -170 patients. With\n      the participation of two centers it seems realistic and adequately to include 130 patients\n      within the settings of a Ph. D. study. Every year an amount of 50-60 patients are seen in\n      the outpatient ward at Skejby- and Odense Universityhospitals (in all approximately 100-120\n      patients)."
