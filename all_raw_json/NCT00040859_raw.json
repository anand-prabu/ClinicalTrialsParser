Treatment repeats every 21 days for at least 2 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete response (CR) receive 2\n      additional courses after CR.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then every 3 weeks (prior to each course of\n      chemotherapy).\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 44 patients will be accrued for this study within 26 months."
