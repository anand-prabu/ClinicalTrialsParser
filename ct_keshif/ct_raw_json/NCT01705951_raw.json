Therefore, finding optimal intervention strategies to combat these growing\n      epidemics is imperative. We are investigating the efficacy of resistance training to\n      ameliorate endothelial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and insulin resistance\n      in four groups: presence or absence of resistance training with or without cessation\n      treatment + nicotine replacement.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that resistance training will improve cardiovascular function\n      in smokers; however, the responses will be better in those who also stop smoking. In\n      addition, resistance training will decrease smoking, however, the effects of counseling and\n      nicotine replacement alone or counseling and nicotine replacement in conjunction with\n      resistance training will be better than resistance training alone."

Those receiving RT work with a certified\n      personal trainer 3 times per week for 12 weeks at 60 minutes each session. Those receiving\n      NRT use the nicotine patch daily for 12 weeks and call the California Smoker's Helpline for\n      smoking cessation counseling. Those in the control group do not receive any intervention and\n      maintain their current lifestyle and habits.\n\n      At week 13, participants return for three post-intervention assessments.\n\n      At week 26, survey data is collected to assess changes in lifestyle habits."
