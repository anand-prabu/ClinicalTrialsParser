The current MDE should be\n             confirmed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI).\n\n          -  The patient has an inadequate response to at least one antidepressant treatment\n             (including the treatment the patient is taking at screening) in the current MDE, as\n             documented by self-report as less than a pre-defined response on the Massachusetts\n             General Hospital Antidepressant Treatment Response Questionnaire (ATRQ).\n\n          -  The patient has a pre-defined Montgomery Aasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)\n             total score, and a pre-defined Clinical Global Impression - Severity of Illness\n             (CGI-S) score at screening, and has had the current MDE for \u226510 weeks.\n\n          -  The patient is currently treated for the current MDE with an adequate selective\n             serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor\n             (SNRI) antidepressant treatment for \u22656 weeks, at the same dosage for \u22652 weeks.\n\n          -  The patient has sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep and/or difficulty\n             staying asleep and/or problem waking up too early) confirmed by a pre-defined\n             Insomnia Severity Index (ISI) score.\n\n          -  The patient agrees to protocol-defined use of effective contraception.\n\n        Entry Criteria to Treatment Period (Baseline Visit):\n\n          -  The patient still fulfils DSM-IV-TR\u2122 criteria for MDE.\n\n          -  The patient received the same SSRI or SNRI antidepressant treatment at adequate dose\n             during the entire lead-in period.\n\n          -  The patient has a pre-defined MADRS total score.\n\n          -  The patient's improvement in the MADRS total score is a pre-defined percentage\n             compared to screening.\n\n          -  The patient has a pre-defined Clinical Global Impression - Global Improvement (CGI-I)\n             score.\n\n          -  The patient has sleep disturbances (difficulty falling asleep and/or difficulty\n             staying asleep and/or problem waking up too early) confirmed by a pre-defined ISI\n             score.\n\n          -  The patient has sleep disturbances confirmed by pre-defined Latency to Persistent\n             Sleep (LPS) and pre-defined Sleep Efficiency (SE).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol\n             or is unsuitable for any reason.\n\n        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply."
