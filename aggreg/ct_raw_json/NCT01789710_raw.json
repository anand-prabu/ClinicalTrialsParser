            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of an internet-based contingency\n      management program for smoking cessation in persons who are homeless. Thirty homeless\n      smokers will be enrolled in the study.  Participants will receive payment based on their own\n      low carbon monoxide readings, which indicate being quit from smoking. Participants will be\n      prescribed nicotine replacement (patches and either gum or lozenge)and bupropion. All\n      participants will receive a four sessions of smoking cessation counseling, and will be\n      trained to perform carbon monoxide monitoring with a device provided by the study. They will\n      also be provided with a mobile phone equipped with a video camera, and will use this\n      equipment at home to monitor their carbon monoxide . Participants will record videos of\n      themselves taking a carbon monoxide reading and displaying the results, and will upload the\n      videos to a secured website that is only accessible by the research team members and the\n      participant. Payment will be based on providing carbon monoxide readings that indicate\n      abstinence.\n\n      The study is designed to address the following aims:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To evaluate whether it is feasible to use internet-based contingency\n      management for helping smokers who are homeless stop smoking.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: To evaluate how effective internet-based contingency managementis on\n      decreasing smoking in smokers who are homeless."
