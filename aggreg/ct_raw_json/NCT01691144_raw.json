In some countries, low-risk follow-up is already\n      done in primary care, mainly in breast, and colorectal cancer. In this study the\n      investigators will explore gynecological cancer patients about their expectations regarding\n      their future follow-up plan. Further, the investigators will ask about the experience and\n      satisfaction among patients who have already attended a follow-up programme for 2-3 years.\n      In addition, the investigators will especially focus on the cooperation aspect between\n      primary and secondary care. The investigators hypothesize that follow-up of selected\n      gynecological cancer patients can be done by general practitioners."

            "textblock": "After gynaecological cancer patients have completed their treatment, they are followed up at\n      a gynaecological outpatient clinic for a number of years. The aim of such follow-up is to\n      detect recurrence, improve survival and reduce adverse effects of the treatment. The\n      national guide for oncological gynaecology recommends follow-up by a specialist for five\n      years at intervals depending on cancer type. Several review studies on follow-up of\n      endometrial, cervical and ovarian cancer patients show large international variations in\n      follow-up routines.  There are only retrospective studies available, and they indicate that\n      most recurrences are discovered within the first three years after completed treatment, and,\n      in most cases, by the women themselves. More intensive surveillance does not appear to\n      affect the time for discovery of recurrence.\n\n      A few randomised controlled studies and retrospective cohort studies have been published\n      that focus on follow-up of colon cancer and breast cancer patients by general practitioners\n      versus by hospital specialists. These studies have not shown any significant differences\n      between the groups in terms of detection of recurrence, incidence of serious clinical events\n      connected with recurrence or health-related quality of life.\n\n      The investigators therefore plan to perform a study in which both gynaecological cancer\n      patients and their regular general practitioners are asked about their views on patient\n      follow-up after completed treatment. The investigators especially wish to focus on the\n      collaboration aspect."
