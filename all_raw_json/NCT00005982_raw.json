Determine the response rate, failure-free survival, and progression-free survival of\n      patients with recurrent or refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma treated with 506U78.\n\n      II. Determine the toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Study the pharmacokinetics\n      of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive 506U78 IV over 2 hours on days 1, 3, and 5. Treatment continues every 28\n      days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
