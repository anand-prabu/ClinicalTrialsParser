            "textblock": "Soluble, viscous fibre has been established as an effective dietary component for lowering\n      postprandial glycemia and promoting satiety. The effectiveness of viscous fibre has been\n      related to its ability to increase the viscosity of the intra-luminal contents of the small\n      intestine.  Hence, the proposed mechanism with which soluble fibre affects the glycemic\n      response, dependent on the viscosity development in the gut, would require that soluble\n      fibre be extractable from the food matrix. This, in part, may be dependent on the food\n      matrix that the soluble fibre is incorporated in. While properties of soluble fibre and\n      their physiological effects have been studied extensively, limited data exists on the most\n      effective mode of administration of fibre to optimize benefits. Furthermore, there are no\n      studies to date that have evaluated how different modes of highly viscous soluble fibre\n      would affect the subsequent meal. Hence, we propose a research study to determine whether\n      the form of administration, taking into consideration the carbohydrate availability of a\n      viscous fibre blend supplement, has a significant impact on postprandial and second meal\n      glycemic response and subjective satiety in healthy individuals."

Blood pressure and anthropometric measurements, including body\n      weight, height, and % body fat will be taken.  An initial finger prick fasting blood sample\n      will be taken and a subjective appetite questionnaire in the form of a 100 mm visual analog\n      scale will be completed.  Subsequently, one of the 5 study meals will be administered to the\n      subject to consume over a 10-15 minute duration accompanied by 300ml of water.  Subjects\n      will then be asked to complete a palatability questionnaire.  Over the following 3 hours\n      capillary blood samples will be taken by finger pricks at 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120 and 180\n      minutes post treatment. Appetite and symptoms questionnaires will be completed at 15, 30,\n      45, 60, 75, 90, and 120.  At 180 min, a second standardized meal will be administered,\n      consisting of 400kcal of pizza and 200ml of water.  Further finger pick blood samples will\n      be taken at 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 min post pizza consumption.  Upon completion of the\n      visit, subjects will be given a 24-hour symptoms questionnaire to complete at home as an\n      additional safety measure for a 24-hour period."
