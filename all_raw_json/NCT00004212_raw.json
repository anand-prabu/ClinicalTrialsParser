Patients are\n      stratified according to prior treatment (minimally treated vs heavily treated).\n\n      Patients receive exatecan mesylate IV over 30 minutes daily for 5 days. Patients in dose\n      levels 5 and above also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and\n      continuing for at least 7 days or until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 3\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of exatecan mesylate with and without G-CSF\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 45 patients will be accrued for this study."
