Ethical committee of University of Antioquia (Medell\u00edn, Colombia) approved the\n      protocol. Considering the large number of articles that demonstrate the efficacy of\n      antihistamines as first-line treatment in patients with urticaria, the ethics committee\n      request that all participants would receive an antihistamine during the two months of the\n      study because a placebo group would provide little information for the principal objective\n      and the high risk of airway angioedema. Thirty heath subjects were used as a control group\n      to evaluated the characteristics of the wheal in the prick test with histamine."
