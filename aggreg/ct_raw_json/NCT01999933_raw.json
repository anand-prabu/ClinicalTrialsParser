In the traditional opinion, the postoperative risk factors were\n      divided into two groups: intermediate risk factors, including large tumor size, deep stromal\n      invasion and lymphovascular space invasion, and high risk factors, including non-squamous\n      cell carcinoma, marginal positive, parametric invasion and pelvic lymph node(LN) metastasis.\n      Patients with intermediate risk factors should accepted adjuvant radiotherapy only and who\n      with high risk factors should received adjuvant concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Cisplatin\n      weekly(40mg/m2) was the standard regimen of concurrent chemotherapy. However, we\n      retrospectively analyzed 801 cervical cancer patients with postoperative radiotherapy and\n      found that distant metastasis was the main cause of current treatment failure(84.5%), which\n      suggested the current regimen of chemotherapy was insufficient and might be strengthened in\n      future."
