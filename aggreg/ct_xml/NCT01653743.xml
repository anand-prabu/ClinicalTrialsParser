      This is an open-label, parallel-group, randomized, multicenter Phase III trial to compare
      the efficacy and safety of a single 250 μg subcutaneous dose of MSJ-0011 to a single 5,000
      IU intramuscular dose of urinary hCG in inducing ovulation in Japanese women diagnosed with
      anovulation or oligo-ovulation.  Ovulation induction therapy will be undertaken with
      follitropin alfa. The primary objective is to show that MSJ-0011 is non-inferior to urinary
      hCG, as assessed by the ovulation rate.

          -  Anovulation or oligo-ovulation.

          -  Any one of the following: spontaneous menstruation (at least twice per year) or a
             positive response to progestin as evidenced by menstruation.

          -  Eligible for ovarian stimulation with gonadotropins (e.g. documented failure to
             ovulate or achieve pregnancy with anti-estrogenic therapy such as clomiphene
             citrate).

             fibroid tumors of the uterus incompatible with pregnancy.

          -  Extrauterine pregnancy in the previous 3 months.

          -  Untreated endometrial hyperplasia.

          -  Abnormal hemorrhage of the reproductive tract of unknown origin.

          -  History of severe ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (Classification of OHSS

             severe corticosteroid-dependent asthma).

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within 3 months prior to date of informed
             consent or simultaneous participation in another clinical trial.

          -  Gonadotropin treatment within 2 months prior to date of informed consent.
