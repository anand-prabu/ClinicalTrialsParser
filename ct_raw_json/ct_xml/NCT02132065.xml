      Unilaterally Dual TAP  (Transversus abdominis plane) block after radical nephrectomy,
      assessment of benefit and opioid reduction.

      Transverses Abdominal Plane (TAP) Block is a relatively new regional   technique which
      infiltrates local anesthetic between the internal oblique and transverse abdominis muscles
      and provides analgesia to the parietal peritoneum as well as the skin and muscles of the
      anterior abdominal wall (1). An Ultrasound-guided bilateral dual transversus abdominis plane
      block (Dual TAP block) had been reported by Boerglum et al (2,3), in which regional
      anesthesia postoperatively can be provided to the upper (Th6-Th9) and the lower (Th10-Th12)
      abdominal wall bilaterally using a four-point single-shot technique.

      Pain has a wide spectrum of effects on the body. Inadequately controlled postoperative pain
      may have harmful physiologic, psychological consequences which potentially increase the
      morbidity and mortality (4,5). It has been recognized that inadequately treated
      postoperative pain may lead to chronic pain which is often misdiagnosed and neglected (6,7).
      Chronic postsurgical pain reported in 20% of patients, 6 months after nephrectomy (8).

      Hypothesis: The use of unilaterally dual TAP block will reduce the VAS score for pain and
      the need of morphine postoperatively after radical nephrectomy.

      Purpose: To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of unilaterally dual TAP block as an adjuvant to
      routine analgesic. To assess the difference in morphine usage in the first 48 hours after
      radical nephrectomy with or without applying of unilaterally dual TAP block.
