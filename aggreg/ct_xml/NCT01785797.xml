  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective randomised-controlled multi-centre trial based in Hong Kong to
      determine whether temporary subdural drain placement after burr hole evacuation of a chronic
      subdural haematoma can reduce the risk of recurrence. Consecutive patients, 60 years old or
      above, diagnosed to have symptomatic chronic subdural haematoma and indicated for burr hole
      operative drainage will be randomly allocated into one of two groups: (1) for
      intra-operative subdural drain placement (intervention group) or (2) not for drain placement
      (control group). Using web-based software block randomisation with an allocation ratio of
      1:1 will be conducted. Instructions to use or not to use a drain will be contained in a
      sealed envelopes labelled with sequential study numbers.

      Intra-operatively, if the surgeon-in-charge judges that after burr hole evacuation of the
      haematoma the patient's condition is unsafe for drain placement, the subject will be
      excluded from the study. Otherwise, randomisation will be performed at this juncture by the
      opening of the sealed envelop. The procedure involves placing a prefabricated silicon drain
      into the subdural space according to a standard protocol and will be removed on the second
      post-operative day at the bedside. Subjects in whom the operating surgeon judges that drain
      placement is unsafe will be excluded from the study. Drainage is undertaken passively by
      hanging the collection bag at the bedside in a dependent position. In addition to general
      demographic, clinical and radiological presentation data, potential risk factors for
      recurrence will be documented. Serial computed tomography brain scans will be arranged
      (before discharge, at four weeks and six months) and the occurence of significant subdural
      haematoma recurrence requiring repeat operative drainage at six months will be recorded.
      Other outcome measures to be determined at regular time intervals for a total follow-up
      period of six months (upon discharge, at four weeks and six months) include: functional
      performance in terms of the extended Glasgow Outcome Scale and modified Rankin Scale, added
      neurological deficit, death and other surgery-related complications. All outcomes will be
      documented by the trial investigators or by the responsible clinician. The data obtained
      will be analysed according to the principle of intention to treat.

      Hypothesis: compared to burr-hole evacuation of chronic subdural haematoma alone (control),
      the additional placement of a subdural drain after evacuation (intervention) will reduce the
      risk of recurrence requiring repeat surgery.
