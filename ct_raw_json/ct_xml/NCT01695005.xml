      The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose level of LY3039478 that can safely
      be taken by participants with advanced cancer or cancer that has spread to other parts of
      the body, including but not limited to lymphoma. The study will also explore changes to
      various markers in blood cells and tissue. Finally, the study will help to document any
      tumor  activity this drug may have.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Part A of this study, participants with advanced/metastatic cancer (including lymphoma)
      will receive increasing doses of LY3039478 to define the dose level for Part B. In Part B,
      LY3039478 will be explored at a predefined fixed dose level. Participants in Part B must
      have a defined alteration in a certain molecular pathway. Enrollment of participants in Part
      B will start once Part A is completed.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  For all parts:  The participant must be, in the judgment of the investigator, an
             appropriate candidate for experimental therapy after available standard therapies
             have failed to provide clinical benefit for their advanced or metastatic cancer.

          -  For Dose Escalation (Part A):  The participant must have histological or cytological
             evidence of cancer, either a solid tumor or a lymphoma, which is advanced or
             metastatic.

          -  For Dose Confirmation (Part B):  All participants must have a histological evidence
             of their advanced or metastatic cancer and prescreened alterations in a defined
             pathway such as mutations, amplification or gene expressions related to the defined
             pathway.

          -  As defined by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1), the
             Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma or the Response Assessment in Neuro
             Oncology (RANO) criteria for glioblastoma:

               -  For Dose Escalation (Part A):  Have measurable or nonmeasurable disease.

               -  For Dose Confirmation (Parts B):  Have measurable disease or reliable biomarker
                  measure (example prostate-specific antigen [PSA], cancer antigen 125 [CA125]).

          -  Have adequate organ function including:

               -  Hematologic:  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at least 1.5 x 109/Liter (L),
                  platelets at least 100 x 109/L, and hemoglobin at least 8 grams per deciliter
                  (g/dL).  Participants  may receive erythrocyte transfusions to achieve this
                  hemoglobin level at the discretion of the investigator; however, initial study
                  drug treatment must not begin earlier than the day after the erythrocyte
                  transfusion.

               -  Hepatic:  Bilirubin no more than 1.5 times upper limits of normal (ULN) and
                  alanine aminotransferase (ALT) no more than 2.5 times ULN.  If the liver has
                  tumor involvement, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase
                  (ALT) equaling 5 times ULN are acceptable.

               -  Renal:  calculated creatinine clearance at least 45 milliliters per minute
                  (mL/min)

          -  Have a performance status of less than or equal to 1 on the Eastern Cooperative
             Oncology Group (ECOG) scale and life expectancy of more than 12 weeks.

          -  Have discontinued all previous therapies for cancer (including chemotherapy,
             radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and investigational therapy) for at least 21 days for
             myelosuppressive agents or 14 days for nonmyelosuppressive agents prior to receiving
             study drug, and recovered from the acute effects of therapy (treatment-related
             toxicity resolved to baseline) except for residual alopecia.  At the discretion of
             the investigator, participants with breast or prostate cancers progressing on
             therapies may have that treatment continued while receiving study drug.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have received treatment with a drug that has not received regulatory approval for any
             indication within 14 or 21 days of the initial dose of study drug for a
             nonmyelosuppressive or myelosuppressive agent, respectively.

          -  Have serious preexisting medical conditions that, in the judgment of the
             investigator, would preclude participation in this study (for example, inflammatory
             bowel disease or history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small
             bowel).

          -  Have central nervous system (CNS) malignancy, except:

               -  Participants with treated CNS metastases are eligible for this study if they are
                  not currently receiving corticosteroids and/or anticonvulsants, and their
                  disease is asymptomatic and radiographically stable for at least 60 days
                  (screening not required).

               -  Participants with glioblastoma are eligible.

          -  Have an acute leukemia.

          -  Have received an autologous or allogeneic stem-cell transplant.

          -  Females who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Have active bacterial, fungal, and/or known viral infection (for example, human
             immunodeficiency virus [HIV] antibodies, hepatitis B surface antigen [HBSAg], or
             hepatitis C antibodies).  Screening is not required for enrollment.

          -  Have malabsorptive syndromes, enteropathies, gastroenteritis (acute or chronic), or
             diarrhea (acute or chronic).
