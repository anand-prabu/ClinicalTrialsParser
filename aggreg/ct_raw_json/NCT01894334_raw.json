Emergency surgery has been the main treatment for Acute Aortic\n      Dissection, however perioperative mortality rate can be as high as 15~30%. Acute lung injury\n      (ALI) is one of the main complications that happen during the perioperative period, which by\n      itself covers 30%-50% of the overall mortality rate. Both domestic and foreign countries\n      lack researches on risk factors, pathogenesis, disease progression and outcome of ALI, which\n      happen during the perioperative period of Acute Aortic Dissection patients.\n\n      This topic study follow projects in the preoperative of  Acute Aortic Dissection'surgery\n\n        1. hemodynamic changes (aortic dissection resulting in acute aortic regurgitation, cardiac\n           tamponade and proximal high blood pressure)\n\n        2. ischemia - reperfusion injury of aortic dissection distal organ\n\n        3. Aortic intima-media exposure cause coagulation / fibrinolytic system function disorder\n\n        4. systemic inflammatory response syndrome; use relevant clinical radiographic parameters,\n           indicators of respiratory mechanics (oxygenation index and lung injury index) and\n           biochemical indicators.\n\n      To discuss risk factors and possible mechanisms of ADD patients with pre-operative ALI and\n      observe their influences on the progress and prognosis of AAD, to explore early intervention\n      in the preoperative for possible risk factors and mechanisms and to evaluate their\n      influences on the prognosis, to achieve the purpose of reducing AAD perioperative mortality\n      of ALI and medical expenses."
