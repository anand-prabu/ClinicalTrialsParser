            "textblock": "The most common goal for patients with vision loss who present for vision rehabilitation is\n      to be able to read. The video magnifier (a device which combines a video camera and a screen\n      to view the print being magnified) is the device which most often allows low-vision\n      individuals to read successfully for extended periods of time. Previous studies on the\n      outcomes of vision rehabilitation have not identified which components of the vision\n      rehabilitation are effective. The hypothesis of this project is that providing a video\n      camera magnifier, with basic training in operating the device, will allow patients to\n      enhance both objective reading ability and subjective report of reading competence."
