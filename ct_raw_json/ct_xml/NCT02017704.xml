      This research is being done to compare the effectiveness of high dose endorectal
      brachytherapy  (END-HDR) and the standard treatment option of chemoradiation with
      Capecitabine in the treatment of cancer of the lowest part of the bowel (rectum).

      Locally advanced rectal carcinoma continues to be a major oncologic problem in the United
      States with approximately 40,000 new cases diagnosed in 2011. For stage II/III rectal
      carcinoma, adjuvant chemoradiation(1-3) and total mesorectal excision  (TME) (4, 5)represent
      the major treatment advances that have increased cure rates over the past 30 years.

      In the setting of TME, a landmark phase III German trial of stage II/III rectal cancer
      patients established neoadjuvant 5FU-based chemoradiation (NCRT) as standard of care over
      the same regimen given post-operatively(6). The preoperative arm showed superior local
      control (6% vs. 13% p=0.006), a complete pathologic response of 8%, a higher rate of
      sphincter preservation and less grade 3 toxicity compared to post-operative treatment.
      However, disease-free and overall survival (76% versus 74%, respectively) were no different
      because of the high rate of distant metastasis occurring in over 1/3 of patients (5yr DM 36
      vs 38%,p=0.84). Importantly, those attaining a pathologic complete response had a decreased
      rate of distant metastasis and improved disease-free survival. Drawbacks to the regimen
      include acute grade 3 or 4 toxicity in 27% of patients, low compliance rates with
      postoperative chemotherapy (27 - 50%), and an overall decline in anorectal function shown by
      long-term studies(6).

      Given the excellent locoregional control reported in TME surgical series, several trials
      have investigated whether certain patients may be spared preoperative radiotherapy(7-9). Two
      large randomized trials by Dutch and British investigators showed that a short preoperative
      course of hypofractionated EBRT (25 Gy in 5 fractions) followed by TME surgery decreased
      locoregional recurrence by 2/3 as compared to patients treated with TME surgery alone. In
      the Dutch trial, patients with mid and distal rectal cancers were most likely to benefit
      from radiotherapy.  In these patients, preoperative radiation was shown to decrease
      locoregional recurrence by 5-fold (10% to 2%); however, the hypofractionated preoperative
      EBRT regimen was associated with a significant increase in acute and chronic morbidity.
      Indeed, the Dutch study revealed that irradiated patients, when compared to surgery alone,
      had more perineal wound healing problems after abdominoperineal resection (29% vs. 19%),
      worsening deterioration of anal sphincter dysfunction, and more severe long-term effects
      related to sexual functioning both in males (p=0.004) and females (p&lt;0.002)(10-12).
      Birgisson Additionally, colleagues have reported a consistent negative impact on bowel
      function in those patients undergoing sphincter preservation(13). In reviewing the long-term
      data of the Swedish short course preoperative EBRT rectal cancer trial, Birgisson also
      reported a higher incidence of secondary tumors (9.5%) in patients treated with preoperative
      radiation when compared to patients having surgery alone (4.3%)(14).

      Modern approaches to address the risk of distant metastasis and poor compliance with
      adjuvant systemic chemotherapy (following NCRT) have incorporated newer effective
      chemotherapy agents earlier in the treatment protocol. For example, oxaliplatin has been one
      of the most widely studied agents as a result of its proven efficacy when combined with
      5-fluorouracil and leucovorin (FOLFOX) both in the metastatic and adjuvant settings for
      colon cancer(15). Initial phase II studies with the addition of oxaliplatin to standard 5-FU
      based NCRT appeared to show improved pathologic complete response rates compared to standard
      NCRT.  However, two phase III trials clearly show that the addition of  oxaliplatin during
      5FU-based NCRT does not significantly improve pathologic complete response, locoregional
      control, distant metastasis or survival but does increase acute grade 3-4 toxicity by two to
      three-fold(16, 17).

      One approach to limit toxicity from external beam radiotherapy is the use of intensity
      modulated radiation therapy (IMRT).  IMRT can limit radiation dose to normal rectum (above
      and below the tumor) and surrounding organs at risk (OARs) such as bladder and sexual
      organs.  IMRT utilizes multiple beams of radiation to treat the rectal tumor plus a margin
      and limits dose to OARs. While IMRT decreases radiation dose to normal structures, it
      requires an additional 2-3 cm margin for microscopic extension (clinical treatment
      volume=CTV), set-up error, and rectal motion (planning treatment volume=PTV). Furthermore,
      IMRT still requires 5-6 weeks of radiation with concurrent chemotherapy,  is substantially
      more expensive than conformal radiation, and is especially prohibitive in countries where
      access to technology necessary for IMRT is limited (20).  Based on the preliminary results
      of RTOG 0822 and others, it still remains to be determined whether IMRT confers a
      statistically significant improvement in pCR, toxicity rates and QOL relative to standard
      NCRT.

      A novel approach to limit radiation toxicity is the use of high dose rate endorectal
      brachytherapy (Endo-HDR) (21). Endo-HDR involves the placement of a silicon multicatheter
      applicator within the rectum to deliver large doses to the rectal tumor and mesorectum with
      rapid dose fall off to the surrounding organs. An Iridium 192 high dose rate brachytherapy
      source attached to a wire is inserted into each catheter to deliver a high dose of radiation
      therapy the tumor. High dose rate brachytherapy has been well established in various
      malignancies (prostate, uterine, sarcoma, head and neck) to escalate radiation dose to the
      tumor over a short period of time while sparing normal tissue. Compared with NCRT and IMRT,
      Endo-HDR delivers treatment internally to the tumor without having to pass through
      surrounding normal tissue and organs. It requires smaller margins (CTV/PTV=~1 cm) on the
      tumor since the applicator is positioned under fiducial guidance over the tumor without need
      for a margin for organ motion allowing greater sparing of OARs (22). Furthermore, the area
      of the rectum exposed to high dose radiotherapy is surgically removed at the time of
      resection which further minimizes chronic toxicity. Important structures that may be spared
      include bone marrow, small bowel, bladder, the autonomic nerves, sexual organs, anal
      sphincter and skin. Considering that 1/3 of patients will develop metastases, limiting bone
      marrow toxicity may contribute to better compliance with systemic treatment and allow for a
      better treatment strategy to target systemic recurrence. Another distinct advantage of
      Endo-HDR is the shortened treatment time (1 versus 6 weeks).  Endo-HDR therefore provides a
      major logistic advantage for patients who may benefit from neoadjuvant therapy but who are
      geographically distant from radiation centers, elderly, or medically infirmed.
