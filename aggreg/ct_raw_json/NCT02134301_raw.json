Approximately 48 patients will be enrolled at 10-15 US centers.  This study will\n      include 5 age cohorts and patients will be entered in a stepwise approach starting with the\n      older age cohort (12-<18 years).  The starting dose will be IV oritavancin 15 mg/kg.    The\n      safety, tolerability and PK data will be reviewed at the completion of each cohort to ensure\n      safety and determine the appropriate dose for the next age cohort.  At least 8 patients will\n      be enrolled in each cohort except for the birth to <3 month age cohort which will have at\n      least 16 patients enrolled. Seven PK samples will be collected over 14 days.  The safety\n      follow-up will complete with a 60-day phone call to the caregiver."
