            "textblock": "Patients with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) usually respond with an increase in\n      platelet count after treatment with steroids, but most patients will experience\n      recurrence.Rituximab has been a useful treatment for patients with recurrent ITP; many\n      hundreds of patients have been treated. 30-40% of patients will achieve a complete remission\n      (CR: platelet count >150 x 109/l) with initial treatment. However, most patients will\n      relapse between 1 and 3 years from initial treatment suggesting that long-term \"cures\" only\n      occur in 20% of the initial patients. An increased rate of durable CRs is therefore a\n      desirable goal. One approach would be to use rituximab maintenance; however, this strategy\n      results in long term B cell suppression. Dexamethasone has also been used to achieve \"cure\"\n      in ITP, especially in adults at or near diagnosis. An initial study suggested that\n      approximately 50% of patients would achieve a long-term response with only one 4-day cycle\n      of high dose (40 mg/day) dexamethasone.  A follow up study suggested that 3-4 cycles of\n      dexamethasone would be better than 1 cycle. Finally, a recent publication suggested that\n      rituximab plus one cycle of dexamethasone was superior to dexamethasone alone, with a > 50%\n      CR rate at 6 months.  Based on the published activity of rituximab and dexamethasone in this\n      disorder, some patients have received treatment with combined dexamethasone and rituximab.\n      We will review the data of those patients who have received more than one course of\n      dexamethasone together with rituximab for relapsed or refractory ITP in order to determine\n      the response rate, duration of response, toxicity of the combination, and clinical\n      predictors of response in this group."
