            "textblock": "On exposure to hypoxia (low oxygen) the normal response is for pulmonary arterial systolic\n      blood pressure (PASP, blood pressure through the lungs) to increase. We have previously\n      shown that raising iron by giving an infusion of iron into a vein reduces this pressure rise\n      and that lowering iron by giving a drug that binds iron, magnifies this response. This is\n      potentially a clinically important observation since iron-deficient people may be at\n      increased risk of pulmonary hypertension if exposed transiently or permanently to hypoxia\n      due to lung disease or residence at high altitude; furthermore if this were true then\n      intravenous iron could be an important treatment in this patient group in the event of\n      hypoxic exposure. The observed effects of iron on PASP are likely to be because iron levels\n      affect oxygen sensing. Low iron levels make the body behave as if exposed to low oxygen by\n      inhibiting the breakdown of the family of oxygen-sensing transcription factors, 'hypoxia\n      inducible factor' or HIF.  This includes one of the body's normal responses to low oxygen\n      levels - raising blood pressure through the lungs.\n\n      This study will answer the question (1) do iron-deficient volunteers have a greater rise in\n      PASP with hypoxia than those who are iron-replete, and (2) does giving intravenous iron\n      cause a greater reduction in the rise in PASP in those who are iron-deficient than\n      iron-replete?  The purpose of this study is not to test the safety or clinical efficacy of\n      iron which is already known."
