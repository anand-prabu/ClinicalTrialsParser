            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes is characterized by increased insulin resistance and impaired insulin\n      secretion. In addition, type 2 diabetes is associated with low grade inflammation indicated\n      by increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1. TNF-\u03b1 has previously been\n      shown to impair peripheral insulin signaling in vitro and in vivo. However, it is unclear\n      whether TNF-\u03b1 may also affect endogenous glucose production (EGP) during fasting and glucose\n      stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) in vivo.\n\n      We hypothesized that low dose TNF-\u03b1 would increase EGP and attenuate GSIS. Recombinant human\n      TNF-\u03b1 or placebo was infused in healthy, non-obese and non-diabetic young men (n=10) during\n      a 4-hour basal period followed by an intravenous glucose tolerance test (IVGTT)."
