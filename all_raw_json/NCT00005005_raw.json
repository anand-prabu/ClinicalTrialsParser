The primary endpoints are changes in bone mineral density at several\n      sites and changes in biochemical markers.\n\n      In addition, we will assess specific biochemical markers of bone turnover (e.g.,\n      osteocalcin, deoxypridinoline, N-telopeptide, bone-specific alkaline phosphatase and bone\n      sialoprotein) to determine if they can predict the skeletal response to combination therapy.\n      We will also determine whether PTH positively affects ultrasound measurements in the\n      calcaneus."
