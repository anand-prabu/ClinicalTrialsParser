  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study,the investigators are looking to see how older women who are survivors of
      breast cancer and either did or did not receive chemotherapy are affected by treatment,
      compared to older women who have never had cancer. Thinking and memory abilities normally
      decrease with age and the investigators want to see if the long-term effects of cancer
      treatments may make these problems worse. The investigators will also look at how thinking
      and memory abilities of older women are affected by genetics and smoking history. Genetics
      and other factors may affect the brain's chemicals or structure, and may either protect
      against the negative effects on thinking or make someone more at risk for them.

        We propose to enroll 480 participants into the study across the 2 sites: 240 participants
        (160 patients, 80 controls) from MSKCC and 240 participants from City of Hope (160
        survivors, 80 controls).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The neuropsychological assessments were designed and validated in English and are not
             currently available in other languages. Translation of questionnaires into other
             languages would require reestablishing the reliability and validity of these
             measures. Therefore, participants must be able to communicate in English to complete
             the tests. Friend nominated, non-cancer controls will be frequency matched on age
             (+/- 5 years), education (less than college vs. some college and above), and race
             will be recruited using the same eligibility criteria as survivors except for no
             history of cancer.

        For cancer patients, eligibility includes:

          -  Female

          -  Age 65 and older at recruitment

          -  Age 60 or older at the time of diagnosis 5-15 years post diagnosis at the time of
             enrollment and no evidence of disease

          -  American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stages I-III breast cancer survivor as per
             clinical judgment/electronic medical record (EMR)

          -  Score of &lt; 11 on the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test (BOMC)

          -  In the judgment of the consenting professional, able to communicate well enough in
             English through verbal and written communication to complete the study assessments
             and provide informed consent

          -  If a tobacco smoker, started smoking prior to age 20 as per self report

        For controls, eligibility includes:

          -  female

          -  Age 65 and older

          -  In the judgment of the consenting professional, able to communicate well enough in
             English through verbal and written communication to complete the study assessments
             and provide informed consent

          -  Score of &lt; 11 on the Blessed Orientation-Memory-Concentration Test (BOMC)

          -  As per self report, no history of treatment with chemotherapy
