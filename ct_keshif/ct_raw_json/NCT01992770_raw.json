The intervention have two\n      core features: it is theory-driven and include systematic tailoring of treatment content.\n      The tailoring is based on a combination of empirically supported behavioural and medical\n      determinants of pain-related disability and patients' individual perceptions on personal\n      goals, facilitators and barriers for health behavior change. In this application, the\n      intervention is labelled tailored behavioural medicine intervention (TBM).\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The aim is to compare effects and cost-effectiveness of a stepped care model including\n      advice and tailored behavioral medicine pain treatment (experimental condition) with a\n      stepped care model including advice and physical exercises (comparison condition) for\n      patients with low back and neck pain and/or widespread pain including fibromyalgia in\n      primary care. A further aim is to characterize patients who benefit/do not benefit from the\n      respective steps i.e. treatments varying in dose and content.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      A stratified randomized stepped care design is applied. Stratification is based on primary\n      care center and patient risk profile.  A consecutive selection is performed at primary care\n      centers in southern, central and northern Sweden. According to power analysis, 364\n      participants should be recruited to allow for sub-group analyses.  After having received a\n      minimal intervention (step 1) comprising 'stay-active advice', participants scoring >90 on\n      the \u00d6rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Questionnaire (\u00d6MPQ) are randomly allocated to an eight-week\n      treatment in step 2.

            "textblock": "STEP-UP: An innovative stepped-care model for tailored behavioral medicine treatment in the\n      management of musculoskeletal pain in primary care\n\n      Background:\n\n      Multimodal rehabilitation and tailored behavioral medicine treatments should be provided to\n      patients suffering from persistent and activity limiting pain according to current\n      state-of-science. There is also evidence that a simple and specific 'stay-active advice' can\n      produce effects comparable to effects of comprehensive treatment packages. Nevertheless,\n      there is a gap of knowledge regarding which individuals who benefit the most from which\n      modalities of pain treatment, at what time point, and with the highest cost-effectiveness.\n      Accordingly, we have set up an innovative stepped-care protocol for the management of\n      musculoskeletal pain in primary care, which is evaluated in a randomized controlled trial.\n      The intervention have two core features: it is theory-driven and include systematic\n      tailoring of treatment content. The tailoring is based on a combination of empirically\n      supported behavioural and medical determinants of pain-related disability and patients'\n      individual perceptions on personal goals, facilitators and barriers for HBC. In this\n      application, the intervention is labelled tailored behavioural medicine intervention (TBM).\n\n      Main objectives\n\n        1. To compare the short- (post-treatment) and long-term effects (12 and 24 months\n           follow-ups) of TBM and physical exercise treatment on everyday life activity, health\n           related quality of life, pain severity, and sick leave (main analysis).\n\n        2. To study whether TBM tailored according to any of two pre-defined patient risk\n           profiles: \"the catastrophising/fear-avoidance profile\" and \"the moderate to high\n           disability profile\" are more effective compared to physical exercise treatment (sub-\n           group analysis).\n\n        3. To characterize patients who benefit/do not benefit from (1) a minimal intervention\n           including advice, (2) TBM and physical exercise treatment respectively\n\n        4. To identify potential moderators (e.g. pain duration, sex, outcome expectations) and\n           mediators (e.g. catastrophising, fear of movement, self-efficacy) of treatment effects.\n\n        5. To study the cost-effectiveness within the experimental trial i.e. for the TBM versus\n           the physical exercise treatment over the entire study period (up to 24-month follow-\n           up).\n\n      Methods:\n\n      A stratified randomized stepped care design is applied. Stratification is based on primary\n      care center and patient risk profile.  A consecutive selection is performed at primary care\n      centers in southern, central and northern Sweden. According to power analysis, 364\n      participants should be recruited to allow for sub-group analyses.
