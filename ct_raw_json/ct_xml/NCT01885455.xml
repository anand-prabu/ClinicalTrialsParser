  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, interventional trial in which the navigation is the intervention.
      Phase is not applicable. The study is a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a
      nurse-led patient navigation intervention in improving rates of receipt of lung-directed
      therapy with curative intent (LDTCI) among African Americans with early stage lung cancer.
      Study sites are cluster-randomized to either the usual care study arm or the to the
      navigation intervention study arm.  Randomization occurred at the level of the study site
      rather than at the level of individual participants. There are two arms.

      This is a randomized, interventional trial in which the navigation is the intervention.
      Phase is not applicable. The study is a randomized trial to evaluate the impact of a
      nurse-led patient navigation intervention in improving rates of receipt of lung-directed
      therapy with curative intent (LDTCI) among African Americans with early stage lung cancer.
      Study sites are cluster-randomized to either the usual care study arm or the to the
      navigation intervention study arm.  Randomization occurred at the level of the study site
      rather than at the level of individual participants. There are two arms.

      Usual Care Arm: Participants who are assigned to the usual care arm may receive the
      following services: complete staging work-up (CT/PET scan and possible mediastinoscopy),
      surgical consultation with a general or cardiothoracic surgeon, cardiac clearance and/or
      pulmonary function testing (if deemed necessary by the evaluating surgeon), surgical
      resection (wedge resection, lobectomy, pneumonectomy, or radiosurgery, as indicated by the
      size and location of the tumor), and adjuvant therapy (radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy, as
      determined by the intraoperative findings and pathology results). Participants will be
      contacted at baseline and at 3-month intervals to complete telephone-administered study
      surveys for one year.

      Intervention Arm: Participants who are assigned to the intervention arm will receive a copy
      of the NCI's &quot;What You Need to Know about Lung Cancer&quot; booklet and they will be assigned to
      an RN-level nurse navigator. The patient navigators will contact their assigned participants
      on at least a weekly basis. The role of the patient navigators is to: (1) help patients who
      are newly diagnosed with early stage lung cancer schedule clinical appointments ; (2)
      identify each patient's unique logistical and emotional needs (barriers to care) and
      coordinate with professional staff to develop effective solutions; (3) connect patients to
      community and social support services; (4) provide medical appointment reminders; (5)
      accompany patients to their clinic appointments as requested; (6) reschedule appointments
      when patients cannot keep them; (7) provide patients with sources of expert information
      about the recommended surgical treatment; (8) guide patients through the health care system,
      including helping them arrive at appointments on time and prepared; (9) interact with
      patients to help them resolve financial, language, transportation, or other barriers to
      treatment; (10) assist patients in finding ways to pay for their health care by working with
      financial counselors at the health care site; (11) organize and coordinate patient
      transportation services; (12) provide health education to patients about lung cancer surgery
      and other relevant information (this may include smoking cessation services); (13) help
      patients to access language-specific materials, (14) facilitate interaction and
      communication with health care staff and providers; (15) use lay language to describe the
      medical terms used by clinicians, and explain patients' concerns to their health care
      providers so that these concerns can be addressed; (16) interact with patients' specialists
      to relay patients' concerns about surgical resection so that they can be addressed by these
      specialists; (17) provide support through active, empathic listening; (18) arrange for
      patients to hear &quot;testimonials&quot; from other patients with similar racial and ethnic
      backgrounds who had successful surgical outcomes for treatment of NSCLC and (19) respect
      patients' medical treatment decisions.

      The patient navigation intervention is standardized to ensure consistency of the
      intervention delivery across the three intervention study sites. The navigators employ a
      secure, web-based data management system to track the frequency, intensity, and content of
      the navigation intervention. Information that is recorded includes the number, length, and
      type of contact (telephone, email or in person) with each participant, and a description of
      the barriers that were addressed. This system fosters the successful deployment of the
      intervention in a standardized manner across the intervention sites and it identifies the
      specific types of barriers to surgery or radiosurgery that were overcome through the
      navigation intervention. These data will also be used to estimate the cost (using
      time-driven, activity-based costing) and cost-effectiveness (increase in quality-adjusted
      life years/cost) of the navigation intervention in a subsequent study. To further ensure
      treatment fidelity, in Year the navigators participated in a 24- hour patient navigation
      training program led by the study consultant, Dr. Beth Calhoun, who is one of the nation's
      leading patient navigation experts, and Dr. Debbie C. Bryant, who led a successful breast
      cancer-focused patient navigation intervention at the Medical University of South Carolina
      MUSC Hollings Cancer Center (MUSC HCC). In addition, the navigators participate in bi-weekly
      teleconferences led by Dr. Ford, during which the intervention is discussed in detail and
      training is provided in such areas as developing effective communication approaches,
      identifying institutional and community resources, and problem-solving.
