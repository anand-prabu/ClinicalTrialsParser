            "textblock": "Total therapy 5B will attempt to accelerate and sustain, at 2 years from starting therapy,\n      the proportion of subjects in complete remission by reducing host-imposed toxicity and\n      facilitating timely completion of highly synergistic 8-drug combination therapy, including\n      the next generation proteasome inhibitor, Carfilzomib. This will result in avoiding multiple\n      myeloma re-growth that, we postulate, ensued in Total therapy 3 during recovery phases from\n      severe de-conditioning.  It is speculated that the incidence of positive minimal residual\n      disease will be reduced with the addition of one cycle of consolidation therapy.  The\n      following approach will be implemented:\n\n        -  apply a 4-day fractionated lower dose melphalan (80 mg/m2) together with CFZ-TD-PACE\n           regimen in MEL80-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE as a hopefully\n           less toxic and more effective transplant regimen\n\n        -  interspersed with 1 cycle of non-transplant supported MEL-20-CFZ-TD (carfilzomib,\n           thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE (in lower doses than with transplant) inter-therapy\n           (reduced from two cycles due to prolonged thrombocytopenia)\n\n        -  followed by CFZ-TD (carfilzomib, thalidomide, dexamethasone) PACE consolidation therapy\n           post transplant #2\n\n        -  CFZ-RD (carfilzomib, lenalidomide and dexamethasone) maintenance for 1 year followed by\n           CFZ-D for an additional year"
