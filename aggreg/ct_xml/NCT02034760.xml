  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A minimum of 205 healthy elderly individuals (at least 65 years old) are recruited as
      subjects.

      Upon inclusion, each individual will be randomized into one of the five groups stratified
      according to gender (M/F) and 30s chair stand (&lt;16/16 or above). The five groups are: Heavy
      Resistance Training (N=35), Light Intensity Training (N=35), Protein Whey (N=50), Protein
      Collagen (N=50) and Carbohydrate (N=35). The individuals randomized into one of the
      supplementation groups (Protein Whey, Protein Collagen or Carbohydrate) will be blinded to
      the supplement content.

      Assessments will be performed at Baseline (before intervention start), and after 6 and 12
      months of intervention and again at 18 months (after 6 months of follow up).

      The primary outcome is change in quadriceps muscle cross sectional area from Baseline to 12
      months of intervention.

      The primary hypothesis is that by applying the intension-to-treat analysis, the Light
      Intensity Training group will increase quadriceps muscle cross sectional area just as much
      as the Heavy Resistance Training group. The two training groups will gain more muscle mass
      than the Protein Whey group, which will gain more than the Protein Collagen and the
      Carbohydrate groups that will loose the quadriceps muscle cross sectional areas.

    <description>MRi scans of quadriceps muscle cross sectional area. The primary time interval for assessment of the primary outcome measure is from Baseline to 12 months intervention. The statistical evaluation of the primary outcome measure is done by applying a two way ANOVA test comparing groups: 1) Heavy Resistance Training vs. Light Intensity Training vs. Protein Whey and 2) Protein Whey vs. Protein Collagen vs. Carbohydrate. The statistical evaluation will be performed first as an intension-to-treat analysis and subsequently as a per-protocol analysis.
Assessments are performed at 6 months as well and at 18 months (after 6 months follow up). Changes in muscle cross sectional area will be evaluated over 6 months from Baseline to 6 months, from 6 to 12 months, and from 12 months to 18 months.</description>
