Otitis media (the\n      build-up of water-like fluid in the middle-ear airspace) may occur if the blood flow in the\n      lining of the middle-ear is too high and may be prevented if a way could be found to lower\n      the blood flow in persons susceptible to the disease. Middle-ear blood flow is measured\n      indirectly by measuring the change in middle-ear pressure while a person breathes a gas\n      mixture containing nitrous oxide (\"laughing gas\"). In this study, 4 groups of subjects will\n      be entered and middle-ear pressure in persons breathing a mixture of 50% Oxygen, 50% Nitrous\n      Oxide (\"laughing gas\")will be measured after exposure to one of four substances (ragweed,\n      histamine,an oral decongestant, a decongestant nasal spray) and a fake medication (placebo)\n      at separate test sessions. All subjects will have one set of 2 x-rays of the middle ears and\n      mastoids.  The group exposed to ragweed will require 3 study visits while the other 3 groups\n      will have 2 study visits. From this information middle-ear blood flow will be calculated.\n      This will help determine the relationship between what happens in the nose and what happens\n      in the middle ear."

These experiments are designed\n      to measure the rate of transME mucosal (transMEM) inert gas exchange in adults and determine\n      if nasal inflammatory reactions experimentally provoked by intranasal histamine or allergen\n      challenge increase the rate transMEM inert gas exchange and if nasal or oral treatment with\n      an adrenergic agonist decreases that rate. Four cohorts of 20 otherwise healthy adults will\n      be identified and one cohort assigned to each of the four experiments. All subjects will\n      have a x-ray in Schuller projection to estimate mastoid volume. The transMEM inert gas\n      exchange rate is measured by repeatedly recording ME pressure by tympanometry while the\n      subject breathes a mixture of 50%N2O/ 50%O2, and then regressing ME pressure on time and\n      dividing the slope of the function by the estimated N2O driving gradient to yield an\n      exchange constant. For each experiment, the transMEM N2O exchange rate is measured twice at\n      separate visits (active and placebo). The four experimental conditions are: (1) intranasal\n      ragweed and placebo challenges; (2) intranasal histamine and placebo challenges; (3) oral\n      pseudoephedrine and placebo; (4) intranasal oxymetazoline and placebo. Experiments 2-4\n      require two visits, while Experiment 1 will require an additional visit to obtain blood for\n      RAST testing to verify ragweed allergy. The paired exchange constants measured in each\n      experiment will be compared for a significant difference using a Student's Paired t test and\n      the results interpreted as supporting or refuting the possibility of modulating the transMEM\n      N2O exchange rate by the different procedures."
