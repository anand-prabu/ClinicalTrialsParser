            "textblock": "At least 100,000 ventral hernia repairs are performed in the U.S. each year. Recently,\n      biologically-based implants derived from acellular human dermis, porcine small intestinal\n      submucosa, and porcine dermis have been reported in a variety of complex abdominal wall\n      repair procedures. A variety of surgical techniques and implant placement methods have been\n      described, with no one standard technique achieving precedence. Biologic implant\n      reinforcement of a myofascial closure by means of component separation, or at a minimum,\n      where three-layer fascial approximation is not possible, sublay placement (i.e., closure of\n      the posterior rectus sheath under the implant) are described strategies. These techniques\n      allow placement of the implant against an intact fascial layer and may improve implant\n      incorporation into host tissue. However, the current literature shows few, if any,\n      prospective, randomized, head-to-head comparisons of human acellular dermal matrix (HADM)\n      allograft and porcine acellular dermal matrix (PADM) xenograft when used as a reinforcing\n      material in the repair of large abdominal hernias by a component separation technique.\n\n      The Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation (MTF) has manufactured and processed Flex HD\n      Acellular Hydrated Dermis. This acellular dermis is derived from human skin. In complicated\n      ventral hernia repairs, this type of graft tissue is necessary. Flex HD has been shown to\n      reduce operative time, lower operative costs and provides minimal elasticity.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to examine and compare the outcomes associated with\n      the use of Flex HD\u00ae, a human acellular dermal matrix (HADM), and Strattice\u2122, a porcine\n      acellular dermal matrix, (PADM) when used as a reinforcing material in the repair of large\n      complicated abdominal wall hernias."
