  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Pregabalin is effective on radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain.

      Purpose: This randomized double-blind trial aims to investigate whether pregabalin is
      effective in treating radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck radiotherapy is associated with peripheral neuropathies, especially with
      brachial plexus neuropathy, which included painful sensation that are described as burning,
      aching, spasm, or tingling. Though there is some recommendation about neuropathic pain,
      there is no definite drug which is recommended for radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic
      pain.

      Pregabalin, a Central nervous system(CNS)-active compound, is an analog of the
      neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid. It has been proved an effective treatment for
      diabetic peripheral neuropathy and postherpetic neuralgia in previous clinical trials. This
      study plans to evaluate the efficacy of pregabalin versus placebo for relieving
      radiation-induced peripheral neuropathic pain, and assessed its safety.
