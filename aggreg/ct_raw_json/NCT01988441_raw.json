It is not known why only some obese subjects develop NAFLD. In recent\n      years, a growing body of evidence showed a crucial role of autophagy in in the regulation of\n      liver fat storage. The purpose of this study is to determine whether autophagy\n      pathway-related genetic polymorphisms affect NAFLD."

The investigators will measure total serum bilirubin, alanine\n      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, \u03b3-glutamyltransferase fasting glucose,\n      triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose,\n      and adiponectin.\n\n      [Liver ultrasonography] All participants will receive an ultrasonographic study of the\n      liver. NAFLD is defined as the presence of an ultrasonographic pattern consistent with the\n      following criteria: liver-kidney echo discrepancy, attenuated echo penetration and\n      visibility of diaphragm, and obscure hepatic vessel structures.\n\n      [Genotyping] Genomic DNA will be extracted from 3 cc venous blood from each participant.\n      After extraction, the genomic DNA will be immediately stored at -80\u00b0C. The TaqMan genotyping\n      assays will be performed for selected SNPs genotyping on ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System\n      (Applied Biosystems).\n\n      [Sample size] Sample size was estimated by Epi InfoTM 7 (CDC, USA) program. Because there\n      was no previous data regarding to the effect of autophagy related gene on NAFLD, the\n      investigators estimate the odds ratio to vary between 60-80%. The investigators used a\n      confidence level of 95%, power of 80%, the ratio of controls to NAFLD cases of 25%, percent\n      of controls exposed of 25-35%, the samples size required would be a total of 291-872\n      subjects."
