    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled trial that will assess whether two group
      interventions for PTSD - Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Cognitive Processing
      Therapy-Cognitive only (CPT-C) result in similar improvements in PTSD symptoms and
      health-related quality of life (QOL).  One hundred fifty-two Veterans with PTSD will be
      randomized to MBSR (n = 76) or CPT-C (n = 76). Comprehensive assessments will take place
      post-treatment and 3 months later.

      The proposed study is a randomized, controlled non-inferiority trial that will assess
      whether Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR) and Cognitive Processing Therapy-Cognitive
      only (CPT-C) result in equivalent improvement in both PTSD symptoms and health-related
      quality of life (QOL). PTSD symptoms will be measured by the Clinician Administered PTSD
      Scale - CAPS and health-related QOL will be measured by the SF-36V Mental Component Summary
      Score - MCS.  In an exploratory aim, we will also assess whether there is a clinically
      meaningful response as defined by improvement in both PTSD symptoms and QOL (defined as a
      reliable change of 12 points on the CAPS and 10 points on the MCS, respectively, according
      to the reliable change index).7, 8 One hundred fifty-two Veterans with PTSD will be
      randomized to MBSR (n = 76) or CPT-C (n = 76). Comprehensive assessments will take place
      post-treatment and 3 months later. Qualitative analysis of brief semi-structured interview
      data will be used to identify previously unrecognized factors pertaining to participation,
      adherence and response to treatment, spirituality and religion as treatment moderators, and
      to identify common themes that may inform treatment retention efforts for both MBSR and
      CPT-C. In addition, potential moderators of change in PTSD symptoms and QOL for MBSR and
      CPT-C will be identified.
