The needle electrode head is gently tapped to pierce the skin, maintaining a 60\u00b0 angle, and insert to a depth of approximately 2cm.  The electrode is then connected to the stimulator and the current setting needed is determined by the test mode on the stimulator.  Once the current setting is known, the stimulator is started on the therapy mode which delivers the current for 30 minutes and shuts off automatically after 30 minutes.  The needle is then removed and stimulator disconnected.  The treatment involves twelve weekly sessions of 30 minutes each."

            "textblock": "Overactive Bladder (OAB) is a chronic condition defined as urgency with or without\n      incontinence usually associated with frequency and nocturia.  It is a common condition\n      affecting 15-45% of adults and constitutes a significant proportion of patients attending\n      urogynaecology clinics.  OAB is known to have a significant impact on the physical, social\n      and emotional quality of life and sexual function in women.  The treatment of OAB is\n      initially conservative with bladder training followed by pharmacotherapy.\n\n      Evidence from a recent Cochrane review on treatment of OAB suggests that the efficacy of\n      anticholinergics in treatment of OAB is enhanced when combined with BT.  Women who fail to\n      improve with these initial measures are offered Intravesical Botox or neuromodulation in the\n      form of Percutaneous Tibial Nerve Stimulation (PTNS) or Sacral Nerve Stimulation (SNS).\n\n      PTNS has also been shown to more effective than pharmacotherapy with anticholinergics.  In\n      2010 National Institute of Clinical Excellences (NICE) issued guidance stating '\"PTNS for\n      OAB demonstrates effectiveness without major safety concerns\"\n\n      We hypothesise that the outcome of PTNS will improve if the PTNS sessions are combined with\n      bladder training (BT)."
