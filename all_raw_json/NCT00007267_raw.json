The study will also examine the effect of clinical depression on impact\n      of the psychological treatments. Because psychological interventions requiring a trained\n      professional can be costly and are often not available to the majority of patients, the\n      study will also examine the efficacy of a self-help intervention.\n\n      The study will recruit 201 patients with systemic sclerosis who report symptoms of pain,\n      depression, or distress about disfigurement and will randomly assign them to one of three\n      interventions: individual cognitive behavioral therapy, self-help cognitive behavioral\n      intervention facilitated by a psychologist, or a disease/health education intervention. An\n      individual blinded to intervention assignment will collect measures of pain, functioning,\n      distress about disfigurement, and mood at baseline and following the 8-week intervention\n      period.\n\n      Both the cognitive-behavioral self-help materials and the educational materials (eight\n      written chapters and audiotapes) will be designed for home use but will be supplemented by\n      two individual sessions and two telephone contacts with the professional. Patients will be\n      followed for 1 year after completing the active intervention phase.\n\n      These findings will increase understanding of the quality of life of individuals with\n      scleroderma and determine whether self-help interventions can be used effectively to manage\n      pain, depression, and distress about disfigurement."
