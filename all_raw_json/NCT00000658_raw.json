Treatment is frequently complicated by the occurrence of multiple\n      opportunistic infections, as well as the presence of poor bone marrow reserve, making the\n      administration of standard doses of chemotherapy difficult. A recent study was completed\n      using a low-dose modification of the standard mBACOD (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin,\n      vincristine, bleomycin, dexamethasone, methotrexate ) treatment. A 46 percent response rate\n      was observed in patients treated with this combination of chemotherapeutic agents, with a\n      number of durable remissions and reduced toxicity when compared to previous experience with\n      more standard treatments. A subsequent study showed similar effectiveness using a lower dose\n      of methotrexate administered on day 15. It is hoped that the use of sargramostim\n      (granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor; GM-CSF) will improve bone marrow function\n      and allow for administration of a higher dose of chemotherapy."

Patients are stratified for (1)\n      presence or absence of a prior AIDS diagnosis, (2) Karnofsky performance status of 70 or\n      greater and lower than 70.  Treatment includes prophylaxis for meningeal lymphoma and\n      Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia.  Patients on low-dose mBACOD who experience neutropenia may\n      be given rGM-CSF until the absolute neutrophil count improves.
