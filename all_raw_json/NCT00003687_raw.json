Patients are\n      stratified by stabilization dose (less than 120 mg/day vs greater than 120 mg/day of\n      morphine) and institution in phase A, and neuropathic pain (yes vs no) in phase B.\n\n        -  Phase A: Patients are randomized to receive oral morphine in one of two formulations\n           (MS Contin or Statex SR) every 12 hours for 7 days.\n\n        -  Phase B: Eligible patients from phase A who have taken no more than 2 breakthrough\n           doses of analgesic per day in the previous 2 days are re-randomized to receive dose\n           escalated oral dextromethorphan capsules or placebo every 4 hours, and oral morphine\n           tablets every 12 hours for 14 days.\n\n        -  Phase C: All patients fulfilling entry criteria at the end of phase A or any time\n           during phase B may receive compassionate use morphine tablets for up to 90 days.\n\n      Patients complete a pain diary twice each day during treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 120 patients will be accrued for this study."
