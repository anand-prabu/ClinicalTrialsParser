Both groups received CSA as part of the treatment\n      regimen. However, the trial was terminated prematurely due to excessive morbidity among the\n      patients treated in the cyclophosphamide arm. They documented that invasive fungal\n      infections were severe among the cyclophosphamide group. Between January 2008 through May\n      2009, in our department, nine pediatric patients with a diagnosis of SAA were enrolled a\n      study with lower dose of cyclophosphamide with 30mg/kg/day for 4 consecutive days and\n      combination with CSA, this study shows promise for children with severe aplastic anemia.Now\n      we want explore the dosage of cyclophosphamide."
