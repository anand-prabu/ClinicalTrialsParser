We will randomize approximately 30 individuals to either a self-directed weight loss\n      program (n=15) or a coached weight loss program (n=15).  The primary purpose of this pilot\n      study is to determine if a home-based weight loss/physical activity (PA) intervention is\n      feasible in individuals with a LEA.  MOVE-LEAP is a 20-week program that involves 11  phone\n      calls from a health coach and a single home visit by a physical therapist.\n\n      This pilot study aims to:\n\n        1. test the feasibility of recruiting overweight/obese individuals with LEA into a\n           randomized trial;\n\n        2. assess whether the intervention can be delivered with high fidelity, and\n\n        3. evaluate whether the intervention is acceptable to and safe as determined by\n           participant feedback, participation and retention for outcome measures."

All participants (both the coached arm and\n      self-directed arm) will be mailed a MOVE-LEAP packet [containing eating and physical\n      activity logs, information on  how to set weight loss goals, suggestions for physical\n      activity/exercise, dietary  guides, etc.), a MOVE-LEAP handout booklet, calories counting\n      book, a pedometer, exercise DVD, and a flip-booklet with exercises (\"Exercise Guide for\n      Persons with Limb Loss\").  A bathroom scale will be provided for participants who do not\n      already own one.\n\n      Participants in the coached arm will receive a home visit by an exercise specialist. This\n      visit will occur 1-3 weeks after randomization. The exercise specialist will assess the\n      participant's capabilities and interest regarding physical activity as well as his/her home\n      environment for physical activity.  Since each participant may have different physical\n      capabilities and limitations, the type and intensity of physical activity will be tailored\n      to each participant's preferences and their home and neighborhood/community environment and\n      resources. If the participant is interested in performing physical activity outside their\n      home, study staff will provide them with information about community resources for physical\n      activities.\n\n      Participants in the coached arm will receive 11 calls by a study health coach. During the\n      phone calls (weekly initially and then every other week), the health coach will review\n      progress and help the participant to set \"SMART\" goals (Specific, Measurable, Attainable,\n      Relevant and Time-limited) and will use motivational interviewing techniques to help the\n      participant achieve those goals.  Motivational interviewing is a style of counseling meant\n      to increase participant engagement through strategic use of open-ended questions, reflective\n      listening and positive affirmations.  The study staff will review the participant's progress\n      on his or her goals and help him or her problem solve to resolve challenges and modify goals\n      as needed. During each session, the coach will discuss an educational topic relating to\n      weight loss. Written materials on each topic are included the booklet."
