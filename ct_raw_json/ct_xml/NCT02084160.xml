      The objectives of this study are:

        -  To evaluate the ability of the Methacetin Breath Test  (MBT) to detect hepatic
           decompensation events

        -  To evaluate the relationship between liver Biopsy and clinical outcome and show that
           the MBT has a better predictive ability of clinical outcome than liver biopsy.

        -  To evaluate the ability of the MBT to predict each of the individual liver related
           complications.

      Exalenz has previously gathered information in a previous study on patients with chronic
      liver disease including the methacetin breath test. Several years later, the company wishes
      to investigate this group of subjects and see retrospectively if the breath test was a
      predictor of complications related to their liver disease.

    <description>Hepatic decompensation is defined as the occurrence of at least one of the following events in the time frame between the last 13C Methacetin Breath Test (MBT) to the time of data collection:
Death (liver related)
Transplantation (cadaveric and living donors)
Ascites
HE (Hepatic Encephalopathy)
Newly diagnosed varices or variceal bleeding
SBP (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis)
HRS (Hepatorenal syndrome)
HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma)
