            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Uveal coloboma is a condition where the eye does not form normally. It occurs early in the\n      fetus   s development during pregnancy. It can lead to different kinds of eye problems,\n      including blindness. Several genes have been linked to coloboma, but the cause of most cases\n      is hard to find. Researchers want to study the genes of people who have coloboma and genes\n      from their close, unaffected relatives (such as parents and siblings).\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study the genes associated with uveal coloboma.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 1 years of age who either have uveal coloboma or are an unaffected\n      relative (such as a parent or sibling).\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have a physical exam and medical history. They will also have a full\n           eye exam.\n\n        -  Participants with uveal coloboma may have other exams, such as imaging studies and\n           hearing assessments.\n\n        -  All participants will also provide blood and cheek swab or saliva samples for genetic\n           testing."

Two hundred and forty (240) participants\n      will be enrolled over four years. Participants will undergo a complete age-appropriate\n      baseline eye examination and physical examination and provide a blood or buccal cell sample.\n\n      Outcome Measures:\n\n      The tests, data, and samples collected will be analyzed to better understand the genetics of\n      uveal coloboma. In particular, ocular and systemic associations will be defined in a cohort\n      of well-phenotyped participants with uveal coloboma, as will the risk factors and microforms\n      of coloboma in relatives of affected individuals."
