Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this drug in these patients. III. Determine the\n      pharmacokinetics of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine, preliminarily, the antitumor\n      activity of this drug in these patients.\n\n      V. Correlate the pharmacogenetic polymorphisms of this drug with pharmacokinetics and\n      pharmacodynamics in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study. If myelosuppression is found to be\n      the dose-limiting toxicity, patients are stratified according to prior therapy (more than 2\n      multiagent chemotherapy regimens or radiotherapy to more than 20% of the bone marrow or stem\n      cell transplantation with or without total body irradiation vs more than 2 single-agent\n      phase I or phase II agents) and extent of disease (bone marrow involvement vs meeting none\n      of the stratum I criteria).\n\n      Patients receive oral gefitinib once daily on days 1-28. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of gefitinib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-45 patients will be accrued for this study."
