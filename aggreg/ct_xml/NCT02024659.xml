  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial enrolled  subjects with
      eosinophilic CRSwNP. Subjects were randomized to receive either budesonide inhalation
      suspension or placebo for 14 days. Visual analogue scales (VAS）of nasal symptoms, endoscopic
      polyp scores and morning serum cortical levels were assessed pre- and post-treatment. Polyp
      samples were evaluated for inflammatory cytokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and
      tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) by immunoassay; collagen by histochemistry;
      and frequencies of different T cell subsets by flow cytometry. this study is undertaken to
      evaluate the efficacy of short-term prescription of budesonide inhalation suspension via
      transnasal nebulization by clinical and immunologic assessments. As outcome parameters for
      remodeling, differences in the expression of collagen and albumin were investigated before
      and after budesonide treatment. Meanwhile, TGF-β, MMPs and TIMPs expression differences in
      nasal polyps were investigated to explore underlying mechanisms of tissue reconstitution.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of chronic rhinosinusitis was made on the basis of symptoms of
