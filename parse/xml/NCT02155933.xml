  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormones are substances that are made by the body and are sent directly out into the
      bloodstream to increase or decrease the function of certain organs, glands, or other
      hormones.  Testosterone is a hormone found in the blood of all girls, but some girls have
      too much testosterone in their blood. Too much testosterone in the blood can possibly lead
      to a problem called polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). People with PCOS have abnormal
      menstrual periods, excess facial and body hair, and too much testosterone in their blood. On
      the other hand, some girls with too much testosterone in their blood do not develop PCOS. We
      do not know why some of these girls develop PCOS and why some do not.

      The purpose of this research study is to find out whether too much testosterone can cause
      problems with other hormones that can lead to the development of PCOS. This study may help
      us understand more about the causes of PCOS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common disorder marked by irregular ovulation and
      hyperandrogenism. Hyperandrogenemia during adolescence can be a forerunner of adult PCOS.
      However, the progression of hormonal abnormalities leading to PCOS are unclear. We will
      examine hormonal profiles (e.g., LH, FSH, progesterone, testosterone, estradiol) during
      pubertal maturation in adolescent girls with and without elevated plasma androgens. The
      working hypothesis is that, in pubertal girls without hyperandrogenemia, overnight rises of
      P are associated with a reduction of LH frequency during the waking morning hours. However,
      in pubertal girls with hyperandrogenemia, LH frequency will be higher than normal during
      both the day and night, despite similar or higher P levels. The studies will involve
      frequent blood sampling over 18 hours. We will assess differences in hormone parameters
      between time blocks (1900-2300 h, 2300-0300 h, 0300-0700 h, 0700-1100 h) in individuals to
      evaluate day-night changes. We will compare such changes between those with
      hyperandrogenemia and those without hyperandrogenemia.
