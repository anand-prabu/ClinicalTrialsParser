  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study, single-center, prospective, open-label, to assess the acceptability
      and performance of the experimental medical device (SPI) used during an imaging examination
      (PET / CT 4D imaging in synchronized mode centered on the thorax). Each patient will be its
      own control, since the imaging examination will be synchronized simultaneously with the two
      systems: tested Medical Device (SPI) and reference Medical Device(RPM).

    <description>feasibility is evaluated in a composite end point (success will be obtained in case of concomitant success of the 4 sub-criteria assessment):
Tolerance / acceptability of the patient to breathe into SPI throughout the examination)
Detection of breath cycle of the patient by measuring dCycleSpi (dCycleSpi = Number of synchronization signals emitted by SPI / total number of breath cycle * 100).
Accuracy of detection of inspiratory peak amplitudes with SPI medical device: by measuring dtSpi (dtSpi = standard deviation of the time lag between synchronization signals and maximum inspiratory amplitude for each cycle).
