The condition, referred to as microvascular angina\n      (MVA) or cardiac syndrome X, is not as benign as originally reported\u2014patients presenting\n      with unstable angina and nonobstructive atherosclerotic coronary artery disease have a 2%\n      risk of death or myocardial infarction at 30 days of follow-up. It is more common in women\n      in whom the first presentation of angina occurs either perimenopausally or postmenopausally.\n      Aberrant flow-mediated coronary vasomotion is pivotal in the pathogenesis (systemic)\n      impairment in endothelial function. Indeed, some centers use systemic assessments of\n      vascular function in their diagnostic pathways for this group of women. It was recently\n      suggested that endothelial dysfunction may lead to myocardial ischemia.\n\n      In the present study, the investigators tested the hypothesis that udenafil offers dual\n      benefits of improving vascular function and lessening ischemia in women with angina,\n      perfusion defect in cardiac MRI, and normal coronary arteries."
