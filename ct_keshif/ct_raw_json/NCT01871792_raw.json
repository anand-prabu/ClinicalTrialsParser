            "textblock": "Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is a well-recognized complication of radiographic\n      contrast administration and is associated with increased short- and long-term mortality.\n      Previous strategies including forced diuresis with diuretics or mannitol, intravenous\n      administration of fenoldopam or dobutamine, and postprocedure hemodialysis to prevent CIN\n      have been largely unsuccessful. In addition, the use of N-acetylcysteine to prevent CIN has\n      yielded conflicting outcomes.\n\n      A review of a large insurance database and retrospective study have shown that statins\n      therapy is associated with a lower incidence of CIN after percutaneous coronary\n      intervention. The preventive effect of statins on CIN may be attributed to direct\n      pleiotropic effects on the vascular wall such as improvement of endothelial dysfunction,\n      anti-inflammatory or anti-oxidative effect. However, recent randomized trial could not\n      demonstrate the preventive effect of statin on CIN in patients with chronic kidney disease.\n\n      Thus, we will investigate the preventive effect of pitavastatin on CIN in patient with renal\n      dysfunction undergoing coronary angiography or intervention."
