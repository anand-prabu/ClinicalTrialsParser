  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Congenital myopathies are clinical and genetic heterogeneous disorders characterized by
      skeletal muscle weakness. Most patients experience muscle weakness and fatigue throughout
      their life. However, progression of symptoms is rare. There are no specific treatments for
      congenital myopathies. Training has been shown to benefit several other muscle diseases with
      weakness, but the defect in congenital myopathies involves contractile proteins of the
      sarcomere, why the effect of training is uncertain in these conditions. The investigators
      will therefore investigate the effect cycle-ergometer training for 30 minutes, three times
      weakly, for ten weeks in 15 patients with congenital myopathy. Another 5-10 congenital
      myopathy patients, who do not train, will serve as controls for the trained patients. The
      study starts and ends with a test day, where efficacy based on VO2max, performance in
      functional tests and a questionnaire will be assessed.
