  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corneal transplantation is the most commonly performed human tissue transplant worldwide.
      Over 40,000 corneal transplants occur in the US each year.  .

      This study will determine specific corneal neovascularization (CN) patterns in human corneal
      allograft recipients to determine the characteristics that worsen the prognosis for graft
      survival. We will test the hypothesis that specific characteristics of CN are prognostic for
      corneal allograft rejection.

      The investigators hope to enroll 240 subjects into the study. These patients will be
      enrolled prior to penetrating keratoplasty. They will be examined by the full protocol
      preoperatively, and postoperatively at 1 week, 1, 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months.  During these
      visits slit lamp biomicroscopy will be used to study CN patterns, and take slit lamp
      photographs if there is any neovascularization detected, permitting us to develop algorithms
      of CN characteristics that are predictive for corneal allograft rejection and failure.  The
      corneal tissue removed during these patients' surgeries will be evaluated
      histopathologically to identify inflammation and neovascularization to confirm and compare
      to what is seen clinically. There will be two short questionnaires conducted at each visit
      to assess stress levels.
