  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rationale underlying this project is the fact that HA is a very common compensatory
      interven¬tion within municipality health care, undertaken to support an independent living
      in the own home. In addition, MD are frequently prescribed and used among HA clients in
      order to compensate for declined body functions. In spite of this, knowledge of their
      effects for the individual and the society is still scarce. In particular, systematic,
      evidence-based strategies based on clear-cut conceptual definitions and descriptions of
      procedures are lacking. Such strategies are crucial in order to evaluate the effects of HA
      and MD.

      The overarching aim is to investigate outcomes of HA on aspects of home and health for
      sub-groups of persons with disabilities.

      The specific aims are to:

        -  Investigate the effects of HA on home and health related outcomes, i.e. usability, fear
           of falling, activity/participation and health-related quality of life for different
           subgroups of persons, e.g. MD users and non MD-users

        -  Investigate the use of a new practice strategy for HA on home and health related
           outcomes for subgroups of persons with disabilities in terms of differences between
           municipalities

        -  Investigate societal level outcomes of HA and MD, i.e. costs and quality adjusted life
           years

        -  Gain a deeper understanding of the processes behind changes in outcomes We hypothesise
           that using a structure strategy for housing adaptation and mobility devices case
           management in ordinary practice in Swedish municipalities increase activity,
           participation, the usability of the home, and reduces societal costs.
