In the proposed research, we will utilize\n      genetically-determined differences in food preferences, indexed by PROP bitter taste\n      phenotype to develop a novel approach to weight loss therapy.  The overall goal of this\n      project is to determine if weight loss following a 6 month intervention can be substantially\n      improved by matching participants with diets that reflect their genetically-determined food\n      preferences. The study is designed as a randomized clinical weight-loss intervention trial\n      in women in which PROP non-tasters and super-tasters. will be randomized to either the\n      low-carbohydrate or the low-fat diet condition"
