If using certain topical products and medications\n      that are not allowed during this study, patients may be asked to withhold them for the\n      remainder of the study.  The study doctor or study coordinator will explain which\n      medications and activities are not allowed during this study. Baseline bacterial swabs from\n      the bilateral volar forearms will be collected followed by application and rinsing of hand\n      wash on the right forearm, and water wash on the left forearm.  200 microliters of\n      water/hand wash will be applied to the volar forearms and lather generated for 15 seconds\n      using a gloved hand. The lather will be allowed to stay in contact with the skin for an\n      additional 30 seconds. The total contact time will be 60 sec. The forearm will be rinsed\n      with running tap water for 15 seconds, air-dried for 5 minutes and the skin surface will\n      again be swabbed for bacteria. The same procedure will be repeated on the 2nd volar forearm\n      with the opposing wash. Subjects will return at 24 hours +/- 6 hours for repeat bacterial\n      swabbings for AMPs for three subsequent visits.  Subjects will be instructed to avoid\n      rigorous exercise/swimming, significant sun exposure (i.e. sunbathing), cleaning the\n      forearms with other antibacterial products, and to wrap forearms in saran wrap when\n      showering/bathing during the period of measurements.\n\n      On Day 1(24 hours +/- 6 hours from day 0)- Day 0 procedures will be repeated with new\n      bacterial swab samples taken.\n\n      On Day 2(24 hours +/- 6 hours from day 1)- Day 0 procedures will be repeated with new\n      bacterial swab samples taken.\n\n      On Day 3 (-24 hours +/- 6 hours from day 2)- Day 0 procedures will be repeated with new\n      bacterial swab samples taken.\n\n      The timeline for subsequent patients will be as follows:\n\n      On Day 0, after being given a witnessed, written, informed consent, a medical history and a\n      limited physical exam will be performed.

Baseline bacterial swabs from\n      the bilateral volar forearms will be collected followed by application and rinsing of a hand\n      wash with an antimicrobial compound on the right forearm, and a cleanser without an\n      antimicrobial compound on the left forearm.  200 microliters of water/hand wash will be\n      applied to the volar forearms and lather generated for 15 seconds using a gloved hand. The\n      lather will be allowed to stay in contact with the skin for an additional 30 seconds. The\n      total contact time will be 60 sec.

Subjects will be instructed to avoid rigorous exercise/swimming, significant\n      sun exposure (i.e. sunbathing), cleaning the forearms with other antibacterial products, and\n      showering during these 24 hours.\n\n      On day 7, the exact procedures completed on Day 0 will be repeated, however this time the\n      procedures will be done using a soap with a different antimicrobial compound on the right\n      forearm.  The same control soap will again be used on the left forearm.  The forearm\n      washings and skin swabbings will be conducted exactly as before."
