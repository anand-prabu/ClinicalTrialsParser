  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical exercise training appears effective for low to moderate patients assigned to
      cardiac rehabilitation. However, adherence to cardiac rehabilitation is low and physical
      activity levels often drop after attending the last supervised rehabilitation session.

      This study will compare home based physical exercise training including telemonitoring with
      regular centre based physical exercise training. Main outcome measures are the change in
      physical activity and the change in physical fitness (peak Oxygen uptake) after the initial
      rehabilitation period (12 weeks) and after 1 year. Secondary outcome measures are
      cost-effectiveness, training adherence, health-related quality of life and patient
      satisfaction.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physical training has beneficial effects on exercise capacity, cardiac function, quality of
      life and mortality in patients with acute cardiovascular syndrome or after cardiac surgery
      and is therefore one of the main aspects of cardiac rehabilitation. However, adherence to
      this therapy is low and effects tempt to decrease directly after the treatment period.

      The objective of this study is to compare the effects of home-based exercise training (HT)
      with telemonitoring guidance and regular centre-based exercise training (CT) on physical
      fitness (PF), assessed by peak oxygen uptake, and physical activity (PA), assessed by
      physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE), in low to moderate risk cardiac rehabilitation
      (CR) patients. Secondary endpoints are cost-effectiveness, training adherence,
      health-related quality of life (QoL) and patient satisfaction.

      Single-centre randomized controlled trial. CR patients are randomized to HT (n=45) or CT
      (n=45). Assessments are performed at baseline, 12 weeks and 1 year, consisting of maximal
      exercise testing with respiratory gas exchange analysis, assessment of PAEE, QoL (also at 6
      months), patient satisfaction (at 12 weeks only) and health care costs (12 weeks, 6 months
      and 1 year) Study population: Low to moderate risk patients entering outpatient CR after an
      acute coronary syndrome or revascularization with internet access and PC at home.

      12-week training program (24-36 one-hour sessions) at 70-85% of their maximal heart rate
      (HR). In the CT group training is supervised by a physical therapist; in the HT group
      training is performed in the home environment using a HR monitor to determine training
      intensity and with weekly feedback / motivation by an exercise specialist who has access to
      the online HR-data. After 12 weeks, subjects in the HT group are encouraged to continue
      using the HR monitor.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoints: PF (peak oxygen uptake) and PA (physical
      activity energy expenditure, PAEE) assessed by a tri-axial accelerometer and HR monitor.
      Secondary endpoints: training adherence, QoL (SF-36) and patient satisfaction (CQ index).

      Exercise training performed by patients after Acute Coronary Disease (ACS) and
      revascularization, classified as low to moderate risk, is considered to be safe. The
      training program that will be used in this study has been evaluated in a similar population
      of elderly cardiac patients without any documented harmful effects. In order to reduce
      potential risks of exercise training all patients perform a maximal cardiopulmonary exercise
      test at baseline, excluding patients with myocardial ischaemia and ventricular arrhythmias
      during exercise. The first three training sessions will be under supervision of trained
      physiotherapist in a clinical setting. The patients will receive a heart rate monitor and
      accelerometer to use at home. These monitors are developed and optimized to cause minimal
      physical discomfort and are non-invasive. During the measurement periods, all patients are
      asked to wear the monitors continuously for 5 days and to note the physical activities
      performed. The HT group will use the HR monitors during their physical trainings as well.

    <description>After the first three supervised training sessions in the hospitals, patients in the home-based training group are instructed to wear a heart rate monitor during exercise training at home. Prescribed exercise exists of two or three exercise sessions per week, of one hour at 70 - 85% of their maximum heart rate.
Once a week the heart rate data is uploaded and evaluated by an exercise specialist together with the patient by telephone.</description>

    <description>Patients in the centre-based training group will perform all trainings sessions under direct supervision of a physical therapist specialized in CR. Training sessions will be performed on an cycle ergometer, starting with a warm up phase of 5 min, followed by 50 min of cycling at 70-85% of the maximal HR and a cooling down period of 5 min. During the training period, physical therapists will record attendance, training duration and actual training intensity. After the 12-week training period patients receive individual advice from their physical therapist on physical activities.</description>
