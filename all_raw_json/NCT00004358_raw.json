Determine whether intermittent, long-term, subcutaneous administration of\n      calcitonin increases phosphaturia, reduces hyperphosphatemia, and increases intact\n      parathyroid hormone levels in patients with tumoral calcinosis.\n\n      II.  Determine whether calcitonin reduces or prevents tumor recurrence. III.  Determine\n      whether hyperphosphatemia abolishes the normal circadian pattern of serum phosphorus.\n\n      IV.  Determine how repetitive calcitonin administration alters the biochemical markers of\n      bone metabolism in osteopenic patients with tumoral calcinosis."
