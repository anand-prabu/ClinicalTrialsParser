  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)
      and luteinizing hormone (LH) pulses are controlled during puberty. In this study, the
      investigators aim to discover whether or not giving 2 small doses of progesterone to early
      pubertal girls will prevent the nighttime increase of GnRH and LH pulses. From the
      information gathered in this study, the investigators may be able to learn more about how
      menstrual cycles are normally established in girls during puberty. Ultimately, if these
      normal processes can be understood, the investigators may be able to better understand
      abnormalities of puberty.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      LH exhibits diurnal changes during early puberty, with nocturnal increases in LH pulse
      frequency and amplitude, but subsequent reduction during the following day. Progesterone (P)
      levels increase overnight in peripubertal girls, and P is the primary effector of LH pulse
      frequency slowing in adult women. The investigators hypothesize that nocturnal LH increases
      stimulate ovarian P, which in turn suppresses LH pulsatility during the following day. The
      investigators will assess this further using a protocol in which two doses of P or placebo
      are given to early pubertal girls, with subsequent assessment of LH pulses over 14 hours.
      The investigators hypothesize that in early pubertal girls, LH pulse frequency will be lower
      in girls receiving P compared to girls receiving placebo.
