            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      Hospitalized children and children undergoing medical care as outpatients are frequently\n      required to undergo needle-related procedures, such as venipuncture for diagnostic purposes\n      and ongoing monitoring (Ellis, Sharp, Newhook, & Cohen, 2004). This procedure causes\n      considerable pain and distress, especially in young children (Humphrey, Boon, van Linden van\n      den Heuvell, & van de Wiel, 1992). Children rate needles as being the most distressing\n      aspect of hospitalization (Kortesluoma & Nikkonen, 2006; Kortesluoma & Nikkonen, 2004), yet\n      they are the most frequently performed skin-breaking procedure for hospitalized children\n      (Cummings, Reid, Finley, McGrath, & Ritchie, 1996; Ellis, et al., 2004; Rennick, McHarg,\n      Dell'Api, Johnston, & Stevens, 2008; Stevens et al., 2011). It is estimated that one-quarter\n      of adults have developed a fear needles, most likely developed during childhood (Taddio et\n      al., 2010; Wright, Yelland, Heathcote, Ng, & Wright, 2009). Being afraid of needles\n      increases the risk of avoidance of needles for immunizations and medical care (Taddio et\n      al., 2009; Wright, et al., 2009). It is therefore crucial that health care researchers and\n      clinicians determine effective pain management strategies for young children, and\n      consistently use such strategies in clinical care.\n\n      Rationale:\n\n      There is a paucity of evidence to support efficacy and feasibility of pain management\n      strategies during needle-related painful procedures in young children, and uncertainties\n      exist regarding analgesic effects of sweet solutions beyond infancy.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to ascertain whether there is evidence of efficacy of\n      oral 24% sucrose (TootSweet, Natural Product Number (NPN) 80021492) in toddlers (ages 12 to\n      36 months) compared to placebo (water) during venipuncture, as measured by pain scores and\n      cry duration.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      A single-centre, phase IV, blinded, two-armed randomized controlled trial (RCT).\n\n      Study population: Children aged 12 to 36 months, who are inpatients in the surgical/medical\n      wards of an urban pediatric tertiary care centre who require venipuncture for the purpose of\n      medically-required venous blood sampling.\n\n      Sample size: Data from 140 toddlers; 70 randomized to receive sucrose and 70 randomized to\n      receive water.\n\n      Data collection: Enrolled children will be video-recorded during their procedure in order to\n      permit completion of the primary outcome measurement at a later date by researchers blinded\n      to the study solutions who were not part of the data collection process.\n\n      Statistical analysis: The primary analysis will consist of a two-way ANOVA with main effects\n      for intervention group and age group. As a secondary analysis, an interaction between\n      intervention and age group will be tested. The primary analysis will be adapted to include\n      adjustment for number of previous hospitalizations and length of current hospitalization and\n      number of venipuncture attempts."
