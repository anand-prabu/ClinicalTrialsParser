II.\n      Characterize the nature and severity of toxicity of this drug in these patients. III.\n      Document any clinical responses to this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive MVF-HER-2(628-647)-CRL 1005\n      vaccine intramuscularly on days 1 and 29. Cohorts of 5 patients receive escalating doses of\n      MVF-HER-2(627-647)-CRL 1005 vaccine until at least 2 of 5 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. Patients are followed on days 43 and 57 and every 2 months for at least 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 5-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
