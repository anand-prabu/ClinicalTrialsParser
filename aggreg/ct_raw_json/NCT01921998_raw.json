            "textblock": "Side effects from chemotherapy can be severe in some patients leading to admission to\n      hospital, a worse quality of life and delays in subsequent doses of chemotherapy. A blood\n      test that could predict patients who will go on to develop severe side effects could be\n      useful and might allow early intervention with medicines to reduce the severity of the\n      symptoms and prevent admission to hospital.\n\n      This study will collect blood samples from patients with lymphoma or sarcoma who are\n      receiving chemotherapy (with an expected admission rate for neutropenic sepsis, one of the\n      side effects that most commonly results in hospital admission, of less than 20%). It will\n      assess whether changes in blood proteins (\"biomarkers\") taken 2 days after the 1st\n      chemotherapy can predict subsequent severe side effects throughout the 4 months of\n      chemotherapy. In addition the investigators will collect data on quality of life and contact\n      with medical professionals to assess the costs of chemotherapy toxicity to both the patient\n      and health service. This will allow us in the future to model the cost effectiveness of\n      using biomarkers in this manner to try and reduce chemotherapy toxicity."
