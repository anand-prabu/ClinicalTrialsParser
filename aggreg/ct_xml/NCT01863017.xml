  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of transcranial direct current
      stimulation (tDCS) as it modifies hyperphagia in obese subjects, non-obese subjects, and
      subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PWS is characterized by hypotonia, feeding difficulties, developmental delay and failure to
      thrive during infancy, and by an insatiable appetite (hyperphagia), rapid weight gain and
      obesity in early childhood.

      Hyperphagia is one of the most prominent and debilitating features of PWS, and currently no
      pharmaceutical drug has been successful in decreasing appetite in such patients.

      tDCS is a safe, noninvasive method whereby a weak electric current is directly transmitted
      into the brain via external electrodes connected to a 9-volt radio battery. It is based on
      decades-old observations that nerve cell firing can be altered by low amplitude direct
      current (DC). The researchers in this study believe that tDCS may have a positive impact on
      hyperphagia and weight.

      In this study, the investigators intend to assess whether the effects tDCS differ between
      obese subjects, non-obese subjects, and subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome by measuring the
      amplitude and latency of eyeblink startle responses to a set of food- and non-food-related
      visual stimuli in all subjects, various hyperphagia questionnaires, and cognitive and
      behavioral assessments. It is hypothesized that as a group, subjects with Prader-Willi
      syndrome will demonstrate behavioral and psychometric evidence of abnormal food image
      processing, craving and associated behaviors relative to our control groups, and this group
      may receive potentially beneficial effects from tDCS sessions.  Obese subjects are also
      predicted to have decreased hyperphagia and food cravings as a result of tDCS.

    <description>Comparing the amplitude of eyeblink startle responses to a set of food- and non-food-related visual stimuli in all subjects to measure effect of tDCS.
Muscle contractions generated by the orbicularis oculi will be recorded by a BIOPAC systems bioamplifier (model EMG 100c) passing 10-500 Hz signals, sampling at a rate of 2000/second and amplified by a factor of 5000. Eyeblink startle-responses will be measured at two lead-intervals (2500 ms and 6000 ms) to assess emotional responses (e.g., early and late, respectively) for each picture stimulus. Startle responses will be assessed during (e.g., while viewing the food, puppy, etc.) and between (e.g., during washout periods; no-images) visual image-processing.</description>

    <description>Use of Dykens Hyperphagia Questionnaire to assess whether active anodal tDCS stimulation of the right frontal brain cortex modifies hyperphagia in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome when compared with sham or no stimulation in relationship to similar healthy obese controls.
The Dykens Hyperphagia Questionnaire is a 13-item instrument that was specifically designed to measure food-related preoccupations and problems, as well as the severity of these concerns. Items on the questionnaire are rated on a five-point scale (1: not a problem to 5: severe and/or frequent problem).</description>

    <description>Use of Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire to assess whether active anodal tDCS stimulation of the right frontal brain cortex modifies hyperphagia in subjects with Prader-Willi syndrome when compared with sham or no stimulation in relationship to similar healthy obese controls.
The Three-Factor Eating Questionnaire is a self-completed, 51-item questionnaire that measures both cognitive and behavioral aspects of eating (dietary restraint, disinhibition, and hunger), and comprises two parts. Part 1 includes 36 true/false questions, and part 2 includes 14 questions on a four point Likert scale (1= rarely, 2 = sometimes, 3 = usually, 4 = always) and 1 question on a five point Likert scale (1 = eat whatever you want, whenever you want it to 5 = constantly limiting food intake, never 'giving in'; other questions).</description>
