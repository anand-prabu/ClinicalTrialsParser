Patients are randomized to 1 of 3\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive low-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 8 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive high-dose epratuzumab IV over 1 hour once weekly for 4 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
