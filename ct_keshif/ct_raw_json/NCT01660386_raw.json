Subjects will be placed\n      in a recumbent position and cannula will be inserted in a dorsal hand vein. The hand will be\n      placed in a heating box (42C) throughout the experiment to allow frequent sampling of\n      arterialized blood. A second cannula will be inserted in a contralateral cubital vein for\n      glucose infusion.\n\n      At time zero (0 min), a 50% glucose bolus will be injected during 1 min to increase PG to\n      12mM. The glucose bolus will be calculated as:(12mM-FPG)\u00d735 mg glucose \u00d7 body weight (kg).\n      PG will be measured bedside every 5 min and maintained at 12mM by an adjustable continuous\n      20% glucose infusion. After 90min, PG will be lowered down below 6mM for the islet cells to\n      rest, then the subject will be instructed to consume 75g glucose solution orally in 5min, PG\n      will be measured bedside every 5 min and maintained below 6mM for 40min then restart the\n      90min-hyperglycaemic clamp experiment. The oral period of hyperglycaemic clamp process is\n      the same as what's done in fasting period. Blood samples will be collected in -2h, 0min,\n      10min, 90min in both hyperglycaemic clamp experimental process for the measurement of\n      insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, active GLP-1, total GLP-1 and DPP-4 activity.\n\n      Thus we could evaluate the beta cell function represented by the first phase and the second\n      phase of insulin secretion(C-peptide secretion) and alpha cell function represented by the\n      change of glucagon concentration during the fasting period and oral period of hyperglycaemic\n      clamp experiment and the change of active GLP-1, total GLP-1 and DPP-4 activity as well."
