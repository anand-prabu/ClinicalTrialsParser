      The purpose of this study is:

        -  to assess clinical efficiency of Subetta in the combined treatment of type II diabetes
           mellitus;

        -  to assess safety of Subetta in the combined treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with type II diabetes mellitus are included in the trial. It is concerned those
      patients, who by the time of the trial receive basal insulin with metformin or metformin and
      sulfonylurea derivatives and with lack of optimal glycemic control (HbA1c&gt;7.0%). For
      patients, which will be included in the trial (mainly middle aged patients without severe
      complications of diabetes), HbA1c&gt;7.0% is the marker showing that optimal individual goal of
      glycemic control is not achieved.

      If a patient meets inclusion criteria and does not show non- inclusion criteria he/she is
      randomized in one of 2 groups: Group 1 - the group receiving standard type II diabetes
      mellitus therapy + Subetta at a dose of 1 tablet 4 times a day; Group 2 - the group
      receiving standard type II diabetes mellitus therapy + Placebo under the regimen used for
      Subetta. The invented names of the drugs containing basal insulin, metformin and
      sulfonylurea derivatives used as standard type II diabetes mellitus therapy, should be
      unchanged for each patient during the whole trial.

      All patients will receive glucometers and the appropriate glucose test strips, so they could
      self monitor blood glucose and register this data in their diaries.

      The trial duration is 26 weeks; the main stages of the trial are conducted during screening,
      then in 4 weeks (Visit 2), in 12 weeks (Visit 3) and in 24 weeks (Visit 4). In 1 week after
      randomization and the onset of the trial therapy and between the visits to the study site
      (on weeks 8±1 and 18±1) an investigator collects data on patient's health and complaints
      (phone visits) to decide whether it is necessary to arrange unplanned visit to the site.

If the mean value of fasting blood glucose is lower than 4.0 mmol/L and a patient shows unreasonable signs or symptoms of hypoglycemia, then dose of basal insulin should be reduced by 2 units.
If value of fasting blood glucose for 3 consecutive days was ≥7 mmol/L, then dose of basal insulin should be increased by 2 units and more (depending on individual values).
Based on the same values investigator can change dose of per oral blood sugar-lowering drugs.</description>
