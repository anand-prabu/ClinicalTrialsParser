  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to explore the clinical utility of the three investigational
      agents in HR+, HER2- breast cancer. LEE011 (CDK4/6 inhibitor), BKM120 (PI3K-pan class
      I-inhibitor) and BYL719 (PI3K-alpha specific class I inhibitor) in combination with
      fulvestrant.

      This is a multi-center, open-label Phase Ib/II study. The Phase Ib portion of the study is a
      dose escalation to estimate the MTD and/or RP2D for three regimens: LEE011 with fulvestrant;
      LEE011 and BKM120 with fulvestrant; LEE011and BYL719 with fulvestrant.

      The Phase II portion of the study will be a randomized study to assess the anti-tumor
      activity as well as safety and tolerability of  LEE011 with fulvestrant to LEE011 and BKM120
      with fulvestrant,  and LEE011 and BYL719 with fulvestrant in patients with  ER+/HER2-
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

      Approximately 216 adult women with ER+/HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer
      will be enrolled.
