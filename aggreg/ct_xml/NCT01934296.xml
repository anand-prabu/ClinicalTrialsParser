  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use an investigational device to record brain activity for
      12 months following surgical implantation of deep brain stimulation (DBS) systems. The goal
      of the study is better understanding of brain activity in movement disorders, not to bring
      new devices to market.

    <description>Cortical synchronization is measured  by the interaction of low frequency rhythms with high frequency activity in the power spectrum of the cortical local field potential.  The measure is called &quot;phase amplitude coupling&quot; and is described in detail in our publication, de Hemptinne et al, Exaggerated phase amplitude coupling in the primary motor cortex in Parkinson disease, PNAS 2013, 110:4780-4785</description>

    <description>This is a one-arm, single-center study of the neurophysiology of human movement disorders with two goals: 1) Assess the feasibility of chronic brain recording using a novel fully implantable pulse generator (Medtronic Activa PC+S), which has the capability of sensing and storing local field potentials (LFPs) recorded from implanted electrodes, in addition to providing therapeutic deep brain stimulation (DBS).  2)  Study acute and chronic effects of therapeutic DBS on cortical LFPs.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria(both groups):

          -  Ability to give informed consent for the study

          -  Movement disorder symptoms that are sufficiently severe, in spite of best medical
             therapy, to warrant surgical implantation of deep brain stimulators according to
             standard clinical criteria

        Inclusion criteria (primary dystonia):

          -  Age 22-75

          -  Primary dystonia that is generalized or segmental, that must affect one or - Stable
             doses of anti-dystonia medications (such as Artane, Baclofen, or Clonopin) for at
             least 30 days prior to baseline assessment

          -  For patients with craniofacial involvement, prior treatment with botulinum toxin with
             failure to adequately control dystonia symptoms.

        Inclusion criteria (PD):

          -  Age 30-75

          -  Bilateral disease (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or greater)

          -  Has been treated with levodopa/carbidopa, and with a dopamine agonist, at the maximal
             tolerated doses as determined by a movement disorders neurologist

          -  Stable doses of antiParkinsonian medications for at least 30 days prior to their
             baseline assessment

          -  Significant disability in the setting of optimal medical management by a movement
             disorders neurologist.  Disability may be due to tremor that is unresponsive to
             medications, or to motor fluctuations

          -  UPDRS-III score off medication between 20 and 60*

          -  Improvement of at least 30% in the baseline UPDRS-III on medication score, compared
             to the baseline off-medication score.

        Exclusion Criteria (both groups):

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding

          -  MRI showing cortical atrophy out of proportion to age

          -  MRI showing focal brain lesions that could indicate a non-idiopathic movement
             disorder,

          -  Major comorbidity increasing the risk of surgery (prior stroke, severe hypertension,
             severe diabetes, or need for chronic anticoagulation other than aspirin)

          -  Inability to comply with study follow-up visits

          -  Any prior intracranial surgery

          -  Mood depression with a Beck depression inventory score of &gt; 17 on baseline screening

          -  Significant cognitive impairment (MoCA&lt;25).

          -  History of seizures

          -  Immunocompromised

          -  Has an active infection

          -  Requires diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) or transcranial magnetic - Has an
             implanted electronic  device such as  a neurostimulator, cardiac pacemaker or
             medication pump.
