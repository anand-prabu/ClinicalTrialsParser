  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to help diabetic patients with uncontrolled hypertension (HTN)
      better understand their risk for Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) and to give them specific
      feedback via a telephone intervention on how to reduce that risk through behavioral changes.

      We hypothesize that patients with DKD and uncontrolled HTN who receive this intervention
      will have less progression, or a smaller decrease in kidney function, after 3 years when
      compared to the education control group.

      A randomized, controlled trial to slow DKD progression:

        1. Using an innovative telehealth approach that is potentially scalable with  demonstrable
           efficacy in reducing antecedents of kidney disease, including poor blood pressure,
           glucose, and lipid control

        2. Enrolling demographically diverse patients from local primary care clinics to allow
           applicability of our results to the general US population within existing delivery
           systems; and

        3. Targeting patients with moderate DKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate between
           45-90 ml/min/1.73m2 with evidence of diabetic nephropathy) and uncontrolled HTN (blood
           pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg), accounting for about 20% of all patients with diabetes who
           disproportionately suffer from end-stage renal disease (ESRD), cardiovascular events,
           and death.

    <description>A tailored intervention with medication management and behavioral components. The behavioral modules may include, diet, exercise, weight, tobacco use, medication management, side effects, diabetes education, diabetic kidney disease risk and knowledge and cardiovascular disease (CVD)  /hypercholesterolemia/hypertension risk knowledge.  In addition, individuals will receive individualized information on their 10-year risk for stroke and CVD. Individuals will also receive information on how changing a particular value such as BP or cholesterol levels can reduce subsequent risks. Based on the patient's responses to a series of questions, there will be a provision of tailored feedback to reinforce evidence-based behavior for disease and lifestyle management.</description>
