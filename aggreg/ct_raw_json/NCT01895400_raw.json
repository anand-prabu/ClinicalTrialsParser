During patients selection period for inclusion(2 weeks), taking\n                medication for vertigo is prohibited.\n\n             -  Included patients will be randomized to Treatment group (Renexin) and Placebo\n                group.\n\n             -  All patients before treatment will do dizziness handicap inventory(DHI), visual\n                analogue scale (VAS) for vertigo, questionnaire for quality of life (SF36).\n\n             -  After 4 weeks(+-~ 3 days) of drug administration, DHI, VAS for vertigo, SF36 will\n                be done for drug compliance and side effects.\n\n             -  After 8 weeks(+-~ 3 days) of drug administration, posturography, DHI, VAS for\n                vertigo, SF36 will be done for drug compliance and side effects.\n\n             -  For control of severe vertigo during drug administration, Valium 2mg can be used\n                as a salvage treatment, and number of valium administration will be checked at\n                every visit.\n\n        2. Statistical analysis\n\n             -  As a statistical analysis, paired T-test will be used to compare equilibrium\n                score, DHI, VAS, SF-36. When p-value is <0.05, it will be considered as\n                significant difference."
