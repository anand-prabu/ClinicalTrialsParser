            "textblock": "Currently, appropriate patients undergo MRI imaging with immobilization and sequences\n      optimized for diagnostic radiology purposes.  Using a mutual information algorithm, these\n      images are then registered to a treatment planning CT obtained with custom immobilization to\n      minimize intra-and inter-treatment motion and positional variation.  This image registration\n      process is time-consuming and introduces additional layers of geometric uncertainty into\n      what should be a highly precise treatment planning process.  However, it is necessary, since\n      radiation dose calculations cannot be performed on MRI data due to the lack of crucial\n      density information.  Ultimately, we envision CT-less treatment planning, using only MRI,\n      due to superior imaging characteristics, fully integrated into the radiation oncology\n      clinic.  This study will begin this process."
