The post\n      stroke disabilities are due to loss of locomotion and activities of daily living, cognition\n      and communication skills.Hemispatial neglect has been reported in association with damage to\n      several different cerebral structures in a large-scale distributed neurocognitive\n      network.Mirror therapy improves the hand function in sub-acute stroke. It also helps in the\n      recovery of neglect in stroke patients. But little consensus exists as to whether one\n      treatment is more efficacious than others and many studies fail to document duration of\n      treatment effects or generalization to daily activities. The aim of our study is to evaluate\n      the effectiveness of limb activation with MT and limb activation strategy alone in the\n      management of stroke patients with unilateral neglect and to make the patient functional in\n      activities of daily living."
