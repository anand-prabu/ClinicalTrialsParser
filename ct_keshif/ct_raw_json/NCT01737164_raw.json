            "textblock": "Aging is a major risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2DM).  Approximately\n      50% of subjects aged \u226565 have diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance, a pre-diabetic state.\n      Skeletal muscle is the main site of insulin-stimulated glucose disposal and aging is\n      characterized by muscle insulin resistance.  It has been suggested that the insulin\n      resistance of aging results from an age-related accumulation of intramyocellular lipids\n      which impair insulin action. However, the molecular basis for the accumulation of\n      intramyocellular fat and insulin resistance in the elderly remains unknown.  AMP-activated\n      protein kinase (AMPK) is an energy-sensing enzyme whose activation results in increased\n      fatty acid oxidation.  Purpose: In the proposed study, we will test the hypotheses that the\n      decrease in fat oxidation that occurs in muscle from older human subjects is secondary to an\n      age-mediated reduction in AMPK signaling, in vivo, and that upregulating AMPK signaling\n      through exercise training will result in (and correlate with) increased fat oxidation,\n      reduced intramyocellular lipids, and improved insulin action.  Using a primary human muscle\n      cell culture system, also we will test that hypotheses that reduced AMPK signaling in old\n      myotubes leads to lower fat oxidation (in vitro) and that chemical activation of AMPK in old\n      myotubes to the same level as young muscle cells will restore insulin action and help\n      prevent fat-induced insulin resistance.  To test these hypotheses the following specific\n      aims (objectives) are proposed:\n\n      Specific Aim 1) To determine whether reduced AMPK signaling in muscle from older subjects,\n      in vivo, is associated with lower fat oxidation rates and insulin resistance, and whether\n      physical activity improves glucose homeostasis in older subjects by upregulating AMPK\n      signaling in muscle.  We will test the hypotheses that (i) reductions in AMPK signaling in\n      muscle from older subjects will be associated with (predict) lower fat oxidation rates and\n      insulin resistance, in vivo; and (ii) training-induced increases in AMPK signaling in older\n      subjects will be associated with (predict) increases in fat oxidation, reductions in\n      intramyocellular lipids, and improvements in insulin action/sensitivity.\n\n      Specific Aim 2) To determine whether age-related declines in AMPK signaling are involved in\n      the reductions in fat oxidation and insulin resistance that occur in aging.  Using an in\n      vitro primary muscle cell culture system, we will test the hypotheses that (i) reduced AMPK\n      signaling in myotubes from older subjects leads to decreased mitochondrial fatty acid\n      oxidation; and (ii) reduced AMPK signaling and fat oxidation in myotubes from older subjects\n      will result in increased susceptibility to fat-induced insulin resistance.\n\n      Specific Aim 3) To examine whether the age-related reductions in fat oxidation and insulin\n      sensitivity in old muscle cells can be reversed by upregulating AMPK signaling.  We will\n      test the hypothesis that chemical activation of AMPK in old myotubes (in vitro) to the same\n      level as young muscle cells will restore insulin signaling and help prevent fat-induced\n      insulin resistance."
