  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During the last 2 decades, several studies have tried to define the best surgical approach
      to hysterectomy for benign uterine diseases1. Accumulating evidence demonstrates that
      abdominal hysterectomy has a higher incidence of complications, a longer hospital stay and a
      slower convalescence in comparison with laparoscopic hysterectomy (LH). The main advantage
      of LHs is the absence of a wide abdominal scar, which results in fewer wound-related
      complications and in a significant decrease of postoperative pain.

      Technologic advances in endoscopic instrumentation and optics have allowed the development
      of an even less invasive procedure than conventional LH using multiple ports:
      laparoendoscopic single-site (LESS) surgery, also known as single-port access (SPA)
      laparoscopy3. In the LESS approaches, total laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH) and
      laparoscopically-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) are all feasible, with comparable
      conventional LH. However, it is yet to be determined which of two alternative and less
      invasive approaches (LESS-TLH and LESS-LAVH) should be preferred. In particular, none has
      focused on postoperative pain as the primary outcome of the study. The investigators have
      therefore designed the randomized trial to investigate specifically differences in
      postoperative pain after LESS-TLH and LESS-LAVH.
