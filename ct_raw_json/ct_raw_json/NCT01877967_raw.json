Forty participants will be randomly allocated\n      to the food supplement and 40 to placebo. As the sample is initially self-selecting where\n      individuals volunteer to take part, a minimisation procedure will be used to randomise group\n      allocation (Altman & Bland, 2005), with volunteers stratified by gender. Neither the\n      participant nor the research assistant supplying the supplement will know which preparation\n      is administered, thus ensuring double-blind administration.\n\n      Participants will be asked to take the food supplement daily for 12 weeks and the pre- and\n      post- intervention data will be collected immediately before and after this time period.\n\n      Both pre- and post-intervention data will be collected using validated neuropsychological\n      measures, cognitive measures, EEG and self-report questionnaires. Blood sampling will be\n      conducted pre- and post-intervention by a Research Assistant trained in phlebotomy. Analysis\n      will be carried out on each of the measures using a two-way ANCOVA, using the pre-treatment\n      score as covariate."
