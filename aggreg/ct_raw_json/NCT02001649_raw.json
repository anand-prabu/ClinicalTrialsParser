            "textblock": "In France, suicide is the second leading cause of death among the 14-22 years population.\n      Suicide behavior (SB) spans a spectrum ranging from suicidal ideation to suicide attempts\n      and completed suicide. Several factors likely determine the predisposition to SB, including\n      biological factors and psychosocial stressors. For biological factors, convergent evidence\n      from adoption, family, and twin studies of suicide strongly suggests genetic contributions\n      to liability for SB. Although genetic factors play a role in SB, identifying specific genes\n      involved has proved challenging. Molecular-genetic technologies have made great advances in\n      the past decade, including genome- wide searches for disease-causing genes with the linkage\n      disequilibrium (LD) approach. Despite being a major public health problem in the youth\n      population, genetic associations studies regarding suicidal behavior in adolescence are\n      still rare. Genes that code for proteins involved in regulating serotonergic\n      neurotransmission have thus been major candidate genes for association studies of SB. Among\n      them, genes for serotonin metabolism (tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH), serotonin transport\n      (5-HTT), and the serotonergic 2A (5-HT2A) receptor have received the most research\n      attention.\n\n      The identification of relevant genetic variants or SNPs in others genes which are involved\n      in the neurobiological pathways (which the alteration may contribute to a suicidal behavior)\n      can help not only   to advance knowledge of the genetic bases of suicide but also to\n      identify new therapeutic targets.\n\n      On the basis of review of the literature, investigators will identify candidate genes that\n      have been reported to be associated with suicidal events.\n\n      The investigators will target genes related to central serotonergic and noradrenergic\n      neurotransmission, and monoamine metabolism (MAOA). The investigators will also study genes\n      involved in glutamatergic neurotransmission (GRIK2, GRIA3) and in the HPA axis (FKBP5) and\n      genes that code for neurotrophic proteins (BDNF).\n\n      DNA will be obtained from saliva. All genotyping will be carried out using standard\n      polymerase chain reaction-based techniques that are routinely used in the Human Genetics\n      Laboratory. DNA segments containing the target variable site  will be amplified using unique\n      sequence flanking primers.\n\n      Tests of association between genetic variant and suicide attempt will be conducted using Chi\n      squared and Armitage Trend Tests. Logistical regression analyses will be performed to\n      evaluate the contribution of individual genetic variant to the prediction of suicide\n      attempt, and to examine SNPs for potential gene-gene and gene-environment interactions."
