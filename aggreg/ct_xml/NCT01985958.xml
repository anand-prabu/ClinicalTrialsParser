      Primary Objective:  To estimate the rate at which radiotherapy to the primary or a
      metastatic lesion produces an immune response in patients with metastatic carcinoma of the
      pancreas.

      Secondary Objectives: To characterize the kinetics of an immune response induced by
      radiotherapy. To characterize the dependency of the immune response on prior exposure to
      chemotherapy.
