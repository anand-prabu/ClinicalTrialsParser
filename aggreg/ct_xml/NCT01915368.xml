  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a proof-of-concept study to provide preliminary evidence of
      efficacy of physical exercise dose on ambulatory function in adults undergoing sub-acute
      stroke rehabilitation.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants admitted for stroke rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to either the
      Stroke Management Group, Stroke Monitoring Group or Stroke Supplementary Group.  All three
      groups will receive usual care, in addition to the intervention.  The Stroke Management
      Group will be provided with periodic information about their progress in the area of
      mobility using specialized activity monitors.  The Stroke Monitoring Group will be
      progressed according to customized protocols using feedback from specialized activity
      monitors.  The Stroke Supplementary Group will receive the same as the Stroke Monitoring
      Group, but will also receive one additional hour of daily (5 times per week) physical
      exercise
