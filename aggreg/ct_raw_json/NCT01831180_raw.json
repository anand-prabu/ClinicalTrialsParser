The\n      hair state and scalp blood flow in younger and older age groups with typical hair care\n      practices will be qualified by measuring various parameters of the hair shaft and scalp with\n      correlation back to hair and scalp satisfaction as measured in the subject. This is a single\n      center study with an anticipated 4 month enrollment period. The investigators will compare\n      various scalp and hair parameters between young and old Caucasian females by obtaining the\n      following biological and chemical/structural information. Hair growth rate, anagen to\n      telogen ratio, hair density (determined via phototrichogram and digital imaging), Vascular\n      blood flow (Laser Doppler Flowmetry), Histamine stimulation and Hair diameter (clipped\n      hairs). In addition, a detailed questionnaire will be administered to each subject regarding\n      satisfaction of the subject's hair state, including typical hair care regimens and symptoms\n      in scalp and/or hair shafts. This information will be correlated to the biologic and\n      chemical/structural information about hair and scalp health. Approximately 50 healthy,\n      Caucasian female subjects will be enrolled in this study. Twenty five participants will be\n      19-25 years-old and 25 participants 60 years or older. There will be two visits, Baseline\n      and approximately 48 hours after baseline."
