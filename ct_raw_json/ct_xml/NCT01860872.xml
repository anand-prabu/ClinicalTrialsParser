  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to learn more about the heart and blood vessels in the lungs
      of people with cystic fibrosis (CF).  This study will include approximately 36 children and
      adults with CF and 12 children and adults without CF. The study will involve one magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) using an intravenous (IV) contrast dye called gadolinium. The
      research also includes lung tests called spirometry and blood samples to look at
      inflammation.

      For the CF subjects, enrollment will be timed to coincide with routine scheduled
      computerized tomography (CT).  The MRI will be compared to CT images of the lungs. The goal
      is to develop better imaging that does not use radiation.

    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by
      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually
      results in respiratory failure.  There is strong evidence that in CF abnormally low vascular
      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary
      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might
      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Knowledge remains limited
      to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and
      destruction of lung tissue. Recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance
      Imaging (MRI) of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. Studies
      demonstrate that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and
      in surrogate measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early
      in the course of CF. The newly developed therapeutics in the last decade which altered
      dramatically the course of patients suffering from pulmonary vascular disease provide
      opportunities to understand the role of pulmonary vasculature in CF lung disease.

      This pilot study (Pilot 3) will assess the relationships between pulmonary perfusion, serum
      markers of pulmonary inflammation and vascular remodeling, and hemodynamic measures
      consistent with pulmonary hypertension. This study will establish MRI as a readily
      obtainable modality to be used in the CF population to obtain measurements of pulmonary
      perfusion; pulmonary arterial hemodynamic, dimension, and flow measures; and ventricular
      mass and function measures.

      The primary goal of this study is to improve the understanding of pulmonary vascular disease
      in CF by examining pulmonary perfusion abnormalities and their association with markers of
      pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling, the severity of obstructive
      airways disease, and pulmonary hemodynamic abnormalities in CF.

      This study will include a single MRI of the pulmonary circulation on about 36 pediatric and
      adult patients with CF and about 12 non-CF controls. MRI will be performed with gadolinium
      contrast. CF patients who are scheduled for clinical chest CT will be enrolled and the
      scheduling of the MRI will be coordinated with the clinical CT. Other study procedures
      include pulmonary function tests (PFT) and blood specimen for serum biomarkers.  Specimens
      will be analyzed for a panel of inflammatory markers.
