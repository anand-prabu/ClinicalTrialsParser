These youngsters were originally participating in a\n      nationwide study of children with type 1 diabetes in Denmark back in 1986. The investigators\n      will try to establish risk factors for developing diabetic retinopathy. The investigators\n      will have emphasis on retinal vessel geometry and the possibilities for early detection of\n      reversible retinal changes, and prediction of other vascular complications."
