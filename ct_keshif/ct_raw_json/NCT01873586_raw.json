Require spinal fusion using TLIF, PLF or PLIF, with or without the use of an\n             interbody spacer, at 1 to 3 levels between L3-S1.\n\n          3. Are willing and able to return for the scheduled follow-up visits, follow\n             post-operative instructions and undergo the required radiographic exams (A/P, Lateral\n             Neutral and Lateral Flexion/Extension X-rays) for up to 4 time points between 3 weeks\n             and 12 months post-surgery (3 months \u00b1 2 weeks, 6\u00b11 months, 12\u00b12 months and if\n             required 24\u00b13 months post-surgery), including one CT-scan at 12\u00b12 months.\n\n          4. Are unresponsive to conservative care over a period of at least 6 months or have\n             signs and/or symptoms that mandate urgent surgical intervention.\n\n          5. Are willing and able to sign study specific informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Are long term users of medications (i.e. steroids greater than 8 days) that are known\n             to inhibit fusion or bone metabolism at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.\n             Exceptions are inhaled steroids for asthma treatment (i.e. patients on inhaled\n             steroids are allowed), or epidural steroid injections.\n\n          2. Are taking immunosuppressive agents (Cancer chemotherapy, treatment with Disease\n             Modifying Anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or any similar immunomodulating drugs) or are\n             treated with Growth Factors or Insulin at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.\n\n          3. Are being treated with radiotherapy.\n\n          4. Are having medical conditions, known to impact bone metabolism, such as Paget's\n             disease, or has established osteoporosis (i.e. has had one or more fragility\n             fractures).\n\n          5. Are pregnant, lactating or women wishing to become pregnant.\n\n          6. Are a prisoner.\n\n          7. BMI \u2265 40\n\n          8. Are smokers and/or nicotine/tobacco users\n\n          9. Are currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that\n             has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study\n             endpoints.\n\n         10. Had prior spine surgery at the index level except posterior decompressive surgery\n             where the posterior elements are preserved e.g. facet saving techniques such as\n             discectomy, laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures.\n\n         11. Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months post-operatively, but low dose\n             concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the\n             Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF)."
