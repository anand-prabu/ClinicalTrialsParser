Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells. Interleukin-2 may stimulate a person's white blood cells to kill leukemia\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation and interleukin-2 in treating patients who have acute\n      leukemia."

For patients unable\n      to receive cyclophosphamide and etoposide, melphalan IV is administered instead on days -3\n      and -2. Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are reinfused on day 0.\n\n      Patients then receive G-CSF daily beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts\n      recover followed by interleukin-2 subcutaneously daily beginning at the completion of G-CSF\n      therapy and continuing for 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 1 month and then monthly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 3-5\n      years."
