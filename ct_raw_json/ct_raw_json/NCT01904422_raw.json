The second\n      form of treatment corresponds to an intensive periodontal treatment, whole mouth in 24\n      hours.\n\n      All patients will be given an initial periodontal examination with manual north carolina\n      periodontal probe, performed by a single operator previously calibrated.\n\n      Periodontal status will be  determine according to the classification of Page and Eke (2007)\n      and periodontal wound size (PISA) will be also determine. Also, will be measured\n      inflammatory mediators and cytokines in both plasma and gingival crevicular fluid (GCF) by\n      ELISA test.
