            "textblock": "Although poor antiretroviral (ART) adherence in HIV does not mean a complete lack of\n      therapeutic results, the benefit of ART increases as adherence improves. Consequences of\n      suboptimal ART adherence are viral rebound, development of drug-resistant HIV strains, and\n      more rapid progression to AIDS. Moreover, HIV-infected persons tend to have numerous\n      co-occurring conditions and therefore take many medications making adherence to multiple\n      drug regimens more difficult. A mobile application capable of improving medication adherence\n      among HIV-infected persons would be highly useful.\n\n      The investigators propose an intervention study designed to address these potential\n      mechanisms of nonadherence by utilizing the Care4Today v2.0 smartphone application (app).\n      The current study is a small pilot Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) comparing the smart\n      phone application titled \"Care4Today v2.0\" versus standard of care to improve medication\n      adherence to ART over a 4-week period with 60 HIV+ participants.\n\n      The pilot RCT consists of 60 HIV+ persons who are at risk for ART medication nonadherence.\n      Using random assignment, 30 HIV+ participants will be assigned to medication adherence\n      improvement via \"Care4Today\" app as compared to 30 HIV+ participants assigned standard of\n      care.\n\n      The investigators will assess the effectiveness and acceptability of the app in improving\n      objectively measured ART adherence (i.e., via medication event monitoring system caps) over\n      a 4-week period via a pilot RCT with 30 HIV+ persons assigned to the Care4Today intervention\n      and 30 HIV+ persons assigned to standard of care."
