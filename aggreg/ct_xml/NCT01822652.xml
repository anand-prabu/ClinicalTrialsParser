  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma are invited to take part in this
      gene transfer research study.

      We have found from previous research that we can put a new gene called a chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) into T cells that will make them recognize neuroblastoma cells and kill them.
      In a previous clinical trial, we used a CAR that recognizes GD2, a protein found on almost
      all neuroblastoma cells (GD2-CAR). We put this gene into T cells and gave them back to
      patients that had neuroblastoma. The infusions were safe and in patients with disease at the
      time of their infusion, the time to progression was longer if we could find GD2 T cells in
      their blood for more than 6 weeks. Because of this, we think that if T cells are able to
      last longer, they may have a better chance of killing neuroblastoma tumor cells.

      Therefore, in this study we will add new genes to the GD2 T cells that can cause the cells
      to live longer. These new genes are called CD28 and OX40. The purpose of this study will be
      to determine the highest dose of iC9-GD2-CD28-OX40 (iC9-GD2) T cells that can safely be
      given to patients with relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will make iC9-GD2 T cells by infecting normal T cells with a retroviral vector containing
      the iC9-GD2 gene. After the new gene has been put into the T cells, the cells will be tested
      to make sure that they kill GD2-positive neuroblastoma cells and then frozen until the
      patient is ready for their infusion.

      The infusion will be given by the Center for Cell and Gene Therapy at Texas Children's
      Hospital or Houston Methodist Hospital. The injection will take between 5 and 10 minutes.

      There will be follow-up visits every 1-2 weeks during the first 2 months and then they will
      be spaced out over a total of 15 years. Because the cells are modified with a new gene we
      must follow patients for at least 15 years to see if there are any long term side effects of
      gene transfer. During the visits, we will see how the patients are doing and during certain
      time points we will obtain extra blood samples to learn more about the way the iC9-GD2 T
      cells are working and how long they last in the body.

    <description>Subjects will receive the iC9-GD2 T cells through an IV over 5 to 10 minutes. Subjects will receive one of the following dose levels (cells/m2):
Dose Level 1 = 1 x 10^7
Dose Level 2 = 1 x 10^8
Dose Level 3 = 2 x 10^8
Six weeks after the infusion, patients will have a disease re-evaluation. If the disease has not gotten worse AND they have not had a severe side effect caused by the infusion of the iC9-GD2 T cells, the subject may be eligible to receive up to 2 additional doses of T cells. Each dose will be at the same dose level as the first infusion, if available, and separated by at least 6 weeks.</description>
