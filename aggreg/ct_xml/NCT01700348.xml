  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the current study, Sonicare AirFloss (AF) will be used in combination with a Manual
      Toothbrush (MTB) in a population of manual toothbrush users who are irregular flossers and
      who exhibit signs of moderate gingivitis.  The alternate test arm will be allocated to a No
      Intervention group and will be given no test products or instruction other than to change
      none of their typical at home oral hygiene habits.

      The aim of this study is to investigate how an AF and MTB oral hygiene intervention will
      affect a population of irregular flossers using the residual protein concentration method as
      an interproximal plaque efficacy assessment.  Gingivitis reduction will be assessed using
      the Modified Gingival Index (MGI) and Gingival Bleeding Index (GBI) indices
