As recommended by the\n      producer, the TEGO\u00ae remains during 3 consecutive HD sessions and is changed every week.  By\n      constituting a mechanical barrier, it could be an interesting alternative to reduce the\n      intraluminal contamination and the risk of TCC-B.\n\n      The TEGO\u00ae connector is supposed to provide an automatic positive displacement of fluid at\n      the end of each TCC flush. This positive pressure could prevent the reflux of blood into the\n      TCC lumen, possibly resulting in TCC-D.\n\n      As the impact of the TEGO\u00ae connector on TCC-D and TCC-B has never been studied, we conducted\n      a randomized controlled study in our center by comparing the anti-thrombotic and\n      anti-infectious efficacy of the TEGO\u00ae connector to trisodium citrate 46.7% (Citralock\u00ae,\n      Dirinco, www.citra-lock.com) . The global cost of both procedures was also evaluated."
