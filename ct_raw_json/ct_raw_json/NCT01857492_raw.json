However the current will be applied for 30 seconds in the beginning of the procedure and after that the current is turned off. This parameter for sham stimulation was chosen based on previous studies that have shown that perceived sensations on the scalp such as tingling usually fade out in the first 30 seconds of tDCS.  It should be noted that less than 3 minutes of tDCS induces no effects on cortical excitability [29] and also using 30 seconds of sham is a reliable method of blinding as shown by a randomized controlled study [30].  Subjects will also meditate while receiving stimulation"

(Model 1224-B New York, NY, USA) or an equivalent device will be used to deliver direct current through 35cm\u00b2 saline-soaked electrodes. The anodal electrode will be placed over the left primary motor cortex (M1) while the cathodal electrode will be placed over the contralateral supra-orbital area. Primary motor cortex will be localized using the 10/20 EEG system (C3 or C4) and this is a reliable method for the technique of tDCS [5]. During active tDCS, a 2mA constant current will be delivered for 20 minutes while the subject meditates. The primary motor cortex is a reliable \"entry port\" to modulate dysfunctional activity in pain-related neural networks."
