Knee OA is\n      one of the most important diseases within musculoskeletal conditions affecting a\n      considerable amount of people worldwide. The randomized controlled trial will involve one\n      intervention group delivered strength exercises compared to another intervention group\n      delivered aerobic exercise (ergometer cycling). The two intervention groups will be compared\n      to a control group undergoing usual care. Cost-effectiveness analysis will be performed\n      comparing the three groups. The study is funded from The Research Council of Norway."
