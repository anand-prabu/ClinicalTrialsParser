            "textblock": "It has been reported that 5-10% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention\n      (PCI) have concomitant AF. Most of those patients have an indication for oral\n      anticoagulation (OAC) to prevent stroke or systemic thromboembolism, and also for\n      antiplatelet therapy (APT) to prevent ischemic cardiac events, particularly stent thrombosis\n      (ST). However, combined use of OAC and ATP is associated with increased risk of major\n      bleeding. Thus, we need to balance the risk for stroke or systemic thromboembolic events and\n      coronary events against the risk for bleeding.\n\n      The AF guideline of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published in 2010 recommended OAC\n      alone with vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) as life-long antithrombotic therapy after 12 months of\n      combined use of OAC plus APT in AF patients undergoing coronary stenting. However, no\n      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and few observational data support this recommendation.\n      Aspirin monotherapy is the commonly used APT regimen in non-AF patients beyond 1 year after\n      coronary stenting. No APT coverage after coronary stenting was reported to be associated\n      with increased risk for ST. It is currently unknown whether OAC is equally effective as\n      aspirin in preventing very late ST beyond 1 year after stenting, although  several RCTs have\n      shown that VKA was at least as effective as aspirin for the secondary prevention of ischemic\n      cardiac events in patients mostly without coronary stent.\n\n      Therefore, we planned a prospective randomized controlled open label trial comparing\n      warfarin alone versus warfarin plus aspirin in AF patients beyond 1 year after coronary\n      stenting.\n\n      The patient enrollment period is 1-year and follow-up duration is at least 1-year.\n      Therefore, the anticipated mean follow-up duration is 1.5-year."
