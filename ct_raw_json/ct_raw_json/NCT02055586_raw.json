To assess the test-retest reproducibility of PET biomarker (FLT) uptake using PET/MRI.\n\n      III. To assess the test-retest reproducibility of quantification of MR sequences\n      (multi-parametric MRI particularly related to tissue perfusion).\n\n      IV. To assess the ability of PET/MRI to measure changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake\n      after initiation of therapy.\n\n      V. To assess changes in qualitative morphologic imaging and quantitative functional MRI\n      parameters after initiation of therapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To compare early changes in PET biomarker (FLT) tumor uptake with treatment response\n      assessed at completion of therapy (prediction of treatment response).\n\n      II. To compare changes in MRI signal intensities (multi-parametric MRI) with treatment\n      response assessed at completion of therapy.\n\n      III. To compare results from multi-parametric MR imaging with FLT tumor uptake. IV.
