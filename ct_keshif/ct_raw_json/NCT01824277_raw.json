Despite these\n      recommendations, approximately 25% of patients undergoing cardiac surgery have evidence of\n      suboptimal glycemic control (A1C>7%). Recent research has demonstrated that such patients\n      experience a higher rate of post-operative complications and significantly worse short-term\n      and long-term post-operative survival. Therefore, it is recommended that attempts should be\n      made to improve glycemic control while patients wait for their elective surgery. However, at\n      present processes of care that facilitate pre-operative glycemic control optimization do not\n      exist in Canada.\n\n      The objective of this project is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of a\n      comprehensive community-based pre-operative diabetes optimization program for patients\n      awaiting elective cardiac surgery."
