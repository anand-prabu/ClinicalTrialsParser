A newly developed gel formulation\n      (Xamiol\u00ae gel) of calcipotriol and betamethasone dipropionate has recently been approved and\n      marketed in Korea as a topical treatment of moderate to severe scalp psoriasis and non-scalp\n      psoriasis vulgaris.\n\n      Xamiol\u00ae gel, the investigational product (IP) used in this study, prevents keratinization by\n      normalizing the reproduction cycle of skin cells. It also relieves itching associated with\n      psoriasis. Xamiol\u00ae gel was initially approved for treatment of moderate to severe scalp\n      psoriasis and its label was extended to non-scalp psoriasis vulgaris in October 2012.\n\n      Since patient compliance is one of the important factors in achieving effective outcomes in\n      the treatment of psoriasis, the once daily dosing of Xamiol\u00ae gel is expected to enhance\n      compliance and treatment outcomes as well as to provide a safe and effective therapeutic\n      option."

            "textblock": "Psoriasis is a disease difficult to cure and is usually recurrent and therefore, a continued\n      management is crucial. An evidence-based approach is important for appropriate treatments of\n      patient with psoriasis. However, there is a lack of response data for the topical treatments\n      in Asian patients with psoriasis, and no treatment guidelines available. Therefore, routine\n      topical treatments, instead of patient-specific treatments, are usually applied, which may\n      result in treatment failure. In this regard, it is imperative to conduct a study to assess\n      topical treatments in Korean patients with psoriasis vulgaris in terms of efficacy and side\n      effects.\n\n      Furthermore, psoriasis patients in Korea, mostly small plaque types, may exhibit different\n      disease activities and response outcomes and accordingly require different treatment options\n      as compared to Western populations whose dominant psoriasis type is large plaque type. Thus,\n      a study in Korean patients with psoriasis may reveal an interesting finding.\n\n      In order to investigate optimal maintenance regimens for the topical treatment of Korean\n      patients with psoriasis vulgaris, we are planning this study which evaluates the efficacy of\n      three 8-week maintenance regimens containing Xamiol\u00ae gel (PRN treatment group, Continuous\n      treatment group and Twice weekly treatment group) in patients who have become \"Responder\"\n      after 8-week induction therapy with Xamiol\u00ae gel (\"Responder\").\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the percentages of \"Responder\"* at week\n      16, as assessed by Investigator's Global Assessment of Disease Severity (IGA), in three\n      different 8-week maintenance regimens of Xamiol\u00ae gel after 8-week induction treatment with\n      Xamiol\u00ae gel in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.\n\n      * Responder is defined as subjects with \"clear\" or \"almost clear\" according to IGA.\n\n      Secondary study objectives is to evaluate efficacy, % of Relapse and time to Relapse, PGA,\n      Patient Compliance, Safety and Quality of Life (DLQI and TSQM) in three arms with\n      calcipotriol/betamethasone dipropionate combination gel treatment in Korean patients with\n      chronic plaque psoriasis of the body."
