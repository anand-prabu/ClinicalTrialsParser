They run a high risk of developing burnout that can\n      impact on their welfare, performance, and patient care. Burnout favours absenteeism and\n      staff quitting their jobs, whereas the shortage of ICU caregivers already started. No\n      randomised controlled intervention aimed at reducing such distresses had been run until now.\n\n      This study allowed finding a new method of psychological support applicable in the special\n      environment of ICU. Our findings suggest that psychologists specifically assigned to treat\n      ICU caregivers might be beneficial on their burnout."

This tool measures the 3 dimensions of burnout independently: emotional exhaustion, depersonalisation, and personal accomplishment. Scores of \u2265 27, \u2265 10, or \u226433 respectively for the 3 dimensions, can be a sign of burnout. A severe burnout can also be defined as the cumulated score of MBI of > -9.",
