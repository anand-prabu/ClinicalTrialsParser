After 1mo, the entire procedure is\n      to be repeated with one of the alternate exposures. This will be repeated 4 times (4\n      exposures; 2 filtered air, 1 diesel exhaust, 1 particle-depleted diesel exhaust)"

            "textblock": "1. Purpose/Objective:\n\n           The aim of this study is to investigate the ability of depletion of diesel exhaust\n           particles to attenuate adverse effects of diesel exhaust on lung function and on\n           allergic responses.\n\n        2. Hypotheses:\n\n           Hypothesis 1: Allergen-specific immune response (specific IgG4, etc; relevant responses\n           in DNA methylation and proteomics) in allergen-challenged airways in sensitized\n           individuals is increased by diesel exhaust.\n\n           Hypothesis 2:  Synergistic responses to will be greater in asthmatics than in\n           non-asthmatics.\n\n           Hypotheses 3: Synergy between inhaled DE and common aeroallergens is attributable to\n           the particulate fraction of DE (i.e. is normalized by particle depletion).\n\n        3. Justification:\n\n           Diesel exhaust consists of both gaseous and particulate air pollutants. In recent\n           studies, cardiovascular effects seem attenuated when only the particulate portion is\n           removed. We would like to know if that is true for respiratory and immunological\n           endpoints. Understanding these potentially subtle changes will help us prevent health\n           problems associated with air pollution in the future.\n\n        4. Research Method:\n\n      Blinded crossover experiment between four conditions (DE and allergen, PDDE and allergen, FA\n      and allergen, FA and saline), randomized and counter-balanced to order. Each condition will\n      be separated by a 4-week washout period.\n\n      An inhaled allergen or saline challenge is delivered after each exposure (DE, PDDE, or FA).\n      24 h post challenge, airway reactivity will be assessed with a methacholine challenge. 48 h\n      post challenge, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), airway brushes and tissue biopsies will be\n      obtained for analysis of immune activation. Nasal lavage samples will also be collected to\n      examine responses in the upper airways and blood and urine will be studied to examine\n      systemic responses. Spirometry and methacholine challenge will be used to assess effects on\n      airway function."
