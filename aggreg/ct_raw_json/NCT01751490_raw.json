The results of this study\n      will have direct and immediate impact on clinical decision making by establishing\n      definitively if patients presenting with joint damage associated with atraumatic shoulder\n      instability should be referred for surgery before commencing physiotherapy rehabilitation.\n      The results of this study may also result in significant cost savings to the National Health\n      Service if surgical intervention for atraumatic shoulder instability does not result in\n      greater improvement than physiotherapy alone."
