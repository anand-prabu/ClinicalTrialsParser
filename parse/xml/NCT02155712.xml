    <textblock>
      The success rate of the Triathlon Tritanium Knee, defined as absence of revision for aseptic
      loosening of the tibial baseplate at 2 years, is no worse than rates reported in the
      literature for cemented devices.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)/Ethics Committee (EC)
             approved; study specific Informed Patient Consent Form.

          2. Patient is a male or non-pregnant female age 18-75 years at time of study device
             implantation.

          3. Patient has a diagnosis of Non-Inflammatory Degenerative Joint Disease (NIDJD).

          4. Patient is a candidate for primary cementless total knee replacement, including a
             resurfaced patella.

          5. Patient is willing and able to comply with postoperative scheduled clinical and
             radiographic evaluations and rehabilitation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt; 40.

          2. Patient has a diagnosis of avascular necrosis or inflammatory arthritis.

          3. Patient has an active or suspected latent infection in or about the affected knee
             joint at time of study device implantation.

          4. Patient has a neuromuscular or neurosensory deficiency, which limits the ability to
             evaluate the safety and efficacy of the device.

          5. Subject is diagnosed with a systemic disease (e.g. Lupus Erythematosus) or a
             metabolic disorder (e.g. Paget's Disease) leading to progressive bone deterioration.

          6. Patient is immunologically suppressed or receiving steroids in excess of normal
             physiological requirements (e.g. &gt; 30 days).

          7. Patient is diagnosed with lumbar radicular pain.

          8. Patient has a known sensitivity to device materials.

          9. Patient is a prisoner.
