  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy of ASP4901 with placebo in patients
      with benign prostatic hyperplasia.  The safety and tolerability of ASP4901 will also be
      evaluated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, randomized, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, active-referenced,
      double-blind study. After obtaining the written consent, patients meeting the eligibility
      criteria at the preliminary enrollment will receive oral administration of placebo in a
      single-blinded manner (single-blind placebo run-in period). Then, patients meeting the
      eligibility criteria at the main enrollment will receive drug or placebo (double-blind
      treatment period) for 4 weeks. Furthermore, patients will be followed up for 1 week to
      confirm the safety of the study drugs after the treatment period (safety follow-up period).
