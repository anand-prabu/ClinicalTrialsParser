Methods to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently\n      needed among MSM in Peru. The information gained from this study is very important for\n      future HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will take place in Peru."

Bisexual HIV-infected MSM could be an important \"bridge\" transmitting\n      HIV and other STDs to women. Interventions to reduce both HIV and STDs are urgently needed\n      among MSM in Peru. Given these associations and the high prevalence of STDs among MSM in\n      Lima, prevention of HIV infections is dependent partially on innovative methods to control\n      bacterial and viral STDs among high-risk HIV-uninfected MSM. The data from this prevention\n      preparedness study is critical for future HIV prevention and vaccine trials that will be\n      conducted in Peru.\n\n      All MSM are counseled and tested for HIV, HSV-2, and syphilis at the screening visit. [AS\n      PER AMENDMENT 07/23/02: The syphilis test results are provided at screening, whereas the HIV\n      and HSV-2 test results are provided at the enrollment visit.] High-risk HIV-uninfected MSM\n      in Lima, Peru, are enrolled. Men are interviewed about risk behaviors in the past 6 months.\n      Trained counselors provide risk-reduction counseling according to locally accepted\n      standards. Men are followed at 3-month intervals for 1 year to determine the incidence of\n      and risk factors for prevalent and incident HIV and HSV-2, and to evaluate the effectiveness\n      of retention strategies. In the baseline questionnaire, 2 additional modules address sexual\n      networks and willingness to participate in HIV vaccine or prevention trials, including an\n      acyclovir trial. Study data are collected and entered into a local database."
