Silymarin (Milk thistle) is a commonly used dietary supplement in\n      HIV-infected patients for treatment of hepatitis or as a hepato-protectant.  Data are\n      available suggesting that it may alter cytochrome P4503A4-mediated drug metabolism.  To\n      evaluate the effect of milk thistle on the protease inhibitor, indinavir (IDV), ten healthy\n      subjects will receive IDV (Crixivan) alone and in combination with an over-the-counter\n      silymarin preparation.  IDV will initially be administered alone at a dose of 800 mg Q8H for\n      four doses and serial samples will be collected for determination of IDV pharmacokinetics\n      after the morning dose on day 2.  Subjects will then initiate therapy will milk thistle\n      using a standardized formulation and dose for three weeks after which subjects will then\n      again take 4 doses of IDV and have serial  samples collected for IDV plasma concentrations.\n      There will then be a 11-day washout period with no drugs, after which IDV will again be\n      given for 4 doses and samples will be collected evaluate the offset of the effects of milk\n      thistle.  To examine the effect of milk thistle on other CYP450 pathways, subjects will\n      receive a single dose of caffeine and dextromethorphan  and have urine collected before and\n      after milk thistle, and after the washout period.  Indinavir, caffeine, and dextromethorphan\n      concentrations in plasma or urine will be determined using validated HPLC methods.\n      Steady-state noncompartmental parameters of indinavir in the presence and absence of milk\n      thistle will be determined.  Pharmacokinetic parameters will be compared using ANOVA that\n      will include factors for a period effect and a treatment effect.  Statistical analyses will\n      include calculation of the mean ratio of the AUC in the treatment phases compared to IDV\n      alone and determination of 95% confidence intervals.  This study will help define the drug\n      interaction potential of complementary and alternative therapies in HIV-infected patients."
