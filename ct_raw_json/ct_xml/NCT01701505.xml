      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasally administered
      Kovacaine Mist for anesthetizing maxillary teeth in pediatric subjects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, randomized, parallel-groups, dose-ranging study to
      assess the efficacy and safety of intranasally administered Kovacaine Mist for anesthetizing
      maxillary teeth in pediatric subjects.

      The study will employ an open-label design to determine the lowest effective doses (LEDs),
      and assess the safety and efficacy of Kovacaine Mist administered intranasally for inducing
      pulpal anesthesia of maxillary primary teeth numbers A to J and maxillary permanent teeth
      numbers 4 to 13 (maxillary right second premolar to maxillary left second premolar)
      sufficient to allow completion of the Study Dental Procedure, and will be carried out in
      healthy children of either sex between the ages of 3 and 17 years, inclusive.
