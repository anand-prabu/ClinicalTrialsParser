            "textblock": "One in five deaths in the U.S. occurs in or shortly after discharge from an intensive care\n      unit (ICU), typically following decisions made by surrogate decision makers to forego life\n      prolonging treatment. A large body of empirical research has identified deficiencies in care\n      processes that contribute to three important problems: 1) family members often struggle in\n      the role of surrogate, 2)leading to lasting psychological distress associated with the ICU\n      experience  patients near the end of life frequently receive invasive, expensive treatment\n      that is inconsistent with their values and preferences, and 3) end-of-life care is a major\n      contributor to health care costs.[8, 9] Although advance care planning can prevent some\n      unwanted treatment, many patients wish for a trial of intensive treatment when the prognosis\n      is uncertain, and therefore it seems likely that the need for interventions to improve\n      \"in-the-moment\" decisions by surrogates will persist.[10, 11]\n\n      The long term goal of the investigators research program is to develop, test, and\n      disseminate strategies to improve surrogate decision making for incapacitated patients and\n      to mitigate adverse psychological outcomes among surrogates. In a pilot project, the\n      investigators developed the PARTNER intervention (PAiring Re-engineered ICU Teams with\n      Nurse-driven Emotional Support  and Relationship-building), an interdisciplinary\n      intervention that 1) gives new responsibilities and advanced communication skills training\n      to existing ICU staff  (local nurse leaders and social work members of the ICU team); 2)\n      changes care \"defaults\" to ensure frequent clinician-family meetings; 3) adds protocolized,\n      nurse-administered coaching and emotional support of surrogates before and during\n      clinician-family meetings, and 4) increases use of palliative care services for patients\n      with a poor prognosis. The investigators 2-year pilot study documented that the intervention\n      is feasible, sustainable, and is associated with shorter ICU length of stay and cost\n      savings. The objective of this proposal, which is the next step in pursuit of the long term\n      goal, is to conduct a stepped wedge randomized controlled trial testing the PARTNER\n      intervention in 5 ICUs among 1000 patients with advanced critical illness and their\n      surrogates."
