  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of single and multiple
      doses of volitinib administered to patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors
      and determine MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose) or RPTD(recommended Phase 2 dose).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint is evaluation of safety and tolerability during all the study of
      therapy following the initiation of multiple dosing of HMPL-504. The safety and tolerability
      variables to be evaluated in this study are adverse events, physical examinations, vital
      signs (specifically including blood pressure), clinical laboratory evaluations including
      serum chemistry, hematology (Maximum Tolerated Dose), and urinalysis (with detailed sediment
      analysis, proteinuria, and 24-hour urine for collection for protein), and electrocardiograms
      (ECGs) in triplicate, Incidence and nature of DLTs (Dose-Limiting Toxicity), to determine
      the MTD (Maximum Tolerated Dose).

    <description>In the study of single-dose, full Pharmacokinetics(PK) profiles of HMPL-504 will be obtained following administration of a single oral dose of HMPL-504 on Day 1 to Day 3. At multiple-dose, Pharmacokinetics(PK) sampling will include a pre-dose and at the 0.5,2,4,6,8 hour time points on days 1,15,21of dosing in the first 21-Day cycle of therapy, and pre-dose on days 2,8,16,and 22 of the first 21-Day cycle of therapy</description>
