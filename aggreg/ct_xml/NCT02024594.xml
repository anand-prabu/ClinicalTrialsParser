  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Visiting anxious and fearful children is an inevitable prospect of the daily work of every
      dentist who treats pediatric patients.  Dentists have been using a wide variety of
      non-pharmacological and some pharmacologic techniques to assist them in the management of
      children with anxiety. One strategy which seems promising for pain control in stressful
      medical situations is teaching the child to use behavioral and cognitive coping skills or a
      combination of both techniques. An alternative technique to non-pharmacologic approaches in
      children being anxious and lacking in cooperative ability is sedative technique such as
      nitrous oxide conscious sedation. As there is lack of studies comparing conscious sedation
      and combinations of cognitive-behavioral strategies in eliminating children's uncooperative
      behaviors and dental anxiety, the aim of this study was to compare the effectiveness of
      inhalation sedation with Nitrous Oxide-Oxygen conscious sedation and cognitive-behavioral
      therapy to reduce dental anxiety in preschool children.
