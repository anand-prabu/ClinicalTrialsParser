All participants will receive study medications in two\n      sessions in a fixed, sequential order as a session 1 (a single dose of metformin on Day 1)\n      followed by washout period (period when no treatment is received) of 4 days and then session\n      2 (rilpivirine on Day 5 to Day 17 with a single dose of metformin on Day 15). The duration\n      of the study is approximately 54 days. Safety evaluations including adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical examination (including skin\n      examination) will be monitored throughout the study."
