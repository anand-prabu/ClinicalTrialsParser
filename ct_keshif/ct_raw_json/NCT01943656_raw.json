            "textblock": "As technologies are advancing quickly in the healthcare setting, new solutions have become\n      available helping disable people to enhance their ability to communicate. One of these\n      advances is the introduction of the 'eye gaze system'. Through processing eye movements,\n      this device allows a person to write, speak, use the Internet and even control systems in\n      the home or office. In the currently proposed study we aim to evaluate the psychological and\n      functional effects of using the Tobii\u2122 Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia who are\n      unable to use arms and legs and sometimes are not able to talk because of an impaired\n      respiratory function.\n\n      Volunteering inpatients will be recruited at the National Spinal Injuries Centre. Volunteers\n      will be instructed and trained to use the Tobii\u2122 Eyegaze System. The number of sessions\n      required to successfully master the device depends on the learning curve of the patient. The\n      progress will be documented accordingly. After successful completion of the training and\n      supervised use, the inpatients will be offered the Tobii\u2122 Eyegaze System for unsupervised\n      use, 4 hours a week, for the following 2 months. It is hypothesised that using the Tobii\u2122\n      Eyegaze System by inpatients with tetraplegia results in improved disability perception and\n      independence scores. For the current feasibility study 12 participants will be recruited and\n      assessed for 'Appraisal of Disability', 'Mood', 'Assistive Technology perception' and\n      'eyeskills' to instruct the computer system. Positive study outcomes will encourage future\n      studies of the role of the Tobii\u2122 Eyegaze System in both a rehabilitation and home\n      environment."
