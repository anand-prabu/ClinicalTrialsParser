            "textblock": "It is estimated that 33 million individuals are currently infected with HIV. HIV/AIDS is a\n      disease that impairs immune function, primarily by decreasing CD4+ T lymphocytes. The\n      progression can be contained by daily dosing with antiretroviral therapy (ART) but there are\n      side effects that can be treatment limiting, and the development of HIV drug resistance can\n      force the physician to modify the ART regimen. There are no effective vaccines currently\n      available for HIV.\n\n      LVsh5/C46 (also known as Cal-1) is a dual therapeutic, self-inactivating lentiviral vector\n      that encodes for both a short hairpin RNA against the HIV-1 co-receptor CCR5 (sh5) and a\n      HIV-1 fusion inhibitor, C46 and inhibits two processes required for HIV-1 infection:\n\n        1. Binding of the virus to the cellular CCR5 co-receptor and\n\n        2. Fusion of the virus with the host cell\n\n      The rationale is that Cal-1 introduced into hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HSPC) and\n      mature CD4+ T lymphocytes will protect these cells and their progeny cells from HIV-1\n      infection and its pathogenic sequelae. This may provide a continuous means of controlling\n      HIV-1 after a single or infrequent dose(s), thereby decreasing or delaying (partially or\n      completely) the need for antiretroviral drug therapy."
