Some of these\n      products include artificial tears, omega-3 supplements, and/or anti-inflammatory\n      medications. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the performance of a combination of\n      TheraTears\u00ae products, and to compare them with the product(s) you have been using."

Has read and signed an information consent letter;\n\n          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;\n\n          4. Exhibits symptoms of dry eye for at least 3 months;\n\n          5. Has an OSDI score of \u2265 23;\n\n          6. Is currently on a non-omega 3 dry eye treatment regimen that, at the minimum consists\n             of instilling artificial tears at least once a day for the past 3 months;\n\n          7. Has an average non-invasive tear breakup time \u2264 5.00 seconds in at least one eye.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Is participating in any concurrent clinical or research study;\n\n          2. Has any known active* ocular disease and/or infection and/or allergies;\n\n             * For the purposes of study, active ocular disease is defined as infection or\n             inflammation which requires therapeutic treatment. Lid abnormalities (blepharitis,\n             meibomian gland dysfunction, papillae), corneal and conjunctival staining and dry eye\n             are typical findings and are not considered active ocular disease. Neovascularization\n             and corneal scars are the result of previous hypoxia, infection or inflammation and\n             are therefore not active.\n\n          3. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect a study\n             outcome variable;\n\n          4. Is using any systemic or topical medications that in the opinion of the investigator\n             may affect a study outcome variable;\n\n          5. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;\n\n          6. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrollment, as\n             determined verbally;\n\n          7. Is aphakic;\n\n          8. Has undergone refractive error surgery;\n\n          9. Has taken part in another (pharmaceutical) research study within the last 30 days;\n\n         10. Has worn contact lenses within the past 5 years;\n\n         11. Is currently using or have used omega 3 supplements in the past 3 months."
