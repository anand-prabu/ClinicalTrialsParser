  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators plan to learn more about how different levels of exercise feel to people
      with Type 2 Diabetes and how it feels to people without Type 2 Diabetes. This study team
      will also look at what causes exercise to feel harder or easier to people with and without
      Type 2 Diabetes. The investigators will also compare the potential benefits of supervised
      exercise training to that of diabetes education/blood sugar monitoring.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is a potent therapy to reduce cardiovascular mortality in Type 2 Diabetes (T2D).
      Although exercise is a cornerstone of treatment for T2D, people with T2D are more sedentary
      than similarly obese people without diabetes, for reasons that are unclear.  Interventions
      which combined behavioral support and physical activity prescriptions successfully increased
      physical activity levels for people with T2D and at-risk for T2D. However, the program
      components which mediated increased physical activity were combined and thus the individual
      benefits of each component remain unknown.  Given the success of these combined programs, it
      appears behavioral support and other psychological factors may play an important role. The
      study investigators are interested in the predictors of physical activity adherence in T2D
      as key targets for future interventions.

      One likely factor which may influence physical activity adherence is perceived exercise
      effort. The study investigators reported, based on a small study, that perceived exercise
      effort is worse in people with T2D than in healthy obese controls, as measured by the Borg
      Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE), even during low intensity exercise.  Thus, one strategy
      to increase physical activity in T2D is to first identify the mediators of RPE in the
      proposed study and then to address them in future studies.  The preliminary data suggest
      that likely mediators of RPE are both objective and subjective in nature.  A key objective
      mediator of RPE is serum lactate level during exercise, which is a physiological marker of
      effort, and is disproportionately elevated in people with T2D vs. healthy controls.  A key
      subjective mediator of RPE is self-efficacy, which influences the perception of exercise
      effort, and is disproportionately worse in people with T2D vs. healthy controls.  To develop
      optimal physical activity interventions for people with T2D, the study investigators must
      understand whether RPE differences vary across the spectrum of exercise intensities (Aim 1),
      and the investigators must also determine the mediators of RPE across exercise intensities
      (Aim 2).  Mediators of RPE in low-to-moderate intensity exercise are particularly important,
      because walking is a preferred physical activity for people with T2D.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Sedentary men and women not participating in a regular exercise program (&gt; 60 minutes
             of exercise per week)

          -  If subject has diabetes, must be uncomplicated type 2 diabetes (T2D) and &lt;15 years
             since T2D diagnosis

          -  Ages of 50-70 years

          -  BMI between 25 and 35

          -  Subjects can only be taking the following oral hypoglycemic drugs:  metformin,
             sulfonylureas or sitagliptin.   Use of insulin or other oral hypoglycemic medications
             is not allowed.

          -  Persons with T2D will be accepted for study only if they have total glycosylated
             hemoglobin levels (HbA1C) &lt;8.0% (adequate control) on therapy.

          -  Control subjects must have HbA1C &lt; 5.7% and a fasting blood glucose of &lt;100 mg/dl
             suggesting no significant insulin resistance.

          -  All women must be post-menopausal, documented by menstrual history and follicle
             stimulating hormone (FSH) level.

          -  Current smokers will be excluded since smoking can impair cardiovascular (CV)
             exercise performance but people who have quit smoking for at least 1 year will be
             accepted for study.

          -  Absence of comorbid conditions that could affect exercise will be confirmed by
             history, physical examination and laboratory testing.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Persons with clinically evident distal symmetrical neuropathy, determined by
             evaluation of symptoms (numbness, paresthesia) and signs (elicited by vibration,
             pinprick, light touch, ankle jerks), will be excluded from further study as
             neuropathy may limit exercise performance.  Specifically, if monofilament sensation
             is absent at the level of the ankles, then participants will be excluded from study
             participation.

          -  Persons with autonomic dysfunction (&gt;20 mm fall in upright BP without a change in
             heart rate) will be excluded as well, due to associated limitations of exercise
             performance.

          -  Persons will be excluded if they have evidence of heart disease by history (Prior
             heart attack or bypass surgery, heart failure, or significant valvular disease) or
             abnormal resting electrocardiogram (EKG) consistent with prior infarct or latent
             ischemia (unless cardiovascular stress imaging or catheterization shows they do not
             have coronary artery disease).  The investigators will also exclude subjects with
             left or right bundle branch block on resting EKG (precludes recognition of ischemic
             EKG changes with exercise) or abnormal exercise EKG (&gt; 1 mm ST segment depression 80
             msec out in the ST segment for 3 consecutive beats).

          -  Persons with angina or any other exercise-limiting cardiovascular, pulmonary or
             musculoskeletal symptoms will be excluded as well.

          -  Presence of systolic blood pressure &gt;145 mm Hg at rest or &gt;250 mm Hg with exercise or
             diastolic pressure &gt;90 mm Hg at rest or &gt;115 mm Hg with exercise are also grounds for
             exclusion.

          -  Subjects with proteinuria (urine protein &gt;220 mg/dl) or a creatinine &gt; 1.6 mg/dl,
             suggestive of renal disease will be excluded.

          -  Subjects with total cholesterol &gt;220 mg/dl, low density lipoprotein &gt; 130 mg/dl, or
             triglycerides &gt; 250 mg/dl will be excluded given the potential insulin resistance and
             endothelial dysfunction associated with these cholesterol parameters.

          -  Subjects taking the following medications will be excluded: insulin, oral
             hypoglycemic agents other than those stated in inclusion criteria.

          -  Control subjects who have more than two immediate family members with type 2 diabetes
             will be excluded.

          -  Subjects will be excluded for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrated by a
             ratio of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1)/Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) &lt;
             0.70 or FEV1 &lt;70% predicted during spirometry.

          -  Persons weighing more than 300 pounds will be excluded as this exceeds the weight
             capacity of our Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry device

          -  Participants with moderate cognitive impairment (Folstein Mini-Mental Status
             Examination (MMSE) score &lt;24).
