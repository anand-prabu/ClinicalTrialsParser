Determine the maximum tolerated dose of erlotinib that can be administered with chest\n      radiotherapy in combination with cisplatin and etoposide or carboplatin and paclitaxel in\n      patients with inoperable stage III non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      II. Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of these regimens in these patients. III. Assess\n      the clinical response (complete response, partial response, progressive disease, or stable\n      disease) in patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      IV. Determine levels of tumor epidermal growth factor expression in patients treated with\n      these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study of erlotinib. Patients are assigned to\n      1 of 2 treatment groups.\n\n      GROUP 1: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 8, 29, and 36; etoposide IV\n      over 1 hour on days 1-5 and 29-33; and oral erlotinib once daily on days 1-49. Patients\n      undergo concurrent radiotherapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on day 1. Patients\n      receive consolidation therapy comprising docetaxel IV over 1 hour on days 50, 71, and 92.\n      Some patients may also receive oral erlotinib once daily on days 50-112.\n\n      GROUP 2: Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and\n      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 21. Patients receive consolidation therapy\n      comprising paclitaxel IV over 1 hour and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 43, 50, 57,\n      64, 71, 78, and 85 and oral erlotinib once daily on days 43-91. Patients undergo\n      radiotherapy concurrently with consolidation therapy 5 days a week for 7 weeks beginning on\n      day 43.\n\n      In both groups, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of erlotinib during\n      concurrent chemoradiotherapy until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n      At least 12 patients from each group are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 8 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-48 patients (12-24 per treatment group) will be accrued for\n      this study within 6-12 months."
