            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      Hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) has curative potential for individuals with sickle\n      cell disease. While the results of conventional HCT have been good, this treatment carries\n      risks of significant short- term and longterm toxicities. For this reason, HCT has been\n      reserved for children who have experienced severe symptoms that predict a poor outcome. Of\n      interest, some patients developed stable donor-host hematopoietic chimerism after\n      conventional HCT. Due to a natural enrichment of donor erythrocytes in the blood, those who\n      developed stable chimerism had a significant clinical benefit, even when there was a\n      minority of donor cells. These observations have paralleled efforts to develop less-toxic,\n      non-myeloablative preparative regiments for transplantation, proved first in a canine model\n      of transplantation, and subsequently translated successfully in a clinical trial for older\n      adults with hematological malignancies.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Multicenter open-label phase I-II study in 30 children with sickle cell disease that\n      combines a non-myeloablative pre-transplant hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) therapy\n      with modulated post-grafting immunosuppression to control host-versus-graft and\n      graft-versus-host reactions. The approach relies on the ability to establish and maintain\n      donor-host chimerism. The primary study endpoint is stable donor cell engraftment; secondary\n      endpoints measure the impact of therapy on sickle cell-related symptoms and end-organ damage\n      (disease-free survival, patient survival, graft-versus-host disease, complications etc). The\n      trial will be conducted within the existing network of Comprehensive Sickle Cell Centers,\n      and will be centrally coordinated by the Sickle Cell Coordinating Center."
