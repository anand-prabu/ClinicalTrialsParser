To determine the in vivo regulatory effect of interleukin-12 on Fas lingand (FasL)\n      expression on patients' peripheral blood lymphocytes.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to disease characteristics: low grade\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular small cleaved, follicular mixed, small lymphocytic, and\n      variants) versus intermediate grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (follicular large, diffuse large,\n      diffuse mixed, immunoblastic, peripheral T-cell, and mantle cell) versus Hodgkin's disease.\n\n      Patients receive interleukin-12 subcutaneously twice a week. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-105 patients will be accrued for this study."
