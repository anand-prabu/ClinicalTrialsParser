Although zidovudine (AZT)\n      prolongs life in certain AIDS patients, it is not a cure for AIDS and it also has toxic\n      effects in many patients. Therefore, it is necessary to test other drugs in HIV-infected\n      patients. AL-721 is a mixture of lipids (fats) extracted from egg yolks. Laboratory tests\n      suggest that it might inhibit the infectivity of the HIV. AL-721 has been tried so far in a\n      few patients for short periods of time and has been found to be well tolerated."

The first dose is taken on an empty stomach 1 hour\n      before a fat-free breakfast, with specific instructions given on foods that are allowed; the\n      second dose is taken at least 3 hours after the evening meal. No snacks are permitted after\n      the evening meal or after the evening dose of study medication. The study is scheduled to\n      last for 16 weeks of treatment and 4 weeks of follow-up. Throughout the study, frequent\n      blood samples will be taken from an arm vein. The blood samples are studied to evaluate any\n      changes in the patient's immune system, any toxic effects that might be detected in the\n      blood, and any changes in the presence of the HIV in the blood."
