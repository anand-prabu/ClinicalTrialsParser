Previous research has shown that type 2 diabetic patients may experience large\n      increments in cTnT levels over the subsequent hours following a single bout of\n      moderate-intensity endurance-type exercise. This phenomenon is likely attributed to cardiac\n      ischemia-reperfusion injury caused by reduced nitric oxide (NO) bioavailability. Recent\n      evidence indicates that ingestion of dietary nitrates dramatically increases the\n      bioavailability of NO, and as such, may be protective against cardiac ischemia-reperfusion\n      injury.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that dietary nitrate supplementation blunts the rise in cTnT\n      levels following exercise in type 2 diabetic patients."
