Thalidomide may stop the growth of cancer by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining topotecan and thalidomide in\n      treating patients who have recurrent or refractory malignant glioma."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
