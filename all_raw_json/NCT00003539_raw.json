Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill\n      them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining\n      chemotherapy with monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of paclitaxel plus monoclonal antibody\n      therapy in treating women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer."

Determine the therapeutic efficacy of paclitaxel in combination with\n      monoclonal antibody HER2 (Herceptin) in women with recurrent or metastatic breast cancer.\n      II. Evaluate the safety of this combination regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by tumor expression of HER2 (overexpression vs normal).\n      Patients receive a loading dose of monoclonal antibody HER2 (Herceptin) intravenously over\n      90 minutes on day 0. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously over 1 hour on day 1. Starting\n      on day 7, patients receive paclitaxel by infusion over 1 hour every 7 days. Monoclonal\n      antibody HER2 is administered intravenously over 30 minutes immediately following paclitaxel\n      every 7 days. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression and unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 50 patients in approximately 6 months."
