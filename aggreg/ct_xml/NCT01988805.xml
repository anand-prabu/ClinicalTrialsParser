  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to collect blood from healthy individuals to investigate whether
      variations in immune-related (inflammasome) genes affect how the immune cells found in the
      blood can help fight infections and prevent diseases.

    <description>Our intent is to collect these cells, divide them into subtypes such as monocytes, lymphocytes and neutrophils and then to analyze their ability to respond to exogenous challenges by changing the production of proteins, the expression of genes and their ability to migrate and ingest materials. We additionally will be interested in examining the cell components that may be released from these cells during various in vitro challenges.</description>
