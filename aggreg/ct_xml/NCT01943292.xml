  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I, open-label, dose-escalation trial of defactinib (VS-6063), a focal
      adhesion kinase inhibitor, in Japanese patients with non-hematologic malignancies.  The
      purpose of this study is to assess the safety (including the recommended phase 2 dose), the
      pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer activity of defactinib (VS-6063).

             therapy.

          -  All persistent clinically significant toxicities from prior chemotherapy must be ≤
             Grade 1.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1, measured within 72 hours before the start of
             treatment.

          -  Predicted life expectancy of ≥ 3 months.

          -  Adequate renal function [creatinine ≤ 1.5x ULN (upper limit of normal)] or GFR of ≥
             50mL/min.

          -  Adequate hepatic function (total bilirubin ≤ 1.5x ULN for the institution; AST
             [aspartate transaminase] and ALT [alanine transaminase] ≤ 3x ULN, or ≤ 5x ULN if due
             to liver involvement by tumor).

             the investigational drug and administration of the study treatment is required. In
             addition, any drug-related toxicity except alopecia should have recovered to grade 1
             or less.

          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Any evidence of serious active infections.

          -  Uncontrolled or severe cardiovascular disease, including myocardial infarct or

             (NYHA) Class II or greater congestive heart failure, serious arrhythmias requiring
             medication for treatment, clinically significant pericardial disease, or cardiac
             amyloidosis.
