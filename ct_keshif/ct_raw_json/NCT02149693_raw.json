            "textblock": "Medical education was transformed from mainly didactic class before 19th century to the\n      clerkship and internship training based on the concept of \"learning by doing\" in 20th\n      century. There are new challenges for medical education in the 21th century, including\n      knowledge explosion, the importance of communication and teamwork in clinical care, and lack\n      of comprehensive and systemic experiential learning. Therefore, another paradigm shift of\n      medical education in this century is necessary. This research project, through applying\n      high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom in\n      resuscitation training, take the innovation and reform of resuscitation training as a pilot\n      test for paradigm shift of medical education.\n\n      This research project is a 4-year project. Three innovative intervention for resuscitation\n      training will be developed, implemented, and evaluated. There will be 4 phases in this\n      project:\n\n        1. Development phase (1st year): establishment of structure, validity and reliability\n           test, faculty development, and course preparation.\n\n        2. Experiment phase (2nd year): comparative studies will be conducted.\n\n        3. Implementation phase (3rd year): integration and implementation of innovative\n           interventions.\n\n        4. Evaluation phase (4th year): effectiveness evaluation and analysis of learning\n           retention.\n\n      Through innovation, development, implementation and effectiveness evaluation in this 4\n      phases, this research project hope to integrate high-fidelity simulation, resuscitation\n      teamwork model, and concept of flipped classroom, into resuscitation training successfully\n      and appropriately. Furthermore, these experiences can provide the bases of paradigm shift in\n      medical education in the future."
