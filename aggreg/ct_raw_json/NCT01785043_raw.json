The study will follow a parallel group, open-label design\n      as liraglutide is administered by subcutaneous injection and sitagliptin orally in tablets.\n      A double-dummy design has been rejected because it is highly complicated in a phase IV\n      study, and any bias of an open-label design has a lower impact on objective variables (as it\n      is our primary endpoint) and it could be compensated with the proposed random\n      design.Sitagliptin has been selected as the active control as it is one of the prescribed\n      treatments for type 2 diabetes patients not well controlled at the maximum tolerated dose of\n      metformin.\n\n      The study objectives will be assessed after 3 months of therapy as it is considered a\n      suitable timing for identifying short-term changes on flow-mediated vasodilation"
