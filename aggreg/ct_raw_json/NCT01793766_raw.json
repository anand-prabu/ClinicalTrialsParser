The other half of the patient will receive a placebo or sham intervention.  The\n      intervention will involve a small electric current given every day for 10 days.  Everybody\n      will be monitored for 16 more weeks (total of 26 weeks) while on a weight maintenance diet\n      to see if the intervention helps people keep the weight off."
