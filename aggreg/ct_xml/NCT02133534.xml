  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if patients with chronic kidney disease have endothelial
      cells that don't function properly, which is thought to be a marker for cardiovascular risk.
       Endothelial cells line the heart and blood vessels.  The investigators will treat your high
      cholesterol with a cholesterol-lowering drug (atorvastatin, or Lipitor).  They will
      determine if this cholesterol lowering drug improves subjects' cholesterol as well as the
      function of endothelial cells.

    <description>Subjects will be treated with atorvastatin 10 mg/day for 30 days. The study team will obtain one blood and urine sample at baseline prior to starting atorvastatin therapy, and again after 30 days of drug therapy. The study team will do ultrasound imaging of the arm in which a probe will be placed over the blood vessels to measure the diameter of the artery and how this changes after a blood pressure cuff is inflated and then deflated.  Subjects will take one nitroglycerine tablet during the ultrasound imaging.</description>
