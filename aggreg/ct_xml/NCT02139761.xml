  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine continues to be one of the most widely used substances of abuse around the world. In
      the US, an estimated 1.4 million individuals (0.5%) &gt; 12 years were current (past month)
      cocaine users in 2011. Currently, no FDA-approved pharmacologic treatments are available for
      cocaine addiction; thus, this remains a serious public health problem without an effective
      pharmacological treatment. A promising lead towards an effective treatment comes from a
      recent finding that pretreatment with oral l-tetrahydropalmitine (l-THP) in rats attenuated
      the cocaine seeking associated with a cocaine challenge, while having no motor effects. This
      finding stimulated our group to test the pharmacokinetics and safety of l-THP in a phase I
      study of people with cocaine use. Preliminary findings show l-THP is safe and well tolerated
      in cocaine users, with no adverse interactions with cocaine.

      This study will test the efficacy and safety of l-THP for abstinence in those with cocaine
      addiction in a phase II pilot study (N=24). Secondarily, we will examine the effects of
      these medications on craving.

    <description>Subjects will be dosed 30 mg BID (2 capsules total a day, total of 60mg/day), matching placebo or l-THP) (total 60 mg daily). The half-life of l-THP is about 10 hours, so subjects will reach steady state in about 2-3 days. The l-THP will be prepared at the University of Maryland School of Pharmacy to Chemistry under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) and standards.  The identical placebo and active capsules will be manufactured and sent to the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center Pharmacy, where they will be stored, randomized and dispensed. Medication will be transported by the study staff to the participant once dispensing occurs.</description>
