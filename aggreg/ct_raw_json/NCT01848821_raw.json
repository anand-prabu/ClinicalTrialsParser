The investigators intend on confirming the histological composition of the\n      dermal substitute in order to delineate the amount of cellular recruitment, collagen\n      deposition and neovascularization present compared with control wounds. The investigators\n      hypothesize that OASIS\u00ae Ultra will provide a faster healing time as well as the\n      re-establishment of a dermis for further skin graft application.  The investigators\n      anticipate that our study will define parameters for the application of OASIS\u00ae Ultra as well\n      as potentially demonstrating the advantages in healing time, healed wound quality and\n      hospital stay."

All eligible patients will be identified by\n      physician care givers on the Churchill service.  Non-study affiliated physicians will then\n      approach the patient and/or his or her healthcare proxy with a consent form and a direct\n      description of the study.

Accrual of patients will take place at the Massachusetts\n      General Hospital Churchill Surgical Service.  All eligible patients will be identified by\n      physician care givers on the Churchill service.  Non-study affiliated physicians will then\n      approach the patient and/or his or her healthcare proxy with a descriptive consent form and\n      a verbal explanation of the study.  If the patient and/or his or her healthcare proxy agree\n      to proceed with inclusion then the described protocol will be followed.\n\n      Consent The consent form is written in non-medical 'lay' terms in order that all non-medical\n      readers may understand the terminologies and ideas.  If the patient is non-English speaking\n      then a certified hospital translator will be obtained in order that the written and verbal\n      discussions can be done in the patient's native language for full comprehension. The PHRC\n      policy on Obtaining and Documenting Informed Consent of Subjects who do not Speak English\n      will be followed. For this study, potential subjects will be given a written translation in\n      a language understandable to them of the \"short form\" or of the entire English version of\n      the consent form approved by the Partners Human Research Committee (PHRC).  Once a patient\n      has been identified as eligible for enrollment by a physician on the team, a verbal\n      discussion will be had with the patient using the sections of the consent form ensuring to\n      cover purpose of research, design of research, procedures, risks, benefits, discomforts,\n      benefits, costs, alternatives and number of patients to be enrolled.  After identification\n      of eligible patients, verbal explanation of the study parameters while leaving the patient\n      with the consent form to read, 24 hours will be allowed to pass in order that the patient\n      may think about potential questions and/or issues he or she may have with the study.  Upon\n      return by a physician not affiliated with the study, they will answer any patient questions\n      or concerns.   If the patient is willing to proceed with consent the co-Investigator or\n      principal investigator will be contacted in order that the patient and the investigator may\n      co-sign the consent form.  We will ensure that there are contact details on the patient's\n      consent form should they have any questions or issues.  If the patient wishes to withdraw\n      consent prior to the completion of the study they will be allowed to do so and the IRB will\n      be contacted for guidance.  The informed consent authorizes the use of medical chart\n      information, historical lab values and consent for photography.\n\n      The PHRC recommendations regarding categories of surrogates (listed in general order of\n      preference)  that may provide consent in writing on behalf of potential subjects incapable\n      of providing informed consent will be followed:\n\n      i) court appointed guardian with specific authority to consent to participation in research\n      or authority to make health care decisions for a class of diagnostic and therapeutic\n      decisions inclusive of the proposed research;\n\n      ii) health care proxy/person with durable power of attorney with specific authority for\n      making health care decisions inclusive of the proposed research; or\n\n      iii) spouse, adult child, or other close family member who knows the subject well and has\n      been involved in their care. Assent of subjects will be a requirement for participation in\n      the research unless the subject is incapable of giving assent due to his/her medical\n      condition. If the individual objects to participation, s/he should not be enrolled. When\n      surrogate consent is relied upon, the Investigator will ensure that the surrogate\n      understands that his or her decisions should be based on \"substituted judgment.\" This means\n      that the decision reflects a potential subject's own views when s/he had the capacity to\n      express them.\n\n      The Investigators will document the relationship of the surrogate to the subject in the\n      research record."
