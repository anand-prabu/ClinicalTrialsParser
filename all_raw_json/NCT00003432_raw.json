Approximately 60-90\n      days after the peripheral blood stem cell transplant, patients receive CEA RNA pulsed\n      dendritic cells IV every 3 weeks for a total of 4 doses. Patients undergo a second\n      leukopheresis after the last dose of immunotherapy to obtain specimens for immunologic\n      tests.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-26 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
