            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase II dose of\n      lurtotecan liposome and cisplatin in patients with advanced solid tumors. II. Determine the\n      toxicity profile, dose-limiting toxic effects, and the pharmacokinetics of this treatment\n      regimen in this patient population. III. Determine any correlation between toxicity profile\n      and pharmacokinetics of this treatment regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the\n      objective tumor response to this treatment regimen in patients with measurable disease\n      (previously untreated solid tumors) entered at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, multicenter, dose-escalation study of lurtotecan liposome.\n      Patients receive cisplatin IV over 1 hour followed by lurtotecan liposome IV over 30 minutes\n      on days 1-3. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Once the total dose of cisplatin is reached, patients receive\n      lurtotecan liposome alone. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue therapy for 2\n      courses after documentation of confirmed CR. Patients achieving partial response (PR)\n      continue therapy until progression or for 2 courses after documentation of stable PR.\n      Patients with stable disease continue therapy for a maximum of 6 courses. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of lurtotecan liposome until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which at least 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 10 patients with\n      previously untreated solid tumors are treated at the recommended phase II dose (1 dose below\n      the MTD). Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-15\n      months."
