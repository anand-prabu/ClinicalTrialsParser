  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase I, multi-center study is to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of AG-221 in advanced hematologic malignancies that
      harbor an IDH2 mutation.  The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where
      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-221 to determine maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose.  The second portion of the study
      is a dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive AG-221 to further
      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the MTD.  Anticipated time on
      study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject must be ≥18 years of age.

          -  Subjects must have documented IDH2 gene-mutated disease based on local evaluation.
             (Centralized testing will be performed retrospectively.) If not performed prior to
             screening, gene-mutation analysis should be the first screening procedure performed.

          -  Subjects must be amenable to serial bone marrow biopsies, peripheral blood sampling,
             and urine sampling during the study.

          -  Subjects or their legal representatives must be able to understand and sign an
             informed consent.

          -  Subjects must have ECOG PS of 0 to 2.

          -  Platelet count ≥20,000/µL (Transfusions to achieve this level are allowed.) Subjects
             with a baseline platelet count of &lt;20,000/µL due to underlying malignancy are
             eligible with Medical Monitor approval.

          -  Subjects must have adequate hepatic function as evidenced by aspartate
             aminotransferase, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) ≤3.0 × ULN, unless considered
             due to leukemic organ involvement.

          -  Subjects must have adequate renal function as evidenced by a serum creatinine ≤2.0 ×
             ULN.

          -  Female subjects with reproductive potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test
             within 7 days prior to the start of therapy. Subjects with reproductive potential are
             defined as one who is biologically capable of becoming pregnant. Women of
             childbearing potential as well as fertile men and their partners must agree to
             abstain from sexual intercourse or to use an effective form of contraception during
             the study and for 90 days (females and males) following the last dose of AG-221.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have previously received AG-221.

          -  Subjects who have undergone hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) within 60 days
             of the first dose of AG-221, or subjects on immunosuppressive therapy post HSCT at
             the time of screening, or with clinically significant graft-versus-host disease
             (GVHD). (The use of topical steroids for ongoing skin GVHD is permitted.)

          -  Subjects who received systemic anticancer therapy or radiotherapy &lt;14 days prior to
             their first day of study drug administration. (Hydroxyurea is allowed for up to 28
             days after the start of AG-221 for the control of peripheral leukemic blasts in
             subjects with white blood cell [WBC] counts &gt;30,000/μL as well as prior to
             enrollment).

          -  Subjects who received a small molecule investigational agent &lt;14 days prior to their
             first day of study drug administration. In addition, the first dose of AG-221 should
             not occur before a period ≥5 half-lives of the investigational agent has elapsed.

          -  Subjects who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Subjects with New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV congestive heart
             failure or LVEF &lt;40% by echocardiogram (ECHO) or multi-gated acquisition (MUGA) scan
             within approximately 28 days of C1D1.

          -  Subjects with a history of myocardial infarction within the last 6 months.

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure [BP] &gt;180 mmHg or
             diastolic BP &gt;100 mmHg) are excluded. Subjects requiring 2 or more medications to
             control hypertension are eligible with Medical Monitor approval.

          -  Subjects with known unstable or uncontrolled angina pectoris.

          -  Subjects with a known history of severe and/or uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias.

          -  Subjects with heart-rate corrected QT (QTc) interval ≥450 ms or other factors that
             increase the risk of QT prolongation or arrhythmic events (e.g., heart failure,
             hypokalemia, family history of long QT interval syndrome).

          -  Patients taking medications that are known to prolong the QT interval (see Section
             9.10.2)

          -  Subjects with known infection with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or active
             hepatitis C.

          -  Subjects with known dysphagia, short-gut syndrome, gastroparesis, or other conditions
             that limit the ingestion or gastrointestinal absorption of drugs administered orally.

          -  Subjects with clinical symptoms suggesting active central nervous system (CNS)
             leukemia or known CNS leukemia. Evaluation of cerebrospinal fluid is only required if
             there is a clinical suspicion of CNS involvement by leukemia during screening.

             uncontrolled bleeding, pneumonia with hypoxia or shock, and/or disseminated
             intravascular coagulation.
