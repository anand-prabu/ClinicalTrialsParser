Therefore, it is assumed that the individual pain\n      sensitivity might determine the subject's performance.\n\n      Aims: To investigate the role of the DNIC efficiency in prediction of anaerobic performance\n      in humans  (2) to study the role of peripheral pro-nociceptive processing  in mediating pain\n      during  anaerobic exercise and its contribution to the subjects' performance  (3) to assess\n      the function of pain-related psychological factors in anaerobic performance."

Moreover, the\n      interaction between psychological factors and pro- and anti- nociceptive processes that are\n      operated during anaerobic exercise, need to be investigated.\n\n      Methods: Forty healthy men and women, between the ages of 18-40 will be involved in the\n      study. Each participant will complete 3 psychological questionnaires regarding their\n      personality traits: Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), State-Trait Anxiety Inventory  and\n      Perceived Stress Questionnaire. Pain psychophysics tests will be used for evaluating the\n      individual pain perception, prior and subsequent to the anaerobic exercise: (1) DNIC will be\n      tested using a paradigm of two remote noxious stimuli with one, the 'conditioning stimulus'\n      (immersing the hand in tub containing  8\u00b0c water), inhibiting the other, the 'test pain'\n      (pressure pain threshold) in order to assess the endogenous analgesia (EA) efficiency (2)\n      heat and pressure pain thresholds, and (3) temporal summation of painful heat and mechanical\n      stimuli that reflect the neuroplasticity of the central nervous system following peripheral\n      noxious stimulation. In addition, Anaerobic performance will be evaluated during Wingate\n      test,and blood lactate will be measured. Gene related pain ill be tested using saliva\n      samples ."
