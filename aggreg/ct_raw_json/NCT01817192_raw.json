            "textblock": "The optimal treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial.\n      Radiographic surveillance alone has been recommended for stage I patients after the tumor is\n      removed surgically from the lung, and this standard has been based on the fact that no\n      previous clinical trial has demonstrated a benefit for stage I NSCLC patients who receive\n      post-operative chemotherapy. These patients, however, have a substantial risk of death\n      within five years after operation, ranging from approximately 30% to 45%, largely due to\n      metastatic disease that is present immediately after surgery but that is undetectable by\n      conventional methods. Some leading organizations therefore currently recommend\n      post-operative chemotherapy as an alternative standard of care in stage I NSCLC patients who\n      are considered to be at particularly high-risk. Up until now, however, there has not been a\n      well-validated means to identify stage I NSCLC patients at high risk of death within five\n      years after operation. A new prognostic tool, the Pervenio\u2122 Lung RS Assay, which has been\n      validated and definitively demonstrated in large scale studies to identify high-risk stage I\n      patients with non-squamous NSCLC, is now available to all clinicians through a\n      CLIA-certified laboratory. It is therefore now possible to compare the outcomes of patients\n      randomly assigned to one or the other of these competing standards of care."
