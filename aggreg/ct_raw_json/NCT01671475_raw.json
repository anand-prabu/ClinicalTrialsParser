            "textblock": "Approximately, 4% and 10% of emergency department (ED) patients in the United States present\n      with altered mental status (AMS). According to previous studies, close to 30% of AMS cases\n      occur due to neurological etiologies. Among these pathologies are non-convulsive seizures\n      (NCS) and non-convulsive status epilepticus (NCSE). In our previous study, the investigators\n      established that approximately 4% (95% confidence interval, 2-8%) of ED patients with AMS\n      suffer from NCS and NCSE. Our study also revealed that  78% of the ED patient with AMS have\n      some form of EEG abnormality.\n\n      NCS and NCSE are difficult to diagnose especially in AMS patients because performing a\n      thorough physical examination or obtaining medical history is often impossible in altered\n      patients. Definitive diagnosis of NCS/NCSE requires electroencephalography (EEG), a test\n      that records brain electrical activity and provides information about the brain function.\n\n      Unfortunately, obtaining an EEG in the ED can be challenging. This requires transporting an\n      EEG machine to patient's bedside, where space limitations and presence of variety of\n      monitors and devices, especially in over-crowded EDs render this practice difficult. In many\n      institutions an EEG service is not offered after work hours due to the unavailability of\n      24/7 EEG technologist coverage and real-time electroencephalographer interpretation. As a\n      result of the aforementioned limitations, ED physicians may refrain from ordering EEG.\n\n      The wireless portable EEG device (microEEG) designed by the Bio-Signal Group was designed to\n      address these limitations. With minimal training, ED personnel could use this small,\n      microEEG device to obtain an EEG. The recording then can be wirelessly transmitted to a host\n      computer via a secure network connection to the neurology experts who could interpret the\n      EEG. Incorporating microEEG in the initial workup of patients with AMS could help the ED\n      attending rule out NCS/NCSE and focus on other diagnoses. Alternatively, if the presence of\n      NCS is confirmed by EEG, the treatment could be initiated early and potentially reduce\n      morbidity or mortality.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that incorporating EEG in the work of ED patients with AMS\n      could impact the management(diagnosis and treatment)of these patients and influence their\n      clinical outcome.\n\n      Sample size: Our sample size analysis using data one published related study reveled that\n      the study would need 65 patients in each group (total n:130). However, the investigators\n      plan to perform an interim analysis after enrolling half of this target sample and adjust\n      the sample size calculation based on the collected data if necessary."

The microEEG combines the characteristics of low noise and small size, due to a number of fundamental design characteristics. It records, amplifies, and digitizes the signals at a point very close to the electrodes. This allows the length of the wires between electrodes and the recorder's amplifiers to be very short, keeping them out of the way. Short wires also reduce any inconvenience signal artifacts or other problems that may be associated with the length of the wires.  The microEEG's dimensions are about 2\"x2\"x1\".",
