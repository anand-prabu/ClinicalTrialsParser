In the 80\u00b4s and 90's few papers, with\n      limited number of patients, have proposed the association between nasal septum contact and\n      headache. The International Classification of Headaches Disorders proposed specific\n      diagnostic criteria for this entity.\n\n      With the major use of CT scans, the contact between nasal mucosa and septum is daily\n      observed in many patients without complaint of headache.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if there is any correlation between nasal and\n      septum mucosa contact and the prevalence of headache. The investigators hypothesized that no\n      correlation will be found using CT scans in a large series of patients."
