Previous studies have proposed that\n      ultrasonographic measurements of the optic nerve sheath diameter (ONSD) correlate with signs\n      of increased ICP. Therefore, this study aims to confirm the increased ICP by\n      ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD during laparoscopic surgery in pediatric patients."
