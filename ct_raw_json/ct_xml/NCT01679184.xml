      Donor-Specific Antibody (DSA) (HLA) levels and non-HLA antibody levels in recipients prior
      to living kidney transplantation and randomize these individuals into a desensitization
      protocol in order to evaluate shifts that can occur with the Luminex and XM-One assay after
      treatment and up to 6 months post transplant.

      If desensitization is needed prior to transplantation in individuals with a negative
      crossmatch but positive DSA and/or XM-one - patients will be evaluated clinically with
      routine lab tests (serum creatinine levels, spot urine protein and spot urine creatinine
      levels) as well as protocol biopsy evaluations.

      1. Rates of acute rejection including subclinical rejection - acute T cell mediated
           (cellular) rejection, antibody mediated acute rejection, and chronic
           antibody-associated injury (i.e.: Transplant Glomerulopathy, Chronic allograft
           arteriopathy) between the groups.

        2. Evaluation of endothelial cell activation and injury on biopsies by checking markers
           for endothelial cell activation and injury (intercellular adhesion molecule-1,
           ICAM-1/CD54; vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, VCAM-1/CD106; and E-selectin,
           ELAM-1/CD62E) in two-color stains of tissue with classical endothelial markers (CD34
           and Factor VIII).

        3. Measurement of serum/plasma levels of TNF-alpha and VEGF and decreased levels of
           protein C and protein S in the circulation, as an assessment of graft vascular
           perturbation.

        4. Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) will be measured by flow cytometry with markers
           for endothelial cell activation.

Determine role of desensitization prior to transplantation in individuals with a negative crossmatch but positive DSA and/or XM-one - based on Luminex and XM-One testing.  Patients will be evaluated clinically with routine lab tests (serum creatinine levels, spot urine protein and spot urine creatinine levels) as well as protocol biopsy evaluations.</description>
