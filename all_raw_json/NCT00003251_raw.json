Radiation therapy uses x-rays to damage tumor cells. Drugs,\n      such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy and\n      radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine plus cisplatin,\n      paclitaxel, and radiation therapy in treating patients who have advanced unresectable head\n      and neck cancer."

Assess the efficacy and role of amifostine as a cytoprotection agent with\n      concurrent chemoradiotherapy in advanced, previously irradiated or metastatic head and neck\n      cancer. II. Determine the toxicity and response to cisplatin, paclitaxel and radiation\n      therapy in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of amifostine in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive paclitaxel by continuous infusion on\n      days 0-3. Amifostine IV is administered over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Radiation therapy is\n      administered once daily on days 1-5. Cisplatin IV is administered on day 5. Patients receive\n      no treatment on days 6-13. Treatment is repeated every 2 weeks for up to 7 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression and unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed monthly\n      during the first year, every 2 months during the second year, then every 3 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 16-46 patients."
