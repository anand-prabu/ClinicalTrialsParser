This study has an\n      adaptive 2-stage design. Bioequivalence based on encapsulated doxorubicin will be tested at\n      the end of Stage 1 using data from at least 24 ovarian cancer patients. An interim analysis\n      of free doxorubicin will be performed at the end of Stage 1 using data from 42 patients of\n      all cancer types. The study may continue into Stage 2 with additional patients of all cancer\n      types; and final evaluation of bioequivalence for free doxorubicin will be performed at the\n      end of Stage 2. The study will include a screening phase followed by an open-label treatment\n      phase consisting of 2 doxorubicin treatment cycles and an end-of-treatment visit on Cycle 3,\n      Day 1. Participants may enter an optional extension phase after 2 cycles. Safety will be\n      monitored throughout the study. Blood samples for pharmacokinetic analysis will be obtained\n      from all participants at specified times over 29 days after starting each study drug\n      administration in Cycles 1 and 2 for determination of plasma concentrations of encapsulated\n      and free doxorubicin."
