Dose escalation continues until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined.\n\n      In the second stage, patients receive escalating doses of oral calcitriol on days 1-3 and a\n      fixed dose of oral dexamethasone on days 0-4. Treatment continues weekly in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Dose escalation continues until the MTD is\n      determined.\n\n      Six additional patients may receive calcitriol and dexamethasone at one dose level below the\n      MTD determined in the second stage, to confirm the MTD.\n\n      The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
