Concurrent saliva and blood draw measurements of Estradiol and Progesterone will be taken between 3-5 times during a 2-week monitoring period. Equivalence will be determined by the matched progression of Estradiol and progesterone levels (pg/ml) in the same patient at the concurrent times. Saliva Estradiol and Progesterone levels are of a magnitude of 100-200 less than serum based values and are converted using an algorithm to adjust to serum equivalence.
