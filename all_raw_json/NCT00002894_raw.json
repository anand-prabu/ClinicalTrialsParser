Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive platinum-based chemotherapy (that is familiar to the oncologist\n           and used routinely by the center) comprising either cisplatin or carboplatin alone or\n           cisplatin in combination with other drugs.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by either carboplatin or\n           cisplatin.\n\n      Treatment for both arms continues every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 months, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 800 patients will be accrued for this study."
