To assess the benefit of 177Lu-octreotate versus interferon \u03b1-2b in patients with\n           progressive, unresectable,non-pancreatic gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumors,\n           resistant to therapy with somatostatine analogues.\n\n        2. To assess efficacy and safety parameters of both treatment arms and the prognostic\n           value of tumor 68Ga-octreotate PET/CT and 18FDG PET/CT uptake at baseline, at mid and\n           end of PRRT treatment.\n\n      In the interferon arm: 5000000 Units of interferon will be administered subcutaneously\n      preferentially in the evening every second day.\n\n      In the 177Lu-octreotate arm: Treatment will consist of 177Lu-octreotate infusions in fixed\n      activities of 7,4 GigaBecqurel each, given 8-11 weeks apart, injected intravenously with\n      simultaneous infusion of an amino acid solution. (Before amino acid nephroprotection\n      solution, ondansetron, methylprednisolone and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in\n      order to prevent nausea or vomiting). Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the\n      aminoacid solution,  177Lu-octreotate is co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid\n      infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5 more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).\n\n      In total, 4 cycles are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be\n      limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) cumulated absorbed doses.\n\n      Treatment efficacy will be assessed on a patient-basis by evaluation of the Progression-Free\n      Survival"
