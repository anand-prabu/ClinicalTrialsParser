            "textblock": "In vitro studies have demonstrated that sodium selenite in sufficient concentration and\n      during sufficient time have a high tumoricidal capacity. This is found in many human cell\n      types as leukemia cells, mesothelioma and non-small cell lung cancer cells. A minority of\n      cell lines seem to be resistant. The question from a clinical point of view is: Is it\n      possible with respect to toxicity to administer sodium selenite to patients in sufficient\n      dose and during sufficient time to get responses in patients with cancer? We have performed\n      first part of phase-1 study and found MTD of 10.2 mg/m2 if given as 10 daily infusions\n      during 12 days. We have recorded limited anti-tumor effect in this treatment regimen.\n      However, in vitro data suggest that low concentration of continuous exposure for 51 h is\n      much more effective. Now we are planning to continue the phase-I trial with modified\n      protocol.\n\n      More specific:\n\n        1. Phase I: Find maximal tolerable dose with continuous infusion\n\n        2. Phase II: Use MTD and study responses, if any"
