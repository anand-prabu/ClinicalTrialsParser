We will also evaluate the usability and\n      satisfaction derived from using this system.\n\n      We hypothesize that:\n\n        1. The use of the MedSentry system will improve medication adherence in patients with a\n           discharge diagnosis of HF.\n\n        2. The improvement in adherence correlates with fewer inpatient hospitalizations.\n\n        3. The improvement in adherence correlates with better health-related quality of life."
