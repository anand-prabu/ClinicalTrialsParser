The control group receives the same amount of\n      placebo play sessions. The intervention group receives subsequently 15 sessions of parent\n      training. All children are 3 to 6 years old and meet diagnostic criteria for ADD or ADHD.\n      Main hypothesis are a stronger reduction of ADHD symptoms of the child in different settings\n      in the intervention than in the control group. Play-persistence and -intensity should also\n      increase more in the intervention group. An additional effect of a subsequent parent\n      training shall furthermore be tested."
