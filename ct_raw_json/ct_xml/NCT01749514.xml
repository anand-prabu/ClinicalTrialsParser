             myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), according to WHO criteria, that meets International
             Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) classification of low or intermediate-1 risk disease

             peripheral complete blood count (CBC) obtained during screening.

          2. Anemia defined as:

               1. Mean hemoglobin concentration &lt; 10.0 g/dL of 2 measurements (one performed
                  within one day prior to Cycle 1 Day 1 and the other performed 7-28 days prior to
                  Cycle 1 Day 1, not influenced by RBC transfusion within 7 days of measurement)
                  for non-transfusion dependent patients (defined as having received &lt; 4 units of
                  RBCs within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1), OR

               2. Transfusion dependent, defined as having received ≥ 4 units of RBCs within 8
                  weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

             of RBCs for hemoglobin ≤ 9.0 g/dL within 8 weeks prior to Cycle 1 Day 1.

          3. Serum erythropoietin level &gt; 500 U/L, OR, if ≤ 500 U/L, patient is non-responsive to,
             refractory to, or intolerant of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs), or ESAs are
             contraindicated or unavailable.

          4. No alternative treatment options, per applicable MDS guidelines, are available and/or
             appropriate for the patient, at the discretion of the investigator.

          5. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2 (if related to anemia).

          6. Adequate renal (creatinine ≤ 2 x upper limit of normal [ULN]) and hepatic (total
             bilirubin &lt; 2 x ULN and AST and ALT &lt; 3 x ULN) function.

          7. Adequate transferrin saturation (≥ 15%), ferritin (≥ 50 µg/L), folate (≥ 4.5 nmol/L
             [≥ 2.0 µg/L]) and vitamin B12 (≥ 148 pmol/L [≥ 200 pg/mL]) during screening
             (supplementation and retest during screening is acceptable).

             Patients must be counseled concerning measures to be used to prevent pregnancy and
             potential toxicities prior to the first dose of ACE-536.
