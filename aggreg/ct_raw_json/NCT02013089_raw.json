            "textblock": "Rational: Cancer sequencing (CS) promises to become the centerpiece of personalized oncology\n      by informing on treatments targeted to each tumor's unique genetic constitution.  This data\n      can be critical to making an informed decision for disease management, though this may not\n      be the case for all patients.  CS identifies variations or differences in the DNA and/or RNA\n      of the cells in an individual's tumor by comparison to that of his/her normal cells.  These\n      somatic variations may, on further interpretation, be identified as key drivers of\n      carcinogenesis.  Such information may predict a patient's prognosis, response to currently\n      available treatments or prompt the development of novel therapeutics.  Though CS has the\n      potential to personalize and optimize cancer care, it may produce a vast amount of data and\n      unique changes in the DNA/RNA that may be difficult to interpret at the present time.\n\n      Using the Integrated genomic network analysis, we could have better understanding of the\n      underlying processes and pathways involved in tumor onset and progression. And then we could\n      choose a specific treatment regimen and develop personalized cancer therapies"
