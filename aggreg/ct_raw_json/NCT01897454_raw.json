Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium,\n      irinotecan hydrochloride, oxaliplatin, and gemcitabine hydrochloride, work in different ways\n      to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Fluorouracil, irinotecan hydrochloride, and gemcitabine hydrochloride may also\n      stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Giving combination chemotherapy and gemcitabine hydrochloride with radiation therapy before\n      surgery may make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be\n      removed."
