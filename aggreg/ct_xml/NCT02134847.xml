  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proposal, we seek to address conclusively two knowledge gaps: 1) the lack of data on
      the relationship between PGY2+ (post graduate year 2) sleep deprivation and patient safety;
      and 2) the lack of data on the relationship between resident sleep deprivation and
      preventable patient injuries. Through the Clinical and Translational Science Award
      (CTSA)-funded Sleep Research Network, the largest and only federally-funded sleep science
      network in the U.S., we propose conducting a multi-center randomized crossover trial in six
      pediatric ICUs staffed by PGY2 and PGY3 residents. We will compare rates of all serious
      errors (i.e., rates of harmful and other serious medical errors due to any cause, including
      but not limited to fatigue-related errors, handoff errors, and provider knowledge deficits)
      of a sleep and circadian science-based (SCS) intervention schedule with a traditional
      schedule that includes frequent shifts of 24 hours or longer. Our specific aims will be:

        1. To test the hypothesis that PGY2&amp;3 residents working on an SCS intervention schedule
           will make significantly fewer harmful medical errors (preventable adverse events) and
           other serious medical errors (near misses) while caring for ICU patients than residents
           working on a traditional schedule; (primary endpoints: resident-related preventable
           adverse events and near misses)

        2. To test the hypothesis that rates of harmful medical errors (preventable adverse
           events) and other serious medical errors (near misses) throughout the ICU (i.e., those
           involving and those not involving residents) will be lower in ICUs when PGY2&amp;3
           residents work on an SCS intervention schedule than when residents work on a
           traditional schedule; (major secondary endpoints: ICU-wide preventable adverse events
           and near misses)

        3. To test the hypothesis that resident physicians' risk of neurobehavioral performance
           failures and motor vehicle crashes - as assessed through simple visual reaction time
           tasks [Johns Drowsiness Score (JDS) and Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT) lapses] - will
           be lower on the SCS intervention schedule than on the traditional schedule. (major
           secondary endpoints: resident neurobehavioral performance and predicted driving safety)
