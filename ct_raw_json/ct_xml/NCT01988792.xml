    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to find out how safely we can add extra nutrients to human milk at
      different feeding volume.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very low birth weight babies (weight less than three pounds and three ounces) are extremely
      fragile and lacking important nutrition due to premature birth. They need enough calories
      for catch-up growth. Giving adequate nutrition is very important for their growth and
      development. Human milk is the best food, however it is not enough to provide all the
      required calories and nutrients for catch up growth and maintain adequate strength of the
      bones (bone mineralization). For premature babies, extra nutrients (human milk fortifier)
      are usually added to the human milk to provide adequate nutrition. These extra nutrients
      will be derived from cow's milk. Currently, a practice of fortifying human milk varies.
      There is no clear information when to start adding extra nutrients to human milk.
