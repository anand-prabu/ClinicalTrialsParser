    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of an enhanced
      mindfulness-based program that includes &quot;mindful exposure&quot; to reduce anxiety and avoidance
      of social situations, and the Buddhist practice of self-compassion aimed at reducing harsh
      judgment and self-criticism that is characteristic of people with social anxiety disorder.

      The purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the feasibility and initial efficacy of an
      enhanced mindfulness-based intervention for SAD (MIND-SAD) that incorporates the following
      components: training in classical mindfulness, including concentration and insight
      (vipassana) meditation; training in self-compassion; and mindful exposure. An exploratory
      aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of the mindfulness intervention on biological
      markers of stress reactivity, including salivary cortisoland salivary alpha-amylase. The
      study is a two-arm, parallel design, prospective study comparing 12 weekly sessions of
      MIND-SAD delivered in a group format versus a wait-list control (WLC).
