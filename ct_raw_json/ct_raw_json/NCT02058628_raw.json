The results of the study will enable a better assessment of the safety\n      and efficacy of the new dose regime (BPO 3% + clindamycin 1%) in comparison to a well\n      established treatment. Based on the data more evidence based recommendations will be\n      possible to improve the treatment of subjects with acne vulgaris. A total of 220 subjects\n      will be enrolled and will have 5 study visits (Day 1, Weeks 2, 4, 8 and 12). The duration of\n      the study will be over 12 weeks."
