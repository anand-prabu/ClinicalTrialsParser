Patients developing such a bacterial pneumonia, has a mortality, duration of\n      mechanical ventilation and length of ICU stay increased. However, the proportion of patients\n      with such bacterial pneumonia, bacterial ecology and morbidity that are little known.\n\n      The aim of this study is to determine the frequency of bacterial pneumonia in patients\n      admitted to the ICU for coma and treated with mechanical ventilation"
