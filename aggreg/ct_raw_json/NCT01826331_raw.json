This study can fill a major\n      knowledge gap in this debate, which is the lack of any population trial that compared the\n      impacts of outcomes- and participation-based incentives in a population of smokers.  This\n      research can help policy makers and health service providers choose the incentives approach\n      that provides the most effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and cost-savings for entire\n      populations of smokers."

Those incentivized for participation in an\n      evidence-based treatment designed for smokers at each stage of change; 2. Those incentivized\n      for biologically validated prolonged abstinence at 6 and 12 months who could also choose to\n      participate in the TTM (Transtheoretical Model)-tailored intervention; and 3. An assessment\n      only control condition.\n\n      The Specific Aims are:\n\n        1. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for participation outperforms the\n           control group at 12, 24 and 36 months as hypothesized;\n\n        2. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for prolonged abstinence at 6 and 12\n           months outperforms the control group at each follow-up as hypothesized;\n\n        3. To assess whether the treatment group incentivized for participation outperforms the\n           treatment group incentivized for outcomes at 36 months as hypothesized.\n\n        4. To compare the cost-effectiveness of each treatment in a population of mostly\n           unmotivated smokers;\n\n      The Secondary Aims are:\n\n        1. To assess the long-term treatment trajectories of each treatment compared to controls\n           with hypothesized increasing trajectory in the participation contingent incentives and\n           decreasing trajectory in the outcome contingent incentives.\n\n        2. To identify mediators of long-term outcomes in each treatment, such as amount of\n           treatment participation, income, severity of smoking, stage of change, self-efficacy,\n           perceived health and intrinsic and extrinsic motivation to quit.\n\n        3. To compare cost-savings of each treatment by modeling all additional costs of smoking\n           for employers and smokers."
