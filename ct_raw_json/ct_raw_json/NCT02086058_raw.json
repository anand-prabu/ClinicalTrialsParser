A secondary aim is to examine how this gene expression profile differs from\n      children with a neurogenic overactive bladder and how the gene expression profile changes\n      from childhood till adulthood. Such new knowledge will result in a more precisely targeted\n      and hence effective treatment of overactive bladder.\n\n      The results will be obtained by retrieving bladder biopsies from children and adults\n      suffering from an overactive bladder or a neurogenic bladder. These biopsies will undergo\n      molecular analysis and the investigators will compare them with biopises from bladder\n      healthy adults and children."
