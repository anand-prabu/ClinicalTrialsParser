Antibody response\n      will also be characterized to a third dose boost of rMenB+OMV NZ administered at\n      approximately 4 years of age in all children who received a two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV\n      NZ as toddlers in study V72P12E1.\n\n      Finally, the safety and immunogenicity of two catch-up doses of rMenB+OMV NZ administered 2\n      months apart to healthy na\u00efve children at 4 years of age will be assessed."
