  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomised observational phase 1 study in 48 healthy volunteers aged 18-50.
      The study is assessing safety and immunogenicity of viral vectored vaccines ChAdOx1 NP+M1
      and MVA NP+M1 in heterologous prime-boost regimens. A crossover design will allow comparison
      of the two vaccines. Volunteers will be divided into 4 groups (n=12 in each group). Groups
      will be recruited simultaneously to control for seasonal changes in influenza. This is
      because at certain times of year there is likely to be a higher naturally acquired T cell
      response to influenza than at other times due to circulating influenza virus in the
      community.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the safety of prime/boost vaccination regimens employing MVA-NP+M1 and ChAdOx1 NP+M1.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 78 weeks post first vaccination.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Safety will be assessed by the nature, frequency, severity, seriousness and duration of adverse events arising during the study combined with analysis of hematology and biochemistry lab tests for abnormalities.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To assess the cellular immune response generated by prime/boost vaccination regimens employing MVA-NP+M1 and ChAdOx1 NP+M1.</measure>
    <time_frame>78 weeks after first vaccination</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The secondary outcomes of peak immune response after first vaccination and peak immune response after second vaccination will be analysed by calculating the area under the curve of the immune response (IFN-γ SFC/ million PBMCs) for each volunteer from baseline to week 78. The mean area under the curve in the 4 groups will then be compared using an analysis of variance, or in the case of skewed data a Kruskal Wallis test. Further pairwise comparisons will be made if a significant difference is found between groups.</description>

             requirements

          -  Willing to allow the investigators to discuss the volunteer's medical history with
             their General Practitioner

          -  For females only, willingness to practice continuous effective contraception during
             the study and a negative pregnancy test on the day(s) of vaccination

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within the three months
             preceding the planned administration of the vaccine candidate

             infection; asplenia; recurrent, severe infections and chronic (more than 14 days)
             immunosuppressant medication within the past 6 months (inhaled/topical steroids are
             allowed)

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine

          -  Any history of anaphylaxis in reaction to vaccination

          -  History of cancer (except basal cell carcinoma and cervical carcinoma in situ)

          -  History of serious psychiatric condition

          -  Any chronic illness requiring on-going or awaiting hospital specialist supervision,
             other than minor surgical procedures and follow up of surgery over 6 months prior to
