Fine-needle aspiration from the breast lesion alone is not sufficient.\n             Incisional biopsy or axillary clearance is not allowed.\n\n        In case of bilateral cancer, the investigator has to decide prospectively which side will\n        be evaluated for the primary endpoint.\n\n          -  Tumor lesion in the breast with a palpable size of 2 cm or a sonographical size of 1\n             cm in maximum diameter. The lesion has to be measurable in two dimensions, preferably\n             by sonography. In case of inflammatory disease, the extent of inflammation can be\n             used as measurable lesion.\n\n          -  Patients must have stage cT1c - cT4a-d disease. Patients with HER2- positive or TNBC\n             are eligible irrespective of nodal status (cN0-cN3). Patients with luminal B-like\n             tumors (defined here as ER and/or PgR >1% stained cells, HER2 negative, Ki-67 >20%)\n             only with histologically (sentinel-node biopsy, core- or fine-needle biopsy) involved\n             lymph nodes (pN1-3).\n\n          -  In patients with multifocal or multicentric breast cancer, the largest lesion should\n             be measured.\n\n          -  Centrally confirmed ER, PR and HER2 status. Central pathology includes also\n             assessment of Ki-67 and LPBC status on core biopsy. ER/PR negative is defined as <=1%\n             stained cells and HER2-positive is defined as  IHC 3+ or in-situ hybridization (ISH)\n             and according to ASCO-CAP guidelines as of 2013). Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded\n             (FFPE) breast tissue from core biopsy has therefore to be sent to the GBG central\n             pathology laboratory prior to randomization.\n\n          -  Age >=18 years.\n\n          -  Karnofsky Performance status index 90%.\n\n          -  Confirmed normal cardiac function by ECG and cardiac ultrasound (LVEF or shortening\n             fraction) within 4 weeks prior to randomization. LVEF must be above 55%.\n\n          -  Negative pregnancy test (urine or serum) within 14 days prior to randomization for\n             all women of childbearing potential.\n\n          -  Complete staging work-up within 3 months prior to randomization.

Chest\n             X-ray (PA and lateral), abdominal ultrasound or CT scan or MRI, and bone scan in case\n             of high risk for primary metastasis. In case of a positive bone scan, bone X-ray or\n             CT scan is mandatory. Other tests may be performed as clinically indicated.\n\n          -  Patients must agree with central pathology testing of core biopsy specimen and final\n             pathology specimen and be available and compliant for treatment and follow-up.\n\n          -  In addition for patients to be randomized to the two supportive anemia treatment\n             arms:\n\n          -  Hemoglobin level <10g/dl.\n\n          -  Body weight \u2265 40 kg.\n\n          -  No need for immediate red blood cell transfusion.\n\n          -  Transferrin saturation (TSAT) \u226420% and serum ferritin <300ng/ml.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with ER- and/or PR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer and Ki- 67 <= 20%\n             (any luminal A-like subtype) or luminal B-like (Ki67>20%) subtype without nodal\n             involvement.\n\n          -  Patients with stages cT1a, cT1b, or any M1.\n\n          -  Patients with pure lobular invasive breast cancer.\n\n          -  Prior chemotherapy for any malignancy.\n\n          -  Prior radiation therapy for breast cancer.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating patients. Patients of childbearing potential must implement\n             adequate non-hormonal contraceptive measures (barrier methods, intrauterine\n             contraceptive devices, sterilization) during study treatment.\n\n          -  Inadequate general condition (not fit for dose-dense, dose-intensified\n             anthracycline-taxane-targeted agents-based chemotherapy).\n\n          -  Previous malignant disease being disease-free for less than 5 years (except CIS of\n             the cervix and non-melanomatous skin cancer).\n\n          -  Known or suspected congestive heart failure (>NYHA I) and / or coronary heart\n             disease, angina pectoris requiring antianginal medication, previous history of\n             myocardial infarction, evidence of transmural infarction on ECG, uncontrolled or\n             poorly controlled arterial hypertension (i.e. BP >140/90 mm Hg under treatment with\n             two antihypertensive drugs), rhythm abnormalities requiring permanent treatment,\n             clinically significant valvular heart disease.\n\n          -  History of significant neurological or psychiatric disorders including psychotic\n             disorders, dementia or seizures that would prohibit the understanding and giving of\n             informed consent.\n\n          -  Pre-existing motor or sensory neuropathy of a severity grade 2 by NCI-CTC criteria v\n             4.0.\n\n          -  Currently active infection.\n\n          -  Incomplete wound healing.\n\n          -  Definite contraindications for the use of corticosteroids.\n\n          -  Known hypersensitivity reaction to one of the compounds or incorporated substances\n             used in this protocol.\n\n          -  Concurrent treatment with:\n\n          -  chronic corticosteroids unless initiated > 6 months prior to study entry and at low\n             dose (10 mg or less methylprednisolone or equivalent).\n\n          -  sex hormones.
