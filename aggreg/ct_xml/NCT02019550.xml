    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 4, prospective, open-label, randomized, cross-over, multicenter trial to
      evaluate ease-of-use with Rebif® Rebidose® and Rebiject II® autoinjectors in subjects with
      relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). Subjects will participate in the study for up
      to 10 weeks (including screening and treatment periods). The treatment period will last 8
      weeks and include 12 self-injections using the Rebif® Rebidose® device and 12
      self-injections using the Rebiject II® device.
