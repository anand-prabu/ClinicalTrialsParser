Determine the immune response of\n      patients treated with this vaccine. III. Determine the clinical response of patients treated\n      with this vaccine.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is dose-escalation, multicenter study. Patients receive Synchrotope TA2M\n      plasmid DNA vaccine intranodally continuously over 96 hours beginning on days 0, 14, 28, and\n      42. Treatment continues for up to 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 8 patients receive escalating doses of Synchrotope TA2M\n      plasmid DNA vaccine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose at which no more than 2 of 8 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
