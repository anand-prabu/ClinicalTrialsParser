  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, double-dummy, double-blind, randomized, active-controlled, parallel
      group phase 3 clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of KALOMIN™ Tab. in
      patients with acute bronchitis.

      The aim of this clinical trial is to demonstrate that KALOMIN™ Tab. is clinically
      non-inferior to Umckamin syrup, as assessed by BSS(Bronchitis Severity Score), in the
      treatment of acute bronchitis after 7 days.
