      1. Abstract

      There is an urgent need for a noninvasive method to diagnose bronchial infections and
      exacerbations in patients with Cystic Fibrosis (CF). The current method to diagnosed
      infections involves either collecting a sputum sample or obtaining a bronchoalveolar lavage
      (BAL). However, some patients cannot produce sputum. At the same time the decision of when a
      patient has an exacerbation continues to be very subjective. In this exploratory study, we
      propose a new, noninvasive method to diagnose bronchial infections and to evaluate possible
      markers of inflammation that can assist in a noninvasive way in the determination of
      exacerbations. We hypothesize that it is possible to recover microbial products causing
      infections in Exhaled Breath Condensate (EBC) samples as well as to measure markers of
      inflammation like Interleukin (IL)-8, LTB4, IL-6, IL-1B, Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha, as
      well as proteases like neutrophil elastase, matrix metalloproteinase 2 and 9 and
      antiproteases like secretory leukoprotease inhibitor (SLPI), alpha one antitrypsin and
      tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). As a way to compare our findings to
      systemic inflammation we will also measure C-reactive protein in serum.

      20 patients with cystic fibrosis who have chronic bronchial infection and 20 controls will
      be recruited. Their exhaled breath condensate and sputum samples will be collected and
      analyzed for the presence of bacteria through traditional, molecular and nuclear acid
      amplification methods as well as Pyrosequencing analysis. We will also measure the above
      markers of inflammation and follow the CF patients for the following year so we can continue
      to collect exhaled breath condensate when they have an exacerbation and are admitted to the
      hospital as well as after treatment for the exacerbation. We will correlate these markers
      with patient's clinical features including pulmonary function test, Body max index, CF
      pathogens, and CF genotype. If our hypothesis turns out to be true it will open up a
      possibility for a new noninvasive diagnostic and follow up method that will benefit cystic
      fibrosis patients.

      2.  Hypothesis &amp; Specific Aims:

      A.  Microbial products can be recovered from exhaled breath condensate. B.  That these
      microbial products recovered from exhaled breath correlate with that recovered from sputum
      C.  Markers of inflammation can be recovered from exhale breath condensate.
