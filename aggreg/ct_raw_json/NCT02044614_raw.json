To assess the feasibility and safety of applying a 12-week course of adjuvant\n           low-frequency icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis to an ongoing regimen of\n           thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis.\n\n           Hypothesis: Icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis can be safely and feasibly implemented\n           in the context of ongoing thrice-weekly in-center hemodialysis.\n\n        2. To measure the effects of a 12-week course of adjuvant low-frequency icodextrin-based\n           peritoneal dialysis to ongoing thrice-weekly maintenance hemodialysis on:\n           inter-hemodialytic weight gain, achievable hemodialytic dry weight, total body water,\n           ambulatory blood pressure, serum phosphorus, and pre-to-post hemodialysis changes in\n           serum potassium and pH, and Kidney Disease Quality of Life-SF physical functioning,\n           energy fatigue, and general health scores.\n\n      Hypotheses: Addition of adjuvant icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis will:\n\n        1. reduce inter-hemodialytic weight gain*\n\n        2. enable achievement of lower hemodialytic dry weight\n\n        3. reduce total body water\n\n        4. improve ambulatory blood pressure control\n\n        5. reduce serum phosphorus\n\n        6. minimize per-hemodialytic changes in serum potassium and pH\n\n        7. have favorable effects on indices of physical function and global health\n\n             -  Indicates co-primary outcomes."
