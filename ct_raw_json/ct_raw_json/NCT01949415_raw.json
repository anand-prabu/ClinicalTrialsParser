            "textblock": "House Dust Mites (HDM) are arachnids that infest bedding, carpet, upholstered furniture and\n      fabric. Like many other allergens, exposure to HDMA in sensitised patients is associated\n      with poorer lung function, greater medication requirements and more asthma symptoms as well\n      as chronic rhinosinusitis symptoms. In contrast to other allergens, there is evidence that\n      HDMA leads to the development of asthma, in addition to exacerbating pre-existing asthma in\n      HDM-sensitised patients.\n\n      ToleroMune House Dust Mite (TM-HDM) is being developed for the treatment of HDM allergy.\n\n      Study TH002 evaluated the efficacy, safety and tolerability of TM-HDM. This study will\n      identify cellular, proteomic or genetic biomarkers of efficacy to TM-HDM treatment in TH002\n      study participants"
