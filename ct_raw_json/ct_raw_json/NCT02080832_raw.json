The regression coefficient of TES on pretreatment mean BOLD\n      activation on the Go-Nogo task will be significantly greater for the citalopram group than\n      the placebo group.\n\n      Aim 2: To determine whether pretreatment brain activation on fMRI while performing an\n      attentional bias (cocaine Stroop) task predicts response to pharmacotherapy in cocaine\n      dependent subjects.\n\n      Hypothesis related to Aim 2:\n\n      Pretreatment fMRI BOLD activation in cocaine dependent subjects during cocaine related words\n      on the cocaine Stroop task predicts 8-week outcome from medication known to enhance\n      serotonin function (citalopram). The regression coefficient of TES on pretreatment mean BOLD\n      activation from the cocaine Stroop task will be significantly greater for the citalopram\n      group than the placebo group.\n\n      Aim 3: (Exploratory): To determine whether structural deficits in white matter as measured\n      by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) predict poor response to pharmacotherapy in cocaine\n      dependent subjects.\n\n      Hypothesis related to Aim 3:\n\n      Lower pretreatment FA and higher radial diffusivity in anterior white matter regions\n      including the anterior corpus callosum and fronto-parietal superior longitudinal fasciculus\n      are associated with poorer 8-week outcome to pharmacotherapy.\n\n      Other Exploratory Aims:\n\n      4. To compare urine benzoylecgonine results and retention between cocaine dependent subjects\n      treated with citalopram and cocaine dependent subjects treated with placebo.\n\n      5. To evaluate changes in behavioral laboratory measures of impulsivity as potential\n      mediators of treatment response.\n\n      6. To explore genetic and plasma biomarkers as potential predictors of treatment response."
