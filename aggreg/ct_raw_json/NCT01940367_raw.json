A 34 gauge needle (equivalent to an acupuncture needle) is inserted percutaneously approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus of the right or left ankle (subject choice) at a 60 degree angle.  A surface electrode is placed on the medial aspect of the ipsilateral calcaneous.  The needle and electrode are connected to a low voltage (9 V) electrical stimulator (Urgent PC).  Stimulation current with a fixed frequency of 20 Hz and a pulse width of 200 msec is increased until flexion of the big toe or fanning of all toes becomes visible, or until the subject reports a tingling sensation across the heel or bottom of the foot.  The current is then set to the highest level tolerable to the subject (0-10 mA) and the subject undergoes therapy for 30 minutes.",
