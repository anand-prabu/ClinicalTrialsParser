Among then, adenosine, a\n      strong endogenous vasodilating agent has been involved in cardiac surgery-induced atrial\n      fibrillation, via A2A receptors modulation.\n\n      The effects of caffeine on the inducibility of atrial fibrillation are actually well-known,\n      leading then to a significant reduction of atrial fibrillation. Moreover, a recent clinical\n      study has demonstrated that coffee drinking was inversely associated with total and\n      cause-specific mortality.\n\n      The investigators therefore examined the preventive effects of oral caffeine on valvular\n      surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass-induced atrial fibrillation. The investigators also\n      evaluated prospectively the influence of caffeine on adenosine plasma levels and A2A\n      adenosine receptors modulation."
