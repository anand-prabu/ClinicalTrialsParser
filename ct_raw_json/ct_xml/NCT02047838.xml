  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This retrospective case-control study was performed in an Academic centre for the diagnosis
      and treatment of endometriosis. It included patients with recurrent unilateral endometriomas
      who were previously operated for the same condition (cases) and patients without recurrency
      who previously underwent surgery for unilateral endometrioma (controls). The primary outcome
      of the study was to assess the impact on ovarian reserve of second surgery for recurrent
      unilateral endometriomas. The evaluation of ovarian reserve was performed by assessing serum
      AMH level, serum FSH level, 17-beta estradiol level and antral follicle count.

        In this study were recruited women referred to an academic centre for the diagnosis and
        treatment of endometriosis.

        Cases were patients undergoing second surgery for recurrent unilateral endometrioma.

        Controls were patients previously operated for unilateral endometrioma.
