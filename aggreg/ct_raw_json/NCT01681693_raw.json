To assess the\n      effects of these variants on metformin response, the investigators will measure metformin\n      renal clearance (pharmacokinetics of metformin), and plasma glucose and insulin levels\n      (pharmacodynamic response) in healthy and diabetic patients who carry either the reference\n      or variant alleles."
