Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy and chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may be an effective treatment for metastatic prostate cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus\n      chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      metastatic prostate cancer that has not responded to hormone therapy."

Patients are assigned to one of four cohorts.\n\n      After the first occurrence of hematologic dose-limiting toxicity in a patient, all\n      subsequent patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 4 days prior to\n      undergoing apheresis and continuing until 6 million CD34+ cells/kg are collected. After 2\n      patients in a cohort group experience hematologic dose-limiting toxicity, subsequent\n      patients undergo autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation.\n\n        -  Cohort I: Patients receive unlabeled monoclonal antibody (MOAB) m170 IV over 5 minutes\n           followed by a tracer dose of indium In 111 monoclonal antibody m170 (In111 MOAB m170)\n           IV over 5-10 minutes on day 0 and unlabeled MOAB m170 IV followed by Y90 MOAB m170 IV\n           on day 7. Patients also receive oral cyclosporine every 12 hours on days -3 to 25.\n           Patients may undergo autologous PBSC transplantation on day 21 and receive G-CSF SC\n           daily beginning on day 21 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Cohort II: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I. Patients also receive paclitaxel\n           IV over 3 hours on day 9.\n\n        -  Cohort III and IV: Patients receive treatment as in cohort I without In111 MOAB m170.\n           Patients also receive paclitaxel as in cohort II.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB m170 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6\n      months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 36\n      months."
