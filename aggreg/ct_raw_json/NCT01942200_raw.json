This\n      includes provision of appropriate packaging sizes to decrease the excess quantity to be\n      discarded, and thus also follows this objective.\n\n      Secondary objective is the assessment of the side effects of Oxaliplatin onkovis. To this\n      end, data regarding co-medication and adverse events are also collected."
