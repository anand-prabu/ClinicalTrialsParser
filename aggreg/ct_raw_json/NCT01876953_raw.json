Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      cytarabine and idarubicin, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either\n      by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving dasatinib together with\n      cytarabine and idarubicin may be an effective treatment for acute myeloid leukemia."
