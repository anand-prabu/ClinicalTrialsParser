This has yet to be studied in a randomized controlled fashion or\n      in a conservative venue. For this study, there will be two groups of patients with low back\n      pain (by randomization). For inclusion into the randomized clinical trial, patients will\n      need to be 18 years of age or older with mechanically producible LBP. They will require a\n      minimum Modified Oswestry Disability Index score of 20% and a baseline pain score of >2.0/10\n      on the numeric analog scale for pain, and a within session change (improvement during the\n      visit) in pain and/or range of motion during the assessment phase of the clinical\n      examination. This finding has been advocated as an effective mechanism to determine if a\n      patient is a candidate for manual therapy. Exclusion criteria will include the presence of\n      any red flags (i.e., tumor, metabolic diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis,\n      prolonged history of steroid use, etc.), or signs consistent with nerve root compression\n      (reproduction of low back or leg pain with straight leg raise at less than 45\u00b0, muscle\n      weakness involving a major muscle group of the lower extremity, diminished lower extremity\n      muscle stretch reflex, or diminished or absent sensation to pinprick in any lower extremity\n      dermatome). Other exclusion criteria include prior surgery to the lumbar spine and current\n      pregnancy. Lastly, if patients are enrolled in the study but do not receive a second outcome\n      measure (follow up visit) they will be excluded from the final analyses. Both groups will\n      receive a pragmatic treatment approach by physical therapists for low back pain. One group\n      will also receive a prescriptive treatment approach for both hips. The investigators will\n      track the outcomes of disability (Oswestry), Pain (Numeric pain rating scale), and recovery\n      at baseline, 2 weeks, discharge, and 6 months. Our aims are to determine if differences in\n      groups exist, with our primary outcome measure of ODI. The investigators feel that the\n      additional of a standardized exercise program and stretching for the hips will improve\n      outcomes in patients with mechanical low back pain."

None have defined recovery in terms of a patient's perspective of recovery such as the patient acceptable symptom state (PASS) score. The PASS is the state beyond which patients consider their state as acceptable and are unlikely to seek further treatment.31 Thus, therapeutic success can be defined at the individual level (i.e., for each patient) as an improvement greater than minimum clinically acceptable score, or as achieving a state acceptable at the end of the care.31 For our study, recovery is defined as a \"yes\" (patients consider their state as acceptable) on the PASS at discharge.",
