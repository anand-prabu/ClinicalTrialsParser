            "textblock": "VX-509 is an oral, selective Janus kinase 3 (JAK3) inhibitor being developed by Vertex. In\n      autoimmune diseases, JAK3 is an essential component of the immune signaling cascade. This\n      cascade ultimately contributes to abnormal immune response that results in chronic\n      inflammation and, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irreversible damage to cartilage\n      and bones. Selective inhibition of JAK3 offers a new disease modifying approach to the\n      treatment of RA.\n\n      This study will follow a \"treat to target\" (T2T) paradigm. T2T strategies have been followed\n      in non-rheumatologic fields for decades. T2T trials have been conducted for RA from the late\n      1990's, and have substantiated the concept that treating to a target is associated with a\n      better outcome than standard of care treatment. This has led to recommendations by experts\n      to use T2T strategies in clinical practice."
