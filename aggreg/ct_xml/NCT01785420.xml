      Background Information and Rationale:

      Trastuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts extracellularly on the erbB-2
      receptor.Trastuzumab is a recombinant humanized IgG1 monoclonal antibody against the human
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/erbB-2),which has shown in both in vitro assays and
      in animals, to inhibit the proliferation of human tumour cells that overexpress erbB-2.
      Additionally, trastuzumab is a potent mediator of antibody-dependent cell-mediated
      cytotoxicity (ADCC). In vitro, trastuzumab-mediated ADCC has been shown to be preferentially
      exerted on erbB-2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with cancer cells that do not
      overexpress erbB-2.  Trastuzumab has emerged as a widely accepted standard of care for
      erbB-2-positive disease. (Metastatic/ adjuvant/neoadjuvant.

      Our current hypothesis suggests that the cells which are disseminated at the time of surgery
      will encounter an inhospitable environment which will be anti-HER in nature. Therefore
      combining the above mentioned streams of thought, we would like to assess the effect of a
      short pre-operative course of Trastuzumab on breast cancer relapse. The study is proposed in
      HER2 positive patients with operable breast cancer.

      Objectives :

      Primary:

      The primary objective of the study is to see the effect of short duration of peri-operative
      Trastuzumab on disease-free survival in comparison in all patients

      Secondary:

      The safety of the pre-operative therapies including the early post operative morbidity

        1. Overall survival (OS) in all patients and in pathologically node positive patients.

        2. The level of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood assessed before
           starting pre-operative therapy and at the same time point in the control arm, level of
           CTCs 10 minutes prior to start of surgery, during surgery and 10 days after surgery on
           40 consecutive consenting patients (20 in each arm). The levels of circulating
           chromatin will also be estimated at the same time points as CTC for these 40 patients.

        3. Evaluation of the paraffin blocks for pTEN loss6-8 and p95ErbB2 truncated form of HER2
           on 100 consecutive consenting patients (50 in each arm).9-11

      Study Design :

      This is phase 3, randomized Double blinded parallel group study of Trastuzumab in pre
      operative setting in operable breast cancer patients.

      Approximately 1000 patients with Women with HER2neu positive, T1/T2/T3 and N0/N1. clinical
      T4 and/or N2 disease who are considered operable by the treating surgeon with
      histopathological diagnosis on core biopsies, will be included in the study. Patients with
      T4 or N2 (locally advanced and large operable for neo-adjuvant chemotherapy) will not be
      included. All node positive patients will receive single injection of Depot Inj.
      Progesterone 500 mg deep IM 4 -14 days prior to surgery

      Patients will be stratified, before randomization for Tumor size, menopausal status, and
      affordability for Trastuzumab and centre of the study. These patients will then be
      randomized 1:1 to receive the following

      Intervention arm: .A single dose of Trastuzumab (Herceptin, Hoffman La Roche) at 8 mg/Kg as
      a 90 minute intravenous infusion in 250 ml of normal saline, in the window period of 10-15 4
      to 14 days (both days inclusive) prior to the planned date of surgery.

      Control arm: A 90 minute intravenous infusion of saline as placebo

      All patients will thereafter receive standard post-operative adjuvant therapy as per local
      institutional practice including hormonal therapy, chemotherapy and radiation therapy.
