On the day following each vaccination, a single 40 mg dose of\n      the activating agent, AP1903, will be administered via intravenous (IV) infusion over 2\n      hours."

Prior radiopharmaceuticals (strontium,\n             samarium) must be completed \u2265 8 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n          9.

Diagnosis of prostate cancer with neuroendocrine differentiation\n\n          7. Known presence of central nervous system metastases, pleural effusions or ascites\n\n          8. Medical or psychiatric illness that would, in the opinion of the investigator,\n             preclude participation in the study or the ability of patients to provide informed\n             consent for themselves.\n\n          9. Cardiovascular disease that meets one of the following: congestive heart failure (New\n             York Heart Association Class III or IV), active angina pectoris, or recent myocardial\n             infarction (within the last 6 months).\n\n         10. Concurrent or prior malignancy except for the following:\n\n               -  Adequately treated basal or squamous cell skin cancer\n\n               -  Adequately treated stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in\n                  complete remission\n\n               -  Any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 5 years\n\n         11.

Prisoners or subjects who are compulsorily detained (involuntarily incarcerated) for\n             treatment of either a psychiatric or medical (e.g. infectious) illness.\n\n         13. Any underlying medical or psychiatric condition, which in the opinion of the\n             investigator will make the administration of BPX-201 and AP1903 hazardous or obscure\n             the interpretation of AEs, such as a condition associated with frequent diarrhea.\n\n         14. Any non-oncology vaccine therapy used for prevention of infectious diseases for up to\n             1 month before BPX-201"
