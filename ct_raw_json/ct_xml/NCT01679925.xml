  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GnRH agonists are used in the treatment of precocious puberty in order to improve adult
      height.However,the psychosocial impact of precocious puberty is often used by the clinician
      at diagnosis to justify treatment, but can not yet be properly assessed. It can not be
      considered as a rational neither for the indication to treatment, nor to assess its
      potential efficacy.

      The overall objective of this work is to improve the conditions leading to the therapeutic
      decision and the procedures for monitoring girls with idiopathic central precocious puberty.

      During the day hospital, the diagnostic workup for precocious puberty will be performed and
      include:

        -  A clinical examination with pubertal stage assessment.

        -  A GnRH test

        -  A Pelvic ultrasound

        -  An MRI will be performed later after the results of GnRH test confirming precocious
           central puberty.

      These reviews are conducted as part of usual care and are required to validate the inclusion
      criteria of patients.

      The CBCL questionnaire will be completed by patient's parents and the first semi-structured
      interview will be conducted by a sociologist assisted by the  psychologist, dedicated to the
      study.

      Patient's follow-up will be planned 6 months after inclusion, including similar
      investigations (except MRI).
