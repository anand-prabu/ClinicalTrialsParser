The procedure is commonly performed under\n      light sedation and local anesthesia.  Bupivicaine, a long acting local anesthetic, has been\n      used to allow extended pain relief for 8-10 hours after carpal tunnel release.  Exparel, a\n      liposomal bupivicaine formulation, has been documented to provide pain relief for up to 72\n      hours post-operatively.  By decreasing post-operative pain through the use of a long-acting\n      local anesthetic, the use of narcotic pain medications may be decreased and patient\n      satisfaction scores may increase.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to prospectively compare bupivicaine and liposomal bupivicaine\n      with respect to post-operative pain control, narcotic usage, and patient satisfaction after\n      carpal tunnel release."
