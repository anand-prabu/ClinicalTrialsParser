Our hypothesis here is that we\n      can improves the therapeutic effects of the virtual exposure by giving control to acrophobic\n      patients during their exposure."

During\n      the study, several groups of patients will be distributed according to different conditions:\n      simple exposure to virtual environment, exposure to anxiogenous virtual environments and\n      exposure with the ability to control and secure the anxiogenous virtual environments.\n\n      The interest of this project is to improve therapy by exposure to virtual reality. Our\n      project offers a systematic therapeutic approach (using virtual reality and the concept of\n      control) where current therapy are too often approximate. We aim to demonstrate the\n      effectiveness of the control of virtual environments on symptomatic and psychophysiological\n      levels, to evaluate the adoption of these methods in the couple patients-caregivers and also\n      to understand the brain mechanisms (including those prefrontal) involved in this therapy."
