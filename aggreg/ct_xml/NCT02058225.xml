  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the effect of infant nutrition on brain development, as measured
      using Magnetic Resonance (MR) techniques.   The investigators  will collect detailed
      information about the diet of each of the infants, and seek to correlate this information
      with multiple MR measurements, including structural imaging, diffusion imaging, and
      functional connectivity. The MR scans will be performed at birth and 3 months of age.
      Dietary information collected will include detailed food diaries describing the feeding
      habits of the infants, and food frequency questionnaires to characterize the diet of the
      mother.
