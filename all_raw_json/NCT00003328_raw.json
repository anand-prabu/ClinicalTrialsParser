Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether radiation therapy followed by porfiromycin is more\n      effective than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with head and neck cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of\n      radiation therapy followed by porfiromycin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV\n      head and neck cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the time to tumor progression in patients with stage III or IV\n      (without distant metastases) head and neck cancer treated with porfiromycin as adjuvant\n      therapy to radiotherapy. II. Determine percentage of patients with locoregional tumor\n      recurrence up to 2 years posttreatment. III. Determine response rate, disease free survival\n      time, and overall survival time in these patients. IV. Evaluate the safety and tolerance of\n      porfiromycin in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are stratified according to primary tumor site (oral vs pharynx vs larynx) and disease stage\n      (both T and N stage: T1-2 vs T3-4 and N0 vs N1-2 vs N3). All patients are randomized to\n      receive either porfiromycin (arm I) or placebo (arm II) as adjuvant therapy to radiation\n      therapy. Both arms follow the same treatment schedule. Daily radiation therapy commences on\n      day 1. Patients receive porfiromycin or placebo by intravenous infusion over 30-60 minutes\n      on day 5 and then on day 46 or 47. Porfiromycin or placebo is administered 30 minutes to 2\n      hours following radiation therapy. All patients with N3 neck disease (metastases in a lymph\n      node more than 6 cm in greatest dimension) undergo a planned neck dissection following\n      external beam radiation at 4 to 12 weeks following therapy. This surgery is not needed for\n      patients with N3 neck disease who do not have residual disease following radiotherapy.\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, then every 2 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months\n      for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 550-600 patients will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
