Unfortunately, our best defense against post-operative nausea and vomiting,\n      a medicine called ondansetron (Zofran), is in dire national shortage.  Consequently,\n      non-pharmacological methods of prevention and treatment for post-operative nausea and\n      vomiting have increased import.  Following emergence from general anesthesia, children often\n      request food and drink.  There have been no studies to date that definitively determine the\n      optimal first food or drink choice for these children.  This study proposes to randomize\n      children to either water or juice first intake following surgery.  The investigators expect\n      to find that children who consume glucose are less likely to vomit than those who first\n      receive water."
