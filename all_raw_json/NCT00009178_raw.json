            "textblock": "Bulimia Nervosa is a frequent problem for young women. It is widely assumed that this\n      disorder cannot be treated effectively in a primary care setting.  This assumption has never\n      been tested empirically, and is probably incorrect.\n\n      In the last 15 years, effective treatment interventions for Bulimia Nervosa have been\n      developed and validated in specialized treatment centers.  The broad aim of this proposal is\n      to examine whether these treatments, suitably adapted, can be usefully transferred to\n      general health care settings.  Specifically, the proposed study will determine the relative\n      and combined effectiveness of the two leading treatments for Bulimia Nervosa in a primary\n      care setting.  The two major interventions are treatment with an antidepressant medication,\n      fluoxetine, and with a form of cognitive behavioral therapy, guided self-help, designed for\n      use in primary care."
