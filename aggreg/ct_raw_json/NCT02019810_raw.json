Low cerebral blood flow is responsible for secondary lesions, leading\n      to bad prognosis. It is not yet established whether increasing cardiac output in these\n      patients can lead to an increase in cerebral blood flow, although there are some arguments\n      in favor of this hypothesis. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that increasing cardiac\n      output will improve cerebral blood flow in patients with severe traumatic injury and high\n      cerebral pressure."
