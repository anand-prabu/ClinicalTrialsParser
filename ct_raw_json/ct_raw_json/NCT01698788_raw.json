            "textblock": "This study is undertaken to determine effect of sustained release dexamethasone\n      implant,Ozurdex in improving outcome of taut posterior hyaloid removal in patients with\n      diabetic macular edema\n\n      Diabetic macular edema constitute important cause of visual impairment in patients with\n      diabetes.Focal/ grid laser photocoagulation is the standard of care in the management\n      .Several adjuncts including intravitreal corticosteroids, Pegaptanib Sodium , Ranibizumab ,\n      Bevacizumab are also been tried.In some patients inspite of multiple lasers or injections\n      macular edema persists as a consequence overlying taut posterior hyaloid membrane which\n      needs to be removed by vitrectomy. The exact role of vitreous in the pathogenesis of\n      diabetic maculopathy remains unclear although it  has been implicated as a cause of macular\n      edema via several mechanical and physiologic mechanisms, which  include the following  (1)\n      destabilization of the vitreous by abnormal glycation and crosslinking of vitreal collagen,\n      leading to traction on the macula, (2) accumulation and concentration of factors causing\n      vasopermeability in the premacular vitreous gel and (3) accumulation of chemoattractant\n      factors in the vitreous, leading to cellular migration to the posterior hyaloid, contraction\n      and macular traction. The observation that release of mechanical traction on the macula with\n      subsequent reduction in DME, either by spontaneous posterior vitreous detachment  or  with\n      vitrectomy, lends support to this line of reasoning.  Furthermore, the evidence that\n      vitrectomy produces improved retinal oxygenation taken together with the evidence that\n      increased oxygenation can reduce DME, suggests an additional physiologic advantage but\n      determination of which eyes might benefit from vitrectomy is the most challenging aspect in\n      the treatment of this condition. Fluorescein angiography, B-scan ultrasonography, and\n      optical coherence tomography may be helpful in this regard. Most often, vitreous surgery is\n      performed when diabetic macular edema persists despite multiple laser treatments. All\n      reports published to date regarding vitrectomy for diabetic macular edema are uncontrolled\n      and nonrandomized patient series. Visual improvement after vitrectomy is related to the\n      duration of edema, as well as the extent of intraretinal lipid and vascular\n      nonperfusion.Even after surgery some patients might need repeat intravitreal bevacizumab or\n      triamcinolone injections to take care of residual macular edema.Intravitreal Triamcinolone\n      Acetonide (TA), a water insoluble steroid, has been shown to reduce the retinal thickness\n      and improve the visual acuity.
