Autosomal dominant Hyper IgE syndrome (AD-HIES; Job's\n      syndrome) is caused by STAT3 mutations, and is a multisystem disorder with skeletal,\n      vascular, and connective tissue manifestations. Understanding how STAT3 mutations cause\n      these diverse clinical manifestations is critical to our complete understanding of bone\n      metabolism, bronchiectasis, dental maturation, and atherosclerosis. Mutations in DOCK8 cause\n      many cases of autosomalrecessive Hyper IgE syndrome. These individuals suffer from extensive\n      viral infections as well as have a high incidence of malignancy and mortality. The\n      pathogenesis of this disease is being investigated. Therefore, we seek to enroll patients\n      and families with a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of HIES syndrome for extensive\n      phenotypic and genotypic study as well as disease management. Patients will be carefully\n      examined by a multidisciplinary team and followed longitudinally. Through these studies we\n      hope to better characterize the clinical presentation of HIES and to be able to identify\n      further genetic etiologies, as well as understand the pathogenesis of HIES. We seek to\n      enroll 200 patients and 300 relatives."

This includes patients with: 1) creatinine value of greater than 1.3\n        mg/dl, 2) history of multiple myeloma, 3) use of metformin-containing products less than\n        24 hours prior to contrast media, and 4) history of significant allergic reaction to CT\n        contrast agents despite the use of premedication."
