            "textblock": "This fracture of the distal tibia occurs in 1 to 4 year-old-children. The child usually\n      presents with an acute onset of limp or refusal to bear weight on one leg. Toddlers and\n      young children may present with guarding, but may not have swelling or noticeable deformity.\n\n      Radiologic signs can be subtle too. In some cases initial radiographs is negative and\n      fractures are diagnosed on follow-up studies by periosteal reaction.\n\n      However, timely diagnosis is important, because it obviates the need for investigations to\n      archive adequate treatment as well as to prevent unnecessary immobilization. The value of\n      sonographic diagnosis of toddler's fracture has been demonstrated. In children it is of\n      particular value as it is comfortable and does not involve the use of ionizing radiation.\n\n      The aim of the present study is to investigate the reliability and accuracy of sonography in\n      the diagnostic workup of the toddler's fracture."
