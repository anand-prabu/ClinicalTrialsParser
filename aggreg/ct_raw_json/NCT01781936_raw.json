The study drug, Fluocinolone Acetonide, is currently used in a surgical\n      implant, Retisert, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat\n      non-infectious posterior uveitis . The study drug is able to be inserted in an ophthalmology\n      (eye)clinic whereas Retisert must be surgically implanted in the Operating Room. Two doses\n      of fluocinolone acetonide will be used in this study to determine if either strength of\n      fluocinolone acetonide can effectively treat uveitis and if so, which strength works better.\n      Or, it is possible that both strengths may work about the same but one strength may have\n      fewer side effects."
