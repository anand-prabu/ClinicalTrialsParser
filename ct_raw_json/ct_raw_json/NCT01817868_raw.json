Patients will be enrolled preferably on a 1:1 basis with regards to\n      prophylaxis and on-demand treatment.\n\n      The patient enrollment period will be 2 years with a follow-up (observation period) of 2\n      years for each patient. Based on the primary effectiveness parameters (joint bleeds and\n      overall bleeds per year) an observation period of 2 years is considered sufficient although\n      it has to be admitted that it is rather short to assess the progression of orthopedic\n      status. Previously treated prophylaxis patients with at least 50 exposure days and patients\n      with continuing prophylaxis treatment will be included."
