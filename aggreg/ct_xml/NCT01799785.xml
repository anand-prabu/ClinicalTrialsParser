  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cirrhosis is associated with a reduction in muscle mass and exercise capacity.  This has an
      impact or morbidity and mortality.  Regular aerobic exercise training is a proven effective
      therapy to improve exercise capacity in healthy and clinical populations.  the effect of
      this training has not yet been evaluated in cirrhosis.  The safety of this intervention also
      requires further study.  Using a randomized controlled design, the investigators aim to
      conduct a pilot study evaluating the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of aerobic exercise
      training on aerobic capacity.
