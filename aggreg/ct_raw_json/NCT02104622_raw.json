            "textblock": "Many people with spinal cord injury are no longer able to walk and must use wheelchairs for\n      mobility. These individuals experience greater rates of depression and lower quality of\n      life. Many of these individuals express a strong desire to walk again, and report many\n      psychosocial benefits to being eye to eye with peers in social interactions. Additionally,\n      wheelchairs allow only limited community access, creating an additional obstacle to seeking\n      out meaningful social roles in the community. Currently, there is new technology called\n      robotic exoskeletons that would allow people with spinal cord injury to walk. These robotic\n      exoskeletons also allow for curb, ramp, and stair negotiation, which are critical to\n      community access. Current research has examined training with robotic exoskeletons indoors\n      over level surfaces in clinical settings. This study will examine the potential for everyday\n      use, including ramps, stairs, curbs and indoor and outdoor use."
