At baseline GSRS and PGWBI will be analyzed in persons with screen detected and biopsy\n           verified coeliac disease and compared with a group of healthy control persons from the\n           health-survey cohort.\n\n        2. In a prospective study of the persons with screen detected coeliac disease, health\n           status (GSRS) and Quality of Life will be compared before and after one year on a\n           gluten free diet."
