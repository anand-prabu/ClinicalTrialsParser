  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent therapeutic strategy following renal transplantation includes simultaneous use of
      reduced calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) dosing and maximized use of a non-nephrotoxic,
      antiproliferative drug (inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) or TOR inhibitor), with
      the goals of reducing/avoiding CNI nephrotoxicity, the incidence of acute rejection, and
      chronic allograft injury (CAI) (i.e., interstitial fibrosis/tubular atrophy), leading to
      more favorable longer-term patient and graft survival.1-7  Early corticosteroid withdrawal
      has also been used in the attempt to avoid well-known side effects while maintaining
      favorable patient and graft survival.8-10 While the investigators center and numerous other
      centers have also included single agent, antibody induction utilizing the lymphodepleting
      polyclonal antibody rabbit anti-human thymocyte globulin (ATG), nondepleting human
      anti-interleukin-2 receptor (CD25) monoclonal antibody daclizumab (Dac) or basiliximab, or
      lymphodepleting humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody alemtuzumab,11-17 evidence now
      suggests that an even more effective induction strategy may include the combined use of more
      than one induction agent (each with fewer doses than if used alone), with the goal of
      bringing the kidney transplant recipient even closer (through more effectively timed
      lymphodepletion) to an optimally immunosuppressed state, allowing further reduction in
      long-term maintenance drug dosing.18-25 The investigators have now successfully used dual
      ATG/Dac induction therapy in both kidney-alone23-24 and simultaneous kidney-pancreas (SPK)
      transplantation,18-20 and a recent report from the investigators center of kidney-alone and
      SPK recipients shows that the addition of anti-CD25 to ATG for induction therapy more
      effectively delays the return of peripheral blood CD25+ cells.25  In the kidney-alone
      recipient study 3 doses of ATG were combined with 2 doses of Dac for induction,23-24 vs. the
      investigators previous studies utilizing single agent induction with 7 doses of ATG or 5
      doses of Dac.4,16,17  Successful combination of ATG/basiliximab as dual induction in kidney
      transplantation has also been reported elsewhere,21-22 along with equivalency in clinical
      outcomes using daclizumab vs. basiliximab.13

      A.  Primary Objectives:

        1. The percentage of patients who develop chronic allograft injury (CAI) progression
           during the first 12 months post-transplant protocol biopsy (i.e., higher grade of IF/TA
           at either the 6 or 12 month protocol biopsy in comparison with the baseline biopsy).

        2. The incidence rate of biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR) during the first 12 months
           post-transplant.

      B.  Secondary Objectives:

        1. Adverse events including graft loss (death-censored and death-uncensored), and death at
           12 months post-transplant.

        2. Incidence rate and severity (severity of CAI at 12 months as well), based upon careful
           review of all clinically indicated and protocol biopsies.

        3. Renal function as determined by serum creatinine and estimated glomerular filtration
           rate (eGFR) (calculated using the abbreviated MDRD formula) at 12, months
           post-transplant.  Use of multivariable analysis to compare renal function as well as
           BPAR and CAI progression will also be performed (particularly, after adjusting for the
           significant effects of donor age, recipient age, race/ethnicity, and any other
           predictors).

      5.  Adverse events including withholding (for â‰¥ 28 days) or discontinuance of study
      medications (and reasons why), new onset diabetes mellitus after transplantation (NODAT),
      infections requiring hospitalization, and requirement of anti-lipid medication at 12 months
      post-transplant.

      6.  Avoidance of the requirement for maintenance corticosteroid therapy after renal
      transplantation.

      7.   Allowance of reduced maintenance tacrolimus dosing (rTd).
