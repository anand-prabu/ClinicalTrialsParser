Of these patients, any patient that is noted to have alcohol intoxication\n      will be identified.  The chart of that patient will be reviewed for details about the\n      patient's alcohol use and for the patient's suitability for a sobering house, which is a\n      place where intoxicated patients can go to await sobriety.  The chart will also be reviewed\n      for the number of previous visits for alcohol use to our hospital ever and in the last year."
