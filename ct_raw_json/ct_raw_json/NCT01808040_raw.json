The study has two major parts; dose escalation and dose\n      expansion. In the first part or dose escalation, subjects will be treated at the lowest dose\n      effective in men: 300 mg two times daily. Orteronel (TAK-700) will be increased to reach the\n      highest dose tolerated in men: 400 mg two times daily. This part of the study is designed to\n      see if female subjects can safely tolerate orteronel (TAK-700), and to measure the changes\n      in estrogens and androgens at different levels of TAK-700.\n\n      In the second part of the study (dose expansion), seven women will be treated with the dose\n      identified in the first part of the study as being safest and most effective. In this part\n      of the study, the investigators want to see if orteronel (TAK-700) will routinely and\n      significantly decrease the estrogen levels at the dose which will be used for any future\n      studies."
