Conservatively, the first\n      dose level to be explored will be LY2780301 400 mg QD and paclitaxel 70 mg/m\u00b2/week."

In addition, this study\n           will assess the role of PI3K/AKT/S6 pathway activation as potential predictive factor\n           for response to LY2780301 in this patient population.\n\n      This trial will be a phase Ib/II prospective, multicentre, open label, uncontrolled study.\n\n      Phase Ib will use a continuous reassessment method (CRM) design, allowing to reach safely\n      and quickly the MTD and the RP2D of the combination, but ensuring the treatment of at least\n      18 patients to secure the tolerance profile.\n\n      Phase II will estimate antitumor activity in the overall patient population and in patients\n      with activation of PI3K/AKT/S6 axis, allowing to examine its potential value as predictive\n      biomarker"
