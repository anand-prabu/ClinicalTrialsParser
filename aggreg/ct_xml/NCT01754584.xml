  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The mucociliary system of nasal mucosa, which is composed of the ciliated respiratory
      epithelium, the mucous blanket, and the mucus-producing glands, is an important defense
      component of the respiratory system. Therefore, it is important to maintain intact inner
      respiratory mucociliary epithelium in reconstruction of large respiratory defect and in the
      development of tissue engineering trachea. Hyaluronan derivatives, which are biodegradable
      and non-immunogenic, have already proved to be effective as a scaffold for chondrocytes.
      However, the feasibility of use as a scaffold for respiratory epithelial cells remained
      unexplored. The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of hyaluronan including
      concentrations and molecular weight on the mucociliary differentiation of human respiratory
      epithelial cells (HREC). If hyaluronan is able to promote mucociliary differentiation of
      HREC, the investigators can synthesize hyaluronan derivatives serving as ideal biomaterials
      for respiratory tissue engineering and tissue-engineered trachea in the future.
