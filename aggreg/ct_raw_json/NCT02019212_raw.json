The outcomes of participants that have\n      had FD studies will be compared to those who have had LD studies. Consented participants\n      will be contacted and will be asked to provide information on their cardiovascular health\n      since the date of their LD or FD scan, such as non fatal myocardial infarction, death,\n      congestive heart failure, admission to hospital with chest pain, further cardiac diagnostic\n      testing, including angiography and early and late revascularization. The event information\n      will be tabulated at 6, 12, 18, and 24 months for the LD and FD studies.\n\n      The study hypothesizes that there will be no difference in the quality and prognostic value\n      between the LD and FD 99mTc-tetrofosmin SPECT MPI imaging protocols. The study hypothesizes\n      that there will be no increase in repeat diagnostic testing and angiography with using the\n      LD imaging protocol."
