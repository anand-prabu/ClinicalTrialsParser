A person with LAMA2-MD will have changes on\n      brain imaging (MRI), a decrease or absence of the protein merosin (laminin 211) on muscle or\n      skin biopsy and changes in the LAMA2 gene that are inherited from both parents.  Several\n      studies have described the changes on brain MRI.  Brain changes on MRI do not correlate with\n      the partial reduction or absence of merosin on muscle or skin biopsy.  8-30% of people with\n      LAMA2-MD develop seizures.  The types of seizures, electroencephalogram changes and common\n      treatment regimens have not been characterized.  This study will review the magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) changes, determine whether certain brain MRI changes are linked to\n      seizures and define the common seizure treatment regimens."

            "textblock": "LAMA2-MD is a congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) subtype caused by mutations in the laminin\n      alpha 2 gene.  LAMA2-MD may present clinically as an early onset, severe phenotype or a late\n      onset limb girdle phenotype. The early onset form is most commonly associated with a\n      complete absence of merosin on muscle biopsy with profound neonatal hypotonia, possible\n      respiratory distress and feeding difficulties while the late onset form presents with\n      proximal muscle weakness, contractures and is able to achieve walking.  In both early and\n      late onset forms, brain white matter abnormalities have been described on brain MRI and\n      approximately 8-30% develop a seizure disorder.  On magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy,\n      white matter changes are shown to be due to increased water content rather than areas of\n      demyelination.  Both,  non-ambulant and ambulant patients may develop respiratory\n      insufficiency requiring non-invasive ventilation and scoliosis.\n\n      Although several studies have evaluated the correlation between brain MRI white matter\n      changes and cognition, no studies to date have provided a systematic evaluation of brain\n      imaging, electrophysiologic testing and seizures in patients identified by molecular or\n      immunohistochemical testing to have LAMA2-MD."
