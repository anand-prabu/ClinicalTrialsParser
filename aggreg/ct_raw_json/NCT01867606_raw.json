To compare the surgical complication rates between oral SBI vs. placebo up to 1 month\n      post-surgery (safety endpoint).\n\n      II. To compare the QOL, as derived from the previously-validated Symptom Distress Scale, the\n      Postoperative Quality of Life questionnaire (PQL), and the uniscale (overall QOL item)\n      between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.\n\n      III. To compare the grade 2 or worse adverse event rates for patients receiving oral SBI vs.\n      placebo.\n\n      IV.

To compare supplement adherence between patients receiving oral SBI vs. placebo.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To explore whether candidate biomarkers are modified with SBI versus placebo.\n\n      II. As part of ongoing research, to bank leftover blood samples for future studies.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive SBI orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO BID on days 1-28.\n\n      In both arms, treatment repeats every 28 days for 3 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks."
