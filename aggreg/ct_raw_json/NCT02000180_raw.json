Participants in the progressive learning group can switch to the high-fidelity simulator at their discretion, but cannot return to the low-fidelity simulator. On the high fidelity VR simulator they can progress through six modules each in colonoscopy and endoscopic polypectomy in a self-directed fashion, with one-on-one feedback by an expert academic endoscopist. The endoscopy instructor will demonstrate techniques, answer questions and provide feedback. The entirety of this will be delivered over two days."
