      Background: Outpatient continuous interscalene brachial plexus blocks are used to control
      pain after shoulder surgery, with infusions of 0.125% bupivacaine or 0.2% ropivacaine. There
      have been no studies comparing the effects of these two formulations. The major concern is
      hemidiaphragmatic paresis, and since ropivacaine preferentially blocks sensory fibers, it
      may cause less blockade of the phrenic nerve. This study was to evaluate the effects of
      continuous interscalene brachial plexus infusions, with the hypothesis that respiratory
      function is more affected by 0.125% bupivacaine than 0.2% ropivacaine, with equal effects on
      pain relief.

      Methods:  All patients underwent baseline spirometry and ultrasound evaluation of
      diaphragmatic excursion, followed by interscalene catheter placement for their surgery, then
      randomized to receive a pump containing 0.2% ropivacaine or 0.125% bupivacaine. Patients
      returned to the hospital the following day for spirometry, ultrasound reevaluation, and
      evaluation of their pain level since discharge.

      INTRODUCTION

      Shoulder surgery is associated with severe postoperative pain and continuous interscalene
      brachial plexus blocks can control this pain. Compared to single-shot injections, continuous
      interscalene blocks can increase patient satisfaction, decrease narcotic requirements, which
      then decreases postoperative nausea and vomiting , improve quality of sleep and decrease
      hospital  length of stay .

      The concept of continuous peripheral nerve blocks at home (CPNBH) with disposable pumps
      began in 1998 in Sweden. The authors chose 0.125% bupivacaine for interscalene catheters and
      their choice was not based on any evidence in the literature, but rather &quot;because this
      concentration was already available at the institution for epidural infusions&quot; (personal
      communication, Dr. Narinder Rawal, January 2013). Two years later, as ropivacaine became
      more widely available, others chose to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 0.2% ropivacaine
      for continuous interscalene infusions. Again, the choice of this specific concentration was
      not evidence-based, but rather &quot;because the company made it in this concentration&quot; (personal
      communication, Dr. Stephen Klein, January 2013). To date, published reviews show that most
      studies use either of those formulations, yet there have been no studies comparing the
      effects of these two drugs and concentrations, particularly on pain relief and on major side
      effects of CPNBH.

      One of those major side effects is ipsilateral phrenic nerve paresis. This is because
      blockade of the brachial plexus at the interscalene groove with a single large-volume
      injection causes diaphragmatic hemiparesis in 100% of patients9,10. This incidence is
      decreased to 20% with a continuous infusion of a dilute solution11, where 9% of patients
      have a subjective feeling of shortness of breath12. An ideal infusate in CPNBH would control
      postoperative pain and have minimal effects on the phrenic nerve.

      Ropivacaine has been shown to have blockade properties that differ from bupivacaine;
      specifically, ropivacaine seems to preferentially block sensory nerve fibers, while weakly
      blocking motor fibers13. It is not known whether this translates into a more attenuated
      block of the phrenic nerve with ropivacaine. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to
      evaluate the effects of continuous interscalene peripheral nerve blocks with 0.125%
      bupivacaine versus 0.2% ropivacaine, comparing their effect on pain relief and respiratory
      function. The primary hypothesis is that respiratory function is more affected by
      bupivacaine than ropivacaine, with equal effects on pain relief.

      METHODS

      Patients who were scheduled for moderately to severely painful unilateral shoulder surgery
      who agreed to continuous interscalene catheter placement were enrolled in the study and gave
      written consent.

      All patients underwent baseline studies, which included ultrasonic evaluation of
      diaphragmatic excursion and bedside spirometry. All were placed in a 45-degree upright
      position on a hospital stretcher. Assessment of the range of motion of both hemidiaphragms
      was performed with a curvilinear low frequency ultrasound probe  The probe was placed
      subcostaly in the mid-axillary line, angled 45 degrees cephalad on both sides, using the
      liver on the right and the spleen on the left as acoustic windows. If there was difficulty
      in obtaining a satisfactory image (frequently the case on the left side), the probe was
      moved laterally toward the anterior axillary line until the diaphragm was visualized. Range
      of motion of the diaphragm with normal respiration was assessed visually to exclude any
      pre-existing diaphragmatic motion abnormalities, followed by sigh and sniff tests. During
      the 'sniff test', movement of the diaphragm was evaluated from the resting expiratory
      position during quick inspirations of air taken through the nose. During the 'sigh test',
      the range of diaphragmatic motion from the resting expiratory position to deep inspiration
      was measured. The normal caudad movement of the diaphragm was recorded with the distance
      traveled in centimeters. Each measurement was performed 3 times and the best value was
      recorded. A mark was placed on the patients' skin where measurements were taken, to
      ascertain that the diaphragm was assessed from the same site during the follow-up visit.

      Bedside spirometry was performed for each patient, again in a 45-degree upright position in
      a hospital stretcher. After instructing the patient, forced expiratory volume at 1 second
      (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC) and peak expiratory flow (PEF) were measured three
      times, and the best measurement was recorded.

      Following this, with standard noninvasive monitoring and oxygen via nasal cannula, all
      patients had interscalene catheter placement with midazolam sedation (up to 5 mg). All
      catheters were placed using and nerve. After draping the area and sheathing the ultrasound
      probe (SiteRite; Bard Access Systems, Salt Lake City, UT), a local anesthetic skin wheal was
      placed and a 17-gauge Tuohy insulated needle was inserted in-plane with a posterior
      approach, through the middle scalene muscle. The prevertebral fascial plane was punctured
      and the needle tip was placed in the area of connective tissue between the C5 and C6 nerve
      roots. A 19-gauge stimulating catheter was then inserted through the needle and attached to
      the nerve stimulator, set at a current of 0.48 mA, 100 microsecond pulse duration and 2 Hz
      frequency. The nerve stimulator settings were kept constant throughout the procedure. With
      ultrasound visualization and muscle twitches of the upper arm (biceps, triceps or deltoid),
      the catheter was threaded 5-6 cm beyond the needle tip. If stimulation was lost during
      threading, the catheter was gently withdrawn, the needle was moved slightly and the catheter
      was threaded again with ultrasound visualization and visible muscle twitching. If this was
      not possible after five minutes (from the first catheter threading), the patient was removed
      from the study. Once the catheter was threaded successfully, the needle and catheter stylet
      were removed and the catheter was withdrawn until the skin marking was 2-3 cm beyond the
      needle depth. The nerve stimulator was reattached to the catheter to verify the presence of
      a muscle twitch at 0.48mA, and a 5 ml volume of 1.5% lidocaine with epinephrine 1:200,000
      was injected under direct ultrasound vision, confirming local anesthetic spread.

      Prior to transport into the operating room and after negative aspiration, all catheters were
      injected with 30 ml plain mepivacaine 1.5%, followed by an assessment of the quality of the
      sensory and motor block. A general anesthetic was administered with propofol induction and
      maintenance with vecuronium and sevoflurane. No opioids or additional benzodiazepines were
      given. Three hours after the initial injection, whether patients were in the operating room
      or in the Post Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU), an additional 10 ml plain mepivacaine 1.5% was
      given through the catheter. Upon arrival to PACU, pain control was assessed (on a numerical
      scale from 0 to 10), catheter and dressing integrity were verified and patients were
      randomized by the pharmacists, using a computer-generated randomization table, to receive a
      disposable pump (On-Q CB004, I Flow Corporation, Lake Forrest, CA) containing 400 ml of 0.2%
      ropivacaine or 0.125% bupivacaine and set at a rate of 6 ml/hr. Except for the pharmacist,
      all other personnel were blinded to the content of the pumps.

      The following day (20-28 hours after discharge), patients returned to the hospital and were
      asked about their highest pain level (on a numerical scale from 0 to 10) since surgery and
      the number of pain pills taken since discharge, difficulty breathing, the amount of numbness
      in the hand, and any problems with the catheter or the pump. The catheter sites were
      examined and when necessary, the dressing was reinforced. After this, patients underwent
      pulmonary testing, again on a stretcher in a 45-degree upright position. Repeat
      ultrasonographic evaluation of diaphragmatic excursion (sniff and sigh tests) and bedside
      spirometry were performed. For the ultrasonographic evaluation, the previously marked sites
      were used for 3 measurements, recording the best effort. If on the sigh and/or sniff test a
      caudad movement of the hemidiaphragm was seen, the distance was measured, recorded and
      assigned a positive value (+). If paradoxical cephalad movement of the diaphragm was
      observed, the distance was given a negative value (-). Following completion of the
      ultrasonographic evaluation, spirometry was performed. Again FEV1, FVC and PEF were measured
      and the best of 3 attempts was recorded. Patients were sent home with CPNBH for an
      additional two days. Per routine, an anesthesiologist called them every day to assess their
      pain level, shortness of breath, numbness, and integrity of the catheter site.

      Statistical Analysis Determining the study size was allowing for a 15% difference in forced
      expiratory volume at 1 second (FEV1) between the two. A non-inferiority power analysis was
      chosen to obtain an alpha error probability of 0.05 and a 1 minus beta error probability of
      0.8. A sample size of 30 patients (15 per group) was chosen to give the study sufficient
      power. A T-test (unmatched pairs) was used to compare continuous data between the two
      groups. If data had a non-normal distribution, a non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis ANOVA was
      used to examine differences between means. Categorical data was expressed as mean + standard
      error. Statistical significance was set at a p-value ≤ 0.05, two-tailed.

      RESULTS

      Of the 38 enrolled patients, one was removed because of prolonged attempts at catheter
      placement and one was removed because of suboptimal pain control from the initial bolus, as
      assessed immediately prior to induction. Six patients were excluded after catheter placement
      and after randomization, for the following reasons: Hoarseness and ptosis (1); Inadvertent
      intraoperative opioids (1); Did not return to the hospital on the first postoperative day
      for reassessment (4). The 30 remaining patients were included in the

      .Pulmonary function values decreased in both groups: the primary variable, FEV1 decreased
      22.4% with bupivacaine, 29.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.25). FVC was decreased 23.1% with
      bupivacaine, 18.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.51); and PEF was decreased 23.9% with bupivacaine,
      30.4% with ropivacaine (p 0.28). On the blocked side, patients in the ropivacaine group had
      an average 75.5% decrease in diaphragmatic excursion on the sigh test, compared to 81.4% in
      the bupivacaine group (p= 0.66). Sniff test diaphragmatic excursion decreased by 62.8% in
      the ropivacaine group and 78.5% in the bupivacaine group (p =0.42). There was a compensatory
      increase in diaphragmatic excursion on the nonsurgical side, with a sigh test increase by
      15% in the ropivacaine group and 12.3% in the bupivacaine group (p =0.77), and a sniff test
      increase by 7.3% in the ropivacaine group and 69.5% in the bupivacaine group (p &lt;0.01). More
      patients in the ropivacaine group had a paradoxical (cephalad during inspiration)
      diaphragmatic excursion. The only statistically significant difference was the percent
      change in the excursion of the contralateral hemidiaphragm with the sniff test. This finding
      was felt to be operator error, because of the difficulty measuring minimal changes during
      the dynamic movement of ultrasonography. Pain scores and oral opioid requirements were
      similar in both groups. There were no patient complaints of shortness of breath.

      All CPNBH infusions were discontinued uneventfully at home by the patients on the second or
      third postoperative day. Three months after the study, all patients were contacted and all
      denied any residual tingling, hypo/hyperesthesia or any new sensorimotor deficit.

      DISCUSSION

      This study showed no difference in pain control or respiratory function between interscalene
      CPNBH with 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine. These are the most commonly used
      formulations for CPNBH. To date, there had been no evidence that they were equipotent in
      their use in peripheral nerve block infusions.

      To avoid the confounding factor of residual numbness from the surgical day, mepivacaine 1.5%
      was chosen as the initial bolus, because of its short duration of action. The continuous
      infusion of local anesthetic was set at a fixed rate of 6 ml/hr since this had been the
      customary rate used by the investigators for over 3,000 CPNBH procedures at this
      institution. The rate was fixed to avoid any patient manipulations of the drip rate during
      the study period. This was done despite evidence that patient-controlled infusion rates
      improve pain control17. However, after the postoperative pulmonary testing was performed,
      patients were allowed to adjust the rate. Of note is that most patients (28 out of 30) chose
      to leave the rate at 6 ml/hr.

      Opiates were intentionally avoided in the immediate perioperative period, as they can cause
      a dose-dependent ventilatory depression. Borgeat et al21 compared ventilatory and phrenic
      nerve function in patients receiving either a continuous interscalene catheter or an
      intravenous morphine pump for postoperative analgesia after shoulder arthroscopy. There was
      no statistical difference between the 2 groups for all pulmonary parameters studied, which
      were equally diminished in both groups. In the present study, patients used equal amounts of
      oral oxycodone at home, so the contribution of this opioid to their postoperative pulmonary
      dysfunction would have been the same in both groups.

      There have been very few studies comparing 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine, all with
      a small number of subjects. One study hypothesized that 0.2% ropivacaine would cause less
      motor blockade after epidural injections for chronic low back pain. With 18 patients per
      group, this study found no difference.  There are only two studies comparing the effects of
      interscalene blocks with ropivacaine and bupivacaine on diaphragmatic and pulmonary
      function. Both were with single-shot injections of concentrations that were higher (0.33%
      and 0.5% respectively) than those used in continuous infusions. With a total of 34 patients
      divided in two groups, Altintas et al. showed that diaphragmatic paresis and decreased
      pulmonary function were more significant in the bupivacaine group. With 15 patients per
      group, Hortense et al.  found that pulmonary function was worse in the ropivacaine group at
      30 minutes but not at 4 or 6 hours.

      CONCLUSION:

      In conclusion, this study showed no difference in respiratory dysfunction or opioid
      requirements on the first postoperative day between interscalene continuous peripheral nerve
      blocks at home with 0.125% bupivacaine and 0.2% ropivacaine. Even though ropivacaine has
      been found to be motor-sparing when compared to bupivacaine, this study showed that it does
      not cause less hemidiaphragmatic paresis.  There is a need for a more ideal infusate, one
      that controls pain but causes a less significant decrease in pulmonary function. Perhaps a
      study is in order, where a lower concentration of ropivacaine is used along with an adjuvant
      or a combination of adjuvants, hoping to find that ideal infusate.
