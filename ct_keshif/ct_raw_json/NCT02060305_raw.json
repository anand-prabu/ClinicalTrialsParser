Local anti-VEGF therapy with intra-articular bevacizumab (Avastin),\n      a VEGF-neutralizing monoclonal antibody that can efficiently antagonize VEGF activity, may\n      block the process and decrease the frequency of recurrent bleeding episodes. In addition, we\n      proved that intra-articular injection of bevacizumab in rat model is safe without\n      significant local or systemic adverse events.\n\n      Primary Objective The efficacy of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for secondary\n      prevention of recurrent hemarthroses for hemophilia patients who has had target joints with\n      chronic synovitis. The safety profiles of intra-articular bevacizumab injection for\n      hemophilia patients.\n\n      Study Population  Adult hemophilia patients who have had one or more target joints with\n      chronic synovitis and recurrent hemarthroses.\n\n      Investigational therapy: Intra-articular injection of Bevacizumab (20 or 40 mg/ 0.8 or 1.6\n      ml/ dose) every month (28 days) for up to 4 months, depending on the improvement of target\n      joint bleeding.\n\n      Study Design  The estimated study period is between Jan 2014 and Dec 2015.

Post-procedure\n      target joints bleedings will be recorded at intervals of 1st, 3rd, 6th, and 12th months.
