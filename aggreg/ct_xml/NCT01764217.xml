  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Observational study based on the routine clinical treatment and diagnostic course, to
      correlate imaging features with outcome objectives. Outcome will evaluated as clinical
      response to the standard treatment and as recurrence and survival in the follow up. The
      study hypothesis is that data extracted form FDG-PETCT used in the routine clinical practice
      can predict outcomes following standard treatment.

      This study will prospectively collect patients undergoing to the standard diagnostic and
      treatment protocol in Maastro Clinic. Any difference in the normal procedure will be
      adopted. The aim is to extrapolate form the PET images some features of the metabolic tumor
      activity to associate with different outcomes and tumor behaviours.

    <description>We will apply a high throughput approach to convert medical images to minable data, where it is hypothesized that it will improve tumor characterization and treatment outcome prediction.
Extracted imaging features consist firstly of global properties, providing information on the first order histogram of voxel intensity values within the tumor VOI.
Local and regional textural features describing patterns and spatial distribution of voxel intensities, are calculated from respectively gray level co-occurrence and gray level run-length matrix representations. Images will be discretized before texture analysis, which allows for a direct comparison of all calculated textural features between patients. Co-occurrence and gray  level run-length matrices are determined considering  26-connected voxels (i.e. voxels were considered to be neighbors in all 13 directions in three dimensions) and a distance of 1 between consecutive voxels. Features derived from the co-occurrence and gray</description>
