            "textblock": "Patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of stroke. Rapid assessment\n      and treatment can reduce the risk. Several international guidelines recommend a test, the\n      ABCD2 score, to identify TIA patients with low and high risk for stroke. The main purpose of\n      this study is to investigate stroke risk after TIA in both short (1 week) and long term (3\n      months/1 year), and to assess whether the Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration\n      of TIA, Diabetes (ABCD2) score is a sufficient tool for predicting stroke risk. Secondary\n      aims are to explore whether adopting imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI) and biological\n      markers of blood into a risk score could improve the predictive value of the ABCD2 score and\n      still be feasible in a daily clinical practice. Further on overall risk factors in TIA\n      patients, and the incidence of other vascular events will be studied. A substudy designed as\n      a randomised controlled trial evaluates pharmaceutical counseling in a subset of\n      participants. Cost-benefit analysis, and a long-term follow-up (5 years) is planned."
