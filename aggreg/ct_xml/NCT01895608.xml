  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The first goal of this study is to examine the extent to which the inclusion of dual-task
      practice to standard balance rehabilitation results in greater benefits to dual-task
      ability. The second goal of this study is to examine the extent to which the addition of
      cognitive training following balance rehabilitation results in greater benefits to dual-task
      ability.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Historically, degradation of balance control in older adults has been attributed to
      impairments of the motor and/or sensory systems. As a result, therapy has focused on motor
      and sensory impairments. However, evidence suggests that an impaired ability to allocate
      attentional resources to balance during dual-task situations is a powerful predictor of
      falls. Despite this fact, few studies have examined whether interventions can improve older
      adults' dual-task ability. The goal of this study is to develop effective interventions to
      improve ability to allocate attention to balance and gait under dual-task conditions.

      Older adults (n = 44) who have been referred to physical therapy (PT) for gait or balance
      impairments who have dual-task impairment will be randomized to receive either standard
      balance rehabilitation or balance rehabilitation with dual-task practice. Following PT,
      subjects will receive cognitive training (CT), either speed of processing or generalized
      cognitive training. Primary outcomes are ability to walk while performing four different
      cognitive tasks of varying difficulty. Assessment will occur at baseline, post-PT, post-CT.

    <description>Timed up and go test (TUG) has three conditions: no secondary task (TUG), cognitive (TUGc) and manual dual-tasks (TUG-m). Time to complete the task will be recorded as a primary outcome measure. Time greater than 15 s for TUG-c indicates impaired dual-task ability.</description>

    <description>The walk while talk (WWT) test involves walking at preferred speed under the following conditions: no cognitive task (WWT), a simple cognitive task (reciting the alphabet; WWT-s) and a complex cognitive task (reciting every other letter of the alphabet; WWT-c).1 A verbal fluency task (WWT-v) and counting backwards by 3s (WWT-count) will be included.</description>
