  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of an auditory training
      program used at home with the subject's own hearing aids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most common communication complaint of older adults with impaired hearing is that they
      can hear speech, but can't understand it.  This is especially true where there are competing
      sounds in the background.  Previous experiments performed under laboratory settings using a
      novel word-based auditory-training regimen have demonstrated substantial improvements in
      open-set recognition of words and sentences in noise.  The current proposed study will
      investigate the effectiveness of the training regimen when used in a patient's home setting
      with their own hearing aids.    All testing for the screening, baseline speech testing,
      training system orientation, and the outcomes portions of this project will be conducted in
      the Audiology Research Laboratory (ARL) of the Speech and Hearing Center located at 200
      South Jordan Avenue.  The use of the training program will be done at the subject's home.

      Subjects will first come to the ARL for either one session for a hearing aid follow-up and
      instruction in the use of the training system (Session 1) or for one session for an initial
      screening to determine eligibility (Screening) followed then by Session 1. Subjects will
      then take home a training system that includes a tablet computer that has the training
      program loaded onto it, a portable loudspeaker, and some accessories. There will be three
      groups of subjects: (1) Hearing aid alone--no training (passive control); (2) Hearing aid
      plus auditory training (training); and (3) Hearing aid plus audio book use (active control).
       Each group will include 40 subjects. Those subjects in the training group and active
      control group will complete two five-week cycles of training and  return to the lab for
      outcome measures after 10 weeks of training for the primary and secondary outcome measures.
      The hearing aid alone group will return for the same outcome measures as the training and
      active control groups, but will have no intervention between these follow-up sessions.

    <description>The CST is an &quot;objective&quot; measure of speech-understanding in noise that will be obtained when the patient's are wearing their hearing aids.  The patient hears standardized recordings of the speech in noise and then reports the sentences that were heard.  These are scored as percent correct.</description>
