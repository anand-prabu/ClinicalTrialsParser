A proportion of advanced stage ovarian cancer\n      expresses substantial levels of Claudin 6 (CLDN6), a carcino-embryonic transmembrane\n      protein, which is absent from normal adult human tissue. IMAB027 is a monoclonal antibody\n      that binds to CLDN6. Preclinically IMAB027 was shown to inhibit tumor growth and to kill\n      cancer cells by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity and complement-dependent\n      cytotoxicity. This trial is a first-in-human dose escalation and dose finding phase 1/2\n      trial of IMAB027 in patients with recurrent advanced ovarian cancer to assess the safety and\n      tolerability, the pharmacokinetics, the antitumoral activity and the immunogenicity of\n      IMAB027."
