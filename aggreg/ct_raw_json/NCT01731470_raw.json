            "textblock": "Interstitial cystitis/painful bladder syndrome (IC/PBS) is a poorly understood chronic\n      disorder of unknown etiology consisting of irritative bladder symptoms and pelvic pain that\n      dramatically affects quality of life.\n\n      Liposomes (LP), the treatment article in this proposal, were discovered in the process of\n      exploring a \"control\" compound when measuring the efficacy of liposomally encapsulated\n      capsaicin for the intravesical treatment of interstitial cystitis. Liposomes are lipid\n      vesicles composed of concentric phospholipid bilayers, which enclose an aqueous interior.\n      Liposomes have the ability to form a molecular film on cell and tissue surfaces and are\n      currently being tested as possible therapeutic agents to promote wound healing. Application\n      of liposomes at the wound surface provides a moist protective film over the wound and\n      augments wound healing without chronic inflammatory reactions in the neodermal layer.\n      Preclinical study data (obtained by using an IC/PBS model in Sprague-Dawley female rats)\n      have demonstrated normalization of urinary frequency indicating that LP may be a potent\n      protectant of the bladder mucosa against inflammation and irritation.  Intravesical LP has\n      so far demonstrated an excellent safety profile and minimal toxicity at concentrations of 2\n      mg/ml. Thus, we hypothesize that intravesical instillation of LP may form a molecular film\n      on bladder ulcer surfaces in patients with IC and provide a safe, effective, and minimally\n      invasive treatment option to alleviating symptoms."
