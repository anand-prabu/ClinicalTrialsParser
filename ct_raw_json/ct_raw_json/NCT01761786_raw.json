            "textblock": "Rationale: the use of antiplatelet drugs (i.e. clopidogrel, ticagrelor or prasugrel) is\n      crucial in the treatment of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI)\n      with stent implantation to prevent atherothrombotic events. Ticagrelor and prasugrel are\n      more effective in preventing atherothrombotic events, but with a higher risk of bleeding\n      complications, compared to clopidogrel. Clopidogrel is converted into its active metabolite\n      by CYP2C19. Carriers of the non functional CYP2C19*2 and *3 alleles have an impaired CYP2C19\n      capacity, making clopidogrel less effective. For these subjects ticagrelor or prasugrel is\n      an alternative.\n\n      Objective: to assess the efficacy, safety and cost-effectiveness of the CYP2C19 genotype\n      guided antiplatelet treatment strategy, using clopidogrel in non-carriers of a CYP2C19*2 and\n      *3 allele and ticagrelor or prasugrel in carriers of a CYP2C19*2 and *3 allele in STEMI\n      patients.\n\n      Intervention: the intervention group will be genotyped for CYP2C19*2 and *3 allele variants\n      within 48 hours after PCI. Carriers will receive either ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) or\n      prasugrel (10 mg once daily or 5 mg once daily if the patient is older than 75 years or has\n      a body weight < 60 kg), according to local standards. Non-carriers will be treated with\n      clopidogrel (75 mg once daily). The control group receives either ticagrelor or prasugrel,\n      according to local standards at the same dosage as the CYP2C19*2 or *3 carriers in the\n      intervention group. The antiplatelet drug will be continued for one year after PCI. The\n      follow-up duration will be one year using follow-up questionnaires."
