            "textblock": "Blood or marrow transplant patients (BMT) may experience legal support needs through their\n      transplant process. Specific examples of medical-legal issues impacting BMT patients include\n      social security disability benefits, Will/estate issues, employment concerns, and creditor\n      issues. At the beginning of the transplant process, BMT patient-families are often\n      overwhelmed by the stress of transplant, and their focus is usually on their care and\n      treatment needs. Legal planning that may be important to patient-families may not be\n      considered or deferred.\n\n      Presently, the process of referral to legal services is predominantly a reactive process.\n      Once a patient identifies a legal issue or concern to a BMT social worker, this is often\n      after the issue escalates to the point where it creates significant stress for the\n      patient-family. The BMT social workers have prolonged contact with these patients and\n      frequently spend many hours trying to assist patients to resolve these issues.\n\n      Cancer Legal Line (CALL) provides caring and compassionate pro bono legal consultation and\n      other referral or pro-bono legal services based on income guidelines to Minnesotans affected\n      by cancer. CALL has provided this support based on Blood and Marrow Transplant (BMT) social\n      work referral for the past 5 years. To our knowledge, there have been no medical-legal\n      partnerships established within hospitals for patients undergoing blood or marrow transplant\n      with cancer.\n\n      It is hypothesized that by establishing an onsite BMT Legal Clinic through a Medical-Legal\n      Partnership (MLP), that patient-and families can be better served through proactive legal\n      consultation. The BMT Legal Clinic would serve to connect the CALL staff with the BMT care\n      team to better serve patients to address patients' concerns, promote well-being,  and reduce\n      stress related to medical-legal issues."
