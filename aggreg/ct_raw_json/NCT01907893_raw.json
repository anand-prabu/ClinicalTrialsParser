The study will also determine the cost and\n      cost-effectiveness of the intervention.\n\n      Primary Hypothesis: Compared to standard treatment alone, access to the TCC Program plus\n      standard treatment will result in lower rates of the composite outcome (i.e. positive for\n      poor function, depression, and/or PTSD).\n\n      Secondary Hypotheses: Compared to standard treatment alone, access to the TCC Program plus\n      standard treatment will result in lower levels of pain and higher rates of return to usual\n      major activity and higher levels of health related quality of life. In addition, both\n      primary and secondary outcomes will correlate strongly with the intermediate outcome of\n      self-efficacy."
