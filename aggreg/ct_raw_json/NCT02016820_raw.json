Those who respond to lifestyle\n      modification will continue on this management.  Those who do not respond to lifestyle\n      modification will start omeprazole 1 mg/kg/day for a planned course of 8 weeks.  We will\n      perform stratified 1:1 enrollment within each study arm, and enroll children until there are\n      8 children in each arm (16 total).  Both study arms will donate stools every 4 weeks during\n      a study of 20 weeks duration (at weeks 0, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20).  The primary outcome will be a\n      significant change in the overall diversity of the colonic microbiome after 4 weeks of PPIs\n      (i.e., from week 8 to week 4), compared to after 4 weeks of lifestyle management."
