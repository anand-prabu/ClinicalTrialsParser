      This phase II trial studies how well Inhibitor of Apoptosis Proteins (IAP) antagonist LCL161
      [also known as Second Mitochondria-derived Activator of Caspases (SMAC) mimetic LCL161]
      alone or with cyclophosphamide works in treating patients with relapsed or refractory
      multiple myeloma. Immunomodulatory therapies, such as LCL161, may stimulate the immune
      system in different ways to kill the cancer cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as
      cyclophosphamide, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing, and can also help to modulate the
      immune response to cancer.  It is not yet known whether giving LCL161 alone or with
      cyclophosphamide is more effective in treating multiple myeloma.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the confirmed overall response rate (&gt;= partial response [PR]) to LCL161,
      used as a single agent, in patients with relapsed multiple myeloma (MM).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the confirmed overall response rate to LCL161 in combination with
      cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of response or
      progression.

      II. To estimate the overall survival and event-free survival of patients treated with LCL161
      in combination with cyclophosphamide, when cyclophosphamide is added to LCL161 for lack of
      response or progression.

      III. To evaluate the tolerability of LCL161 alone and in combination with cyclophosphamide
      in patients with relapsed MM.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine degradation of cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein-1 (cIAP1) in
      peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), changes in serum cytokines, and changes in immune
      cell subsets by flow cytometry.

      II. To correlate the effect of LCL161 with the presence of activating mutations of the
      nuclear factor kappa beta (NFKB) pathway.

      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LCL161 alone, and LCL161 in combination with
      cyclophosphamide.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive LCL161 orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Patients
      lacking a minor response by end of course 2 or partial response by end of course 4 also
      receive cyclophosphamide PO QD on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.
