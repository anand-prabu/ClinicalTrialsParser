At least 4 weeks have elapsed since the completion of major surgery, and the patient\n             has fully recovered from this surgery and any post-surgical complications.\n\n          4. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 2 or less (Appendix\n             5: ECOG Performance Status Scale*).\n\n          5.

Patient of childbearing potential (defined by the clinical sites' standards) is using\n             adequate birth control measures (e.g., barrier method with spermicide; intrauterine\n             device; implantable or injectable hormonal contraceptives; surgical sterilization)\n             for the duration of the study and will continue to use such precautions for 12 months\n             after receiving treatment.\n\n          8. Patient has no significant valvular heart disease (trace or mild valvular stenosis or\n             regurgitation is allowed).\n\n          9. Patient is able to stay within 45 minutes driving time of an emergency room for 28\n             days after doing.\n\n         10. The patient has a caregiver for 28 days after dosing.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Positive pregnancy test.\n\n          2. Serum creatinine level > 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), chronic renal failure\n             requiring hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.\n\n          3.

Glasgow Coma Score (GCS; see Appendix 3: SOFA Score Calculations) of less than 15.\n\n          7. Treatment with an investigational drug within the past 30 days or 5 half-lives of\n             that drug.\n\n          8. Documented primary brain malignancy or brain metastases.\n\n          9. Clinically significant ascites or clinical evidence or history of portosystemic\n             hypertension or cirrhosis.\n\n         10.

Patient has a foreign body which in the opinion of the treating investigator could be\n             difficult to manage in case of infection (e.g. prosthetic hip).\n\n         12. Clinically significant pleural effusion.\n\n         13. Clinically significant pericardial effusion, circumferential pericardial effusion, or\n             any effusion greater than 1.0 cm at any location around the heart.\n\n         14. Need for ongoing treatment with an immunosuppressive agent.\n\n         15. History of solid organ transplantation (with the exception of a corneal transplant >\n             3 months prior to screening).\n\n         16.

History of a significant medical illness deemed by the PI or local investigators as\n             unsuitable for the trial. For example:\n\n             i. Symptomatic congestive heart failure ii. Psychiatric Illness/social situation that\n             may make study dangerous iii. Unstable angina pectoris\n\n         18. Asplenia.\n\n         19.
