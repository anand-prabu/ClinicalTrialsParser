LEMS is a rare autoimmune cause of a defect in neuromuscular transmission.  The\n      disorder is clinically characterized by fluctuating muscle weakness, hyporeflexia and\n      autonomic dysfunction."

These paraneoplastic cases progress more quickly than primary autoimmune LEMS.  An\n      overlap syndrome with other autoimmune diseases is often detected in LEMS patients.\n\n      3,4 DAP is effective in LEMS because it increases calcium influx into the nerve terminal  by\n      blocking potassium efflux and thereby prolonging the presynaptic action potential.  3,4 DAP\n      is less likely to provoke epileptic seizures than its precursor, 4-aminopyridine, because it\n      is less able to cross the blood-brain barrier.  3,4 DAP is effective in increasing strength\n      and improving autonomic symptoms in LEMS patients of both the primary autoimmune and\n      paraneoplastic etiologies."
