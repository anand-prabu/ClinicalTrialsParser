All subjects will receive 20 grams/day\n      of phenylbutyrate in the liquid form phenylbutyrate-triglyceride taken as one teaspoonful\n      three times per day with meals. Blood will be drawn on two days prior to starting\n      phenylbutyrate to measure alpha-synuclein concentrations. Phenylbutyrate-triglyceride will\n      then be started and the change in plasma alpha-synuclein will be measured on day 1, 7, 14,\n      and 21 days while taking phenylbutyrate. After 21 days, the drug will be stopped and a final\n      blood sample will be measured at 28 days to see if plasma alpha-synuclein has fallen to its\n      pre-phenylbutyrate level. No effects on Parkinson symptoms are expected during this short\n      trial. Please note that although taking any type of Parkinson's drugs for symptomatic\n      treatment disqualifies you, if you and your neurologist are willing and able to have you off\n      Parkinson medication for six weeks before and during the trial, you may be eligible to\n      participate."
