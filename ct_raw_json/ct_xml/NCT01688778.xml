  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of telemedicine among the group of
      type-2-diabetics who, despite rehabilitation, remain poorly regulated.  To describe the
      patients with regards to vulnerability and social resources and to determine wich groups
      benefit the most from telemedicine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Type-2-diabetes is a growing healthcare problem. Both because of the increasing amount of
      patients and because of the complications of diabetes.

      Non-pharmacological treatment is considered fundamental in the treatment of patients with
      type-2-diabetes.

      In the Community of Copenhagen, all patients diagnosed with diabetes receive
      rehabilitation. The rehabilitation consists of counseling with regards to nutrition,
      physical activity, smoking cessation and education about diabetes.

      Some patients however, remain poorly regulated despite rehabilitation as well as
      pharmacological treatment.

      A total number of 165 patients will be randomized to intervention group or standard care.

    <description>Monthly video consultations with a nurse as add-on to standard treatment. The nurse has access to bloodsugar- bloodpressure and weight measurements uploaded by the participants to a tablet computer directly from the devices.
Patients on Insulin measure bloodsugar twice a day (fasting and before their evening meal). Patients not on Insulin measure bloodsugar once a week (fasting and before their evening meal). All participants measure bloodpressure and weight once a week. The intervention lasts 32 weeks.</description>
