Treatment repeats every 14 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients with evidence of stable or responding disease are eligible for 4\n      additional courses of treatment.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of Synchrovax SEM plasmid DNA vaccine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which at least 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 10 days after the last dose of study drug.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 6-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
