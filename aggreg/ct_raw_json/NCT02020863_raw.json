In this study\n      protocol, the rate of fluid administration will be determined instead by the closed-loop\n      (automated) control system under the supervision of the anesthesiologist. The system will\n      independently decide when to give fluid and at what rate; the supervising anesthesiologist\n      will monitor the system to ensure appropriate volumes are being delivered and to intervene\n      if necessary."

They will receive standard patient\n      care in that in no way will their anesthetic or surgical procedure will be altered as part\n      of the study, with the exception of fluid administration. Fluids are usually given to a\n      patient based on the physician's discretion.
