This weight regain is\n      linked to numerous factors, mainly dietary compensation phenomenon tied to cravings (Lecerf,\n      2013. Ob\u00e9sit\u00e9 : pourquoi les regimes \u00e9chouent-ils ? Nutr Clin Metab (in press)).\n\n      Due to the difficulties to keep the weight loss, it seems interesting to consider\n      alternatives like reflexotherapy. This method seems to act in reducing the dietary urges\n      causes by stress, by cravings or by frustration.\n\n      This technique would allow to re-establish normal hormones' or neurotransmitters'\n      concentrations mainly involved in the food intake.\n\n      This could be a complementary response to the limits of the classic treatments for weight\n      maintenance management, but it needs to be confirmed by a specific study."
