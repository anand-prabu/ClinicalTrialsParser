We will then test the\n      RFPM's validity (accuracy) compared to the validity of pen-and-paper food records. Our\n      experience and the literature indicate that the RFPM is acceptable and feasible in school\n      settings. Following modification of the RFPM and pilot testing with 4 adolescents, we will\n      test the reliability and validity of both the RFPM and food records when used by 60\n      adolescents (12 to 18 years of age). During one week, participants will use the RFPM and\n      during another week they will use food records (the order will be balanced across\n      participants). The accuracy of each method will be examined by comparing energy and nutrient\n      intake (collectively referred to as food intake or FI) to three gold standards: 1) doubly\n      labeled water or DLW (energy intake only, or EIDLW), 2) a laboratory-based test meal\n      (FILaboratory), and 3) food intake during lunch in a school cafeteria (FISchool).\n      User-satisfaction and participant burden will also be compared between methods, and a\n      cost-effectiveness analysis will determine if and under what conditions one method is more\n      cost-effective than the other."
