Specifically, the effect of image-guided\n      SBRT treatment on clinical tumor response rate, local control and progression-free survival\n      will be studied.  This study will examine target volumes and relevant margins determined by\n      an assessment using 4D PET and repeated 4D CT.  These data will allow us to evaluate and\n      determine the impact of the body immobilization system on the planning target volume (PTV)\n      margins, patient's breathing pattern, target motion, and inter-treatment targets shifts."
