  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irisin, a newly discovered myokine induced in exercise, has potential effects in stimulating
      adipose tissue browning, fighting obesity and diabetes. No prior study has reported on the
      role of circulating irisin in healthy individuals in correlation with lean and fat body
      mass. Furthermore, the circadian and seasonal variation of irisin is largely unknown.

      The main aims of this prospective study will be to investigate: 1) circulating irisin levels
      in healthy, young men and women according to their lean and fat mass; 2) the circadian
      variations of irisin levels; 3) the seasonal variations of irisin levels.

Participants will also be asked to complete a validated questionnaire assessing their diet and exercise habits. Correlations between serum irisin levels and the above parameters will be examined</description>
