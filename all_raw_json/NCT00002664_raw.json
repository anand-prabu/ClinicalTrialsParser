Colony-stimulating factors\n      such as G-CSF may increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral\n      blood, and may help a person's immune system kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody therapy plus G-CSF\n      in treating patients with metastatic colorectal cancer that has not responded to treatment\n      with fluorouracil."

II. Describe the toxicities associated with this regimen. III. Assess the\n      quality of life in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Biological Response Modifier Therapy.
