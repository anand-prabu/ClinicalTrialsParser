    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of GSK's trivalent
      MMR (Priorix®), comparing it to Merck&quot;s MMR vaccine(M-M-R®II), which is approved for use in
      the US.

      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity of GSK's trivalent MMR vaccine (referred to as
      INV_MMR vaccine) in contrast to the US standard of care (M-M-R®II, Merck and Company,
      referred to as COM_MMR) when both are used as a second dose in subjects 7 years of age and
      older. In this study, the INV_MMR vaccine may be administered as a second dose to persons
      with either a history or formal documentation of one dose immunization with any measles-
      containing vaccine. In addition, subjects with either no history of vaccination or no
      documented history of vaccination who require 2-dose MMR vaccination will receive 2 doses of
      MMR approximately 42 days apart. This study is intended to support licensure of GSK's MMR
      vaccine in the US.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes that they and/or their parent(s) or Legally
             Acceptable Representative(s) (LAR) can and will comply with the requirements of the
             protocol.

          -  Male or female subjects 7 years of age or older and born after December 31, 1956*.
             *The only exception to this is health care workers born before 1957 without other
             evidence of immunity to mumps for which one dose of a live mumps virus vaccine is
             recommended; therefore this population is eligible for enrollment in this study.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject or from the parent(s)/LAR(s) of
             the subject (assent will be obtained from subjects who are still legally minors in
             line with local rules and regulations).

          -  Subjects in stable health as determined by investigator's physical examination and
             assessment of subjects' medical history.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.
             Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
             hysterectomy, or ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject agrees to be abstinent or practiced adequate contraception during the entire
             period starting 30 days prior to vaccination(s) until 3 months after receipt of the
             study vaccination(s) and has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product other than the study vaccine(s),
             during the period starting 30 days preceding the day of first study vaccination,
             (i.e. 30 days prior to Day 0) or planned use during the entire study period.

          -  Receipt of any measles, mumps or rubella-containing vaccine during the period
             starting 42 days before the day of first study vaccination (i.e. 42 days prior to Day
             0).

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs during
             the period starting 180 days before the first study vaccination or any planned
             administration of immune-modifying drugs during the entire study. Inhaled and topical
             steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products during the period
             starting 180 days before the day of first study vaccination through the
             immunogenicity evaluation at Visit 2 or Visit 3 (for one-dose or two-dose cohort,
             respectively).

          -  Planned administration/ administration of any live viral vaccine not foreseen by the
             study protocol during the period starting 42 days prior to the first study
             vaccination and ending 42 days after the last study vaccination (either at Visit 2 or
             at Visit 3). Live intranasal influenza vaccine and any inactivated vaccine required
             in the age group may be given at any time, including the day of study vaccination.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational product.

          -  History of measles, mumps, or rubella disease.

          -  Known exposure to measles, mumps, or rubella, during the period starting 30 days
             before study start (i.e. 30 days prior to Day 0).

          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on
             medical history and physical examination.

          -  History of allergic disease or reactions likely to be exacerbated by any component of
             the vaccine(s), including hypersensitivity to neomycin, latex or gelatin.

          -  Blood dyscrasias, leukemia, lymphomas of any type or other malignant neoplasms.

          -  Acute disease at the time of enrollment.

          -  Active alcohol or drug abuse or history of any substance abuse.

          -  Pregnant or lactating female.

          -  Female planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive
             precautions during the entire study period.

          -  Active untreated tuberculosis according to the subject's medical history

          -  Any other condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, prevents the subject
             from participating in the study.
