            "textblock": "The EVEREST II REALISM study (REALISM study) is a continued access registry designed for\n      continued data collection on the use of Abbott Vascular's System (MitraClip device).  After\n      the completion of enrollment in the pivotal EVEREST II Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) and\n      EVEREST II High Risk Registry Study (HRR), continued access to the technology was warranted\n      to collect additional safety and effectiveness data on the MitraClip device.  This continued\n      access study was approved by FDA on November 21, 2008 (G030064).  There are two arms (High\n      Risk and Non-High Risk) in the REALISM study.  Enrollment in the Non-High Risk arm of the\n      study concluded on April 14, 2011 and enrollment in the High Risk arm is ongoing.\n\n      REALISM is a prospective, multi-center, study of the safety and effectiveness of an\n      endovascular approach to the treatment of mitral valve regurgitation using the Evalve\n      Cardiovascular Valve Repair System (MitraClip\u00ae implant). Patients with moderate-to-severe\n      (3+) or severe (4+) mitral regurgitation (MR), as determined by the site from a\n      transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE), were considered for enrollment in this study. The TTE\n      and a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) are used to assess eligibility criteria for MR\n      severity, valve anatomy and left ventricular parameters."
