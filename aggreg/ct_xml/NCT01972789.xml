  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate   and   compare   two   individualised ranibizumab treatment regimens,
      differentiated by the definition of disease activity which determines the treatment interval
      until the next injection. The results will be used to generate further recommendations about
      intensive versus relaxed treatment approaches  and  how  they  can  be  utilised  within  an
       'inject  and extend' approach to maximise patient outcomes, while reducing the need for
      potentially unnecessary intravitreal injections. This study will   also   investigate
      genotypic   expression   and   response   to intravitreal injections of ranibizumab between
      the two treatment arms.

      The study hypothesis is that intravitreal  ranibizumab  when  administered  to  resolve  IRF
      only results in visual acuity benefit that is not clinically worse than intravitreal
      ranibizumab when administered to completely resolve both IRF and SRF in patients with wet
      AMD.

    <description>Ranibizumab 0.5mg is given monthly for the first 3 months followed by an individualised treatment regimen as determined by disease activity defined by a loss of ≥5 letters, new retinal haemorrhage, presence of any IRF or SRF on OCT. If any signs of disease activity are present, the subsequent injection interval will be kept at 4 weeks. If none are present, the interval is extended to 6 weeks. This process occurs with 2 week extensions until 12 weekly intervals. If there are any signs of disease activity in the study eye at any given interval, then the subsequent injection interval is not increased. After extending, the presence of disease activity will require a reduction in intervals: if 1 sign of disease activity is seen the interval is reduced by 2 weeks; if 2 or more signs are seen the interval goes back to 4 weekly. Extension can occur again if there are no signs of disease activity but will not exceed 2 weeks less than the disease activity break point.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of subfoveal CNV secondary to wet AMD without restriction of lesion size,
             with visual impairment being exclusively due to an active wet AMD lesion. Active
             lesions will be characterised by any of the following: abnormal retinal thickness,
             with evidence of intraretinal, subretinal or sub-pigment epithelial fluid
             accumulation, confirmed by OCT; presence of intraretinal or subretinal haemorrhage;
             new leakage shown on a FA; CNV enlargement on FA unless solely due to dry, fibrotic
             staining; visual acuity deterioration considered likely to represent CNV.

          2. BCVA score at both Screening and Baseline must be 23 letters or more  as measured by
             the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS)-like chart at 4 metres,
             inclusively (or approximate Snellen equivalent to 20/320).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any active periocular or ocular infection or inflammation (e.g., blepharitis,
             conjunctivitis, keratitis, scleritis, uveitis, endophthalmitis) at the time of
             Screening or Baseline.

          2. Uncontrolled glaucoma (intraocular pressure [IOP] ≥30 mm Hg on medication) at the
             time of Screening or Baseline.

          3. Neovascularisation of the iris or neovascular glaucoma at the time of Screening or
             Baseline.

          4. Visually significant cataract, aphakia, pseudoexfoliation, severe vitreous
             haemorrhage, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, proliferative diabetic retinopathy or
             CNV of any cause other than wet AMD at the time of screening and baseline.

          5. Structural damage within 0.5 disc diameter of the centre of the macula (e.g.,
             vitreomacular traction, epiretinal membrane, scar, laser burn, foveal atrophy) at the
             time of screening that in the investigator's opinion could preclude visual function
             improvement with treatment.

          6. Treatment with any anti-angiogenic drugs (including any anti-VEGF agents) prior to
             Baseline in study eye (allowed in fellow eye).

          7. Any intraocular procedure (including Ytrium-Aluminium- Garnet capsulotomy) within 2
             months prior to Baseline or anticipated within the next 6 months following Baseline
             in th study eye (allowed in fellow eye).

        Other protocol-defined inclusion/exclusion criteria may apply.
