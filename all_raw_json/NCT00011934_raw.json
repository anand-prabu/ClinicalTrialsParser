Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation,\n      chemotherapy, and biological therapy in treating patients who have chronic myeloid leukemia."

Determine the one year event-free survival in patients with chronic phase\n      chronic myeloid leukemia receiving sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation followed by GM-CSF and interferon alfa. II. Determine the toxicity of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients undergo harvesting of autologous bone marrow. A portion of the cells are\n      treated ex vivo with sargramostim (GM-CSF) for 3 days. Patients then receive myeloablative\n      chemotherapy with busulfan and cyclophosphamide on days -9 to -2 according to the\n      preparative regimen protocol. Patients undergo sargramostim (GM-CSF)-treated autologous bone\n      marrow transplantation on day 0. Patients receive GM-CSF subcutaneously daily on days 5-180,\n      and interferon alfa daily on days 90-180. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 6\n      months for 2 years, and then annually for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-19 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years."
