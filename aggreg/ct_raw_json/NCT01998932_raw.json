            "textblock": "Chronic venous ulceration of the lower limb poses a significant problem to patients and\n      healthcare providers alike. 1% of the population of Western countries have either an open or\n      healed chronic venous ulcer.\n\n      However, the pathophysiological abnormalities are not entirely clear in how raised venous\n      pressure translates into the changes seen in the skin culminating in an open ulcer. The\n      standard treatment of this condition in the United Kingdom is to undertaken compression\n      bandaging of the lower limb.\n\n      In order to further their knowledge of venous ulceration, the investigators seek to\n      determine the biological profile of venous ulcers over a maximum of twenty-eight weeks and\n      by dividing the groups into healing and non-healing wounds, the investigators may be able to\n      demonstrate a difference in the biological profile.\n\n      This work may provide insights into predicting who will respond to treatment and targets for\n      treatment in the future."
