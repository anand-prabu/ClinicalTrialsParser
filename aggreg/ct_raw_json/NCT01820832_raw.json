Emerging evidence in patients with CKD show that vitamin D\n      and its analogs can reduce proteinuria or albuminuria in the presence of\n      angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibithion. While some of the studies  reported that vitamin\n      D receptor activation has been associated with increased serum creatinine and reduced\n      estimated glomerular filtration rates. Therefore, the investigators plan to conduct a\n      randomized clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Calcitriol in the treatment\n      of mild proteinuria (<1.0g/d) CKD patients,which has no specific treatment at present."
