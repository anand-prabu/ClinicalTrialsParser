It is anticipated that a longer injection time will lead to less pain for the\n      patient during the injection. This hypothesis will be tested on healthy volunteers, who will\n      each recieve three injections with the same amount of lidocaine subcutaneously on the\n      abdomen. The injections will be given over 15, 30 and 45 seconds. After each injection, the\n      subject will be asked to evaluate the pain on a Visual analog scale (0-100 mm). The aim of\n      the study is to find a simple method for pain reduction that can be used in clinical\n      practice."
