      Background:

      - Scientists know that alcohol use disorders affect brain structure. They want to know more
      about the effects of alcohol use disorders on a person   s behavior. They want to develop
      tasks that can be done inside a scanner that can help them better understand these effects
      in later studies.

      Objective:

      - To develop tasks that investigate a person   s behavior that can be used in later studies.

      Eligibility:

        -  Inpatient participants of another study. They must be physically healthy right-handed
           adults 18   60 years old.

        -  Healthy right-handed volunteers 18   60 years old.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam. They will have an
           EKG to record heart activity. They will give blood and urine samples and have a
           psychiatric interview.

        -  Participants will have between one and three visits.

        -  Participants will be asked about their alcohol drinking to see if they have an alcohol
           use disorder.

        -  Participants will complete one of three simple computerized tasks either inside the
           magnetic resonance imagining (MRI) scanner or outside of it.

        -  The MRI scanner takes pictures of the brain. The scanner is a metal cylinder.
           Participants lie on a table that can slide in and out of the cylinder. They will be in
           the scanner for about 60 minutes. They may have to lie still for up to 20 minutes. The
           scanner makes loud knocking noises, but they will get earplugs.

      Objective

      The purpose of this protocol is two-fold: 1) to develop tasks examining various cognitive,
      motivational, and decision-making behaviors outside the scanner and 2) to modify, refine,
      and verify the feasibility and applicability of tasks for functional magnetic resonance
      imaging (fMRI) to measure intended concomitant brain activation.

      Study population

      Healthy volunteers without an alcohol use disorder, and inpatient participants with alcohol
      dependence as determined by the DSM-IV-TR.

      Design

      The participants will pilot one or both aspects of this study depending on whether the task
      is de novo or a modification to previously verified or published task.

      Outcome measures

      The outcome is to develop and examine tasks that reliably measure specific cognitive,
      motivational and decision-making behaviors and invoke associated brain systems and functions
      in our targeted subject populations.

        -  INPATIENT PARTICIPANT WITH ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE:

               1. We will study up to 50 male and 50 female individuals who meet criteria for
                  current alcohol dependence.  Inpatient participants will be recruited from the
                  NIAAA protocol 05-AA-0121, Assessment and treatment of people with alcohol
                  drinking problems.

               2. INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Physically healthy;

          -  Between 18-60 years of age (since age effects fMRI signal in ways that have not yet
             been well-characterized);

             c. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Are not cleared on a neuromotor examination;

          -  Are currently receiving psychotropic medication for emotional distress;

          -  Have symptoms of alcohol withdrawal as indicated by the most recent measurement
             within the past 30 days, as measured by the Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment
             (CIWA) score &gt;  8.

        MRI Exclusion Criteria*:

        Participant is unable to undergo MR imaging because of ferromagnetic objects in their
        bodies which might be adversely affected by MRI including implanted pacemakers, medication
        pumps, aneurysm clips, metallic prostheses (including metal pins and rods, heart valves or
        cochlear implants), shrapnel fragments, permanent eye liner or small metal fragments in
        the eye that welders and other metal works may have     any doubt about presence of these
        objects will result in exclusion from this study);

          -  Are pregnant, as determined by a negative pregnancy test;

          -  Left handed.

               -  Subjects are instructed that regardless of the time of consent, the study will
                  not commence until 72 hours has passed since any medication use (prescription or
                  over-the-counter) that may interfere with the successful completion of the
                  study, including medications that could potentially alter the BOLD response in
                  the fMRI machine, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and benzodiazepine.

        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS WITHOUT AN ALCOHOL USE DISORDER:

          1. We will study up to 100 male and 100 female individuals who have never met criteria
             for an alcohol use disorder and are between the age of 18 and 60 years and will be
             recruited from the NIAAA protocol 98-AA-0009, Screening Evaluation for NIAAA
             Protocols.

          2. INCLUSION CRITERIA:

             -Same as inpatient participants with alcohol dependence.

          3. EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

               -  Same as inpatient participants with alcohol dependence (item 3 does not apply).
