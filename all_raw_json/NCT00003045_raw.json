Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining hyperthermia with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of hyperthermia plus radiation therapy in\n      treating patients who have nonmetastatic advanced prostate cancer."

Hyperthermia treatment is given twice in the first 4 weeks of\n      radiation therapy, preferably early in the course of radiation. Hyperthermia treatments are\n      only given once a week. A transrectal ultrasound applicator is used to deliver the\n      hyperthermia treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed every three months for 2 years, and every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 65 patients will be accrued over 2 years."
