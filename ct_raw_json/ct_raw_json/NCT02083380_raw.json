Three OZ439/PQP treatment arms will be included (for patients\n      > 35 kg), with doses scaled to target similar exposures in lighter patients.\n\n      The study aims to recruit predominantly patient populations with the highest probability of\n      having 'lower immunity' to P. falciparum, while also including patients with a probability\n      of having 'higher immunity'. Hence the study will recruit across a wide age range and across\n      geographical regions (Africa, Asia and possibly Latin America). The underlying assumption is\n      that children of 5 years or less in Africa and all ages in Asia/Latin America will have the\n      lower immunity and hence potentially require the highest drug exposure to achieve effective\n      treatment. For this reason, patients of 5 years or less in Africa will form the largest\n      proportion of the population while patients of greater than 5 years in Africa will form the\n      lowest proportion of the population.\n\n      The study will test for efficacy/futility at Day 28 (including data from patients\n      discontinuing prior to Day 28) through interim analyses using Bayesian methodology. Only\n      data from patients in Asia/Latin America and patients of 5 years or less in Africa (the\n      'lower immunity' population) will be included in the interim analyses. Interim assessment of\n      efficacy and futility will occur after recruitment of approximately 50 evaluable patients\n      per dose cohort and thereafter approximately every 25 patients.\n\n      Independently of the analyses for efficacy/futility, the safety of OZ439/PQP treatment arms\n      will be assessed at scheduled time points by an Independent Safety Monitoring Board (ISMB).\n\n      Adults and children will be included through progressive step-down in age range following\n      safety evaluation.\n\n      Following Screening and informed consent, patients will receive study drug and will be\n      followed for clinical signs of malaria (parasitaemia and temperature), safety assessments\n      and pharmacokinetics up to Day 42 following dosing (Day 63 at selected sites)."
