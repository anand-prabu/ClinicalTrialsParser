Determine the safety of immunization with glycosylated MUC-1-KLH vaccine plus\n      adjuvant QS21 in patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal epithelial cancer. II.\n      Determine the dose of this treatment regimen for optimal antibody response in these\n      patients. III. Determine the effect of immunization with this treatment regimen on the\n      T-cell response in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of glycosylated MUC-1-KLH vaccine. Patients receive\n      glycosylated MUC-1-KLH vaccine and QS21 subcutaneously once a week on weeks 1-3, 7, and 19.\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of glycosylated MUC-1-KLH until the dose for\n      optimal antibody response without unacceptable toxicity is determined. Patients are followed\n      at 2 and 12 weeks, and then every 3 months thereafter as long as detectable immunity against\n      MUC-1 persists.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
