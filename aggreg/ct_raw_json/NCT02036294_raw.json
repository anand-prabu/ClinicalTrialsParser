The intervention offers tailored services to address individual\n      patients' biopsychosocial needs, starting early during hospital stay and continuing for 3\n      months post hospital discharge. The study hypothesis is that compared to usual care, the\n      study intervention will : a) Improve patient health- related quality of life and survival,\n      and reduce use of hospital and emergency room visits; b) result in improved patient\n      experience, self- confidence, and self-care behaviors; c) result in improved family\n      caregivers coping skills, self-confidence, and problem solving skills to address patient\n      barriers to care and treatment."
