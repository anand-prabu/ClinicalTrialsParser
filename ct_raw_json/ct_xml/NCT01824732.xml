      This study was advocated by Institute of Basic Research in Clinical Medicine, China Academy
      of Chinese Medical Sciences in December 2012.

      The purpose of this study is to make a event monitoring to see whether Tanreqing injection
      is safe and the characteristic and mechanism of anaphylactic reaction used Tanreqing
      injection in hospitals in China.

    <textblock>
      It is very common that Chinese Medicine Injection used in hospitals in mainland China.
      However safety problems rose in recent years. There could be many uncertain factors
      influence Chinese Medicine Injection in clinical practice.

      In order to ensure the safety of public drug use and lower drug-induced risks, a registry
      study for Tanreqing injection safety surveillance with 3000 patients will be conducted from
      Jan.2013 to Mar.2013.At the same time,Patients who have anaphylactic reaction are selected
      as the allergic group and not have anaphylactic reaction are selected as the control
      group.The proportion of allergic group and control group is 1:4.All the patients who are
      selected should draw blood.

      Eligibility criteria Patients who will use Tanreqing injection in selected hospitals.
