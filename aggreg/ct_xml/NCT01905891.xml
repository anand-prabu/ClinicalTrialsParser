      The purpose of this study is to correlate pathological features from specimens in order to
      determine if this new molecular diagnostic technique can be used to detect risk of skin
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Squamous cell carcinoma is the culmination of a multistep carcinogenesis process that is
      preceded by early stages referred as squamous dysplasia and actinic keratosis. Squamous
      dysplasia (SD) also known as &quot;field effect&quot; is clinically characterized by xerosis (dry,
      scaly skin), lentigines and uneven pigmentation. While morphologically skin biopsies and
      cytology samples show only minimal changes, at the molecular level it is known that SD is
      characterized by small clone keratinocytes carrying mutations of the P53 gene.  An optical
      technology called Partial Wave Spectroscopy (PWS) probes nanoscale structures in the order
      of tens to a few hundred nanometers. PWS is a light back-scattering techniques that uses
      light reflected off of a tissue sample. The measured biomarker is sensitive to the cytosolic
      and nucleic architecture within the cell and quantifies the nanoscale disorder, which
      conventional light microscopy fails to appreciate. PWS has allowed to identify various
      grades of structural disorder at the nanoscale level of colonic and pulmonary premalignant
      cell samples.  Using PWS we aim to study the spectrum of cutaneous SD from patients at high
      risk for SCC development. Since squamous dysplasia is difficult to assess with routine
      histology and cytopathology and a grading system for squamous dysplasia by routine histology
      or cytology is not available, we propose to assess the value of PWS as a new and more
      sensitive imaging technique. By identifying the degree of SD at the molecular level, we may
      be able to intervene with close surveillance, early treatment and chemoprevention strategies
      to achieve lower morbidity by means of fewer and smaller skin cancers.

    <description>Sample will be obtained from random dorsal forearm skin sites without evidence of keratotic lesions. The site will be selected by the investigator. Skin will first be wiped with an alcohol pad and 1% lidocaine will be superficially infiltrated per standard skin surgical procedures. 30% trichloroacetic acid (TCA, standard chemical peel) will then be applied for five minutes. TCA will be neutralized using bicarbonate. Using a cytology brush (a small brush which is used to collect cells during the course of a biopsy) cells will be collected by gentle scraping surface of the skin. Then, a superficial shave biopsy specimen, obtained by using a dermablade (a flexible, one piece blade specifically designed for shave biopsy and excision of skin lesions) will be obtained.</description>
