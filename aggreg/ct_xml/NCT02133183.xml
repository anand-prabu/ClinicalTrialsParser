    <textblock>
      This partially randomized pilot trial studies how much TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 reaches the
      brain tumor and how well it works when given before and after surgery in treating patients
      with glioblastoma that has grown or recurred and requires surgery. TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the penetration of MLN0128 (TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128) across the blood brain
      barrier and achieve a concentration of 70 nM in tissue resected from a contrast enhancing
      region of the tumor in 60% of recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) patients. (Part I) II. To
      determine the ability of MLN0128 to inhibit TOR complex (TORC)1/2 in the enhancing
      components of the tumor as determined by modulation of ribosomal protein S6 (RPS6)
      phosphorylated Ser-235 (pS235) in reverse phase protein array (RPPA) assays. (Part II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the penetration of MLN0128 across the blood brain barrier by determining its
      concentration in tissue resected from a non-contrast enhancing region of the tumor. (Part I)
      II. To assess the plasma pharmacokinetics of MLN0128 in patients with recurrent GBM. (Part
      I) III. To determine the ability of MLN0128 to inhibit TORC1/2 in the non-enhancing
      components of the tumor as determined by modulation of RPS6 pS235 in RPPA assays. (Part II)
      IV. To assess the ability of MLN0128 to inhibit TORC1/2 by evaluating pharmacodynamics (PD)
      markers by immunohistochemistry such as pS235, pS236, phosphorylated 4E-binding protein
      (p4EBP), phosphorylated-mechanistic target of rapamycin (serine/threonine kinase) (pmTOR),
      and v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 (AKT)pSer473. (Phase II) V. To evaluate
      the safety profile of MLN0128 in pre-operative patients with recurrent GBM.

      VI. To estimate response rate, progression-free survival, and overall survival.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To perform mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) to qualitatively assess the ability of MLN0128
      to penetrate the blood brain barrier and enter tumor tissue in enhancing and non-enhancing
      regions of the tumor. (Part I) II. To determine ex-vivo sensitivity of tumor neurosphere
      cultures (patient derived cell lines [PDCL]) established from surgical specimens to MLN0128.
      (Part II) III. To explore the potential association of tumor genotype with progression-free
      survival among patients treated with MLN0128. (Part II) IV. To determine the ability of
      MLN0128 to inhibit TORC1/2 as determined by modulation of additional TORC1/2 markers in RPPA
      assays. (Part II)

      OUTLINE:

      PART I:

      COHORT A: Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 orally (PO) once daily (QD) for 7-9 days
      (including 2-4 hours before surgery). On day 0, patients undergo surgery. Within 30 days
      after surgery, patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO QD. Courses repeat every 28 days
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If patients do not
      demonstrate adequate TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 tumor tissue concentrations, patients are
      enrolled in Cohort II.

      COHORT B: Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO 2-4 hours before surgery on day 0.
      Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO once weekly.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      PART II: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO according to the results from Part I.
      Patients also undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive
      TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo surgery on day 0. Within 30 days after surgery, patients receive
      TORC1/2 inhibitor INK128 PO according to the results from Part I. Courses repeat every 28
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 2 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months thereafter.
