DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar depression I/II, severe, with or without psychotic\n             features.\n\n          5.

Score of greater than or equal to 18 on the first 17-item HAM-D at the prestudy visit\n             and at the first baseline phase visit.\n\n          7. Score of 15 or greater on the HAM-D (17) at the end of the baseline period(s) (i.e.,\n             at randomization no more than 20% less than entry enrollment criteria).\n\n          8.

Able to come off of prior drugs and PRN zolpidem and lorazepam by start of baseline.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA FOR BIPOLAR PATIENTS:\n\n        Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n          1.

Other principal psychiatric diagnosis judged by the investigator to dominate the\n             clinical presentation.  In particular, patients with depressive symptoms more than 2\n             years in duration should be carefully evaluated to determine whether another\n             psychiatric diagnosis exists which could interfere with efficacy and safety\n             measurements.\n\n         17.
