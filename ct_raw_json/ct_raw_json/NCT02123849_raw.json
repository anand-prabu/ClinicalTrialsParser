To determine whether the change in the smoking-related gene expression signature of nasal\n      epithelium persists one week off agent intervention.\n\n      II. To compare the change in urinary prostaglandin E metabolite (PGE-M) and leukotriene E\n      (4) (LTE [4]) between the continuous and intermittent dosing arms and to determine whether\n      the change persists one week off agent intervention.\n\n      III. To analyze the impact of intermittent and continuous ASA on a three lung cancer-related\n      gene signatures (an 80-gene signature, a phosphoinositide 3-kinase [PI3K] gene signature,\n      and a nasal epithelium cancer signature) in the nasal epithelium and to analyze any\n      difference between the intermittent and continuous ASA interventions.\n\n      IV. To determine whether the change, if any, in the lung cancer-related gene expression\n      signatures of nasal epithelium persists one week off agent intervention.\n\n      V. To compare the safety in current smokers of 12 week exposure to continuous versus\n      intermittent ASA.\n\n      VI. To evaluate a gender effect in the modulatory effects of intermittent and continuous ASA\n      on smoking-related gene expression signature.\n\n      VII. To explore in a discovery-driven fashion the effect of ASA intervention on whole-genome\n      gene expression.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I (CONTINUOUS): Participants receive acetylsalicylic acid orally (PO) once daily (QD)\n      for 12 weeks.\n\n      ARM II (INTERMITTENT): Participants receive placebo PO QD during weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11\n      and acetylsalicylic acid PO QD during weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 2 weeks."
