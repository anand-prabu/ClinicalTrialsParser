Sleep apnea\n      is a disease where a person has interruptions in their breathing while they are sleep. This\n      can lead to low oxygen levels in the blood. CPAP is a mask that delivers oxygen at high\n      pressure to the lungs to prevent a decrease in blood oxygen levels. CPAP is a known\n      treatment for sleep apnea."
