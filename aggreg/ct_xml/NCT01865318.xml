    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of this trial is to investigate the
      pharmacodynamic (the effect of the investigated drug on the body) of insulin degludec
      (insulin 454), an explorative formulation, not similar to the proposed commercial
      formulation, under single-dose and steady-state conditions in male subjects with type 1
      diabetes.
