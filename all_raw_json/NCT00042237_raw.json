            "textblock": "Schema-Focused (SF) Therapy is an extension of cognitive therapy that was developed to\n      address the treatment needs of patients with long-standing mental disorders. SF therapy\n      focuses on early maladaptive schemas (EMS): broad, pervasive themes regarding oneself and\n      one's relationship with others, developed during childhood and elaborated throughout one's\n      lifetime, which are dysfunctional to a significant degree. SF Therapy involves the\n      identification of the particular EMS that is most relevant for each patient and attempts to\n      modify the relevant schemas by altering the distorted views of self and others.\n\n      Participants are assessed pretreatment, after 12 weeks, posttreatment, and 3 and 6 months\n      posttreatment. The severity of depressive symptomatology is measured and a self-report Beck\n      Depression Inventory is administered. At the end of the study and at the follow-up\n      intervals, participants are given the Longitudinal Interval Follow-up Evaluation, an\n      instrument that assesses the severity of depression and dysthymia symptoms."
