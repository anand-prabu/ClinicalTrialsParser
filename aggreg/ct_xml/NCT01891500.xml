  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators in this study are concerned about the harmful effects of oxygen exposure
      in newborn infants, particularly at high concentrations.  Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) is an
      FDA approved drug for the treatment of hypoxic respiratory failure (HRF) in term and
      late-preterm babies greater than 34 weeks gestation.  Hypoxic respiratory failure occurs
      when a patient's lungs cannot get enough oxygen into their bloodstream.  This condition is
      traditionally treated with high concentrations of oxygen and most often requires the patient
      be placed on a ventilator (breathing machine). The administration of inhaled nitric oxygen
      directly into the lungs often improves blood oxygen levels and allows caretakers to reduce
      the amount of oxygen given to the baby.  The purpose of this research study is to evaluate
      if giving the inhaled nitric oxide earlier in the course of disease improves the
      effectiveness of the drug, reduces the amount of cellular injury from oxygen exposure, and
      decreases the total amount of time a patient requires supplemental oxygen.  This study uses
      an FDA approved drug in a new manner.
