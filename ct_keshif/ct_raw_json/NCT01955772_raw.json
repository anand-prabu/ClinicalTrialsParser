            "textblock": "Myeloablative allogeneic hematopoetic stem cell transplantation (AHSCT) are prone to\n      frequent secondary malnutrition to metabolic and digestive troubles due to conditioning\n      regimen, treatments (antibiotics, immunosuppressive therapy\u2026) and graft complications (graft\n      versus host disease). In the absence of appropriate nutritional support, myeloablative\n      conditioning lead to a rapid serious denutrition. But, it is known as negative independent\n      prognostic factor of overall survival of patients who presented malignant hemopathy treated\n      by high-dose chemotherapy or AHSCT. Furthermore, it increases hospitalisation delay and\n      decreases quality of life. In AHSCT with myeloablative conditioning, introduction of\n      nutritional support is recommended. However, type of nutritional support   remains not\n      clearly defined. Parenteral nutrition is user but favour infections and secondary effects\n      potentially decrease by intravenous glutamine. Few previous studies with low number of\n      patients, mainly retrospective or combining allo-and auto HSCT had shown feasibility,\n      acceptable tolerance and low cost of enteral nutrition (EN). A recent prospective\n      no-randomized study in 45 adults patients who had undergone AHSCT with myeloablative\n      conditioning find a significant decrease of day-100 mortality (5% vs 30%), of infection\n      mortality, of median duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) and prevalence of GvH (Graft\n      versus Host Disease) grade III-IV in EN (enteral nutrition) group. These results had to be\n      confirmed by a randomized study. As EN is 4 to 5 more cheaply than PN, besides\n      mortality/morbidity stakes for the patient, this study could have potential economic\n      interest."
