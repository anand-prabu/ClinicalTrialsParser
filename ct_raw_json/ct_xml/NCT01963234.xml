  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the research is to study the impact of a recovery support system called Seva
      on primary care organizations, where issues such as coordination of care, job satisfaction,
      and the cost of adopting and operating new technologies are critical. The study will also
      investigate how to best implement this kind of technology into health care delivery systems
      that care for people diagnosed with substance abuse.

    <description>To measure implementation progress, we will adapt our implementation model intervention into a specific implementation plan (including timetables) for each clinic. We employ the Stages of Implementation Completion model (Chamberlain et al., 2011) to assess the degree of implementation. Each of the 8 phases of the implementation completion model is prospectively broken down into discrete tasks and events. We will assess whether each task/event was implemented and the length of time each one took to implement. Starting at the beginning of the implementation planning period (4 months before the first patient accesses Seva), the checklist will be reviewed and updated monthly by the implementation program leader, with responses verified by the clinic coach.</description>

    <description>We will analyze computerized system log files to produce metrics about patterns of system adoption by patients and staff. We will assess the characteristics of staff members (job function, years with clinic, etc.) and patients (age, gender, race, etc.) to determine individual characteristics associated with the degree of adoption.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patient subjects must be 1) age 18 or older 2) be identified with a new drug treatment
        episode, and 3) meet criteria for Substance Use Disorder (SUD) according to the National
        Institute on Drug Abuse's modified-ASSIST screening instrument.  Clinician subjects
        referring patients will ensure that patients: 4) have no current psychotic disorder severe
        enough to prevent participation, 5) have no acute medical problem requiring immediate
        inpatient treatment, 6) are willing to use Seva, and 7) can understand and sign a consent
        form in English.

        Clinician subjects include MDs, behavioral health providers, nurses and management staff
        from the clinics' primary care and behavioral health departments.  Clinician must have an
        interest in the research objectives.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Failure to meet inclusion criteria above will exclude participants from
             participating.
