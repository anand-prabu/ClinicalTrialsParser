For\n      the rectal tumors suitable for ELAPE, most of them were circular or nearly circular\n      infiltrating tumors. Patients with these rectal tumors should receive full ELAPE resection.\n      In those rectal tumors not involving the levator ani muscle, the dissection plane may\n      continue close to the external anal sphincter and the levator ani muscle, leaving the\n      ischioanal fat and the terminal branches of the pudendal nerve intact.If the tumor has only\n      penetrated into 1 side of the levator ani muscle, the dissection might include the levator\n      ani muscle and the fat of the ischioanal fossa on the side of the tumor to achieve a clear\n      circumferential resection margin, whereas the ischioanal fat and levator ani muscle on the\n      other side of the tumor may be left\n\n      . This individual ELAPE may be as effective as conventional ELAPE while minimizing the\n      operative trauma and the damage to the nerves of the genital organs."
