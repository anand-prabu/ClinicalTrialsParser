  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the EVoluSIon study is to evaluate the SImmetry Sacroiliac Joint Fusion
      System for fusion of the SI joint and relief of SI joint pain symptoms.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized post market study designed to collect data on SI joint
      fusion and subject back pain following implant of the SImmetry device. Up to 10 sites and 50
      subjects will be implanted and followed through 24 months. Data will be collected
      pre-operatively, at implant hospitalization, discharge, and at specified follow-up time
      points through 24 months.

    <description>The SImmetry device is commercially available and consists of one 12.5mm SIJ Implant and one 6.5mm SIJ Implant. The implanted devices consist of a range of threaded, self-tapping, cannulated implants designed to transfix the sacrum and ilium, providing stability for intra-articular fusion.
The SImmetry Surgical Instruments consist of standard manual surgical instruments used to access and prepare the sacroiliac joint space for intra-articular fusion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be indicated for the SImmetry device according to the approved SImmetry
             labeling

          -  Subject has three (3) positive (experiences pain) Provocative Tests for SIJ pain; for
             example, Compression, Thigh Thrust, FABER, Distraction or Gaenslen's

          -  Subject has documentation of failed, non-operative management of SIJ pain for ≥ 6
             months prior to surgery; for example, use of medications, braces, SI belts,
             orthotics, physical therapy or manual manipulation

          -  The subject has two (2) positive diagnostic SIJ injections, fluoroscopically guided,
             with two different local anesthetics.  The first injection using a numbing agent
             (e.g. lidocaine) and the second injection using a different numbing agent (e.g.
             Bupivicaine) must both must result in a ≥75% decrease in pain from the anesthetic
             portion of the injection

          -  The subject has VAS back pain score of ≥ 60 mm

          -  The subject has an ODI ≥ 40%

          -  The subject is at least 18 years of age and skeletally mature

          -  The subject agrees and is able to comply with study requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects contraindicated per the cleared labeling will be excluded from participation
             in the study

          -  The subject has bi-lateral SIJ disease

          -  The subject has pelvic soft tissue or bony tumors

          -  The subject has had any trauma causing fracture of the sacrum or iliac bones or has
             had spinal trauma leading to a neurological deficit

          -  The subject has a history of a central nervous system (CNS) disorder(s)

          -  The subject has painful hip and/or knee arthrosis with potential progression to hip
             and/or knee arthroplasty

          -  The subject is indicated for or awaiting other spine surgery

          -  The subject is pregnant or is planning on becoming pregnant in the next two years

          -  The subject has uncontrolled insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (Type 1 Diabetes)

          -  The subject is a smoker

          -  The subject has chemical dependency abuse problems as evidenced by a history of
             abusing drugs which is documented in their past medical history or is elicited from
             an interview

          -  The subject is receiving or seeking worker's compensation, disability remuneration,
             and/or involved in litigation related to low back or SIJ pain

          -  The subject has a history of significant emotional or psychosocial disturbance
             (anxiety attacks, obsessive/compulsive disorders, depression or schizophrenia) as
             documented in their past medical history or elicited by an interview
