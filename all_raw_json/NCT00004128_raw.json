After\n      treatment, stem cells are collected from the patient's blood or bone marrow and stored. More\n      chemotherapy or radiation therapy is given prepare the bone marrow for the stem cell\n      transplant. The stem cells are then returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming\n      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Interleukin-2 may\n      stimulate the patient's white blood cells to kill cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying two different regimens of combination\n      chemotherapy, interleukin-2, and peripheral stem cell transplant and comparing them to see\n      how well they work in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia."

Patients in the first randomization are\n      stratified according to center, WBC (no greater than 25,000/mm^3 vs 25,000-99,000/mm^3 vs at\n      least 100,000/mm^3), age (15 to 45 vs 46 to 60), and performance status (0-1 vs 2 vs 3).\n      Patients in the second randomization are stratified according to center, first treatment arm\n      (I vs II), number of induction courses to reach complete remission (CR), cytogenic/molecular\n      genetic group at diagnosis (low vs high vs intermediate vs unknown), and autologous\n      peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation planned after consolidation (yes vs no).\n\n      First randomization\n\n        -  Induction: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms:\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive standard-dose cytarabine IV over 24 hours on days 1-10,\n                etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5, and daunorubicin IV over 5 minutes on days\n                1, 3, and 5.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive etoposide and daunorubicin as in arm I and high-dose\n                cytarabine IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days 1, 3, 5, and 7.\n\n        -  Consolidation: When CR is reached, patients receive intermediate-dose cytarabine IV\n           over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 1-6 and daunorubicin IV over 5 minutes prior to\n           cytarabine on days 4, 5, and 6.\n\n        -  Harvest: Patients who achieve CR and are ineligible for allogeneic PBSC transplantation\n           receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SQ) every 12 hours beginning 20 days after\n           starting consolidation treatment and continuing until autologous PBSC are harvested.\n           Autologous bone marrow is collected from patients with insufficient PBSC. Allogeneic\n           PBSC are harvested for patients who have an HLA identical donor. Allogeneic bone marrow\n           is harvested for high risk patients (under age 40) who have an unrelated bone marrow\n           donor.\n\n        -  Transplant preparative chemotherapy: It is recommended that patients receive\n           cyclophosphamide on 2 consecutive days and total body irradiation on 3 days OR busulfan\n           on days -8, -7, -6, and -5 followed by cyclophosphamide on days -4 and -3.\n\n        -  Transplantation: PBSC or bone marrow is infused on day 0.\n\n      Second randomization\n\n        -  Patients who achieve CR with full hematologic recovery but have no HLA identical donor\n           are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms no earlier than day 22 after stem cell\n           infusion.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive interleukin-2 SQ once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats\n                every 4 weeks for 1 year in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n                toxicity.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive no further treatment. Patients are followed at 1, 4, and\n                13 months, then every 4 months for 3 years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients (1,000 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      the first randomization and a total of 577 patients (288 per treatment arm) will be accrued\n      for the second randomization of this study."
