Untreated CMV retinitis is a rapidly progressive, blinding\n      disease in AIDS patients. The manner in which foscarnet breaks down in the body and the\n      effect of increasing periodic intravenous doses are also studied. Foscarnet is active in\n      vitro (test tube) against herpes viruses, including CMV, by inhibiting the virus DNA\n      polymerases, enzymes necessary for virus replication, without affecting cellular DNA\n      polymerases. Opportunistic CMV disease in AIDS is usually seen as retinitis, colitis,\n      esophagitis, hepatitis, pancreatitis, encephalitis, or pneumonia. Ganciclovir has been used\n      to treat AIDS patients with CMV disease but can cause severe neutropenia (very low\n      neutrophil cell counts). Foscarnet does not suppress the production of neutrophils or other\n      leukocytes (myelosuppression) and has shown in vitro activity against HIV."
