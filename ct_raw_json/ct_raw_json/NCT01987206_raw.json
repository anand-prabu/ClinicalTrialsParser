                "description": "The control algorithm, at its core, is a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)controller that incorporates an Internal Model Control (IMC) based tuning rule using an explicit model of human T1DM glucose-insulin dynamics. Parameters of the model are personalized based on a priori easily available subject parameters. This controller divides the control action into three components - the proportional distance between the current measurement and the target setpoint, the accumulated integral error as expressed by the area between the current state curve and the target set point over time, and the derivative rate of change of the current measurement.\nThe Health Monitoring System algorithm uses the same glucose monitoring (CGM) data as the PID control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for trending and predictions of future glucose values.  Using a redundant and independent algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device."

                "description": "The first control strategy is a flavor of Model Predictive Control (MPC) algorithm. MPC employs an explicit model of the process to be controlled when optimizing the input. Specifically, MPC controllers for glycemia control use a model of a human's T1DM insulin-glucose dynamics to predict the evolution of the blood glucose values over a so-called prediction horizon of controller steps, and optimize a predicted insulin input trajectory in order to optimize a specified cost objective that penalizes unsafe glycemic values, and also insulin usage.\nThe Health Monitoring System algorithm uses the same CGM data as the MPC control algorithm but utilizes a separate algorithm for trending and predictions of future glucose values.  Using a redundant and independent algorithm is an important safety feature of the overall AP device."

The 27.5-hour period includes: 2 announced meals\n      (dinner and breakfast of 65g and 50g CHO respectively) preceded with a dose of rapid-acting\n      insulin equivalent to 100% bolus based on each subject's Insulin to Carbohydrate (I:C) ratio\n      and 1 unannounced meal (lunch of 65g carbohydrates, same meal content as dinner); complete\n      night from 12:00 am to 7:00 am. The goal is to demonstrate that the AP device is able to\n      maintain the subject blood glucose within a safe range at all times."
