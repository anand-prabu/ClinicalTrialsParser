The overarching objective is\n      to improve patient compliance with the medication and ultimately clinical outcome.\n\n      In this pilot study, we will utilize a scientific approach for proof of concept employing\n      both objective (inflammatory cytokine profiles and Physical Therapy (PT) measurements) and\n      subjective (patient perception) methods to support an evidence based clinical plan. Patients\n      will be divided into two cohorts. Group A will receive AI therapy with a directed exercise\n      program.  Group B will receive AI therapy without a directed exercise program. Data will be\n      collected when both cohorts of patients enroll in the study, at the end of PT for Group A\n      and, at the end of 8 weeks for Group B. At these time points, both groups will undergo a PT\n      evaluation; have blood drawn for cytokine profiles; answer questions on an iPad that\n      includes: the Pain Disability Index, the PHQ-4 (Psycological Health  Questionaire depression\n      scale, and pain level scale."
