  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3-part study to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics,
      pharmacodynamics, and immunogenicity of MK-8226 in participants with moderate to severe
      atopic dermatitis.  Part 1 will be done to find the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of MK-8226
      and to assess safety and pharmacokinetics.  Part 2 will evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics,
      and preliminary efficacy.  Part 3, if done, will further define safety and pharmacokinetics,
      and will explore MK-8226 pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics to model the optimal dose range
      for future studies if Part 1 does not supply sufficient information to do this.

      Part 1 of the study is a multiple rising dose assessment of the safety, tolerability, and
      pharmacokinetics of MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment
      follow-up period.

      Part 2 of the study is an assessment of the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of MK-8226
      for 12 weeks followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period.

      An interim futility analysis will be performed when approximately 40% of the participants
      that have been treated with study drug have completed the active treatment portion of the
      study (Week 12) while additional patients will continue to be enrolled into Part 2 of the
      study. If the interim results support study continuation, additional participants may be
      enrolled in Part 3 of the study.

      In Part 3 of the study, participants will be treated with MK-8226 for a period of 12 weeks
      followed by a 20-week off-treatment follow-up period to evaluate pharmacokinetic and
      pharmacokinetic correlations to assist with modeling the dose range planned for further
      studies.
