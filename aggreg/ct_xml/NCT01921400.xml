      To evaluate for the presence of HCV Core protein, HCV RNA and SPP in the placenta and fetal
      membranes using paraffin-embedded sections and post-delivery specimens respectively.  In
      parallel, we will assess placental tissue for evidence of HCV infection using a novel in
      situ hybridization technique and translate our in vitro findings to these in vivo samples.

      Our overall hypothesis is that cytotrophoblasts at the maternal-fetal interface within the
      placenta serve as a &quot;barrier&quot; that must be crossed during vertical transmission and that
      cytotrophoblasts are permissive to HCV at a low level that may be enhanced under certain
      conditions.   By comparing the regulation of key steps in the intracellular life cycle of
      HCV in cytotrophoblasts to highly permissive hepatocytes, significant differences in HCV
      regulation should be revealed.

      Based on our preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that HCV Core protein is
      differentially processed in cytotrophoblasts compared to hepatocytes.

    <description>We will begin by examining paraffin-embedded sections from HCV-infected mothers who had the placentas sent to pathology for analysis.We will perform a combination of immunohistochemistry (IHC) and immunofluorescence (IF) to analyze the level of SPP expression in the trophoblast cell layer, as well as if HCV Core protein expression was detectable in this layer or in any cell type within the placental section.
We would also plan to identify other patient-derived tissues that were not paraffin embedded, both from uninfected patients and infected patients to validate different parts of our preliminary data.  We would plan to use dissected fetal membranes, which contain both chorion and amnion, to investigate the level of SPP expression in these tissues.</description>

      Our planned protocol will be to secure whole placental organs after delivery for study
      patients.  Tissue preparation will include a combination of segments preserved in nucleic
      acid preservative (TriZol or equivalent) and flash freeze of sections to preserve cellular
      anatomy.
