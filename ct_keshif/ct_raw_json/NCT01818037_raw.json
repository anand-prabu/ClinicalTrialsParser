At 1 year, the postoperative results showed that good visual\n      outcomes could be obtained in microphthalmic eyes.\n\n      Since only a few studies have reported outcomes, and that too only short term of cataract\n      surgery on microphthalmic eyes, in this prospective observational study we evaluated the\n      long-term impact of bilateral cataract surgery on eyes with microphthalmos. The\n      investigators examined the outcomes, complication rates, influence of age at surgery on\n      pattern of axial growth and central corneal thickness and visual and orthoptic assessment in\n      these eyes."
