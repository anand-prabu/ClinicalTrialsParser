  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this cross-sectional study is to obtain insight in the characteristics
      (nutritional status and level of physical activity) of sarcopenic compared to non-sarcopenic
      community-dwelling older people. There is one measurement moment and measurements will take
      place at the participant's home.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Characterization of sarcopenic older people (demographics, nutritional status, level of
           physical activity)

        -  Prevalence rates of sarcopenia in community-dwelling older people in the Netherlands

        -  Insight in differences and/or overlap between sarcopenia versus frailty

        -  Insight in the impact of sarcopenia on economic outcomes
