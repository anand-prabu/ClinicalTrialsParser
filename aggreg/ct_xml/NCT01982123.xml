      This pilot clinical trial studies single photon emission computed tomography
      (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) in measuring lung function in patients with lung cancer
      undergoing radiation therapy. Diagnostic procedures that measure lung function may help
      doctors find healthy lung tissue and allow them to plan better treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To utilize SPECT/CT imaging with technetium Tc-99m microaggregated albumin (99mTc-MAA)
      and 99mTc-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) to identify functional lung on
      serial imaging in patients receiving radiation treatment for lung cancer, as well as to
      characterize reproducibility of perfusion and ventilation in non-irradiated lung tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the dose response relationship on multiple spatial scales (global lung,
      regional lung, lung image voxel) between radiation dose and changes in lung ventilation and
      perfusion, both acutely (mid-radiation treatment) and long term (3 months post-treatment),
      using SPECT/CT imaging with 99mTc-MAA and 99mTc-DTPA.

      II. To estimate the degree of radiation response in lung tissue with varying levels of
      function (i.e. compare radiation dose response of well ventilated and well perfused tissue
      against lung tissue with poor perfusion and ventilation).

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate proton radiation therapy for functional lung sparing in lung cancer through
      treatment planning comparisons to conventional photon radiation therapy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo 99mTc-MAA and 99mTc-DTPA SPECT/CT at baseline, mid-radiation therapy (up to
      1 week post-treatment), and at 3-6 months post-treatment.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically.

    <description>For lung tissue inside the radiation field, changes in tracer uptake at the global lung, regional lung, and lung image voxel scales (compared to baseline) will be plotted against the radiation dose at the same scales to generate multiscale radiation dose response curves. These curves will be fit to linear and sigmoid dose-response functions. Lung regions in the upper quartile and lower quartile of ventilation and perfusion will also be separated out, and separate radiation dose response curves per region will be generated.</description>
