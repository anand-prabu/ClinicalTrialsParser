PET-MRI combines two imaging methods that can be used to evaluate disease. PET-MRI\n      is similar to standard-of-care PET-CT, but exposes the patient to less radiation. It is not\n      yet known whether PET-MRI produces better image quality than PET-CT in diagnosing patients\n      with cancer, cardiac disease, or neurologic disease."
