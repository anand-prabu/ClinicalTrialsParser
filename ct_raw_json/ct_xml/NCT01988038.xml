  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The design and establishment of the Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) Data Repository does not
      require, and may be constrained by, a narrowly conceived hypothesis. However, the PKD
      Repository has been designed to include demographic, clinical, biochemical, and genetic data
      that will further explore the natural history of the disorder and assess the factors that
      are likely to be associated with the progression of disease and the incidence of
      complications including renal failure, cardiovascular disease, and stroke.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this project is to collect data from a large population of patients with PKD.
      Based upon the estimated prevalence of PKD (1:500 and 1:1000 live births), it is estimated
      that there may be 10,000 PKD patients in the New York City area. This sample size far
      exceeds any database established thus far. As many as 40% of affected PKD patients are
      reportedly unaware of a family history of this disease, in part because many patients may go
      undiagnosed until they present with a medical complication (e.g., hypertension, kidney
      failure). Furthermore, this initiative will provide an opportunity to compare data from
      racially diverse populations.

        All patients enrolled in this study will have the diagnosis of autosomal dominant
        polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The diagnostic criteria for at-risk individuals (i.e.,
        with a first degree family member with ADPKD) includes the presence of at least two
        (unilateral or bilateral) renal cysts, and two cysts in each kidney are considered
        sufficient for diagnosis in aged 15 to 29 years and in 30 to 59 years, respectively. In
        families of unknown genotype, the presence of one or more (unilateral or bilateral) renal
        cysts is sufficient for establishing the diagnosis in individuals aged 15 to 29 years, two
        or more cysts in each kidney is sufficient for individuals aged 30-49 years.
