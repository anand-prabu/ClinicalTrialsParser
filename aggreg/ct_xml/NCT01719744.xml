  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 study of ENMD-2076 in patients with advanced/metastatic soft tissue
      sarcoma. This study will help to understand how well ENMD-2076 works and how safe and
      tolerable the drug is in this patient population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ENMD-2076 is an oral drug that works by blocking certain enzymes called Aurora A from
      working. These enzymes are needed for cells to divide including cancer cells. ENMD-2076 also
      works by stopping the growth of new blood vessels which would provide the tumor with
      nutrients for it to grow. It is believed that by blocking Aurora A enzymes from working and
      stopping new blood vessels from growing, the tumors may stop growing or shrink.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have documented histological diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma (e.g. leiomyosarcoma,
             synovial sarcoma, angiosarcoma and liposarcoma etc), with the exception of
             gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST).

          -  Meet revised RECIST criteria (version 1.1) within 4 weeks of entry by having
             measurable disease defined as one or more lesions that can be accurately measured in
             one or more dimensions.  Areas of previous radiation may not serve as measurable
             disease unless there has been objective interval tumor growth documented
             radiologically.

          -  Must have had no more than 1 line of treatment in the advanced/metastatic setting.
             The use of prior anti-angiogenic therapy is allowed. Previous neo-adjuvant or
             adjuvant therapies are allowed.

          -  Are at least 3 weeks from major surgery or radiation therapy and recovered; 3 weeks
             from any other previous anticancer therapy and recovered including biologics.

          -  Are ≥ 18 years of age

          -  The patient has a multigated acquisition (MUGA) scan with an actual left ventricular
             ejection fraction of greater than or equal to the institution lower limit of normal
             within one month prior to start of study.

          -  Have clinically acceptable laboratory screening results within certain limits
             specified below:

               -  AST and ALT ≤ 2.5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) or less than or equal to 5
                  times ULN if liver metastases are present

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 x ULN

               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 x ULN or &gt; 50 ml/min calculated by the Cockroft and Gault
                  formula (formula defined in appendix E).

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1500 cells/mm3

               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL

               -  INR ≤ 1.5

          -  Have an ECOG performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Patients must have and consent for access to archival material (for correlative
             studies). Patients who do not have archival material will be eligible if they consent
             for fresh tissue biopsy.

          -  Women of child producing potential must agree to use effective contraceptive methods
             prior to study entry, during study participation, and for at least 30 days after the
             last administration of study medication.  A serum pregnancy test within 72 hours
             prior to the initiation of therapy will be required for women of childbearing
             potential.

          -  Have the ability to understand the requirements of the study, provide written
             informed consent which includes authorization for release of protected health
             information, abide by the study restrictions, and agree to return for the required
             assessments.

          -  Able to tolerate oral medications.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women who are pregnant or nursing

          -  Have active, acute, or chronic clinically significant infections or bleeding.

             diastolic blood pressure greater than 100mmHg); or history of congestive heart
             failure (equal to or greater than Grade 2 classification by New York Heath
             Association).

          -  Have active angina pectoris, stroke or recent myocardial infarction (within 6
             months).

          -  Have chronic atrial fibrillation or QTc interval corrected for heart rate of greater
             than 480 msec.

          -  Have additional uncontrolled serious medical or psychiatric illness.

          -  Require therapeutic doses of anti-coagulation either by virtue of low-molecular
             weight heparin or coumadin (prophylactic anti-coagulation allowed).  Patients with
             previous history of deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism are also excluded.

          -  Known CNS metastases

          -  Have any medical condition that would impair the administration of oral agents
             including recurrent bowel obstructions, inflammatory bowel disease or uncontrolled
             nausea, vomiting or diarrhea

          -  Have 2+ protein by urinalysis. Patients with an ongoing or previous history of
             nephrotic syndrome will be excluded

          -  Have an additional malignancy diagnosed within 5 years of study enrollment with the
             exception of basal or squamous cell skin cancer or cervical cancer in situ

          -  Require treatment with drugs known to be potent inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 that
