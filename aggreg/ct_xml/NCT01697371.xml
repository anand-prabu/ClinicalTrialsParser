  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local control of hepatic metastases appears to be a major determinant of overall survival.
      However, many patients are not suitable for resection due to medical or surgical reasons.
      Therefore, there is an important role for a treatment that can provide the equivalent of
      tumor resection with minimal morbidity. Stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) delivers an
      ablative regimen of highly focused external beam radiotherapy that targets one or more
      discrete extracranial lesions. Published reports using SBRT to treat liver metastases have
      shown actuarial local control rates ranging from 50-100% with higher doses associated with
      better local control.

      In patients with metastatic liver disease, aggressive local therapy using modern
      radiotherapy techniques are promising and project to have a substantial role in the
      treatment of metastatic liver cancer to treat unresectable disease. The dosimetric advantage
      of proton therapy may lead to improved clinical outcomes with less morbidity, however, there
      is no clinical data to confirm this assertion. We thus propose a phase I study to determine
      the feasibility and safety of stereotactic body proton therapy in patients with liver
      metastases followed by a phase II study to determine the efficacy of such treatment on local
      control.
