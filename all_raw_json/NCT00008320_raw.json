Determine the time to progression in patients\n      treated with this regimen. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n      IV. Assess the quality of life of these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Topical ceramide cream is applied to all cutaneous lesions twice daily. Courses\n      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality\n      of life is assessed at baseline and then at 1 and 3 months. Patients are followed every 3\n      months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22 patients will be accrued for this study within 27 months."
