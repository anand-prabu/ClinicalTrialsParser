Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      blinatumomab, find cancer cells and help kill them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      prednisone, vincristine sulfate, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine, work in different ways to\n      stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from\n      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Dasatinib may stop the growth of cancer cells\n      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving blinatumomab with combination\n      chemotherapy or dasatinib and prednisone may kill more cancer cells."
