These unnecessary admissions are increasing for several years,\n      reaching rates of over 30% in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or\n      heart failure at two months of hospital discharge. There is scientific evidence suggesting\n      that a multidisciplinary intervention consisting in  controling disease and stress\n      associated with disease, and modifying eating habits could reduce the number of\n      hospitalizations due to disease decompensation.\n\n      The main objective of the study is to assess the rate of readmissions at year of\n      multidisciplinary intervention in patients with COPD and / or heart failure.\n\n      We will select 144 patients who will be randomized to two groups (control and intervention\n      group) and they will be followed for 12 months through 4 visits  (1 month, 3 months, 6\n      months and 12 months of hospital discharge).\n\n      Patients assigned to the intervention group will be receive three educational sessions (one\n      of them will be imparted by nursing, another by the nutritionist and the last one by the\n      psychologist). In addition, patients with a BMI <20 and / or> 30 will receive a closer\n      monitoring by the nutritionist).\n\n      Patients assigned to the control group will receive usual care in clinical practice."
