  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lack of appetite and weight loss are a common side effect of ADHD therapy with amphetamines
      such as methylphenidate.  Lack of sufficient food intake has been shown to have negative
      effects on weight and height as well as learning and memory.

      There is no current treatment to prevent this loss of appetite except discontinuation or
      reduction of the methylphenidate. Discontinuation or reduction of the drug can cause the
      return of ADHD symptoms.

      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects, good and/or bad, of two doses of a
      drug, cyproheptadine, vs placebo to find out if cyproheptadine prevents the appetite
      suppression associated with methylphenidate.

             informed consent is obtained

          -  Patients must meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth
             Edition (DSM-IV) diagnostic criteria for ADHD (any subtype) and score at least 1.5
             standard deviations above the age norm for their diagnostic subtype using published
             norms for the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire:
             Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Subscale (SNAP-IV ADHD Subscale) score at
             both Visit 1 and 2

          -  Laboratory results, including serum chemistries, hematology, and urinalysis, must
             show no clinically significant abnormalities (clinically significant is defined as
             laboratory values requiring acute medical intervention, indicating a serious medical
             illness, or requiring further medical evaluation in the judgment of the investigator)

          -  Patients and parents have been judged by the investigator to be reliable to keep
             appointments for clinic visits and all tests, including venipuncture, and
             examinations required by the protocol.

          -  Patient has not been on stimulants for at least 2 weeks.

        Exclusion Criteria:

             items 4 and 5 of the C-SSRS within the past year, 2) suicidal behaviors detected by
             the C-SSRS during the past two years; or 3) psychiatric interview and examination

          -  Patients with significant cardiovascular disease or other conditions that could be
             aggravated by an increased heart rate or increased blood pressure

          -  Patients who have any medical condition that would increase sympathetic nervous
             system activity markedly (for example, catecholamine-secreting neural tumor), or who
             are taking a medication on a daily basis (for example, albuterol, inhalation
             aerosols, pseudoephedrine), that has sympathomimetic activity. Such medications can
             be taken on an as-needed basis

          -  Presence of contraindications for methylphenidate or cyproheptadine hydrochloride

          -  Patients who have had prior serious adverse reaction to stimulants.

          -  Parental or (immediate) family history of substance abuse
