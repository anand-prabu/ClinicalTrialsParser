Tumor budding is a histological phenomenon that reflect loss of adhesion between tumor cells in the stroma of the invasive front of colorectal cancers. It is present if more than five groups containing 1-4 cancer cells each, within a microscopic area on x20 (Uneo et al (x25), 2002 and Mitrovic et al (x20), 2012).",
