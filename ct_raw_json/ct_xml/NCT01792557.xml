      Although surgical techniques such as limberg flap. modified limberg flap and karydakis are
      currently most popular treatment methods for pilonidal disease, crystallized phenol
      application is also successfully used for pilonidal sinus treatment by different centers. We
      believe crystallized phenol application could become a good alternative to popular surgical
      interventions using transposition flaps.

    <textblock>
      Pilonidal sinus disease (PSD) is usually located at sacrococcygeal region of the body and
      mostly effect young males causing loss of labor and school time. Its incidence is reported
      26 per 100000 in a Norwegian study. Although there are many treatment modalities either
      surgical or conservative, ideal treatment is still a matter of debate. Surgical techniques
      such as limberg flap, modified limberg flap and karydakis are most popular treatment methods
      for pilonidal disease crystallized phenol application is also successfully used for
      pilonidal sinus treatment by different centers. We would like to compare flap techniques and
      crystallized phenol application for complications, recurrence, patient comfort, duration of
      recovery and return to work. We believe crystallized phenol application could become a good
      alternative to popular surgical interventions using transposition flaps.

    <description>Crystallized phenol application for pilonidal disease treatment. After sacrococcygeal region of the patient is cleaned from hairs, hairs inside the sinus are removed than crystallized phenol is applied in to the cleaned sinus. Following 2 minutes of phenol exposure, crystallized phenol is removed from the sinus. Crystallized phenol application will be repeated weekly for 4 weeks.</description>
