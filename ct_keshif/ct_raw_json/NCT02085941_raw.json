All tumor shapes and sizes will be eligible for ablation.\n\n          -  Participants must have sustained all available treatment options (radiation,\n             chemotherapy, surgery) as verified by the Dana Farber Cancer Institute's Head and\n             Neck Tumor Board. These cases will be reviewed by a team of medical oncologists,\n             radiologists, radiation oncologists, and surgical oncologists.\n\n          -  Participants must have an advanced head, neck or spine malignant tumor that would\n             potentially benefit from a minimally invasive procedure.\n\n          -  Age 18 years or older\n\n             -- Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the use of\n             cryoablation  in participants < 18 years of age, children are excluded from this\n             study but will be eligible for future pediatric III trials.\n\n          -  Life expectancy of greater than 8 weeks in the opinion of the referring clinician.\n\n          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status \u2264 2 (see Appendix A).\n\n          -  Participants must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:\n\n               -  Leukocytes  \u2265 3,000/microliter (mcL)\n\n               -  Absolute neutrophil count  \u2265 1,500/mcL\n\n               -  Platelets  \u2265 100,000/microliter (mcL)\n\n               -  Total bilirubin within normal institutional limits\n\n               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/Alanine aminotransferease (ALT) \u2264 2.5 X\n                  institutional upper limit of normal\n\n               -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits or creatinine clearance \u2265 60\n                  mL/min/1.73 m2 for subjects with creatinine levels about institutional normal\n                                .\n\n          -  Cryoablation can be performed near vessels of the head and neck, and if deemed\n             necessary tumor may be displaced using a saline injection (hydrodisplacement). Tumor\n             displacement from nerves may be required and will be performed as deemed appropriate\n             to avoid nerve injury.\n\n          -  The effects of cryoablation on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this\n             reason women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate\n             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to\n             study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become\n             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should\n             inform her treating physician immediately.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n             document.\n\n          -  MRI-Guided Cryoablation Criteria-Cohort 1\n\n             -- Participants must have a mass that is well-visualized under MRI. Since positron\n             emission tomography-computed tomography (PET-CT) guidance requires the nuclear\n             medicine department to administer a radionuclide material, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG),\n             the default will be to try to use MRI guidance.\n\n          -  PET/CT-Guided Cryoablation Criteria-Cohort 2 -- Patients must have a mass that is\n             well visualized under PET/CT. Tumors that are not clearly seen by MRI but showing on\n             PET/CT will be ablated with PET/CT guidance.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Participants who exhibit any of the following conditions at screening will not be\n             eligible for admission into the study.\n\n          -  Participants with tumors involving the optic chiasm, brain, or spinal cord will not\n             be eligible for participation in this study. Furthermore, tumors that encase any\n             major blood vessel (carotid, jugular, vertebral) will be excluded from the study due\n             to inability to displace these masses.\n\n          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for\n             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not\n             recovered from adverse events due to agents administered more than 4 weeks earlier.\n\n          -  Participants may not be receiving any other study agents.\n\n          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic\n             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse\n             events.\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to gadolinium contrast agents, if contrast use is anticipated during the\n             procedure.\n\n          -  Participants with a blood glucose level of > 200mg/dl prior to the baseline study,\n             known ischemic disease, and/or impaired renal function (eGFR < 60ml/min) will not be\n             eligible for this study.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium is a contrast agent\n             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an\n             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with gadolinium, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the\n             mother is treated with gadolinium.\n\n          -  MRI-Guided Cryoablation Exclusion Criteria-Cohort 1\n\n          -  -Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium is a contrast agent\n             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an\n             unknown but potential risk of adverse events in nursing infants secondary to\n             treatment of the mother with gadolinium, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the\n             mother is treated with gadolinium.\n\n          -  PET/CT-Guided Cryoablation Exclusion Criteria-Cohort 2\n\n               -  Based on potential risks of fetal loss, teratogenicity, fetal growth retardation\n                  and carcinogenesis, PET/CT with FDG is contraindicated in the pregnant patient.\n\n               -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because FDG with PET/CT is a\n                  radioactive diagnostic agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient\n                  effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk of adverse events in\n                  nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with FDG breastfeeding\n                  should be discontinued if the mother is treated with F-FDG."
