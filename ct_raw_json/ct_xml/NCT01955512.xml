  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In asthma, breathing in an allergen, such as house dust mite induces inflammation in the
      airways. This process appears to involve an interaction between two different sorts of blood
      cells, platelets and white blood cells via a receptor called the P2Y12 receptor. The purpose
      of this study is to determine whether the drug clopidogrel which blocks the P2Y12 receptor
      on platelets, reduces inflammation following breathing in house dust mite in people with
      mild asthma.
