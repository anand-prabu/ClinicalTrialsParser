Curcumin may be effective in preventing the development of colon\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to determine the dose amount of curcumin that can be tolerated to\n      help in preventing colon cancer in healthy men and women."

The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicities. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients are accrued to\n      receive curcumin in the pharmacokinetic phase of the study.\n\n      Patients are followed at 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for the dose escalation phase\n      and then 12 additional patients will be accrued for the pharmacokinetic phase of this study\n      within 3 months."
