A PET scan is a procedure in which a small amount of\n      radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein, and a scanner is used to make detailed,\n      computerized pictures of areas inside the body where the glucose is taken up. Because cancer\n      cells often take up more glucose than normal cells, the pictures can be used to find cancer\n      cells in the body. PET/CT using the drug fluorine F 18 d-FMAU, may help find cancer and find\n      out how far the disease has spread."
