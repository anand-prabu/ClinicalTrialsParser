Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet\n      known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective when combined with radiation therapy for\n      treating medulloblastoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare two combination chemotherapy treatments plus\n      radiation therapy in treating children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Assess whether a cyclophosphamide-containing combination chemotherapy regimen\n      increases progression-free survival compared to a lomustine-containing regimen in children\n      with newly diagnosed, average-risk medulloblastoma. II. Determine progression-free and\n      overall survival of children treated with craniospinal radiotherapy and local boost\n      radiotherapy for a total dose of 5580 cGy followed by adjuvant\n      lomustine/cisplatin/vincristine vs. cyclophosphamide/cisplatin/vincristine. III. Determine\n      the long-term neurocognitive, endocrinologic, and cardiopulmonary sequelae associated with\n      craniospinal radiotherapy, local boost radiotherapy, and adjuvant chemotherapy in these\n      children, and determine whether replacement of lomustine with cyclophosphamide alters the\n      incidence and degree of sequelae. IV. Determine whether cellular and biologic parameters,\n      including tumor molecular genetic analysis, DNA ploidy, mitotic activity markers, and\n      immunohistochemical analysis, are correlated with progression-free survival, overall\n      survival, and patterns of disease relapse in these patients. V. Evaluate the utility of\n      routine magnetic resonance imaging surveillance studies of the head and spine in detecting\n      subclinical recurrent disease.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by participating institution.\n      Following surgery, patients are randomized to one of two groups. The first group receives\n      craniospinal irradiation followed by a boost to the primary tumor. Beginning within 1 week\n      after initiation of radiotherapy, patients receive vincristine weekly for 8 doses. Beginning\n      6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy, patients receive adjuvant\n      lomustine/vincristine/cisplatin every 6 weeks for a total of 8 courses. The second group\n      receives craniospinal irradiation plus vincristine as above, followed by adjuvant\n      cyclophosphamide/vincristine/cisplatin every 6 weeks for a total of 8 courses. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: It is anticipated that 240-300 patients will be entered over 4 years."
