Disturbances in\n      endothelial function are implicated in its pathogenesis. Endothelial function also depends\n      on endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) that enhance angiogenesis, promote vascular repair\n      and have potential as a marker of cardiovascular disease. Systemic lupus erythematosus\n      patients have endothelial dysfunction and fewer EPCs. There are studies showing improvement\n      of endothelial function and EPCs after physical exercise program in individuals with heart\n      failure, diabetes and coronary arterial disease, but there isn't studies evaluating\n      endothelial function and EPCs after."
