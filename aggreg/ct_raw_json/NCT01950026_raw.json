This study was approved by the Ethics Committee\n      of the Universidade Paulista - UNIP under protocol number 125 608 of 18/10/2012.\n\n      The study included 24 subjects randomly recruited from both sexes and from four different\n      ethnic groups: white, brown, black and asian with different ages, individuals intolerant to\n      cold, suffering any change in skin sensitivity, illness from infectious diseases or\n      previously diagnosed to respond negatively to the use of cold were excluded.\n\n      The survey was conducted in the clinic Physiotherapy Universidade Paulista - UNIP in light\n      and airy ambience, with recording of the mean daily temperature in degrees Celsius planned\n      for the capital of S\u00e3o Paulo by newsletter Climatempo available and accessed\n      http://www.climatempo.com.br/previsao-do-tempo/cidade/ Before all applications, the average\n      temperature obtained in the days from the application was 21.93\u00b0 Celsius.\n\n      For obtaining of personal data and anthropometric evaluations, a data sheet prepared by the\n      authors to self-fulfillment, and then calculated the BMI of subjects, if in doubt, check the\n      height and body mass was performed before the application of cryotherapy. Participants were\n      divided into 4 groups of different ethnicities - white, brown, black and asian; ethnicity\n      was proven through the birth certificates of volunteers, according to the classification\n      described by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics - IBGE.\n\n      All participants were maintained in supine position for 20 minutes to rest and stabilization\n      of body temperature, sleep after receiving an application through the cold thermal bag\n      Thermo Gel \u00ae brand size \"P\" consisting of a cellulose-based gel for subsequently receiving\n      of cryotherapy in the middle third of the right thigh and left earlier, leaving 15-20 cm\n      from the anterior superior iliac spine - ASIS side tested, depending on the stature of the\n      individual being assessed and 5 cm away from the surface to be evaluated, according to\n      manufacturer's instructions. The temperature was verified on site described before, during\n      and after applications of cryotherapy which lasted for 30 minutes and then recorded. To\n      check the temperature after application of cryotherapy was used a thermometer brand CASON \u00ae\n      INFRARED THERMOMETER AC 380 (- 32 \u00ba C 380 \u00ba C)."
