In innovative colonoscopy\n      group narrow band imaging (NBI) and Dual Focus (DF) function will be used to identify and\n      classify all lesions acc. to Sano and Kudo classification. Endoscopic biopsy will be taken\n      from all lesion and endoscopic diagnosis will be compared with final histological diagnosis.\n      Thus sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic accuracy, predictive values, likelihood ratio and\n      Youden index will be calculated. As secondary endpoints total examination time, coecal\n      intubation rate and pain intensity (VAS scale) will be established. This study will help to\n      establish whether new technologies used during colonoscopy may improve diagnostic\n      possibilities and whether they prolong examination time or lead to increase of pain\n      intensity afterwards."
