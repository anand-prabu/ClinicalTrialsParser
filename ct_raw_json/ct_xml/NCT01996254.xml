  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) can safely and effectively reduce post-amputation pain. This study involves a
      device called the Smartpatch System. The Smartpatch System delivers mild electrical
      stimulation to nerves in the residual limb. The Smartpatch System includes a small wire
      (called a &quot;lead&quot;) that is placed through the skin in the upper leg. It also includes a
      device worn on the body that delivers stimulation (called the Smartpatch Stimulator).
