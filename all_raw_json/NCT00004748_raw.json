Compare the efficacy of low-dose oral pulse methotrexate (MTX) and ursodiol versus\n      colchicine and ursodiol in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC).\n\n      II.  Determine the optimum dose and duration of MTX treatment.\n\n      III.  Investigate the role of fibrogenic cytokines (FC) in PBC pathogenesis and the effect\n      of treatment on FC production."

Patients are stratified by prior/concurrent\n      medical management.\n\n      Patients in the first group are treated with oral methotrexate 3 times a week and a daily\n      oral placebo.\n\n      Patients in the second group are treated with daily oral colchicine and an oral placebo 3\n      times a week.\n\n      Therapy continues for 10 years.  Beginning year 2, daily oral ursodiol is administered to\n      all patients.  Patients with disease progression are crossed to the alternate group or\n      undergo liver transplantation if clinically indicated."
