Occurrence of hypnosis will be confirmed with both the loss of eyelash-reflex and failing of flexed-holding arm. Time and number of breaths needed for the loss of consciousness will be noted. Existence of hiccup, cough, increase in secretions, and refusal of the mask by the patient will be reported if any. All patients will be extubated and released to the ward after they are questioned about any discomfort or issue they want to report to anesthesiologist",
