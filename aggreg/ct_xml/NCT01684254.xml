  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present project will focus on evaluating the technical efficacy of the in-shoe gait
      monitoring device (ActiveGait) through laboratory based biomechanical gait assessments of
      children who exhibit gait deviations due to CP or idiopathic toe walking wearing the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators on this protocol intend to develop the device and rely on it to propose a
      Toe Walk Severity (TWS) index, a novel outcome measure for quantifying changes in severity
      of toe walking over time and for assessing the outcome of surgical and non-surgical
      interventions.

      Tasks include:

      A.Validate data acquisition measurements in laboratory setting compared to gold-standard
      video analysis and field (outside of laboratory).

      B.Develop multi-stage classification algorithm from subset of laboratory and field data.

      C.Validate classification algorithm against random subsets of laboratory and field data.

      D.Explore the development of a Toe Walking Severity (TWS) index from available biomechanical
      and ActiveGait data for different ambulatory conditions.

      E.Perform longitudinal study of the childhood toe walking population including both
      laboratory analysis and at-home monitoring using ActiveGait technology.

      F.Analyze statistically the sensitivity and specificity of the TWS index compared to
      clinical observations. Gather evidence that the TWS index provides a means to track changes
      in severity of toe walking over time.
