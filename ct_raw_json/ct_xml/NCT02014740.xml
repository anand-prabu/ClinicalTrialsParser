  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to learn about the effect of Liraglutide, (Victoza®),
      on the fat surrounding the heart.Excessive amount of the fat around the heart is common in
      people with type 2 diabetes and can be associated with  poor sugar control. Liraglutide is
      an injectable prescription medicine that can improve blood sugar control in adults with type
      2 diabetes.

    <description>Echocardiographic epicardial fat thickness is an non invasive, inexpensive, reproducible and direct measure of visceral fat. In fact, epicardial fat strongly reflects the intra-abdominal and intra-myocardial fat accumulation as measured by magnetic resonance imaging procedures.</description>

    <description>•	L-group will be started and dose-escalated to 1.8mg sc once daily according to below schedule: Liraglutide will be administered with a starting dose of 0.6 mg (after a least one week) and subsequent increments to 1.2 mg (after a least one week) and to 1.8 mg (after at least a week on 1.2 mg). L-group subjects will need to achieve the final dose of 1.8 mg by at least three weeks from the starting dose. Subjects who would not be able to achieve the dose of 1.8 mg (due to potential side effects) will be advised to lower the dose to 1.2 mg. Metformin regimen will be continued.</description>
