Strategy 1 - Patient and physician-specific written educational material. Pilot-tested\n      customized written educational material about bone health for men on ADT will be used for\n      this study. A customized letter will be prepared for the patient's primary care physician,\n      with specific advice and recommendations for the targeted strategies. Both pamphlet and\n      letter will include a list of additional resources. Strategy 2 - patient written material\n      and a bone health care coordinator (BHCC). The same written patient material as in strategy\n      1 will be used, along with a BHCC who will follow the approach of successful studies and\n      contact the patient by phone or arrange an in-person visit at the hospital if preferred by\n      the patient. The BHCC will also encourage the patient to pursue a bone mineral density test\n      (BMD) with their physician and adopt bone-appropriate diet, lifestyle, and supplement intake\n      recommendations, and will follow up with the patient at least twice over the next 3 months\n      to facilitate behavioural changes and BMD ordering. Counselling sessions are short,\n      typically <15 min. The BHCC will also contact the patient's physician to help facilitate BMD\n      testing. Time points in the study are baseline, 3-month follow up, and 6-month follow up.\n\n      Control group The control group consists of a wait-list control for 6 months, during which\n      no specific recommendations or interventions will be made by the study team. Prostate Cancer\n      (PC) clinicians  can still provide usual care. At the end of 6 months, control group\n      participants will be referred to the Osteoporosis Clinic at the University Health Network."
