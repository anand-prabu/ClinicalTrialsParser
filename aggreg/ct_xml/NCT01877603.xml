  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irisin  is  a  signaling  protein  that  is  released  into  the  blood from  skeletal
      muscle  after  proteolysis  of  the  membrane protein  FNDC5 .  FNDC5,  encoded  by  the
      Fndc5  gene. Irisin activity  on  subcutaneous  white  adipose  tissue,  both  in  culture
      and  in  vivo,  stimulated  UCP1  expression  and  induction  of brown  adipocytes  in
      white  adipose  tissue  depots,  a  process known  as  white  fat  ''browning''.  Irisin
      increases  total energy  expenditure  in  animal  models,  and  irisin  expression  in mice
      fed  a  high  fat  diet  resulted  in  a  significant  improvement in  glucose  tolerance
      and  a  reduction  in  fasting  insulin  levels.  Collectively,  these  data  suggest  that
      decreased  serum irisin  levels  may  be  associated  with  the  development  of  insulin
      resistance  and  Type 2 diabetes. Indeed,  some studies showed that  irisin  levels  were
      decreased  in  newly  diagnosed  Type 2 diabetes.

      Endothelial dysfunction is an early physiological event in atherosclerosis. However, to
      date, no data are available on the relationship between circulating irisin and endothelial
      dysfunction in diabetes. Therefore, the investigators hypothesized that circulating irisin
      level is associated with endothelial dysfunction.

        From July 2013 to Dec 2013, a total of 200 Chinese Han newly diagnosed type 2 diabetic
        patients were selected. They had been referred to our hospital and were aged 40～70 years.

        During the same period, 50 healthy subjects (all from medical staff in our hospital) were
        selected as control subjects.
