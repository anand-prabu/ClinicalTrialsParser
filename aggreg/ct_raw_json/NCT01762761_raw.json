PK sampling and assessments will occur at\n      the Week 2 visit during stage 2 of the study, when all subjects are receiving eltrombopag.\n      After the completion of stage 2, subjects may continue the eltrombopag treatment in stage 3,\n      if he/she can benefit from the continuous eltrombopag treatment based on investigator's\n      judgement.\n\n      The initial dose of eltrombopag administration is 25 mg orally once daily. During the 8\n      weeks double-blind treatment, dose of investigational product will be adjusted according to\n      the weekly subject platelet count.\n\n      The eligible subjects who have completed stage 1 (8 weeks of double-blind treatment period:\n      the first 6 weeks data will be used for primary endpoint analysis and the last 2 weeks will\n      be data clean period during which period the blinded treatment is continued as to the first\n      6 weeks) would enter a voluntary open-label stage 2 (24-week open-label extension phase) in\n      which subjects from both eltrombopag group and placebo group will have the opportunity to\n      receive eltrombopag treatment. Subjects unwilling or unqualified (such as the subjects who\n      meet the stopping criteria) to participate in extension treatment will attend follow-up\n      visits for 4 weeks after the completion of double-blind phase. During open-label stage 2\n      during which period all eligible subjects will receive open label eltrombopag treatment. The\n      dose of eltrombopag will be continuously adjusted according to the subject's platelet count.\n\n      Following completion of Stage 2, if the subject benefits from the eltrombopag treatment\n      based on investigator's discretion, the subject can voluntarily enter stage 3, during which\n      the subject will continue eltrombopag treatment until the commercial launch of eltrombopag\n      in China."
