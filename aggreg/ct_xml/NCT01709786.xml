  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the accuracy of two rapid methods of measuring hemoglobin in
      patients with suspected hemorrhage.  These methods will be compared with standard laboratory
      measurements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anemia and bleeding are major causes of morbidity and mortality in both surgical and
      nonsurgical patients.  The current standard of care for monitoring patients at risk for
      bleeding is serial measurement of hemoglobin levels.  At present, the photometric
      cyanmethemoglobin method is the most widely used technique for monitoring hemoglobin in the
      lab, and is currently the gold standard. However, this method has potential for delay before
      final results are obtained.

      Immediate hemoglobin measurements are available with portable point-of-care devices such as
      the iSTAT, which can produce a measurement of hemoglobin concentration in less than 1
      minute. Unfortunately, the accuracy of this device has been reported to vary with hemoglobin
      level, and as such may not be as accurate in detecting blood loss when compared with the
      gold standard of laboratory analysis.

      Recently, a noninvasive, spectrophotometry-based monitoring technology has been developed.
      This novel technology measures the differential optical density of wavelengths of light
      passed through the finger in a method similar to conventional pulse oximetry. While some
      studies have reported that this device appears to be accurate in patients undergoing
      elective surgical procedures,   more recent work suggests that this accuracy degrades with
      increased blood loss, lower oximeter signal quality and lower absolute Hgb values.

      We will evaluate the accuracy of point-of-care and non-invasive SpHb measurements and
      utility of continuous hemoglobin monitoring in an intensive care unit setting.  If these
      methods of rapid hemoglobin measurement can be validated in patients at risk for ongoing
      hemorrhage, use of this technology may result in earlier detection of ongoing hemorrhage,
      expedite appropriate treatment, and improve patient outcomes.

        Patients admitted to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit of University Hospital, Cincinnati
        will be eligible for this study if they are at risk of ongoing bleeding and require serial
        CBC measurements.  A patient will not be eligible if he or she is:(1) less than 18 years
        of age, (2) a prisoner, or if (3) clinicians are unable to take pulse oximetry readings
        due to injuries, burns, amputations, or related problems.
