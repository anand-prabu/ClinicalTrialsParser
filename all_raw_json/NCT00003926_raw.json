Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells. Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the\n      side effects of high-dose chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in protecting from the side\n      effects of peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have high-risk or\n      relapsed solid tumors."

Patients are stratified according to\n      age (1 to 18 vs 19 to 45 years).\n\n      All patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) IV for 1 week. On day 6 of G-CSF administration,\n      patients undergo peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) harvest followed by chemotherapy.\n\n      Patients receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -8 to -6 followed by melphalan IV over\n      30 minutes on days -5 and -4 and thiotepa IV over 2 hours on days -3 and -2. Patients\n      receive amifostine IV over 5 minutes beginning 30 minutes prior to melphalan and thiotepa\n      administration on days -5 to -1. PBSC are reinfused on day 0.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of amifostine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed on day 50; at 3, 6, and 9 months; and at 1, 2, and 3 years post PBSC\n      transplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
