The study hypothesis is that obesity cannot be reduced\n      just by distributing nutritional information. Instead, by influencing also the eating\n      behavior  such permanent lifestyle changes can be achieved. The effect of the therapy along\n      the time-line, the health information literacy of the study persons and the changes in it\n      will be studied at different phases of the intervention. The research will be carried out in\n      three groups of different nutritional therapies with a parallel ICT-intervention group for\n      each."
