Thrombolysis in\n      Myocardial Infraction (TIMI) flow will be measured in all patients undergoing angiography,\n      and fractional flow reserve (FFR) will be measured in all patients except those with TIMI\n      flow =0, 1 and 2. All imaging procedures must be completed within 6 weeks.  All patients\n      will have a follow-up visit at 6 months after enrolment.During the 6 month follow-up visit\n      major adverse cardiovascular events will be collected and adjudicated by an clinical\n      endpoint committee (CEC)."
