This system will study the parturient's pattern of analgesic\n      use in 15 min epochs and titrate the demand doses and basal infusion rate to maintain a\n      plasma level of remifentanil that is appropriate for the degree of pain felt.\n\n      The system incorporates vital signs (pulse oximetry and heart rate values) into the\n      algorithm which would temporarily stop the pumps and step down doses accordingly when\n      predefined critical values are reached."
