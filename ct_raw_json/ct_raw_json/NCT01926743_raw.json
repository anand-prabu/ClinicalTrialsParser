Realistically, it is impossible to\n      identify complete removal of lymph node in dissected nodal station by naked eye. The\n      investigators can assess the route of lymphatic drainage and identify residual lymph nodes\n      in dissected area. In the field of gastric cancer treatment, ICG and near infra-red\n      fluorescence imaging was used only detection of sentinel lymph nodes. However, this novel\n      concept can help to understand lymphatic drainage and make surgeons to perform D1+ or D2\n      lymph node dissection completely."
