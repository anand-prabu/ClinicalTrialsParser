    <textblock>
      Nutrasorb is a newly developed food product (see www.nutrasorb.com).  This study will use
      the Nutrasorb soy protein product that is matrixed with polyphenols from blueberries and
      green tea extract, and test for efficacy as a nutritional countermeasure to exercise-induced
      physiologic stress (i.e., immune dysfunction, inflammation, and oxidative stress) using both
      traditional and metabolomics-based outcome measures.
