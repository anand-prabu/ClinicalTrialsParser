  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if an antibody called Humanized 3F8 (Hu3F8)
      combined with granulocyte- macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) is safe for
      treating neuroblastoma.

    <description>Once cycle consists of treatment with hu3F8 for 3 days (day 1, 3 and 5). GM-CSF is started 5 days in advance of each hu3F8 cycle at 250 mcg/m2/day (day -4 to day 0), and at 500 mcg/m2/day x 5 days (day 1 to day 5). Cycles are  5 days. Cycles are repeated at 2-4 week intervals between first days of hu3F8, through 4 cycles. Patients who complete 4 cycles of treatment without complications or disease progression have the option of continuing treatment for up to 24 months from their first dose of hu3F8.</description>

             Pathology), or b) BM metastases or MIBG-avid lesion(s) plus high urine catecholamine
             levels.

          -  Patients must have either refractory or relapsed high-risk NB (including

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Existing major organ dysfunction &gt; grade 2, with the exception of hearing loss and
             hematologic toxicity (defined as suppression of all subtypes of WBCs, RBCs, and
             platelets).

          -  Active life-threatening infection.

          -  Pregnant women or women who are breast-feeding.

          -  Inability to comply with protocol requirements, including PK studies and genetic
             studies.
