      The purpose of this study is the validation of a newly developed self-report questionnaire
      which aims at determining the prevalence, location and intensity of SWAllowing difficulties
      with drug intake, and describing the impact on MEdication regimen focusing on coping
      strategies and COmpliance issues (SWAMECO).

      The study aims at investigating a cohort of patients with diagnosed systemic sclerosis using
      the newly developed self-report SWAMECO-questionnaire.

      The self-report questionnaire is sub-divided into four sections: detection of swallowing
      difficulties, coping strategies, risk factors to develop swallowing difficulties and
      adherence to medication.

      This study involves patients with systemic sclerosis. Systemic sclerosis often is
      accompanied by swallowing disorders which may lead to issues in handling medication regimen
      with risks for patient safety.
