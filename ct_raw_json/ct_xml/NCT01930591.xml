  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor is a first line therapy along with aspirin for patients undergoing primary PCI
      for STEMI. However, many patients are still treated with fibrinolytic therapy and the safety
      and efficacy of Ticagrelor has not been investigated in this patients population. The
      present study is proposed to study the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor in patients
      undergoing PCI post fibrinolytic therapy for STEMI.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The newer antiplatelet agents such as Ticagrelor have demonstrated superiority to
      Clopidogrel in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At present Ticagrelor
      remains a first line therapy as an adjunct to aspirin for patients undergoing primary PCI
      for STEMI for reducing major adverse events. However, the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor
      has not been investigated in patients with STEMI post fibrinolysis. Ticagrelor results in
      significantly higher platelet inhibition than aspirin or clopidogrel and may expose patients
      to an increased risk of bleeding if administered post thrombolysis. However, fibrinolytic
      therapy itself results in a prothrombotic milieu with greater activation of platelets, a
      condition that can be balanced with addition of stronger antiplatelet agents. Similar
      concerns were initially reflected for clopidogrel as an adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy but
      were later proven to be unsubstantiated. In fact, adjunct administration of clopidogrel to
      fibrinolytic therapy reduces major adverse events as shown by multiple studies and has
      become the standard of care recommended by guidelines. The present study is proposed to
      study the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI post fibrinolytic
      therapy for STEMI.
