However, DCA is\n      also used as an investigational drug for treating various diseases of adults and children,\n      at doses far greater than those to which humans are normally exposed in the environment. Our\n      research involves how DCA is metabolized by healthy adults and by children with a fatal\n      genetic disease, congenital lactic acidosis (CLA) who are treated with DCA."
