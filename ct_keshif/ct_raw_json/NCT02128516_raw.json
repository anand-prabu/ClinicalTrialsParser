This study will compare the efficacy of\n      NUTRALYS\u00ae to a reference product. If the results of the study demonstrate a significant\n      improvement in relation to the placebo, not inferior to that of whey, NUTRALYS\u00ae could be\n      considered as an alternative to sports nutrition products, to which many people are\n      intolerant."
