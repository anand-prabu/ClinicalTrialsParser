      The purpose of this study is to test a recruitment intervention to increase racial/ethnic
      diversity in clinical trials. The trial will be conducted in clinics where community
      physician referrals are needed. Recruitment approaches cannot be made directly to community
      members.  Minorities as defined in this trial include those underrepresented in clinical
      trials:

        -  African Americans/ Blacks

        -  Asians

        -  Native Hawaiians/Other Pacific Islanders

        -  Hispanic/Latinos

        -  Native Americans/Alaskan Natives

      Low minority participation in clinical trials limits our ability to assess and address
      potential differences in therapeutic responses. To address the problem of low minority
      recruitment we are initiating a randomized trial of a recruitment intervention (RECRUIT)
      funded by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health disparities (NIMHD) to
      increase racial/ethnic diversity in clinical trials.

      Our specific approach is directed toward multisite trials conducted at specialty clinics in
      academic centers with recruiting venues that include community practices or practices of
      colleagues in other areas of the academic center. The intervention will focus on
      approximately 60 specialty clinics. Clinical sites will be randomized to the intervention or
      control group. The target of the intervention will be the site investigators and clinical
      trial coordinators.

        Inclusion:

        A parent trial must :

          -  have a coordinating Center willing to allow their Clinical Sites to participate;

          -  be studying be studying a condition that requires community or health system
             physician referral

          -  be studying an intervention where the recruitment approach cannot be made directly to
             minority community members

          -  need to increase recruitment of racially/ethnically diverse participants* to the
             trial as demonstrated by current trial progress or historical data from other trials
             in the same disease;

          -  be a Phase II or Phase III trial

          -  be conducted in at least six multiple sites;

          -  expect each Clinical Site to recruit at least 10 participants;

          -  be funded by a sponsor (NIH or pharmaceutical company or other) that has a strong
             commitment to recruiting racially/ethnically diverse subjects;

          -  be willing to have investigators and coordinators attend a special training meeting
             (at RECRUIT expense);

          -  require randomization to intervention or control (could be best medical care or
             active control or placebo or other type of control);

          -  provide transportation costs for trial participants who need assistance in getting to
             trial sites or use some RECRUIT reimbursement for this purpose.

        The clinical site must

          -  be a funded Clinical Site in the parent trial;

          -  be located in an area where at least 20% of the population within 30 miles in the age
             group under study in the parent trial are from diverse populations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  site does not agree to be randomized;

          -  investigator or coordinator is under 18 years of age.
