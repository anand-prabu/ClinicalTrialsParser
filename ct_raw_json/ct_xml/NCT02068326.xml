  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Although it is now possible to diagnose Borderline Personality disorder (BPD) in
      adolescents younger than 18 years according to the DSM-V, and studies indicates that BPD can
      be reliably diagnosed in adolescence only a few evidence based treatment programmes for
      adolescent BPD exists. Mentalization-based treatment (MBT), including group psychotherapy,
      has repeatedly shown to be effective in treating adult BPD, but in the case of adolescents,
      only individual MBT have been tested and found to be effective.

      Aims/hypotheses: We will test whether group based MBT (MBT-G), including an introductory
      programme for patients (MBT-I) and their parents (MBT-P) is more effective than Treatment As
      Usual (TAU) fin treating adolescents with emerging BPD. Further, we hypothesise that the
      ability to mentalize will have a mediating effect on the relation between initial BPD
      pathology and both primary and secondary outcome measures.

      Methods/Design: 150 patients referred to child and adolescent psychiatric clinics in Region
      Zealand will be randomized to either MBT-G or TAU. Inclusion criteria: Meeting DSM-V
      BPD-criteria at the threshold (five criteria) or sub threshold level (4 criteria). Follow-up
      will be at three and 12 months.

      Discussion: Early intervention is especially important in relation to personality
      psychopathology and has long-term benefits for patients, their families and society. In
      addition to being cost effective, using the group modality in the treatment of BPD may have
      several advantages. This is the first Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) to test the
      effectiveness of group based MBT for adolescents.

    <description>the experimental intervention is a year-long manualized program that comprises four components:
Five individual case-formulation sessions,
MBT-I, an introductory pedagogical program for patients (six weekly sessions)
MBT-G, MBT-program in groups (34 weekly sessions)
MBT-P, a psychoeducation program for the patients' parents or parents substitutes (seven sessions).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive Treatment As Usual (TAU). TAU will be provided by non-MBT trained mental health professionals in the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry in Region Zealand. TAU may vary considerably in number and type of intervention across clinics and according to the needs of the patient, e.g. ad hoc crisis management. However all patients will be seen at at least four counselling sessions scheduled every 10th week. All mental health services delivered during the treatment period to patients in the TAU group will be monitored and registered.</description>
