Determine the objective response rate in patients with recurrent platinum\n      sensitive ovarian epithelial cancer treated with cisplatin liposomal (SPI-77). II. Determine\n      the time to response, duration of response, time to progression, and survival in these\n      patients treated with this regimen. III. Characterize the safety of this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin liposomal (SPI-77) IV over a minimum of 4 hours on day\n      1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with clinical benefit after 6 courses may receive additional\n      courses upon approval by the pharmaceutical sponsor. Patients are followed every 2 months\n      for a minimum of 6 months and then periodically for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 26-63 patients will be accrued for this study."
