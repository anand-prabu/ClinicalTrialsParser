The goal of this proposed\n      study is to explore the feasibility of using multiple insulin delivery routes in order to\n      mimic the physiology of both first- and second-phase insulin secretion.  The intent is to\n      exploit the rapid action achieved by inhaled insulin to compensate for part of the meals and\n      utilize the conventional subcutaneous route for management of basal insulin and as\n      second-phase meal-related insulin."
