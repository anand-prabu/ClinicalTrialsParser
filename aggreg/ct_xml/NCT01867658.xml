      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety of the Progel® PALS,
      including the Progel® Extended Applicator Spray Tips, in sealing or reducing intraoperative
      air leaks in patients undergoing video assisted or robotic assisted thoracoscopic
      (VATS/Robotic) surgeries.

      The data collected in this clinical study will supplement the Approved PMA P010047 Progel®
      PALS product.

      This is a prospective, open label, multi-center clinical study designed to assess the safety
      of the Progel® PALS product, including the Extended Applicator Spray Tip, when used in Video
      Assisted and Robotic Assisted Thoracoscopic Surgery.  The study will treat approximately 105
      evaluable subjects at up to 15 U.S. sites.  All subjects will provide informed consent prior
      to enrollment in the study.

      Patients who have met the initial screening criteria and who have a visible pleural air leak
      which requires treatment with a sealant, after standard closure techniques are used
      (standard sutures, staples or devices supplied by the hospital for thoracoscopic surgery)
      will be eligible for study participation.  If the subject is treated, the surgeon will
      utilize Progel® PALS to the same sites originally treated with standard technique.

    <description>The primary outcome of the study is the rate of device- and/or procedure-related adverse events at one month after surgery in subjects using Progel® PALS in a VATS/Robotic procedure. Endpoint analysis of the rate of device- and/or procedure-related adverse events will be based on the Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudication of adverse events.</description>

    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide written informed consent.

          -  Subject is scheduled for video assisted or robotic assisted thoracoscopic surgery for
             lung resection (i.e. lobectomy, bilobectomy, segmentectomy, and wedge resection/lung
             volume reduction), decortications or biopsy within 45 days of the screening
             evaluation.

          -  Subject is ≥18 years of age.

          -  Subject has a life expectancy ≥6 months.

          -  Following lung resection, subject has at least one or more visible intraoperative air
             leaks, after standard closure techniques are applied, that requires treatment with
             pleural sealant.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with the study procedures and complete the
             entire study as specified in the protocol, including the follow-up visits.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has undergone previous lung resection or previous use of a sealant for air
             leaks.

          -  Subject has a serum creatinine ≥2.5 mg/dl at baseline or is currently on dialysis.

          -  Following lung resection, subject has intraoperative air leaks that require
             non-standard, visceral pleural closure (e.g. leak is too small or tissue is too
             fragile to use sutures/staples).

          -  Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude
             the use of the study device, or preclude the subject from completing the follow-up
             requirements.

          -  Subject has known allergy to human albumin or any component in the Progel® PALS
             product.

          -  Subject has an active or latent infection which is systemic or at the intended
             surgery site.

          -  Subject has necrotic or friable borders of the defect that will not support secure
             suture fixation if use of sutures is required.

          -  Subject is participating in another investigational drug or device trial.

          -  Subject is pregnant or has plans to become pregnant during the study period or is
             currently breastfeeding.

          -  Subject is part of the site personnel directly involved with this study.

          -  Subject is a family member of the investigational study staff.
