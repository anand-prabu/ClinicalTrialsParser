EmReg combines didactic and experiential training, and emphasizes skill acquisition and generalization through examination of incidents of emotional dysregulation in one's life and completion of homework assignments. The treatment is divided into two phases: knowledge provision and practice facilitation. During the knowledge provision phase participants are introduced to the objectives and the main concepts of the treatment, to increase their familiarity with the terminology, and to the emotional regulation skills they acquire during the practice facilitation phase. During the practice facilitation phase participants receive training in emotional regulation skills, which they practice in-session with the guidance of the therapist and feedback from the group, as well as out-of-session as homework assignments.",
