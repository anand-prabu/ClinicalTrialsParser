A recent trial indicated that clopidogrel and aspirin\n      treatment reduced the risk of recurrent stroke and was not associated with increased\n      hemorrhage events, compared with aspirin monotherapy. Apixaban, a new oral anticoagulant, is\n      proved to be as effective as traditional anticoagulants with less risk of bleeding events.\n\n      To estimate whether apixaban is beneficial for acute TIA or minor stroke, a randomized,\n      double-blind, multicenter, controlled clinical trial has been designed. The investigators\n      will assess the hypothesis that a 21-days apixaban regimen is superior to clopidogrel and\n      aspirin dual-therapy for the treatment of high-risk patients with acute nondisabling\n      cerebrovascular event."
