    <description>The Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1) percent predicted expresses FEV1 as a percentage of the &quot;predicted values&quot; for participants of similar characteristics (height, age, sex, and sometimes race and weight). A positive change from baseline in FEV1 percent predicted indicates improvement in lung function.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) is the amount of air which can be forcibly exhaled from the lungs after taking the deepest breath possible. FVC will be assessed via spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FVC indicates improvement in lung function.</description>

    <description>The Forced Expiratory Flow (FEF) 25%-75% measurement describes the amount of air expelled from the lungs during the middle half (25% - 75%) of the forced vital capacity test and is measured using spirometry. A positive change from baseline in FEF indicates improvement in lung function. The predicted percent will be assessed.</description>
