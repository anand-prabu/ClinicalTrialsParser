A more aggressive approach towards effusions has been\n      suggested, but further studies are needed.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. to determine the size of pleural and pericardial effusion that results in at least 30%\n           reduction of physical performance in the 6-minute walk test.\n\n        2. to compare the improvement in physical performance between the intervention group and\n           the control group, measured from baseline to day 30 after surgery.\n\n      Materials and methods:\n\n      A randomised controlled intervention trial. Patients admitted for open heart-surgery (aortic\n      valve surgery, coronary artery bypass graft surgery and combinations) will be randomised\n      into either an intervention group or a control group. The intervention group will be\n      followed with physical tests and ultrasonic examination the month following surgery. Pleural\n      or pericardial effusion of a predefined size will be drained. The control group will follow\n      the current postoperative regimen."
