At the end of this period:\n\n        -  patients with a tumor response will continue the targeted therapy,\n\n        -  patients in progression will discontinue the targeted therapy and will be withdrawn\n           from study and oriented towards standard treatments\n\n        -  patients with a stable disease at 12 weeks will be randomized in order to determine if\n           they continue or stop the targeted therapy.\n\n      About 80 patients will be treated in each of the 5 treatment groups opened to enrollment,\n      each group corresponding to an available targeted therapy."
