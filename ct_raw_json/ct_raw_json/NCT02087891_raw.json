Stress may also result in increased utilization\n      of health care services.  In the workplace, stress leads to emotional exhaustion, job\n      dissatisfaction, lower productivity and impaired performance.  Stress management programs\n      and those based on mindfulness meditation have gained popularity in recent years. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of an 8-week web-based mindfulness\n      stress reduction program and its effectiveness in reducing work related stress and improving\n      well-being in a large corporate call center."
