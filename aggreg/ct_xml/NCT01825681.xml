  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A six-week intervention is designed to increase positive affect in people who care for a
      family member with dementia. The intervention consists of 5, 60-minute sessions followed by
      a 30 minute evaluation session conducted at week 6 and again at week 10.

      The primary hypotheses is that experimental subjects who participate in LEAF will
      demonstrate significantly greater improvements in psychological outcomes and will engage in
      more problem focused and positive appraisal forms of coping compared to the wait-list
      control condition.

    <description>The DES will be used to assess positive and negative affect. This 20-item version of the DES was modified to include additional positive affect items as well as those that are likely to tap into trait positive affectivity. The full scale assesses interest, enjoyment, surprise, sadness, anger, disgust, contempt, fear, guilt, shame, shyness, amusement, awe, contentment, gratitude, hope, love, pride, sympathy, and sexual feelings (e.g., &quot;I felt sexual, desiring, and flirtatious&quot;). The scale can be scored for total positive and negative affect,grouped according to where they would fall on the circumplex model of affect (e.g., high activation vs. lower activation),or individual affects can be examined.  In student samples this modified DES has shown acceptable reliability with the positive affects subscale (α = .79) and the negative affects subscale (α = .69).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        - participants must live with and be the primary care provider for a family member with
        dementia

          -  speak and read English

          -  have the ability to provide informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        - Lack of a high speed internet connection or evidence of severe cognitive impairment or
        active psychosis, as assessed by trained interviewers  will result in exclusion from the
        study.

        -However, in the RCT if someone does not have access to high speed internet options for
        participation will be explored, for example accessing the internet atan alternate location
        near their home, (e.g. private room in library, health clinic).
