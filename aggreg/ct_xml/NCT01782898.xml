  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Seventy percent of surgeries performed in the United States are done in an outpatient
      setting.Pain Control after ambulatory surgery is very challenging because patients do not
      have access to fast and potent intravenous medications Pain after ambulatory surgery is
      poorly controlled in the United States with up to seventy five percent of patients having
      moderate to severe pain after ambulatory procedures. Postoperative pain have been associated
      with serious morbidity, including myocardial infarction and pulmonary embolism.

      The use of intraoperative opioids can result in an exaggerated response to pain
      (hyperalgesia) and contribute to an exacerbation of pain after surgical procedures.Opioids
      are commonly given intraoperative, not in response to pain, but in response to hyperdynamic
      cardiovascular states. Esmolol is a short acting beta 1 antagonist that can be used to
      treat/prevent hyperdynamic states during surgery. More importantly, esmolol has been shown
      to have central antihyperalgesic effects that might contribute to a reduction in
      postoperative pain. It is therefore conceivable that the use of intraoperative esmolol
      instead of  opioids to avoid hyperdynamic states during surgery can result in lower
      postoperative pain.  Since postoperative pain can substantially affect postoperative quality
      of recovery, it is also conceivable that the use of intraoperative esmolol might result in
      an improved postoperative quality of recovery to surgical patients.

      The main objective of the current study is to examine the effect of intraoperative esmolol
      on postoperative quality of recovery. A secondary objective is to examine the effect of
      esmolol on postoperative pain.

      Significance: Postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery has been shown to be poorly
      managed in The United States. The goal of this study is to investigate if a change in the
      intraoperative pharmacologic management of patients undergoing ambulatory surgery can
      improve their postoperative quality of recovery and pain.

      The research question is; does the use of intraoperative esmolol improve postoperative
      quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery? Does the use of intraoperative esmolol improve
      postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery?

      The hypotheses of this study is; does the use of intraoperative esmolol improves
      postoperative quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery. The use of intraoperative
      esmolol reduces postoperative pain after ambulatory surgery.
