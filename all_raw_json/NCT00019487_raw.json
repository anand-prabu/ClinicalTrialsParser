Cells are incubated in the presence of\n      gp209-2M peptide and then harvested and cloned. Patients receive 30-minute IV infusions of\n      these in vitro sensitized cells. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 2 courses. An\n      additional cohort of 8 patients receives gp209-2M peptide in Montanide ISA-51 subcutaneously\n      in 2 different sites followed 2 days later by the adoptive transfer of cloned lymphocytes.\n      At 4 to 6 weeks after the treatment courses, patients with stable or regressing disease may\n      be retreated.\n\n      Patients with disease progression after 2 courses may receive 2 additional courses of cell\n      infusion followed by interleukin-2 (IL-2) on one of two schedules. One cohort of patients\n      receives IL-2 by intravenous bolus over 15 minutes every 8 hours beginning on the day after\n      cell infusion and continuing for up to 5 days of each treatment course. Another cohort\n      receives IL-2 by daily subcutaneous injections on days 1-12 of each course of therapy. If\n      after 12-16 patients have been treated with cloned cells alone initially and responses are\n      inadequate, subsequent patients entered into this study are randomized to receive the cell\n      infusion followed by IL-2 on one of the two described schedules.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4-6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 91 patients will be accrued for this study over 2 years."
