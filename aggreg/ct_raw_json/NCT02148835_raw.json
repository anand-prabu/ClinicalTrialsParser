The HS-Omega-3 Index is a prime parameter to demonstrate\n      bioavailability in the long-term. Study hypothesis is that increased intake of EPA+DHA will\n      increase the HS-Omega-3 Index. Study aim is to investigate how supplementing various\n      sausages with omega-3 fatty acids influences the HS-Omega-3 Index in healthy volunteers, as\n      compared to unsupplemented matching sausages. Safety and palatability of the sausages are\n      also to be assessed."

Use of platelet inhibitors or conventional\n             anticoagulation with a target INR of 2.0 - 3.0 is not an exclusion criterion.\n\n          4. Subjects with any acute and life-threatening condition, such as collapse and shock,\n             acute myocardial infarction (last three months), stroke, embolism.\n\n          5. Subjects with significant medical co-morbidity, seriously limiting life expectancy or\n             insulin-treated diabetes mellitus or a BMI>30\n\n          6. Allergy/intolerance or history of hypersensitivity to components of study\n             intervention.\n\n          7. Pregnant subjects and breastfeeding subjects.
