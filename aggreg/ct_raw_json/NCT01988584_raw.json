The study involves one baseline/treatment visit\n      and 3 follow-up visits at 6 months, 12 months, and 2 years.  Five children in each group\n      will be randomized to a placebo control group at the baseline/treatment visit.  Parents will\n      not be told if their child received stem cells or a placebo until the 12 month follow-up\n      visit.  At that time parents may elect to have their child receive the stem cell treatment;\n      either bone morrow harvest or umbilical cord blood if banked with CBR.  All study visits\n      will be conducted at the UTHealth Medical School and Children's Memorial Hermann Hospital in\n      Houston, Texas.\n\n      As of 1/21/2014 we have met our enrollment limit for children without banked cord blood\n      undergoing bone marrow harvest for stem cells."
