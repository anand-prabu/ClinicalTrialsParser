To estimate the dose response relationship on multiple spatial scales (global lung,\n      regional lung, lung image voxel) between radiation dose and changes in lung ventilation and\n      perfusion, both acutely (mid-radiation treatment) and long term (3 months post-treatment),\n      using SPECT/CT imaging with 99mTc-MAA and 99mTc-DTPA.\n\n      II. To estimate the degree of radiation response in lung tissue with varying levels of\n      function (i.e. compare radiation dose response of well ventilated and well perfused tissue\n      against lung tissue with poor perfusion and ventilation).\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate proton radiation therapy for functional lung sparing in lung cancer through\n      treatment planning comparisons to conventional photon radiation therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo 99mTc-MAA and 99mTc-DTPA SPECT/CT at baseline, mid-radiation therapy (up to\n      1 week post-treatment), and at 3-6 months post-treatment.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up periodically."
