            "textblock": "Study C: HA-\u03b2 TCP (ReproBone\u2122) vs. autologous iliac crest bone graft in a calcaneal\n      lengthening osteotomy in children with hindfoot valgus. A clinical randomized controlled\n      study with 12 months of follow-up.\n\n      Purpose. To investigate the clinical and radiographic findings of a calcaneal lengthening\n      osteotomy by comparing autologous bonegraft and HA-\u03b2-TCP graft in a group of children with\n      hindfoot valgus deformities. The primary outcome measure is pain score (visual analog\n      scale). We expect children who are randomized to HA-\u03b2-TCP graft to have less postoperative\n      pain than children randomized to autologous bone graft.\n\n      Design. Prospective, randomized controlled study.\n\n      Randomization: Children who fulfill the criteria for inclusion together with their\n      parents/guardian receive  information about the project. The patients are randomized to\n      respectively HA-\u00df-TCP and iliac crest bone graft.\n\n      Surgical procedure: Calcaneal lengthening osteotomy is performed between the anterior and\n      middle facet of the subtalar joint. The corticalis of the calcaneus is bilaterally cut\n      through. The planovalgus deformity is corrected and with a graft matching the wedged\n      osteotomy is inserted. Tantalum balls are inserted into calcaneus on each side of the\n      osteotomy and in cuboideum. Postoperative pain treatment consist of a tibial nerve catheter\n      which is used the first 24 hours. Patients in whom graft is harvested from the iliac crest\n      get local infiltration analgesics accordingly to a standardized procedure. The pain is\n      registered by the use of a visual analog scale (VAS) a 3, 8 and 12 hours postoperative. The\n      amounts of used analgesics are registered.\n\n      Power and significance: The primary parameter is postoperative pain score. We expect the use\n      of artificial bone graft will reduce the VAS score from 60 mm to 30 mm. A reduction of 30 mm\n      corresponds to a significant fall in pain intensity. With reference to a former published\n      study on a comparable patient group we expect a standard deviation of 25 mm in the\n      population. Therefore the number of patients in each group should be 12  in order to\n      demonstrate a significant difference of 30 mm. We strive towards 2x15 patients in order to\n      compensate for eventual drop-outs. We used an non-paired design with power = 80 % of p <\n      0.05%."
