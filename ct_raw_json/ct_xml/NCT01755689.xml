    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of GSK Biologicals'
      meningococcal vaccine (MenACWY-TT) co-administered with Cervarix as compared to MenACWY-TT
      and Cervarix administered alone and the co-administration of MenACWY-TT with Cervarix and
      Boostrix as compared to MenACWY-TT administered alone and Cervarix co-administered with
      Boostrix.

             informed assent obtained from the subject if the subject is less than legal age, or
             written informed consent obtained from the subject if the subject has achieved legal
             age. The legal age will be determined according to local regulations in each

          -  Chronic administration of immunosuppressants or other immune-modifying drugs within
             six months prior to the first vaccine dose. For corticosteroids, this will be ≥10
             mg/day prednisone or equivalent. Inhaled and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             within the period starting 30 days before and ending 30 days after each study dose of

             epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy.

          -  History of any neurologic disorders or seizures. A history of ADHD or depression or a
             history of a single, simple febrile seizure does not exclude a subject.
