    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies stereotactic body radiation therapy in treating patients
      with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery. Stereotactic radiation therapy may be
      able to send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate feasibility and safety of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) of the
      liver for treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate radiographic local response, local control and time to local progression
      (TTLP) of treated lesions in HCC patients after liver SBRT.

      II. To evaluate overall survival (OS) and cancer specific survival (CSS) in HCC patients
      treated with liver SBRT.

      III. To evaluate explanted irradiated liver tissue (for patients who proceed to liver
      transplantation) to determine extent of residual tumor and extent of radiation effects
      within and around the irradiated field.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo SBRT every other day over 2 weeks (5 fractions total) in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months
      and then every 6 months for up to 2 years.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Life expectancy &gt; 3 months

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status =&lt; 2

          -  HCC diagnosed by either of the following approaches:

               -  Histologic confirmation of HCC on biopsy

               -  Evidence of vascular enhancement of suspected lesion on at least two imaging
                  techniques

                  (AFP) is &gt; 200 ng/mL in the setting of cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis B/C

          -  HCC must be deemed unresectable by an experienced surgeon or patient must be

             range of normal

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior radiation therapy to the upper abdomen or thorax

          -  Lesions within 1 cm from the stomach

          -  Prior uncontrolled, life threatening malignancy within the previous 6 months

          -  Pregnancy is not permitted; women of child-bearing age must undergo pregnancy testing

          -  Previous gastric, duodenal or variceal bleed within the past 2 months
