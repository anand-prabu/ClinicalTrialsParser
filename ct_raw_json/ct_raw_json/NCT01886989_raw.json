The\n      investigators aim to test the hypothesis that cocoa will lower high-fat mixed meal\n      breakfast-induced postprandial rise of glucose, lipids and markers of atherosclerosis in\n      patients with diabetes. Randomized cross-over controlled trial, in which participants will\n      be assigned to the placebo or cocoa group with breakfast meal. Patients with type 2\n      diabetes(n=25) will qualify for the study. The participants will be asked to consume 2 cups\n      cocoa or placebo beverage on 2 separate postprandial study days. Both groups will receive\n      high-fat mixed meal breakfast on each day. Blood draws and blood pressure (including HDI)\n      measurements will be conducted at fasting, 30 min, 1,2, 4 & 6 hours postprandial each day\n      for 2 days."
