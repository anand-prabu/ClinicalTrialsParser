PHP is a human-derived\n      chemically modified hemoglobin preparation.  PHP selectively scavenges excess nitric oxide\n      (NO) and does so in a catalytic, concentration-dependent reaction that results in the\n      formation of the non-toxic NO metabolite, nitrate.  PHP is postulated to reduce excess,\n      toxic levels of NO while allowing critical beneficial levels of the molecule to persist."

Efficacy will be determined by evaluating objective clinical measures of mortality\n      and organ function over the 28-day treatment period.\n\n      The safety and tolerability of PHP will be evaluated over the continuous 28 days using a\n      number of measures including an evaluation of:\n\n        -  all cause mortality,\n\n        -  median patient survival time and\n\n        -  adverse event rates and duration."
