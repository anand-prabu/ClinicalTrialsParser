            "textblock": "Brachytherapy is a curative treatment for many malignancies, brachytherapy delivers a high\n      radiation dose to a very small and well-specified target within a patient with cancer. Yet\n      there is no current convenient, inexpensive, real time method of confirming the radiation\n      dose delivered. There is no current monitoring or fail-safe device for radiation oncologists\n      and their patients if the radiation dose becomes too high, especially to radiation sensitive\n      organs, or conversely if the target receives too little dose.High dose-rate(HDR)\n      brachytherapy is a highly advanced radiation-based cancer treatment, where a very small\n      radioactive source, Iridium-192, is placed in or near the tumor through a catheter or\n      channel. This provides a high radiation dose to the tumor in 5-15 minutes with a precise\n      location, while minimizing radiation exposure to surrounding tissue and organs. This\n      protocol will determine the feasibility of using a novel nano-material based fiber-optic\n      dosimeter (nanoFOD) device, with dimensions less than 1 mm wide, to measure real-time,\n      pin-point, in-vivo radiation dose given during radiation therapy treatments. The size of the\n      device allows placement through a catheter or channel near areas of interest, or within\n      already placed brachytherapy delivery catheters."
