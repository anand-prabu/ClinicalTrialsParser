Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this\n      patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive CMA-676 IV\n      over 2 hours on day 1. Patients may receive 1 additional dose of therapy 15 to 28 days\n      later. Patients who achieve complete or morphologic remission are followed for an additional\n      6 months and every 3-6 months thereafter until relapse and/or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 55 evaluable patients will be accrued. Enrollment will then be extended\n      for up to an additional 55 patients."
