Treatment repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of docetaxel is preceded or followed by sequential dose\n      escalation of flavopiridol. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel\n      preceded or followed by escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) of the combination is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 22\n      additional patients are accrued to receive flavopiridol and docetaxel at the recommended\n      phase II dose.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 3 courses during study, and then at\n      completion of study.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 49 patients (27 for phase I and 22 for phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study within 2 years."
