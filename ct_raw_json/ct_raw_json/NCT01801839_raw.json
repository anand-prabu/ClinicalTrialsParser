And\n      continuous such imbalance could lead to immunoparalysis, which is characterized by loss of\n      delayed type hypersensitivity, failure of primary infections eradication, and a\n      predisposition of secondary nosocomial infections development.  However, in which phase of\n      sepsis does immunoparalysis occur is still unknown. So this study aims to tentatively\n      understand this problem  by checking monocytes/macrophages` antigen presentation and\n      cytokine secretion\uff0cand by checking monocytes/macrophages` expression of Tim-3 (the T cell\n      transmembrane, immunoglobulin, and mucin-3), which is an inhibitory regulatory molecule, in\n      sepsis patients` peripheral blood mononuclear cells."
