The study will determine the most\n      effective methods of educating patients with poor literacy about their disease.\n\n      Patients with systemic inflammatory rheumatic conditions (rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic\n      arthritis, and seronegative polyarthritis) will be assessed and placed into one of three\n      reading levels: 8th grade or lower; 9th to 11th grade; or 12th grade or higher. Patients\n      from each reading level will be randomly assigned to one of two intervention groups. Group 1\n      will receive disease-specific material from the Arthritis Foundation written at an 11th\n      grade reading level. Group 2 will receive plain language materials, an arthritis glossary,\n      and a one-hour, in-person session with a study educator using interactive, text-free\n      methods. The study educator will help the patient with reading-related problems either by\n      study visit or by telephone for 6 months postsession.\n\n      All patients will receive a medication calendar. Patients will be followed for one year\n      after the intervention and will be assessed for changes in health status, disease activity,\n      communication with the physician, self-management of their arthritis, understanding of and\n      adherence to prescribed treatment, and satisfaction with their intervention."
