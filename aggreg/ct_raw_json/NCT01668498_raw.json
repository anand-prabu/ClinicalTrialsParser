While an\n      improvement of QoL has been demonstrated for panitumumab and cetuximab in comparison to best\n      supportive care the data basis for patient related outcomes regarding skin toxicity deriving\n      from randomized trials is still small.\n\n      Recent surveys among German oncologist revealed that physicians are reluctant to use oral\n      antibiotics as preemptive treatment . Only 19 out of 110 oncologists stated that they are\n      thinking about using preemptive treatment in patients with acne-like skin rash.\n\n      Thus, in the present trial two main questions will be addressed:\n\n      (i) Can preemptive treatment with oral doxycycline be replaced by a sequential skin\n      treatment strategy (i.e. local treatment with erythromycin followed by doxycycline in case\n      of inefficacy = development of acne) without compromising treatment efficacy of skin\n      toxicity treatment? (ii) Comparison of general and skin related QoL between both treatment\n      arms."
