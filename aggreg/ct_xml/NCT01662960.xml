  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether an existing treatment for problems that
      participants have with making movements after a stroke can be performed at home.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two forms of home-based treatment for post-stroke problems making
      movements with the arms and hands. After initial pre-treatment assessments, participants
      will complete 4 weeks of treatment, with assessments after each week of treatment and 3
      months after the completion of treatment.
