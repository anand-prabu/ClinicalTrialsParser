  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of the protocol is to evaluate the StO2 performance measured at the
      admission to the emergency department to identify hemodynamic failure at the admission or
      within the first three hours of monitoring patients with drug poisoning.

      The study hypotheses are:

        -  The early detection of hypoperfusion by StO2, essential to prevent the development of
           collapse.

        -  To limit hemodynamic failure effects, reduce morbidity and mortality of drug poisoning,
           hospital stay and cost.

      The procedure is a measurement and non-invasive monitoring system of percentage of oxygen
      saturation of haemoglobin in tissues using infrared technology. The system used in the study
      is the tissue oxygenation monitor InSpectraTM StO2 Spot Check, Model 300 consisting of a
      clamp applied to the base of the thumb of the patient.
