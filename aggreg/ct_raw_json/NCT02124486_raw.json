            "textblock": "Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a condition with an unknown cause or causes.\n      The condition is associated with raised pressure in the brain and can cause disabling daily\n      headaches and loss of sight, which can be permanent. The raised brain pressure squashes the\n      nerves supplying the eye (also known as papilloedema) and this can affect vision. Over 90%\n      of patients with IIH are overweight and weight loss is the most effective treatment. Other\n      treatments for IIH have very little current evidence to support their use.\n\n      Weight loss is difficult to maintain. This trial aims to compare two methods of weight loss,\n      bariatric surgery and the most effective dietary programme commonly available, Weight\n      Watchers, to see which offers the most effective sustainable treatment for IIH. Bariatric\n      surgery is recommended by the NICE clinical guidelines for patients with a Body Mass Index\n      (BMI) of over 40, or over 35 with a co-morbidity. Women suffering from IIH have a BMI on\n      average around 38 and IIH is not recognised as a co-morbidity for bariatric surgery.\n\n      This trial will recruit 60 women with IIH from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham, a\n      major UK IIH centre. They will be randomised and 30 participants will be allocated to the\n      dietetic intervention arm, and be enrolled in their local Weight Watchers group. 30\n      participants will be allocated to the bariatric surgery arm, and will be referred to the\n      Birmingham Heartlands Hospital bariatric surgery pathway to receive bariatric surgery. Both\n      groups of participants will be allocated to a treatment arm which is proven to bring about\n      weight loss.\n\n      Participants will then be followed up for five years, with the most important measurement\n      being their brain pressure after one year of being in the trial.\n\n      A further 20 obese women who don't suffer from IIH will be recruited to compare the baseline\n      symptoms and biomarkers of those with IIH; they will take no further part in the study. 5\n      further healthy individuals will be scanned twice in an MRI test group to validate the MRI\n      scan sequence to be used in the trial."
