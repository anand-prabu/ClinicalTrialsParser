  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the implementation of two evidence-based
      intervention strategies of SBIRT (Generalist vs. Specialist) for adolescent alcohol,
      tobacco, other drug use, and HIV risk behaviors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guided by Proctor's conceptual model of implementation research, the proposed study is a
      multi-site, cluster randomized trial to compare two principal strategies of SBIRT delivery
      within adolescent medicine. In the Generalist Strategy, the primary care provider delivers
      brief intervention (BI) for substance misuse. In the Specialist Strategy, BIs are delivered
      by behavioral health counselors. The 7 study sites, primary care clinics operated by a
      large, urban Federally Qualified Health Center in Baltimore, will be randomly assigned to
      implement SBIRT for adolescents using either the Generalist or Specialist strategies. Staff
      at each site will be trained in the assigned implementation strategy, and quarterly booster
      trainings will be provided during the implementation period. Implementation outcomes,
      including: penetration, costs/cost-effectiveness, acceptability, timeliness,
      fidelity/adherence, and patient satisfaction will be assessed during the 18-month-long
      implementation period using a complementary combination of administrative service encounter
      data, provider and patient surveys, and qualitative interviews. At the end of the active
      implementation period, all training and technical support activities will cease for 12
      months in order to measure relative sustainability. The study will also examine the
      effectiveness of integrating HIV risk screening within an SBIRT model.
