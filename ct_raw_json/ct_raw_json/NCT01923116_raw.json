            "textblock": "Rationale:\n\n      Anal cancer incidence has increased dramatically in HIV (human immunodeficiency\n      virus)-positive men. Like cervical cancer, anal cancer is causally linked to infections with\n      high-risk papillomaviruses, and is preceded by precursor lesions: anal intraepithelial\n      neoplasia (AIN). Several treatment options exist for AIN, but success rates are\n      disappointingly low. An alternative strategy might be therapeutic HPV (human papilloma\n      virus) vaccination. In women with vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia (VIN), a condition with a\n      comparable pathogenesis, therapeutic vaccination with HPV-16 viral oncoproteins E6 and E7,\n      was well tolerated, and proved to be effective.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The objective of the current proposal is to assess, in a phase 1/2 study, the safety and\n      efficacy of this synthetic vaccine SLP-HPV-01\u00ae in HIV+ men with CD4 counts > 350 x 10E6/l\n      and intra-anal high-grade, HPV16 positive AIN, who failed on previous treatment.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      HIV-positive MSM (men who have sex with men) with a CD4 count > 350 cells/ul with\n      HPV16-induced intra-anal high-grade AIN (grade 2-3) that was resistant to, or recurred after\n      conventional cauterization or other forms of local treatment.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      The first phase of the study is a dose-response study, with 3 different dosage schedules\n      (1,5,10; 5,10,20; and 10,20,40 \u03bcg of SLP-HPV-01\u00ae, administered intradermally with a\n      three-week interval), each dosage schedule with or without the co-administration of\n      pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (Pegintron 1 \u03bcg/kg s.c.) at the day of vaccine administration. Each\n      vaccination schedule is to be tested in 5 patients.\n\n      The vaccination schedule that induces in HIV-positive MSM the best HPV16-specific response\n      compared to that of the women with VIN in our previous study, is considered the optimal\n      schedule. The size of this dose group will be increased to a total of 20 patients by\n      treating an additional 15 patients.\n\n      Intervention:\n\n      Patients will be vaccinated 3 times with a 3-week interval with the SLP-HPV-01\u00ae vaccine.\n\n      Endpoints:\n\n      The primary clinical end points will be both toxicity/ safety, and the regression of the\n      lesions at 3, 6 and 12 months, as assessed by HRA (high resolutions anoscopy), with biopsies\n      taken of lesion sites.\n\n      Secondary endpoints are regression of lesions at 18 months and HPV16-specific immunity in\n      blood will be measured: i.e. ELISPOT (IFNg) for ex-vivo detection of antigen-specific\n      responses and multiparametric intracellular cytokine/extracellular activation marker\n      staining to determine the type (CD4+ and/or CD8+) and function (activation status and/or\n      cytokines) of T-cells that respond."
