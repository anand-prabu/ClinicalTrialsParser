            "textblock": "Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is one of the most common causes of end\n      stage renal disease (ESRD), affecting an estimated 0.2% of population. Of ADPKD patients,\n      58% in 15-24 year, 85% in 25-34 year, and 94% in 35-46 year olds suffer from polycystic\n      liver in addition to polycystic kidneys. Several anti-proliferative drugs have been used in\n      clinical trials to stop cyst growth both in liver and kidneys. Among them, octreotide and\n      sirolimus have been shown to be one of the most promising drugs to reduce cyst volume.\n      Sirolimus already has been used as one of the most potential oral immunosuppressants.\n      Moreover, the serum trough level is quite easy to measure. Sirolimus is the mTOR inhibitor\n      that has been proven to be effective in reducing cyst growth both in animal models. However,\n      its efficacy and safety is not well proven in previous studies. This is a open-label,\n      prospective study to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of Sirolimus to reduce cyst\n      growth in ADPKD patients with massive polycystic liver."
