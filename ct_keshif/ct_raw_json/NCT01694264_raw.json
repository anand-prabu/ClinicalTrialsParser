            "textblock": "Biologic agents, especially anti-TNF\u03b1 treatments are widely used in inflammatory arthritis\n      such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and ankylosing spondylitis (AS). More than 60% of RA or AS\n      patients achieve good clinical response to anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment. However, TNF\u03b1 is also an\n      important mediator participating in the normal immune response to infectious agents, in\n      particular intracellular microorganisms in the human body. Therefore, opportunistic\n      infections such as tuberculosis, viral and fungal infections have been of concern when using\n      anti-TNF\u03b1 agents. With accumulating experience, the treatment guideline for anti-TNF\u03b1\n      therapy in latent tuberculosis is now well established. It is noteworthy that there are a\n      number of case reports describing hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation in otherwise\n      asymptomatic carriers who received anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment. Anti-TNF\u03b1 agents are now utilized as\n      a promising treatment regimen for RA and AS treatment for even HBsAg carriers, yet there are\n      still concerns of the risk of anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy contributing to HBV reactivation. In our\n      previous studies, we found that anti-viral therapy before starting anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment may\n      reduce the incidence of HBV reactivation, and that entecavir is likely more suitable in\n      long-term prophylaxis for HBsAg carriers under anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment. This justifies the need\n      of a prospective trial that could demonstrate the long-term effects of prophylaxis in using\n      anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy in this subgroup of patients. It would help clinicians understand 1)\n      whether anti-viral therapy is necessary in inactive HBsAg carriers initiating anti-TNF\u03b1\n      treatment, and 2) at what time point would we most likely witness HBV reactivation after\n      starting anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy without anti-viral therapy coverage. In addition to established\n      nationwide network of Rheumatologists working in major academic institutes in Korea, our\n      division in Seoul National University Hospital has led many multi-center trials throughout\n      the past years. In summary, the question of whether to combine anti-viral prophylaxis in\n      HBsAg carriers starting anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy is an important issue to Rheumatologists. There is\n      no guideline for managing this subset of patients, and clinicians normally begin anti-viral\n      therapy after the patient's liver function worsens. Therefore, our nationwide network of\n      specialists proposes to launch a prospective study to investigate the benefit of anti-viral\n      prophylaxis with entecavir in HBsAg carriers starting anti-TNF\u03b1 treatment."
