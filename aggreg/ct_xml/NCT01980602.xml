      Title: How does exercise improve the calf muscle in patients with poor blood supply to their
      leg?

      Purpose of the project: Patients with peripheral arterial disease have a poor blood supply
      to their lower leg. The reduced inflow prevents the leg from utilising nutrients and oxygen
      as easily as a healthy leg would. This causes pain when walking (intermittent claudication),
      which often occurs after a reproducible distance e.g. every 50 yards. These patients have a
      reduction in their quality of life as they feel embarrassed in social situations e.g.
      walking around town requires multiple breaks, so they tend to avoid this and isolate
      themselves more.

      One treatment for claudication is exercising until the pain comes onÍ¾ which most are
      reluctant to do. Walking up to three times a week for an hour, can double most people's
      walking distances, but doesn't always. The reason why some improve with exercise and others
      do not remains unknown.

      This project will be the first randomised controlled trial of exercise in claudicants that
      focuses on the adaptations that occur in the muscle at a cellular level. We wish to compare
      muscle cells from a group that have exercised and group that have not. We will focus on the
      change in muscle cell size and function at present, and later progress to why and how this
      happens.

      Methods: We will take measurements at the start of the study (baseline), after 6 weeks and
      then 3, 6 and 12 months. These measurements will be of a patient's fitness, actual walking
      distances and blood samples. At the time of surgery, muscle from the calf will be taken from
      the affected leg. This will be processed at the University's biomedical science department
      to look at the different types of muscle fibre and how efficiently they are working.
