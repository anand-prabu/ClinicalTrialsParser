Adequate\n      bowel preparation is essential for optimal visualization of the colorectal mucosa. However,\n      inadequate bowel preparation (IBP) had been unexpectedly reported in up to 30% of patients\n      undergoing colonoscopy. Many factors may influence the quality of bowel preparation, which\n      can be broadly categorized as patient-related or procedure-related. It has been shown that\n      split-dose regimen or some modified educational strategies can improve the quality of bowel\n      preparation. For the patients with possible IBP before the performing of colonoscopy, it may\n      be better to repeat bowel preparation with modified or enhanced strategies in case of failed\n      intubation, missed lesions or unnecessarily increased cost. Thus, it is important to set up\n      a model to predict the quality of bowel preparation individually."
