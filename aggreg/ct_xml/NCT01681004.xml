      The purpose of this study is to compare outcomes when patients with degenerative
      sacroiliitis (arthritis of the SI joint) and or sacroiliac disruption (abnormal separation
      or tearing of the sacroiliac joint)undergo either SI joint fusion with the iFuse Implant
      System or undergo specific, targeted non-surgical treatment of the SI joint.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age 21-70 at time of screening

          2. Patient has lower back pain for &gt;6 months inadequately responsive to conservative
             care

          3. Diagnosis of sacroiliac joint disruption or degenerative sacroiliitis based on ALL of
             the following:

               1. Patient has pain at or close to the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS) with
                  possible radiation into buttocks, posterior thigh or groin and can point with a
                  single finger to the location of pain (Fortin Finger Test), and

               2. Patient has at least 3 of 5 physical examination maneuvers specific for the SI
                  joint (see Table 3), and

               3. Patient has improvement in lower back pain numeric rating scale (NRS) of at
                  least 50% after injection of local anesthetic into affected SI joint(s) (see
                  Section 3.6.4), and

               4. One or more of the following:

             i. SI joint disruption:

               -  Asymmetric SI joint widening on X-ray or CT scan, or

               -  Leakage of contrast on diagnostic arthrography

             ii. Degenerative sacroiliitis:

               -  Radiographic evidence of SI joint degeneration, including sclerosis,
                  osteophytes, subchondral cysts, or vacuum phenomenon on CT or plain film, or

               -  Due to prior lumbosacral spine fusion

          4. Baseline Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) score of at least 30%

          5. Baseline SI joint pain score of at least 50 on 0-100 mm visual analog scale*

          6. Patient has signed study-specific informed consent form

          7. Patient has the necessary mental capacity to participate and is physically able to
             comply with study protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe back pain due to other causes, such as lumbar disc degeneration, lumbar disc
             herniation, lumbar spondylolisthesis, lumbar spinal stenosis, lumbar facet

             osteoporotic fracture).  Patients meeting the osteoporosis screening criteria
             identified by the National Osteoporosis Foundation should be screened for
             osteoporosis with DEXA.****  See Section 3.6.4.

          9. Known allergy to titanium or titanium alloys

         10. Use of medications known to have detrimental effects on bone quality and soft-tissue
             healing

         11. Prominent neurologic condition that would interfere with physical therapy

         12. Current local or systemic infection that raises the risk of surgery

         13. Patient currently receiving or seeking worker's compensation, disability
             remuneration, and/or involved in injury litigation.
