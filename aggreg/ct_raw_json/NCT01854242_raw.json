Development of the disease seems to be related to the defect\n      of neutrophil function in individuals with GSD type Ib and subsequent colonic inflammation.\n      In the last decade, it has become a standard for patients with GSD type Ib and\n      gastrointestinal symptoms to be evaluated for IBD.  Patients with GSD type Ia were not\n      recognized to have similar gastrointestinal symptoms until recently.  The prevalence of IBD\n      is greater in patients with GSD type Ia versus the general population."
