The ultimate purpose is that youth\n      will improve in cognitive functioning and have better functional outcomes including jobs to\n      sustain independent living.\n\n      The results of this study will inform a larger trial on the efficacy of cognitive\n      remediation in homeless youth to improve cognition and vocational outcomes.  Hypotheses are\n      that, compared to those in an active control group receiving computerized work-skills\n      training, individuals who receive cognitive remediation will show greater cognitive benefits\n      on proximal measures of neurocognition and evidence better vocational outcome as defined by\n      greater number of hours worked. This study will address the service gap in the use of\n      integrated psychosocial interventions for homeless populations as the first investigation of\n      cognitive remediation in homeless youth."
