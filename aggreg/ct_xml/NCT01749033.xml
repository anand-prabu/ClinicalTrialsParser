  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A laryngeal mask airway (&quot;LMA&quot;) is an airway device that is commonly used and placed under
      general anesthesia to facilitate ventilation of the patient's lungs while anesthetized. It
      is similar to an &quot;endotracheal tube&quot; (a breathing tube) but is less invasive. It is also
      placed as a backup when the Anesthesiologist is unable to pass a breathing tube and the
      patient is not adequately ventilating. Unfortunately, an LMA may lead to complications
      similar to those of breathing tube placement, such as sore throat and hoarse voice. Previous
      studies have examined several variables that may affect how often complications occur; these
      variables include giving anti-inflammatory medications and inflating the LMA to different
      pressures (the &quot;working&quot; end of the LMA, which rests in the patient's throat, has a cuff
      that is inflated to provide a seal). We are studying the effect of the PLACEMENT TECHNIQUE
      on postoperative sore throat, hoarse voice, and difficulty swallowing. We will be using 3
      placement techniques - the traditional placement technique, a slightly different traditional
      placement technique, and a new technique, abbreviated the &quot;ELLIA&quot; method. The hypothesis of
      this study is that a new LMA insertion technique will have no difference in postoperative
      pharyngolaryngeal morbidity including sore throat, dysphagia and dysphonia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The LMA will be inserted based on one of three methods randomly assigned to each patient.
      The ELLIA technique involves gently lifting the patient's laryngeal structures (throat)
      while placing the LMA to oppose the force of gravity. Whereas the traditional method of
      placement involves guiding the LMA through the pharynx with a finger inserted into the
      pharynx, the ELLIA method avoids this step. General anesthesia will be maintained at the
      discretion of the Anesthesiologist throughout the surgical procedure. At the end of the
      case, as would normally occur, the LMA will be removed from the patient's airway and the
      patient will be taken to the PACU, where he or she will be cared for as usual. At one and
      two hours postoperatively, blinded research assistants will assess the patient for sore
      throat, hoarse voice, and difficulty swallowing. Finally, at 24 hours the patient will
      receive a telephone call from a blinded research assistant assessing for the same outcomes.
      These data will be collected and presented.
