The investigators\n      try to enroll a double blind double dummy study with a good power to compare the effect of\n      this drug both in the form of oral and intravenous against the placebo in preventing the\n      contrast nephropathy in the patients whom undergo coronary angiography/angioplasty."

Among\n      the all prophylactic measures hydration and the dose ant type of contrast are the only\n      factors that have been proved to be effective in preventing contrast nephropathy. N-Acetyl\n      Cystein is an antioxidant agents that may be effective in different aspects of medicine, but\n      it,s use in this condition is controversial. While some studies showed it is effective in\n      prevention of contrast nephropathy, others showed no benefit. Different studies used\n      different dose and route of administration. So more clinical trials with good power are\n      needed to compare different oral Vs IV administration of the drug in a randomized double\n      blinded clinical trial. In this study we allocate the eligible patients with chronic kidney\n      diseases stages 2 to 4 to three groups. Oral N-Acetyl Cystein group, IV N-Acetyl Cystein\n      group, placebo group. All group will be matched according to stages of chronic kidney\n      diseases, diabetes, anemia, heart failure, age and sex."
