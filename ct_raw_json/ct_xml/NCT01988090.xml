  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to look at the difference, if there is a difference between two
      different doses of Vitamin D and the reduction of joint/muscle pain (arthralgia)that is
      caused by taking anti-estrogen medications (aromatase inhibitors) by breast cancer patients.
       The investigators hope to learn if taking a higher dose of Vitamin D is a good way to
      prevent aromatase inhibitor arthralgia (AIA).

    <textblock>
      Treatments with anti-estrogen agents for hormone receptor positive breast cancer is the most
      efficacious of systemic therapies, with aromatase inhibitors (AI's) being considered the
      most active anti-estrogen therapy in early stage breast cancer.  But, use of these
      treatments has been shown to cause musculoskeletal (joint/muscle) side effects that
      sometimes cause patients to discontinue the use of them.  Also, Vitamin D deficiency is a
      well know cause of a wide array of musculoskeletal issues. There is evidence that Vitamin D
      supplementation may help prevent arthralgia while on AI's.  Therefore, the investigators
      want to see if giving a higher dose of Vitamin D could decrease the incidence of AIA as
      compared to a standard dose of Vitamin D.  The investigators believe that this could
      possibly result in patients continued treatment with AI therapy for hormone receptor
      positive breast cancer.

    <description>The primary endpoint for this study is development of Aromatase Inhibitor Arthralgia (AIA) in each arm after 12 weeks of AI therapy. We will measure this by using patient questionnaires that describe the level of AIA pain experienced by the participant.  We will also measure the grip strength of the patients enrolled.
At five years, we will compare breast cancer recurrence rates in each arm to see if there is a difference between those patients that had less pain and stayed on their aromatase inhibitor therapy.</description>

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>We will check compliance of aromatase inhibitor therapy during the study by reviewing the patient's use of AI drug. This will be done by counting remaining pills in patient's bottles of AI at weeks 12, 24, 36, and 52 weeks. Compliance rate over 52 weeks of AI therapy will be compared between the two arms using longitudinal data analysis.
We will test the participant's blood to see if there is an association between low baseline vitamin D levels and AIA (aromatase inhibitor arthralgia / pain).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All participants must be female and at least 21 years of age

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Patients must have had histologically confirmed stage I-III breast carcinoma that is
             positive for Estrogen Receptor (ER) and/or Progesterone Receptor (PR).

          -  Post-menopausal

          -  Beginning adjuvant aromatase inhibitor therapy, with no previous use within the last
             6 weeks

          -  Bisphosphonates are allowed at the treating investigator¡¦s discretion

          -  Performance status (WHO/ECOG scale) 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of kidney stones

          -  Hypercalcemia at baseline, defined as any corrected calcium greater than the
             laboratory's normal parameters

          -  History of either symptomatic hypercalcemia or hyperparathyroidism, at the treating
             investigator's discretion

          -  Baseline Vitamin D level greater than 50 ng/mL

          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with, or follow study procedures.

          -  Currently taking Phenytoin or phenobarbital -7 Currently taking cholestyramine or
             orlistat

          -  Malabsorption syndrome, such as Crohn's disease

        Prohibited Therapies: Patients may not take additional Calcium and Vitamin D aside from
        the study medications. Patients who are on cholestyramine or orlistat will not be allowed
        on the trial. Also, patients who are taking phenytoin or phenobarbital are not allowed on
        the trial either because of interaction between Vitamin D and anti-epileptic medications.
