Intraoperative NIR fluorescence imaging will be performed using a state-of-the-art hand-held fluorescence camera system (f 2.4) for real-time optical visualization of nodal disease, along with gamma counting for 99mTc sulfur colloid, to determine if concordance can be established as a continuous endpoint. Results will be histologically confirmed in resected tissue specimens."

However, these devices\n      cannot be used during the surgical procedure to visualize lymph nodes with cancer (called\n      \"sentinel lymph nodes\"). As a part of the standard of care, the patient will initially\n      undergo imaging of their lymph nodes prior to their surgery. They will be injected with a\n      radioactive dye around the tumor site, and images will be acquired about 2 hours later using\n      a device to image where the dye travels to in the neck. In addition, we will test, for the\n      first time in humans, a new, experimental dye-labeled particle (dots), cRGDY-PEG-Cy5.5-C\n      dots for lymph node mapping. This particle, the size of a small protein, will be injected\n      around sites of melanoma in the operating room to identify diseased nodes using a hand-held\n      camera system. The dye-labeled particle can be viewed in tissues that may contain tumor. The\n      particles will not treat the cancer and any images or information found during this study\n      will not be used for your treatment. The information collected may be used to guide the\n      design of future studies to detect and/or treat tumors."
