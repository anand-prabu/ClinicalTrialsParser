  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare overall survival rates of colorectal cancer patients
      with multi-organ metastases with an indication for first line systemic treatment randomized
      for treatment with combination chemotherapy or treatment with combination chemotherapy and
      additional maximal tumor debulking including surgical tumor resection, RFA, (DEBIRI-)TACE
      and SBRT, depending on best clinical judgement according to a standardized treatment
      algorithm. Our hypothesis is that maximal tumor debulking in addition to systemic treatment
      with chemotherapy and biologicals will provide an improvement in progression free and
      overall survival in this patient group.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histological or cytological documentation of cancer is required.

          -  Indication for first line palliative systemic treatment for metastatic colorectal
             cancer (mCRC).

          -  Patients with CRC metastases in ≥ 2 different organs and

               -  &gt;3 extrahepatic metastases or

               -  &gt;5 hepatic metastases not located to one lobe or

               -  ≥1 hepatic metastases and positive para-aortal or celiac lymph nodes or adrenal
                  metastases

               -  The primary tumor is excluded as metastatic site.

          -  Tumor debulking can be achieved with local treatment modalities in at least 80% of
             metastatic lesions

          -  To meet the inclusion criteria a cytological analysis should be performed in case of
             any uncertainty about the presence of a lesion e.g. a false positive or false
             negative result on imaging.

          -  Age ³ 18 years.

          -  WHO performance status 0 - 1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Adequate bone marrow, liver and renal function as assessed by the following
             laboratory requirements to be conducted within 7 days prior to screening:

               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 5.6 mmol/L;

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1,500/mm3;

               -  Platelet count ≥ 100*109/l;

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 times the upper limit of normal;

               -  ALT and AST ≤ 2.5 x upper limit of normal (≤ 5 x upper limit of normal for
                  subjects with liver involvement of their cancer);

               -  Albumine &gt; 30 g/l;

               -  Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal or a MDRD ≥ 50 ml/min;

               -  Prothrombin time or INR &lt; 1.5 x ULN, unless coumarin derivates are used. Due to
                  interactions with capecitabine, all patients using coumarin derivates will be
                  treated with LMWH instead.

               -  Activated partial thromboplastin time &lt; 1.25 x ULN (therapeutic anticoagulation
                  therapy is allowed if this treatment can be interrupted as judged by the
                  treating physician).

          -  Written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.

          -  Prior (neo-)adjuvant chemotherapy for non-metastatic disease &lt; 6 months after last
             treatment and first detection of metastasis.

          -  Candidates for HIPEC.

          -  Patients with liver metastases only

          -  Evidence of brain metastases.

          -  Other malignant diseases

          -  History of cardiac disease:

               -  Congestive heart failure &gt;NYHA class 2;

               -  Active Coronary Artery Disease (defined as myocardial infarction within 6 months
                  prior to screening);

               -  Cardiac arrhythmias requiring anti-arrhythmic therapy (beta blockers or digoxin
                  are permitted).

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension. Blood pressure must be ≤160/95 mmHg at the time of
             screening on a stable antihypertensive regimen. Blood pressure must be stable on at
             least 3 separate measurements on at least 2 separate days.

          -  Uncontrolled infections (&gt; grade 2 NCI-CTC version 4.0).

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women. Women of childbearing potential must have a
             negative pregnancy test performed within 7 days of the start of treatment. Both men
             and women enrolled in this trial must agree to use adequate barrier birth control
             measures (e.g., cervical cap, condom, and diaphragm) or intrauterine device during
             the course of the trial. Oral birth control methods alone will not be considered
             adequate on this study, because of the potential pharmacokinetic interaction between
             study drug and oral contraceptives. Concomitant use of oral and barrier
             contraceptives is advised.

          -  Concurrent anticancer chemotherapy, immunotherapy or investigational drug therapy
             during the study or within 4 weeks of the start of study drug.

          -  Concomitant use of dexamethasone, anti-convulsants and anti-arrhythmic drugs other
             than digoxin or beta blockers.

          -  Severe allergy for contrast media not controlled with premedication.

          -  Substance abuse, medical, psychological or social conditions that may interfere with
             the subject's participation in the study or evaluation of the study results.

          -  Any condition that is unstable or could jeopardize the safety of the subject and
             their compliance in the study.
