  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the association between the presence of
      HPV infection in one or both members of infertile/sub-infertile couples and the outcome of
      pregnancies obtained by assisted reproduction.

      The success of assisted medical procreation is defined as achieving a pregnancy resulting in
      the birth of a living, viable child.

      The secondary objectives of this study are:

      A. To study the alterations of sperm present in infertile men according to the presence of
      HPV in semen.

      B. Identify the specific HPV genotypes involved.

      C. To study a potential link between HPV and embryonic characteristics (as classified by
      Giorgetti)

      D. To study a potential link between HPV and survival of the conceptus: products of
      miscarriage or stillbirth, duration of pregnancy, birth weight.

      E. To study a potential link between HPV and fetal malformations.
