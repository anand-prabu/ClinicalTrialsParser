The study showed a significant reduction\n      moist desquamation using breast IMRT from 47.8% to 31.2% (p=0.002). There are two other\n      Phase III trials showing improvement of long term cosmetic outcomes. Yet the use of breast\n      IMRT remains not widely accepted. This trial aims at evaluating long term tolerance of\n      breast IMRT compared to standard radiotherapy.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that breast IMRT reduces the occurence of chronic breast pain\n      (primary objective), improves cosmesis, reduces the occurence of delayed and permanent\n      radiation induced skin side effects (telangiectasia, dryness, induration, edema,\n      discolorations), improves quality of life. The investigators also hypothesize that there\n      will not be differences in the local control rate or survival."
