Determine the overall survival of patients treated with this drug. III.\n      Determine the toxicity profile of this drug in these patients. IV. Assess the quality of\n      life of patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive DHA-paclitaxel IV over 2 hours on day\n      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, every 2 courses, and at end of study\n      treatment. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
