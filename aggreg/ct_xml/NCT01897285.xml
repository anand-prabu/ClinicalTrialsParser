  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      AQUACEL® foam adhesive dressing is a sterile Hydrofiber® foam wound dressing consisting of a
      waterproof outer polyurethane film, and a multi-layered absorbent pad, having a silicone
      adhesive border.  The multi-layered absorbent pad contains a layer of polyurethane foam and
      a non-woven wound contact layer of Hydrofiber® (NaCMC). This dressing product was launched
      in 2012. A new source of silicone adhesive is now under assessment for this product. This
      Healthy Volunteer Wear test will form part of the Design Validation for this change in
      supplier and is required to confirm that the new Silicone Adhesive trilaminate supplier can
      coat the silicone adhesive to provide comparable adhesive dressing performance in terms of
      wear time, ease of use and with a similar safety profile in relation to the skin.

    <description>Adhesion at 7 days measured by:
1 = Excellent 2 = Good 3 = Average 4 = Poor 5 = Very Poor
Conformability
1 = Excellent 2 = Good 3 = Average 4 = Poor 5 = Very Poor
Dressing Integrity
1 = Excellent 2 = Good 3 = Average 4 = Poor 5 = Very Poor
Ease of Application
1 = Excellent 2 = Good 3 = Average 4 = Poor 5 = Very Poor
Ease of Removal,
1  = Very easy 2 =  Easy 3 = Difficult 4 = Very difficult
Adhesive Residue 0 = None 1 = Minimal 2 = Moderate 3 = Considerable
Comfort during removal
1 = Excellent 2 = Good 3 = Average 4 = Poor 5 = Very Poor
Condition of the skin This will be evaluated by the Skin Irritation Scale (Doubtful reaction/weak positive reaction/ strong positive reaction/ extreme positive reaction/irritant reaction/ negative reaction)</description>
