The specific aims of this proposed research are identified as follows:\n\n        1. The investigators will investigate the treatment effects of RT + dCIT compared to RT,\n           CIT, and DMCT on motor ability, muscle function, sensory function, daily performance,\n           real-world arm activity, quality of life, and motor control variables at before\n           treatment, midterm assessment, and after treatment. In addition to study of treatment\n           benefits, physiological responses as the potential adverse effects including\n           post-exertional fatigue, post-exertional pain, and a biomarker of oxidative stress will\n           be also examined in this project. The investigators hypothesized that the therapeutic\n           regimen combining RT with dCIT will contribute to more significantly reduction in\n           impairment and disability for stroke patients than the other intervention groups.\n\n        2. The investigators will investigate if the clinical characteristics or behavioral\n           markers of stroke patients will influence the outcomes after interventions. The\n           proposed potential predictors will be chronicity, side of lesion, muscle tone, motor\n           ability of distal part of upper limb, and amount of affected hand use.\n\n        3. The investigators will examine whether the improved scores after each treatment reach\n           clinically important changes in order to establish the clinical significance relevant\n           for individualized medicine. The investigators will also assess and compare the\n           clinimetric properties (e.g., validity, responsiveness, minimal detectable change, and\n           minimal clinically important difference) of the rehabilitation outcomes to inform\n           selection of instruments."
