  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if a new way of imaging called the Cerenkov luminescence
      or effect that is used with a standard clinical PET/CT scans can be done in order to capture
      tumor sizes. The investigators believe endoscopies and surgical procedures could benefit
      from this type of imaging in the future. The Cerenkov imaging could be used as a guide for
      surgical resections.

      The purpose of this study is to use the Cerenkov light from FDG or Iodine-131 tracers to
      image tumors and its sizes in the head, neck, breast, axillary and pelvic regions with a
      highly sensitive camera. The investigators will be trying to see if we can get another
      picture of the tumor using the Cerenkov light as part of the standard clinical scan or
      therapy.

    <description>This study seeks to optically image the Cerenkov emissions from the PET tracer 18F-FDG and the radiotherapeutic 131I in a cohort of patients with tumors in the pathologic lymph nodes in the neck, axilla or inguinal region as well as primary breast tumors.</description>

    <description>We will image (i) patients who are receiving a 18F-FDG PET/CT scan for tumors in the head / neck region and (ii) patients with thyroid cancer after 131I radioablation. Two scans will be completed per patient, one of the primary tumors, as well as a 'background' scan of the contralateral side or, if tumor is there as well, of the forearm. The device to be used is an intensified charge-coupled device camera (Stanford Photonics, Palo Alto, CA) connected to a laptop PC. The camera will use a Quartz high-UV transmission 50 mm 0.8f lens. The Imaging device will be placed approximately 5 cm from the area of the patient to be imaged.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is 18 years of age or older.

          -  Participant is scheduled for standard clinical 18F-FDG PET/CT scan or 131I therapy
             within the Nuclear Medicine Service at Main Hospital.

          -  Patients must have pathologic lymph node metastases in the neck, axillary or inguinal
             area (do not need to be biopsy proven) from either leukemias, lymphomas: , Head and
             Neck cancers (e.g. tonsillar, nasopharynx, tongue carcinoma, breast cancer or
             melanoma;or lymphoma or tonsillar or squamous cell carcinoma with metastases in the
             neck region for PET/CT imaging, or thyroid cancer for thyroid ablation therapy. Any
             other more infrequent cancer metastasizing with nodal metastasis in the neck, axilla
             and inguinal regions to cervical lymph nodes is eligible as well as the primary goal
             is to image pathological (i.e. hypermetabolic) lymph nodes.

          -  Patients with hypermetabolic activity and uptake in the neck,axilla, breast and
             inguinal region on scan, defined visually as significant lesion suspicious for
             malignancy by a nuclear medicine physician or trainee.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients imaged for Cerenkov luminescence are going to be required to be in a
             darkened enclosure for at least 10 minutes and sit still during image acquisition,
             potentially covered by a dark cloth in case that the ambient light level remains too
             high for the ultra-sensitive camera. Any conditions that would prevent this will
             exclude the patients.

          -  There are no other past medical, physiological or demographic concerns. This includes
             any patients with skin blemishes that are present at the dermis over the tumor, as
             these are of particular interest for use of this technique.
