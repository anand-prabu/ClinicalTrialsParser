            "textblock": "Heart failure is a public health problem, responsible for 150.000 admissions, 32.000 deaths,\n      1% of public health expenditure each year in France. Heart transplantation remains the\n      standard of care in patients for which medical therapy is not sufficient. But heart\n      transplantation is a limited resource, as a result of donor shortages. It is therefore\n      possible to consider mechanical circulatory support for patients awaiting heart\n      transplantation or for those who are not suitable for transplantation. Left Ventricular\n      Assist Devices (LVAD) are portable pumps which help the left side of the heart to provide\n      appropriate \"cardiac\" output. in this type of device, right heart is not assisted and must\n      work on its own, LVADs are thus implanted in patients whose right ventricular function is\n      normal.\n\n      The aim of the REVADE study is to assess right ventricular echocardiographic parameters in\n      this population, especially on physical exercise, for a better understanding of right\n      ventricular adaptation to this long-term modified pressure pattern."
