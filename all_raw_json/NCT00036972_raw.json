Patients with histologically confirmed malignant glioma receive interleukin-13\n           PE38QQR immunotoxin via continuous intratumoral infusion over 48 hours on days 2 and 3.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pre-resection interleukin-13 PE38QQR\n      immunotoxin until the histologically effective concentration (HEC) is reached or maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The HEC is defined by pathologic observations. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity. After the HEC is reached or MTD is determined, up to 6 additional patients are\n      enrolled at selected dose levels to study safety and tolerability. Subsequent cohorts of\n      patients are not treated with a pre-resection infusion.\n\n        -  Resection (all patients): Patients undergo maximal resection (en bloc, if feasible)\n           followed by placement of 2-3 peritumoral catheters (4 days after completion of\n           pre-resection infusion for the initial cohorts of patients and at study entry for\n           subsequent cohorts of patients).\n\n        -  Post-resection therapy (all patients): Beginning on the second day after resection,\n           patients receive interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin via continuous peritumoral infusion\n           over 96 hours.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin until\n      the previously-defined HEC is reached or MTD is determined, whichever occurs first. If\n      dose-escalation is stopped after HEC is reached, then three additional cohorts of patients\n      receive escalating durations (5, 6, or 7 days) of post-resection infusion. If dose\n      escalation is stopped after the MTD is determined, then the duration of post-resection\n      infusion is not escalated.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-50 patients will be accrued for this study."
