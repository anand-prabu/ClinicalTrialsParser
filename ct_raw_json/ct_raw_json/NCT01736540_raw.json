            "textblock": "Iron, one of the most common elements in nature and the most abundant transition metal in\n      the body, is readily capable of accepting and donating electrons. This capability makes iron\n      a useful component of various, essential biochemical processes. Despite the essential role\n      of iron, the excess of iron is toxic to the human body. It is critical for the human body to\n      maintain iron balance, since humans have no physiologic mechanism for actively removing iron\n      from the body.\n\n      The development of iron overload occurs when iron intake exceeds the body's capacity to\n      safely store the iron in the liver, which is the primary store for iron. Long-term\n      transfusion therapy, a life-giving treatment for patients with intractable chronic anemia is\n      currently the most frequent cause of secondary iron overload.\n\n      The mounting evidence regarding the mortality and morbidity due to chronic iron overload in\n      transfusion dependent anaemias has led to the establishment of guidelines that aim the\n      improvement of patient outcomes. Further prospective studies are warranted in order to\n      assess the impact of iron overload in patients with acquired anaemias.\n\n      In this study, non-invasive R2- and T2*-MRI techniques will be applied to the liver and the\n      heart, respectively, to complement the primary variable (serum ferritin) assessed in\n      patients with various transfusion-dependent anaemias. The main objective of this study is to\n      assess the prevalence and severity of cardiac and liver siderosis in patients with\n      transfusional siderosis. This study will also aim to establish possible correlations between\n      cardiac and liver iron levels with clinical effects in patients with different\n      transfusion-dependent anaemias. Patients will be eligible for enrollment irrespective of\n      receiving chelation therapy or not (and irrespective of the chelating agent used)."
