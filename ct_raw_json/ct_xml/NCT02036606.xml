  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Racing thoughts relate to subjective acceleration of thinking which has been essentially
      associated with manic episodes in bipolar disorder. Qualitatively, the phenomenology of
      racing thoughts in major depression seems to differ from rumination and pure manic racing
      thoughts: thoughts of all kinds accumulate in the patient's head. Recent qualitative
      evidence is consistent with the existence of these two kinds of &quot;thought overactivity&quot;
      related to mood disorders. In order to evaluate this and better understand the
      psychopathological and cognitive mechanisms that underlie thought overactivity in mood
      disorders, we have created a 34-item self-questionnaire - the Racing and Crowded Thoughts
      Questionnaire (RCTQ) and a number of neuropsychological tasks (time perception, cognitive
      flexibility). Also, given the relationship between mood disorders and creativity, it is
      likely that thought overactivity is related to increased creativity. We aim at evaluating
      this relationship through the French version of the Cognitive Processes Associated with
      Creativity scale (CPAC).
