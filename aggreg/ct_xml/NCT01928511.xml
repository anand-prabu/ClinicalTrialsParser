  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Chronic Hepatitis B on long term oral antiviral therapy have to continue
      treatment indefinitely unless they achieve HBeAg seroconversion or HBsAg seroclearance, when
      therapy can be stopped. While HBeAg seroconversion is a more achievable endpoint, only
      20-25% of patients develop this after one year of oral antiviral therapy. HBsAg
      seroclearance is universally infrequent. Strategies to improve these endpoints such as
      combination oral antiviral therapy have not been generally successful and recently studies
      have examined the possibility of switching or adding peginterferon therapy. However these
      have not been tested adequately in the group of patients that have been on long term oral
      antiviral therapy. Consequently this study was conceived to evaluate whether switching or
      adding peginterferon compared to continuing oral antiviral therapy are more efficacious
      strategies. HBeAg positive and HBeAg negative patients (n=310)will be randomised to continue
      oral antiviral therapy, switch or add pegylated interferon for 48 weeks in a ratio of 1:2:2
      respectively. The study endpoints are HBsAg seroclearance, reduction of qHBsAg &gt;1 log,
      qHBsAg&lt;200 IU/ml, HBeAg loss and seroconversion, and HBV DNA suppression, all at week 72.
