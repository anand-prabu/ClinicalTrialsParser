For example, increased whey\n      protein ingestion with and without exercise training is associated with enhanced weight\n      loss, body composition and subjective hunger in overweight and obese individuals. Our\n      findings suggest that the effects of whey protein ingestion occur independent of a\n      calorie-restricted diet and to a greater extent in individuals following a combined exercise\n      program of resistance exercise, sprint intervals, stretching/yoga/pilates, and aerobic\n      exercise training compared to standard resistance training."
