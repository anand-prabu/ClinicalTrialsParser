This\n      study will determine the long term medical condition and daily functioning of patients with\n      CGD after a transplant and if possible, compare these results to patients who do not undergo\n      a transplant.\n\n      This multi-center study combines a longitudinal and cross-sectional evaluation (both retro\n      and prospectively) of subjects with confirmed CGD who have already received  hematopoietic\n      cell transplant (HCT) since 1995 or who will receive HCT during the study period. This study\n      will investigate which subjects benefit most from HCT, and the overall outcomes in CGD\n      patients with and without transplant. The study aims to identify variables contributing to\n      best outcomes of HCT in subjects with CGD."

All transplanted subjects in the\n             Cross-Sectional Analysis are surviving and shall have at least 3 years of follow-up\n             post-transplant to be included.
