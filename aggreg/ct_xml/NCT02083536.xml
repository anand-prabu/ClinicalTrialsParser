      The ultimate clinical aim of this proposed phase I trial is to evaluate  the toxicity and
      determine the recommended phase II dose of combining the effect of  LDFWART following
      administration of Carboplatin and docetaxel for 6 cycles in patients with recurrent
      platinum-sensitive and - resistant ovarian cancer.

    <description>Chemotherapy will consist of 6 cycles of Docetaxel and Carboplatin. Each cycle will follow standard of care and will be scheduled every 3 weeks ± 3 days. Chemotherapy should be administered in the morning to allow 6-8 hours before Radiation Therapy.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents within 4 weeks
             preceding the start of study treatment) or chemotherapy for at least 3 weeks
