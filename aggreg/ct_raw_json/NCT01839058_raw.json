Some evidence suggests it may be related to sustained esophageal contractions\n      (SECs) of longitudinal smooth muscle. The investigators have previously shown that acid is a\n      trigger for SECs and results in shortening of the esophagus. In this study, the\n      investigators plan to prospectively evaluate esophageal shortening responses to acid in a\n      group of patients with NCCP compared to controls. The investigators will use high resolution\n      esophageal manometry coupled with acid infusion to evaluate shortening.  The investigators\n      hypothesize that at least a subset of patients with NCCP will have an exaggerated esophageal\n      shortening response to acid which correlates with symptom production. If our hypothesis\n      proves true, this may lead to a future therapeutic target in the treatment of these\n      patients."
