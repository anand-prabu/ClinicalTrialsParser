  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To advance our understanding of the mechanisms of human cardiorenal syndrome with emphasis
      upon the interaction of diuretic therapy and the renal-angiotensin-aldosterone -system and
      cGMP pathway.

      The belief is that the chronic AT1 receptor blockade in subjects with compensated CHF and
      renal dysfunction will improve renal function with increased sodium excretion, glomerular
      filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow and renal function reserve as compared to
      the response of placebo-treated subjects.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction of equal or less than 40% assessed by
             echocardiography, nuclear scan, MRI or left ventriculogram within the past 48 months.

          -  Stable New York Heart Association (NYHA) class II and III symptoms as defined by: no
             change in NYHA symptoms over the past 3 months, on stable doses of ACE inhibitor,
             beta blocker, digoxin and furosemide over the last 4 weeks and no episode of
             decompensated CHF over the past 6 months.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance of equal or less than 80 ml/min and greater than 20
             ml/min, using the MDRD formula assessed within the past 48 months and a confirmatory
             calculated creatinine clearance equal or less than 80 ml/min and greater than 20
             ml/min at the time of enrollment.

        Subjects who are already taking AT1 receptor blocker will be excluded.  Aldosterone
        antagonist, antiarrhythmic medications and other vasodilators will be allowed; however,
        all medications must be at stable doses 4 weeks prior to enrollment.  Subjects taking
        nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) except aspirin will not be able to increase
        their medication dose for the duration of the study.  Subjects will be excluded if they
        have had a prior diagnosis of intrinsic renal disease, including renal artery stenosis of
        &gt; 50%, or if they meet any one of the exclusion criteria listed below.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior diagnosis of intrinsic renal diseases including renal artery stenosis of &gt; 50%

          -  Peritoneal or hemodialysis within 90 days or anticipation that dialysis or
             ultrafiltration of any form will be required during the study period

          -  Hospitalization for decompensated CHF during the past 6 months

          -  Subjects that are taking AT1 receptor blockers

          -  Myocardial infarction within 6 months of screening

          -  Unstable angina within  6 months of screening, or any evidence of myocardial ischemia

          -  Significant valvular stenosis, hypertrophic, restrictive or obstructive
             cardiomyopathy, constrictive pericarditis, primary pulmonary hypertension, or biopsy
             proven active myocarditis

          -  Severe congenital heart diseases

          -  Sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation within 14 days of
             screening

          -  Second or third degree heart block without a permanent cardiac pacemaker

          -  Stroke within 3 months of screening, or other evidence of significantly compromised
             CNS perfusion

          -  ALT &gt;1.5 times the upper limit of normal

          -  Serum sodium of  &lt; 125 mEq/dL or &gt; 160 mEq/dL

          -  Serum potassium of &lt; 3.5 mEq/dL or &gt; 5.7 mEq/dL

          -  Serum digoxin level of &gt; 2.0 ng/ml

          -  Hemoglobin &lt; 9 gm/dl

          -  Other acute or chronic medical conditions or laboratory abnormality which may
             increase the risks associated with study participation or may interfere with
             interpretation of the data

          -  Received an investigational drug within 1 month prior to dosing

          -  Patients with an allergy to iodine.

          -  Female subject who is pregnant or breastfeeding

             is unsuitable for any reasons
