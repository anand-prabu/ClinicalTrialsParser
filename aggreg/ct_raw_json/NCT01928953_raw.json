The study will do so by evaluating the burden of illness impact of OIC on each of\n      the opioid user patient sub-groups of interest in terms of clinical outcomes (including\n      symptoms), resource utilization (laxative use, OIC-related MD visits, hospitalizations, and\n      ER visits), economic burden, and HRQL. This study also aims to identify \"predictors\" of\n      outcomes of interest and will evaluate physician and patient perceptions of the severity and\n      burden of OIC."
