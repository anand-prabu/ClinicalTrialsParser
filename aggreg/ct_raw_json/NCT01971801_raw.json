Emerging evidence from observational studies links vitamin D insufficiency\n      with UI. Prior to a larger intervention trial of vitamin D among older women with low serum\n      vitamin D levels and urgency UI, we propose a pilot study in 100 older women comparing\n      weekly, oral vitamin D3 50,000 IU to placebo. We hypothesize that adequate vitamin D\n      supplementation will improve UI symptoms in older women with vitamin D deficiency. Changes\n      in UI-episodes will be assessed by a 7-day bladder diary and other validated symptom\n      measures administered at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention. Serum calcium and\n      25(OH)D levels will be monitored. The expected outcomes will provide new knowledge regarding\n      the impact of vitamin D supplementation on UI symptom improvement and inform a larger,\n      randomized controlled clinical trial involving vitamin D supplementation."
