Evaluate the effects of 20 Gy of external-beam radiotherapy to 1 orbit vs.\n      the untreated orbit at 3 and 6 months after therapy in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy.\n\n      II.  Evaluate whether 20 Gy of external-beam radiotherapy delivered to the second orbit 6\n      months later in the course of the disease produces effects of equal magnitude to those\n      observed when the first orbit was treated.\n\n      III.  Relate the magnitude of treatment effects to the time since onset of eye symptoms.\n\n      IV.  Evaluate whether characteristics of radiation retinopathy are present 3 years after\n      orbital radiotherapy."
