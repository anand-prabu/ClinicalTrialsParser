The overall benefit from alteplase\n      is substantial, but up to 2/3 of patients with large artery clots may not achieve reopening\n      of the vessel and up to 40% of the patients may remain severely disabled or die, leaving\n      substantial room for improvement. Tenecteplase, widely used in coronary heart disease, may\n      be more effective and may have less bleeding complications than alteplase, and may be the\n      drug of choice also in stroke.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: Tenecteplase may be given safely to patients with acute ischemic stroke at a\n      dose that is associated with improved clinical outcome compared with existing treatment\n      options.\n\n      AIMS: To compare efficacy and safety of tenecteplase vs. alteplase given <4\u00bd hours after\n      symptom onset.\n\n      STUDY ENDPOINTS: The primary study endpoint is excellent clinical outcome at 3 months\n      (effect). Secondary study endpoints are major early clinical improvement (effect) and\n      bleeding complications (safety)."

The number of\n      patients treated at a participating centre will therefore essentially remain unchanged.\n      Estimated 400 patients are thrombolysed per year in participating centres. Allowing for 20%\n      of patients not being included in NOR-TEST, the total number of patients (n=954) will still\n      be met."
