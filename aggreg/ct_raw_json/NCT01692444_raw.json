The role of fibrocytes has been demonstrated in\n      the pathophysiology of asthma, lung fibrosis or pulmonary hypertension. However, the\n      recruitment of blood fibrocytes and their involvement in COPD airway remodelling remain\n      unknown.\n\n      The main objective of the study is to analyse the distribution and quantify the number of\n      the peri-bronchial and blood circulating fibrocytes in patients with different stages of\n      COPD compared to control subjects."
