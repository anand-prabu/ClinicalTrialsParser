            "textblock": "Preclinical studies provide strong support for the concept that fasting evokes resistance to\n      multiple forms of stress. Fasting reduces plasma levels of growth factors and modulates\n      intracellular nutrient sensing systems, thereby diverting energy from growth to maintenance.\n      Accordingly, the currently available preclinical evidence suggests that short-term fasting\n      protects normal cells against the perils of chemotherapy. In contrast, cancer cells are not\n      protected, as a result of their self-sufficiency in growth signals. This phenomenon is\n      termed Differential Stress Resistance (DSR). DSR reduces the severity of toxic side-effects\n      of chemotherapy and interestingly, it simultaneously renders cancer cells more vulnerable to\n      chemotherapeutics. Importantly, extensive preclinical evidence and preliminary clinical data\n      indicate that a specifically designed very low calorie, low amino acid substitution diet\n      (\"Fasting Mimicking Diet, FMD\") has effects on cancer therapy that are very similar to those\n      of fasting. This study aims to evaluate the impact of the FMD on tolerance to and efficacy\n      of neoadjuvant chemotherapy in women with stage II or III breast cancer."
