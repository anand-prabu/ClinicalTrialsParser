Long-term adjuvant endocrine therapy\n      (AET) improves breast cancer outcomes greatly, but, unfortunately, is commonly associated\n      with physical and emotional concerns. I propose to evaluate the feasibility and preliminary\n      effectiveness of a behavioral intervention to facilitate problem identification, provide\n      education, coaching for breast cancer survivors with symptoms while on AET. Therefore, the\n      intervention intends to empower women to engage in better self-care and seek out resources\n      they need, which, in turn, will lead to better symptom management."
