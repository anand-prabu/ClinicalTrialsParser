  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is conducted in Europe. The aim of the trial is to compare cognitive function and
      associated brain activation patterns during an acute hypoglycaemic episode and during
      euglycaemia (normal blood glucose concentration). Additionally, the purpose is to assess
      cognitive function in the recovery phase after hypoglycaemia or euglycaemia, respectively,
      in subjects with type 1 diabetes.

    <description>Each subject will be randomly allocated to an experimental visit sequence consisting of a hypoglycaemic glucose clamp followed by euglycaemic glucose clamp (using i.v. infusion of human soluble insulin (Actrapid®)) or vice versa separated by at least 21 days. Each visit includes an overnight stay. For each of the two conditions (euglycaemia and hypoglycaemia) cognitive performance will be assessed by a validated cognitive test</description>
