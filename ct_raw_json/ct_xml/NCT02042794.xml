  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver resection is an operation to remove the diseased part of the liver. The liver is
      supplied by two vessels, the hepatic artery and the portal vein supplying 25% and 75%
      respectively of the total blood flow with 50% oxygen from each vessel. During liver
      resection it is standard practice to clamp both vessels(Pringle's manoeuvre), so as to avoid
      bleeding. Clamping both the vessels deprives the unaffected liver from nutrients required
      for survival. Reinstating the blood supply causes further damage by pouring harmful
      substances into the liver, which accumulate during the clamping. We hypothesize that not
      clamping the oxygen rich hepatic artery will cause less damage to the liver.

      Our aim is to compare the Pringle manoeuvre with portal vein clamping, to identify if the
      latter will result in less tissue injury and thereby fewer complications. Initially we aim
      to conduct a pilot study. The main objective is to ensure that patients can be successfully
      recruited and that data capture is complete. The secondary outcomes will be development of
      infective complications by 30 days following surgery, bleeding and blood transfusion
      requirements, heart/chest complications, recovery of liver functions, growth of remnant
      liver, death within 30 days following surgery, length of high dependency unit/hospital stay
      and quality of life at 3 months after surgery.

      There is published literature on the safety of this method and in the event of any
      intraoperative problems, the procedure will be converted to the standard Pringle manoeuvre.
      The Liver Unit at St James's University Hospital has four surgeons performing around 270
      liver cancer resections per year, of which nearly 160 are for bowel cancer spread.
      Considering the team's experience in research and liver surgery, we believe it is well
      placed to conduct the trial in a safe and efficient manner.
