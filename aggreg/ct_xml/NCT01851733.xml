  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided laser surgery
      (MLA) and doxorubicin hydrochloride in treating patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      multiforme. The blood brain barrier (BBB) is a separation of circulating blood from the
      tissue of the central nervous system, preventing substances in the blood from entering the
      brain. MLA disrupts the BBB around the tumor which may allow cancer-killing substances to be
      carried directly to the tumor and the surrounding area. Using MLA prior to chemotherapy may
      result in a greater concentration of drug in the tumor to kill the cancer cells while
      limiting side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Evaluate imaging techniques (MRI) and blood tests (biomarkers) to help figure out the best
      time for chemotherapy to be initiated after the blood brain barrier is disrupted, as it is
      immediately following a procedure like MRI-guided laser ablation (MLA-Monteris Neuroblate).

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria - Arm A:

          -  Newly diagnosed brain tumors that appear high-grade based on MRI.

          -  Scheduled for biopsy for diagnostic purposes.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB-approved written informed
             consent document.

        Exclusion Criteria - Arm A:

          -  Currently receiving or scheduled to receive any other therapies intended to treat the
             newly diagnosed high grade glioma prior to the biopsy and the post-biopsy biomarker
             sample collection.

          -  Pregnant.

        Inclusion Criteria - Arms B and C:

          -  Histologically confirmed GBM; rare GBM variants and secondary Glioblastoma multiforme
             (GBM) are allowed.  Note: Patients with suspected secondary GBM will be eligible to
             consent to this study.  The biopsy for pathologic confirmation of secondary GBM is
             typically performed at the same time as the MLA procedure to minimize risk to
             patients (one surgical procedure to the brain instead of two).  These patients would
             be consented and would undergo study procedures (the pre- and post-MLA blood draws
             and MRIs), but would not go on to receive doxorubicin if pathology does not confirm
             the diagnosis of secondary GBM.  For these patients, confirmation of secondary GBM
             from frozen tissue or preliminary pathology is acceptable in the absence of full
             pathology for randomization and treatment.

          -  Unequivocal evidence of tumor progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan.

          -  There must be an interval of at least 12 weeks from the completion of radiotherapy to
             study registration except if there is unequivocal evidence for tumor recurrence per
             RANO criteria. When the interval is less than 12 weeks from the completion of
             radiotherapy, the use of PET scan is allowed to differentiate between unequivocal
             evidence of tumor recurrence and pseudoprogression.

          -  Largest dimension of the recurrent tumor is a maximum of approximately 3 cm.

          -  At least 18 years of age.

          -  Karnofsky performance status â¥ 60%.

          -  Scheduled for MRI-guided Laser Ablation (MLA).

          -  Normal left ventricular ejection fraction on MUGA or echocardiogram within the past 1
             year prior to registration for patients with history of congestive heart failure
             and/or coronary disease requiring medications other than aspirin, or known prior
             exposure to anthracycline chemotherapy.

          -  Adequate bone marrow and hepatic function as defined below (must be within 7 days of
             MLA):

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) â¥ 1500/mcl (G-CSF is allowed)

               -  Platelets â¥ 100,000/mcl

               -  Hemoglobin â¥ 9 (pRBC transfusion +/- ESA are allowed)

               -  ALT â¤ 3 x ULN

               -  AST â¤ 3 x ULN

               -  ALP â¤ 3 x ULN.  If ALP is &gt; 3 x ULN, GGT must be checked and be â¤ 3 x ULN.

               -  Bilirubin â¤ 2 x ULN

          -  At the time of registration, patient must have recovered from the toxic effects of
             prior therapy to no more than grade 1 toxicity.

          -  At the time of registration, patient must be at least 2 weeks from prior vincristine,
             3 weeks from prior procarbazine, and 4 weeks from other prior cytotoxic chemotherapy.

          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and
             for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect
             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating
             physician immediately.

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed
             consent document (or that of legally authorized representative, if applicable).

        Exclusion Criteria - Arms B and C:

          -  Prior treatment with doxorubicin and/or bevacizumab.

          -  Prior treatment with Gliadel wafer is allowed if it has been at least 3 months from
             placement.

          -  Previous treatment with complete cumulative doses of daunorubicin, idarubicin, and/or
             other anthracyclines and anthracenediones that is equivalent to a total dose of 240
             mg/m2 doxorubicin.

          -  More than 2 prior relapses.

          -  Currently receiving any other investigational agents that are intended as treatments
             of GBM.

          -  A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or
             biologic composition to doxorubicin or other agents used in the study.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, recent heart attack within the previous 12 months or severe heart
             problems, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Premenopausal women must have a negative serum
             pregnancy test within 14 days of study entry.

          -  Inability to undergo MRI due to personal and medical reasons.

          -  Known HIV-positivity on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the potential
             for pharmacokinetic interactions with doxorubicin.  In addition, these patients are
             at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.
             Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination
             antiretroviral therapy when indicated.
