      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of two doses (6 Development Units [DU]
      and 12 DU) of MK-8237 sublingual tablets compared to Placebo in adolescents with house dust
      mite-induced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis.

      Study Hypothesis:

      At least one dose of MK-8237 sublingual tablet is safe and well-tolerated in adolescents
      with house dust mite-induced allergic rhinitis/rhinoconjunctivitis.
