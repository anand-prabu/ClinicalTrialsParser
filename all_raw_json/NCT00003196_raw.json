            "textblock": "It is known that immune reactions of the donor cells against cancer contribute significantly\n      to the ability to achieve cure after bone marrow transplant (BMT). This research study will\n      test an approach to treating cancer that uses immune cells from the donor to fight the\n      cancer cells. The main reason for using this treatment is the evidence that strong immune\n      responses can occur from donor cells and remissions from cancer have been reported in\n      patients whose cancer came back after a bone marrow transplant. This type of treatment is\n      called a donor leukocyte infusion or DLI. It has been shown that it is possible to get\n      complete remissions of the cancer by using DLI. Most success with the use of DLI has been in\n      a form of leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia. However, there is good evidence that\n      this effect can occur in other diseases including multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and chronic\n      lymphocytic leukemia. This type of immune response against cancer cells is usually called a\n      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect"
