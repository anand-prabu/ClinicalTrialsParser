  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether, for individuals in inpatient opioid
      detoxification, linking to outpatient Suboxone treatment increases treatment adherence and
      reduces relapse to illicit opioid use.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this randomized trial, consenting individuals seeking inpatient opioid detoxification
      will be assigned to one of two groups. The first group will receive a tapering schedule of
      buprenorphine during inpatient detoxification to alleviate acute withdrawal symptoms, and
      referral to a community medical and substance abuse treatment providers (DETOX). The second
      group will also receive buprenorphine to relieve withdrawal symptoms, but will maintain a
      stable dose of buprenorphine through inpatient discharge and linkage to an appointment with
      a primary care provider within a week of discharge (LINKAGE). All participants complete
      study assessments at baseline, 1-month, 3-months and 6-months post-enrollment.

      The SSTAR inpatient detoxification program based in Fall River, Massachusetts will serve as
      the recruitment site of this trial. SSTAR's program has 38 beds and is a 24-hour medically
      and psychiatrically supervised treatment facility that provides evaluation and withdrawal
      management. The SSTAR Family Healthcare Center is a 330 Federally Qualified facility also in
      Fall River that provides primary care and behavioral health services to residents of
      Community Health Network Area 25 (Fall River, Somerset, Swansea and Westport,
      Massachusetts). Dr. Bailey, Director of Research at SSTAR, will oversee the provision of
      buprenorphine treatment to study participants during detoxification and serve as liaison to
      the primary care providers at the Family Healthcare Center.
