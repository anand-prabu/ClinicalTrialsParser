    <textblock>
      This is an open-label Phase 1/2 study to assess the maximum tolerated dose of cintredekin
      besudotox (IL-13PE, hlLl3-PE38QQR) and the therapeutic response as assessed by Response
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria. In Phase 1, patients will first
      receive a dose of 1 μg/kg intravenously (iv), which if tolerated, will be escalated to a
      maximum of 3 μg/kg iv. In Phase 2 of the study, patients will receive the maximum tolerated
      dose determined in Phase 1. The maximum tolerated dose will be administered on Days 1, 3,
      and 5 of Week 1 of each 4 week cycle for a maximum of 4 cycles (16 weeks). Phase 1 of the
      study will enroll patients with adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), malignant pheochromocytoma,
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Phase 2 of the study will only
      include patients with ACC.

      The investigators hypothesize that IL-13-PE will cause cancer regression in patients with
      metastatic and locally advanced adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) and other malignancies with
      high IL13Rα2 expression level given the following:

        -  High levels of interleukin-13 receptor alpha 2 (IL13Rα2) are observed in ACC and in
           malignant pheochromocytoma, pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, and hepatocellular
           carcinoma.

        -  IL13Rα2 regulates cellular proliferation and invasion of ACC cells.

        -  IL-13-PE is highly effective in causing cell death in IL13Rα2 positive ACC cells, and
           causes tumor regression and prolonged survival in an ACC xenograft nude mice model.

      The purposes of this study are:

        -  To determine the safety and maximal tolerated dose of IL-13-PE in patients with
           metastatic and locally advanced ACC and other malignancies with high IL13Rα2 expression
           level.

        -  To determine response rate and progression-free survival in patients with recurrent,
           metastatic, or primary unresectable ACC treated with IL-13-PE.

        -  Evaluate response to IL-13-PE with functional imaging as compared to axial imaging.

        -  Determine if response to IL-13-PE treatment is associated with IL13Rα2 expression
           level.

    <description>An OR=a complete (CR) or partial response (PR)/non-CR. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 5 (maximum of 2/organ) representative of all involved organs will be identified as target lesions (TL) and measured at baseline. A sum of the diameters (SD, longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all TLs will be calculated and reported as the baseline SD. All other lesions including pathological lymph nodes (LN) will be identified as non-TLs and recorded, but not measured, at baseline. For TLs, CR=disappearance of all TLs and a reduction in the short axis to &lt; 10 mm of any pathological LNs (whether target or non-target), and PR= ≥ 30% decrease in the SD of TLs taking as reference the baseline SD. For non-TLs, CR=disappearance of all non-TLs, normalization of tumor marker level (TML), and all LNs must be non-pathological in size (&lt; 10 mm short axis); and non-CR=the persistence of 1 or more non-TLs and/or maintenance of TML above normal limits.</description>

    <description>PFS was defined as the time from randomization to disease progression (PD) or death. All measurable lesions (maximum of 5 per organ and 10 in total, those with the longest diameter and suitability for accurate repeated measurements) were identified as target lesions (TL). A sum of the longest diameter for all TLs was calculated and reported as the baseline sum longest diameter(SLD). All other lesions were identified as non-TLs and recorded at baseline. PD for TLs was defined as ≥ 20% increase in the SLD, taking as reference the smallest SLD recorded since treatment started or the appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PD for non-TLs was defined as the appearance of 1 or more new lesions and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-TLs. Patients with neither PD nor death were censored at the date of the last tumor assessment that confirmed no PD. Patients who underwent surgical resection with curative intent without prior progression were censored at the date of surgery.</description>

    <description>Phase I of the study will begin with 1 patient who will receive 1 μg/kg. If this patient experiences no greater than grade 1 toxicity of any type, then enrollment of 3-6 patients at the next 2 dose levels, 2 and 3 μg/kg, will start, following a conventional 3+3 design. If the 1 patient at 1 μg/kg experiences any grade 2 or higher toxicity, then enrollment at the 1 μg/kg level will be expanded to a total of 3-6 patients, prior to possible escalation to the 2 and 3 μg/kg dose levels. If none of the first 3 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) at 1 μg/kg, then escalation will proceed to 2 μg/kg; if 1 patient in the first 3 experiences a DLT at 1 μg/kg, then 3 more will be enrolled at that dose level, with subsequent escalation only if 1/6 has a DLT at 1 μg/kg.</description>
