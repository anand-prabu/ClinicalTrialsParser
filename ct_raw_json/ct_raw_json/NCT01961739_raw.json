Taking into account a drop-out rate of 50%,\n      total number of 69 patients in each arm is estimated as sufficient to close the study.\n\n      Patients will be randomly assigned into 2 arms, arm 1 (treatment): topical 2% lidocaine and\n      arm 2 (control): vaseline base. Each arm will consist of 69 patients. Patients will be\n      assigned to either treatment or control arm according to the randomization table.\n\n        -  Treatment arm - topical 2% lidocaine. Topical application of 2% lidocaine in vaseline\n           base repeated two times per day,\n\n        -  Control arm - vaseline base. Topical application of pure vaseline base twice per day.\n\n      In addition to the aforementioned topical treatments, all patients will be given written\n      instructions to perform dietary modifications and anal hygiene. All patients with bleeding\n      hemorrhoids will be given Detralex 2 tablets twice per day.\n\n      Those patients in whom a technically successful procedure has been completed will be\n      considered as valuable for the efficacy evaluation. A technically successful procedure is\n      defined as the completion of treatment procedures stipulated in this protocol and consists\n      of correct drug dose and frequency of application, adherence to written instructions for\n      dietary modification and anal hygiene and presence at follow-up visits."
