      This study is a prospective, single arm, multi-center, in-clinic study with one treatment
      group assignment.  There will be two consecutive phases of the study:

      A total of up to 150 subjects will be enrolled at up to 11 investigational centers

      Subjects will come for clinic visit for YSI testing

      Study has three periods and 9 visits

             year.

          3. Subject is willing to perform greater than or equal to 4 finger stick blood glucose
             measurements daily

          4. Subject is willing to perform required sensor calibrations

             placement (e.g., psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          3. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device)
             wherein they have received treatment from an investigational study (drug or device)
             in the last 2 weeks

          4. Females of child-bearing potential who have a positive pregnancy test at screening or
             plans to become pregnant during the course of the study
