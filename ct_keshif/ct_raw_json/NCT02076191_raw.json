An initial dose of ruxolitinib of 10 mg orally twice daily is anticipated with planned, dose escalations of 15 mg orally twice daily, 25 mg orally twice daily and 50 mg orally twice daily. The dose can also be de-escalated to 5mg orally twice daily if dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) are observed at the initial 10mg dose. Patients will receive ruxolitinib as a single agent for the first 7 days followed by the administration of decitabine on day 8 for a total of 5 consecutive days. Patients will continue ruxolitinib at the assigned dose through the first cycle and may reduce the dose for specified toxicity beginning with the second cycle. Patients in Phase II will start at the recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of ruxolitinib in combination with decitabine at a dose of 20 mg/m2 daily intravenously over 5 days."

Ruxolitinib is a drug that is approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA)\n      for the treatment of patients with advanced forms of myelofibrosis. It inhibits the Jak\n      proteins that are often abnormal in MPN. A recent clinical study showed that ruxolitinib\n      treatment could put some patients with this disease into remission. Decitabine is a\n      chemotherapy, approved by the Federal Drug Administration (FDA), that has been used to treat\n      acute leukemia. It works in some patients, but most patients with accelerated and blastic\n      MPN do not respond to treatment. Ruxolitinib and decitabine will be combined in this study\n      to find out what dose of the two medicines are safe together. Using Ruxolitinib in\n      combination with Decitabine is experimental. The investigators want to find out what\n      effects, good and/or bad it has on the patient and the disease."

            "textblock": "At this time, there is no standard medical treatment for MF-BP or MF-AP. The investigators\n      believe that the combination of ruxolitinib and DEC is a candidate approach to the treatment\n      of MF-BP/MF-AP that is worthy of exploration based on both the current understanding of the\n      biology of disease and emerging preclinical data. The molecular pathogenesis of MPN and\n      progression to blast phase is almost certainly due to a complex combination of gene\n      mutations (JAK2V617F, MPL) and epigenetic alterations (IDH1/2, IKZF1, EZH2, TET2) that\n      culminate in the emergence of leukemic clones. Recent evidence indicates that the JAK2V617F\n      protein can localize in the nucleus and influence global DNA methylation patterns which may\n      lead to genomic instability and disease progression. The inhibition of JAK-STAT mediated\n      cell proliferation and survival in conjunction with the reversal of DNA hypermethylation of\n      tumor suppressor genes would be predicted to have at least an additive if not synergistic\n      effect in inducing apoptosis of cells belonging to the malignant myeloid clone. Correlative\n      studies conducted within a trial of Private and Confidential MPD-RC 109 Ruxolitinib +\n      Decitabine combination JAK2 inhibitor and DMNT1 inhibitor in patients with MPN-BP would\n      explore the effect on methylation status of various gene promoters as well as the influence\n      on gene expression of chromatin related proteins and ultimately leukemic cell survival. The\n      sequential administration of a JAK2 inhibitor followed by a DNMT inhibitor would also\n      potentially serve to overcome the JAK2-independent effects of epigenetic lesions that lead\n      to MPN-BP. In addition, a murine model of leukemic transformation has been described. In\n      this model, bone marrow obtained from Tp53 null mice is retrovirally transduced with\n      Jak2V617F, and transplanted into donor C56BL/6 mice. The transplanted mice develop an MPN\n      which progresses to AML. In vitro drug studies utilizing bone marrow from these leukemic\n      mice have demonstrated that exposure to decitabine or ruxolitinib inhibits colony formation\n      in a methylcellulose colony-forming assay. Importantly, the combination of decitabine and\n      ruxolitinib in this assay significantly reduces colony formation when compared to either\n      drug alone (Rampal et al. ASH 2012 oral abstract 808) thus providing pre-clinical evidence\n      for the combination study proposed here."
