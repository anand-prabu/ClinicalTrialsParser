  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a within-subject randomized cross-over design to evaluate the effects of
      DBS on sleep architecture, as measured by polysomnography, and on wake-time vigilance, as
      measured by a virtual reality street-crossing simulator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the proposed study, we will use a within-subject randomized clinical trial to measure
      objective changes in sleep architecture with DBS &quot;on&quot; and to compare effects of different
      DBS stimulation parameters on sleep architecture as measured by sleep studies.  The study
      design will allow us to address our hypothesis that low frequency deep brain stimulation
      parameters are more effective than the conventional settings at improving sleep architecture
      and wake-time vigilance. If our hypothesis is correct, low frequency settings could be used
      during sleep and this would prolong stimulator battery life, therefore decreasing the
      frequency of required surgical battery changes for DBS.  These data will be valuable in
      considering clinical treatment strategies and provide insight into the basic mechanisms of
      sleep dysfunction in PD.  The study may also contribute to understanding how to achieve
      maximum clinical benefit from DBS while minimizing morbidity and cost.

    <description>This virtual pedestrian environment is a measure of &quot;real-world&quot; street-crossing behavior. This simulation is composed of an elevated platform that simulates a curb at a street-side and 3 monitors (arranged in a semi-circle) on which the subject, while wearing headtracker equipment, views the virtual environment of bidirectional traffic. When the subject deems it is safe to cross the virtual street, he/she steps off the platform/curb, which activates crossing of the street by a cartoon representation of the participant. The speed of street crossing by the cartoon is determined by each individual subject's walking speed, which is measured prior to the test.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who have undergone unilateral subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS surgery for
             treatment of PD.

          2. Stable DBS stimulator settings and medication regimen for at least 6 weeks prior to
             the sleep studies.

          3. Sleep dysfunction as measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (score &gt;5)

          4. 19 years of age or older

          5. Ability to walk up and down stairs

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known narcolepsy

          2. Other previous surgical treatment of Parkinson's disease(with the exception of
             unilateral STN DBS) including pallidotomy, thalamotomy, or gene therapy procedures.

          3. Pregnant women will be excluded from this study.

          4. Untreated obstructive sleep apnea. If obstructive sleep apnea is discovered during
             the first sleep study, the subject will be removed from the study.  After they have
             been treated for at least 6 weeks with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP),
             they can re-start the study.

          5. Inability to walk without assistance, including a cane, wheelchair, or walker

          6. Cognitive dysfunction that would prevent subject's ability to participate in the
             study.

          7. Blindness
