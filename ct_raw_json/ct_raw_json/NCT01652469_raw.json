Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature, by testing for interaction\n           between treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B: docetaxel) and VeriStrat status (VSG\n           vs VSP) using as outcome progression free survival.\n\n        2. Explore whether treatment with erlotinib provides progression free survival benefit as\n           compared to docetaxel in the VSG group.\n\n        3. Compare progression free survival in the two treatment arms (Arm A: erlotinib vs Arm B:\n           docetaxel) in the VSP group.\n\n        4. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall\n           difference in progression free survival between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no\n           significant interaction).\n\n        5. Explore the predictive ability of the VeriStrat signature using the secondary measures\n           of clinical efficacy including overall survival, objective response rate, and disease\n           control rate.\n\n        6. Compare overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate between\n           treatment groups separately in the VSG and VSP groups.\n\n        7. Explore the prognostic ability of the VeriStrat signature by testing for an overall\n           difference in overall survival, objective response rate and disease control rate\n           between the two VeriStrat groups (in case of no significant interaction).\n\n        8. Assess the safety and the tolerability of the two treatments separately in each\n           VeriStrat group and overall.\n\n      Recruitment period: 18 months Sample Size: 500"
