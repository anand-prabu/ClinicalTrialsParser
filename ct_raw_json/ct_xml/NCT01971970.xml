  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anti-TNF treatment (infliximab (IFX), adalimumab (ADA)) has become standard therapy for
      refractory pediatric and adult Crohn's disease (CD) patients, and is used for the induction
      (primary response) and maintenance of remission. When effective, clinical and endoscopic
      remission is reached within weeks. However, primary non-response is observed in 20% of
      pediatric patients, and in 40% of adult CD patients, suggesting a more robust acute response
      to anti-TNF therapy in children as compared to adults.During maintenance treatment, 60 - 80%
      of patients have secondary loss of response, necessitating dose adjustments to maintain
      clinical response. Anti-TNF treatment is also increasingly used in ulcerative colitis (UC),
      and has been shown to induce remission in active disease. For UC, the comparison between the
      efficacy in children versus adults is more difficult to report as studies in children are
      scarce. Anti-TNF treatment is associated with rare but potentially fatal side effects,
      infusion reactions, and is an expensive treatment. To avoid overtreatment it is necessary to
      early identify non-responders to treatment, and therefore it is important to develop
      predictive biomarkers of treatment response.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anti-TNF naïve CD patients (≥ 6 years) who initiate anti-TNF treatment (IFX or ADA)
             because of active luminal disease, failing treatment with immunomodulators
             (azathioprine, 6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) and corticosteroids.

          -  Anti-TNF naïve UC patients (≥ 6 years) who initiate anti-TNF treatment (IFX or ADA)
             because of active disease despite corticosteroid treatment or because of failing of
             immunomodulator treatment.

          -  Anti-TNF naïve CD or UC patients (≥ 6 years) who initiate anti-TNF treatment (IFX or
             ADA) because of intolerance to treatment with immunomodulators (azathioprine,
             6-mercaptopurine, methotrexate) or corticosteroids.

          -  Informed consent by patients and parents (when required).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  IBD patients who initiate IFX or ADA immediately after diagnosis.

          -  Presence of severe perianal disease as primary indication to start anti-TNF
             treatment.

          -  Age &lt; 6 years when anti-TNF maintenance treatment is initiated.
