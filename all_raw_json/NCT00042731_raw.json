Patients are stratified according to\n      disease stage (stage I vs stage II) and presence of high-grade prostatic intraepithelial\n      neoplasia. Patients are randomized to 1 of 7 treatment groups.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 87 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
