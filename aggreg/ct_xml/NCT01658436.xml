    <description>The investigational study drug to be used in this trial is BEZ235, which is supplied as 300mg, 200mg and 50mg sachets. Supply as 200mg and 50mg are provided for dose reduction. Patients should be instructed to take the contents of one sachets of BEZ235 twice a day in the morning within 30 minutes after a light meal (breakfast).On stage 1-open label-30 patients will receive BEZ235 . On stage 2-double-blind setting with 99 patients additional patients-only patients randomized under BEZ arm will be treated with study medication.</description>
