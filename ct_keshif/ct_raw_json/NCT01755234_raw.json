            "textblock": "80% of 25 million American who undergo surgery describe moderate to severe pain. The use of\n      multimodal analgesic techniques can attenuate patient's postoperative pain and several\n      different medication have been found to be effective. Pain can significantly affect\n      patient's quality of recovery after surgery. Volatile anesthetics can increase sensitivity\n      to pain at the low concentrations present on emergence from anesthesia. Propofol may have\n      analgesic effect at sedative doses. The effects of propofol,when used for  anesthesia\n      maintenance, on postoperative pain have demonstrated controversial results with some\n      investigators showing a potential benefit  whereas others have not shown any benefit.\n      Propofol for maintenance of anesthesia has been advocated as an strategy for high risk\n      patients even though it has shown controversial results on reduction of Post operative\n      nausea and vomiting. A comparison of propofol vs.volatile anesthetic in regards to the time\n      required by patients to meet discharge criteria has also shown conflicting results.The QOR\n      40 is a validated instrument that has been specifically developed to evaluate patients\n      recovery after anesthesia and surgery.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of maintenance of anesthesia with two\n      agents (Propofol and Sevoflurane) on quality of recovery after ambulatory surgery\n\n      Significance: the results of this study can lead to the discovery of an anesthesia technique\n      that is associated with a better recovery for patients after ambulatory surgery.\n\n      Research question is: do patients anesthetized with propofol have a better quality of\n      recovery after ambulatory anesthesia than patients anesthetized with Sevoflurane? The\n      hypothesis: patients anesthetized with propofol will have better quality of recovery than\n      patients anesthetized with Sevoflurane after ambulatory surgery."
