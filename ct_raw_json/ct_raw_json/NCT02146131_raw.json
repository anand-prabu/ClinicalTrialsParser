These two procedures are similar in that they both: (1) enable your doctor to look\n      inside your lungs with a device called a bronchoscope, and (2) Use fluoroscopy, which is a\n      technique that uses X-rays to see your lungs.\n\n      This will give the doctor an opportunity to use either of the bronchoscopy methods described\n      above and compare the tests to see if R-EBUS provides better results than standard\n      bronchoscopy."
