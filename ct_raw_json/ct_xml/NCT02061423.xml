      This trial will determine the safety and immune activity of HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine in
      patients with high risk HER-2pos breast cancer with residual disease post neoadjuvant
      therapy. Subjects will have estrogen independent stage I III breast cancer with residual
      disease in the breast or axillary nodes post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Mammogram, laboratory
      studies, CT, and leukapheresis will be performed, in addition to vaccine administration.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dendritic cell cancer vaccines combined with chemotherapy may increase complete responses
      giving breast cancer specific immune cells greater opportunity to function while the immune
      repertoire is being shifted by chemotherapy to anti-breast cancer response and offer the
      chance to test secondary prevention of breast cancer in high risk settings. 2. Subjects with
      estrogen independent (as determined by lack of estrogen receptor expression on primary or
      residual tumor) stage I III breast cancer with residual disease in the breast or axillary
      nodes post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy will be undergo mammograms, laboratory studies, and
      leukapheresis. Vaccines will be manufactured using subjects leukapheresis product, which
      will be administered in the Clinical Research Center 1 Dulles Building weekly for 6 weeks.
      Three to six booster vaccines will be administered following the initial induction vaccines,
      should the subject demonstrate no HER-3 or HER-1 response post induction vaccines. Immune
      analysis will be done after subject receives all induction vaccines and again after they
      receive all booster vaccines.
