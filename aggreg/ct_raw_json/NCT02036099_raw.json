            "textblock": "Based on the literature on dementia and driving, and on knowledge tools available to date\n      including one from our current work, a Driving in Mild Dementia Decision Tool (DMD-DT) will\n      be adapted and tailored to guide physicians in their decisions to report a driver with mild\n      dementia to the provincial licensing agency. The DMD-DT intervention will include a) an\n      algorithm-based computerized clinical decision support system (CCDSS) for facilitating\n      driving assessment and physicians' reporting to provincial transportation authorities, b) an\n      individualized educational package for patients and caregivers about dementia and driving\n      and driving cessation, and c) a modified reporting form to provincial driving regulatory\n      authorities. Months 1 to 6: The DMD-DT will be tailored and adapted to practice with the\n      input of the co-investigators and knowledge-users who represent the perspectives of\n      physicians, patients and their caregivers, as well as transportation authorities. Pilot\n      testing will be done, and input from focus groups of knowledge-users will refine the\n      intervention. Physicians will be recruited to participate in a clinical trial of the DMD-DT.\n      Months 7-18: A parallel-group cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted to\n      compare the effects of the DMD-DT to a legislation reminder on recommendations for reporting\n      to the licensing agency. The effects of the DMD-DT on the doctor-patient relationship will\n      be further explored in focus groups and interviews with physicians. Months 19-24: The\n      knowledge obtained from the study will be used to generalize and sustain use of the\n      intervention beyond Ontario, Canada, and to disseminate the information to knowledge-users.\n      The primary outcome measure is the filing of a report to the Ministry of Transportation of\n      Ontario, indicating that the physician has a concern about the patient's health condition\n      (i.e. mild dementia). The primary outcome of the study is the difference in reporting\n      between the DMD-DT and control arms. Since the current reporting rate is low, approximately\n      13%, from a public health point of view, the primary outcome expected is that physicians in\n      the DMD-DT group will report more patients with mild dementia than those in the control\n      group."
