Chemoprotective drugs such as amifostine may protect normal\n      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel, cisplatin, and\n      amifostine in treating patients who have advanced non-small cell lung cancer that cannot be\n      surgically removed."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose of docetaxel when combined with\n      amifostine and high dose cisplatin in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. II.\n      Determine the response rate and survival of these patients treated with this regimen. III.\n      Determine the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study of docetaxel. Patients receive\n      amifostine IV over 15 minutes, immediately followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour, followed at\n      hour 2 by amifostine as above, immediately followed by high dose cisplatin IV over 30\n      minutes. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the\n      maximum tolerated dose is determined.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
