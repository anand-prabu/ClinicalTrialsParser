      Prospective study, controlled, randomized, single-center, blinded, which aims to evaluate
      the effect of laser acupuncture in the treatment of perioperative pain during tracheal
      suction after patent ductus arteriosus ligation in preterm infants.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      management of pain in preterm infants is essential because it is exposed to repetitive
      movements painful and invasive miners such as surgical treatment of the ductus arteriosus
      which is accompanied by respiratory instability, increased consumption analgesics.
      Acupuncture has shown its analgesic efficacy in numerous studies in children and adults.
      Acupuncture (laser) is a simple, fast method without side effect used in children, but no
      study exists on the effect of acupuncture in the treatment of perioperative pain in addition
      to pharmacologic agents in preterm infants. Hypothesis: acupuncture reduce pain and
      discomfort after surgery of the ductus arteriosus in preterm infants in addition to
      pharmacologic agents

      Main objective:

      Assessing the contribution of laser acupuncture on the pain management during endotracheal
      suctioning (ETS) after surgery ductus arteriosus in preterm infants
