  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hyponatremia is a condition in which there is a low sodium level in the blood. Individuals
      with cirrhosis may develop low blood sodium as a complication of their liver disease.  In
      these patients, the presence of low blood sodium may exacerbate other complications such as
      encephalopathy, resulting in confusion, drowsiness, or coma. It may also affect the ability
      of the body to fight infection.  In certain cases, cirrhotic patients may be hospitalized
      for the treatment of their low blood sodium.

      The drug tolvaptan is currently FDA approved for the treatment of hyponatremia in patients
      with cirrhosis. Although it has been shown to increase the sodium level, the clinical trials
      that led to its approval did not otherwise assess clinical benefit of the drug.

      This study is designed to determine whether patients with cirrhosis derive a clinical
      benefit when they receive tolvaptan for the treatment of hyponatremia within 2 days of
      admission. Specifically, whether it is associated with shortened length of stay and
      improvement in other complications of cirrhosis.
