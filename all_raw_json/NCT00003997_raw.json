Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicities of this treatment in these\n      patients.\n\n      III. Determine the duration and reversibility of the qualitative and quantitative toxicities\n      of this treatment in these patients.\n\n      IV. Evaluate, in a preliminary manner, the antileukemic activity of this treatment in these\n      patients.\n\n      V. Assess relative mRNA levels of selected NER genes (ERCC1, ERCC2, and ERCC3) in tumor\n      tissues of patients treated with this regimen and correlate with clinical outcome.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive 6-hydroxymethylacylfulvene (HMAF) IV over 5 minutes on days 1-5. Treatment\n      repeats every 3-4 weeks for at least 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of HMAF. The maximum\n      tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which dose limiting toxicity occurs in at least 40%\n      of patients.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter."
