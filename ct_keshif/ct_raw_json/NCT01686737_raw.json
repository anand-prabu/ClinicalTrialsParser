More than\n      three-quarters of women with breast cancer suffer from fatigue during cancer treatment.\n      While exercise interventions can improve fatigue in breast cancer patients, many patients\n      request complementary treatment approaches. Therefore, this study investigates the effects\n      of yoga in women with breast cancer compared to aerobic exercise and usual care.\n\n      It is hypothesized that yoga is more effective than usual care and equally effective as\n      aerobic exercise."
