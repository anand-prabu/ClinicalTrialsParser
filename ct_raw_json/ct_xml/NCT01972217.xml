    <textblock>
      This is a 2-part study in patients with metastatic CRPC. Part A is an open-label safety
      run-in study to assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics (PK) of olaparib when
      given in addition to abiraterone 1000 mg once daily. Part B is a randomised, double-blind,
      placebo controlled comparison of the efficacy, safety and tolerability of the dose of
      olaparib selected from Part A when given in addition to abiraterone, versus placebo given in
      addition to abiraterone. Abiraterone is indicated in combination with prednisone or
      prednisolone for the treatment of patients with metastatic CRPC.  Prednisone or prednisolone
      5 mg twice daily (bid) will be administered with the abiraterone in this study.

    <description>The parameters describing the safety and tolerability of olaparib will include: - The percentage of patients with DLTs; -The percentage of patients with adverse events by National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) (version 4.03) grade; - The percentage of patients with serious adverse events; - The percentage of patients who discontinue olaparib due to adverse events or serious adverse events. Adverse events will be assessed by graded Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0. Clinical chemistry and haematology laboratory tests, and vital signs will also be measured. The number of adverse events that constitute dose limiting toxicities will be derived and used to select a dose to evaluate further in Part B of the study.</description>

             recovered from any effects of any major surgery.

          -  Judgment by the Investigator that the patient should not participate in the study if
             the patient is unlikely to comply with study procedures, restrictions and
             requirements.

        Exclusion from the genetic research may be for any of the exclusion criteria specified in
        the main study or any of the following:

          -  Previous allogeneic bone marrow transplant.
