            "textblock": "1. Study rationale 1-1.\n\n             -  Predicting the treatment response of antipsychotic drug in schizophrenia patients\n                has been an issue in psychiatry. However, it is not clear if the findings of\n                structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) such as brain gray matter volumes and\n                white matter connectivities, are related to the treatment response of\n                antipsychotic drugs.\n\n             -  The cognitive and behavioural symptoms of patients with schizophrenia are\n                hypothesized to involve a disruption of neuronal interactions resulting in\n                dysfunctional cognitive integration (Friston et al., 1995, 1996). This hypothesis\n                is supported by reports about a decrease in white matter anatomic connections\n                (Mitelman et al. 2006; Skudlarski et al. 2010; Zalesky et al. 2011) and brain\n                structure alterations, especially decrease in volumes of specific brain regions\n                for patients with schizophrenia. Several studies of brain connectivity have shown\n                that functional connectivity depends strongly on the underlying anatomic structure\n                (Sporns O et al. 2004). At the anatomic level, the pathology of schizophrenia has\n                been related to a wide range of anatomic abnormalities, including ventricular\n                enlargement, associated with anomalous neurodevelopment or neurodegenerative\n                alterations (Shenton ME et al 2001). And schizophrenia is likely to be the result\n                of both general and specific localized changes in both grey and white matter\n                (Knochel C et al. 2012; Konrad A et al. 2008). Savas HA et al. found that\n                responders to risperidone had greater hippocampal volumes than patients who failed\n                to respond to risperidone (Savas HA et al., 2002). Vicente M et al. found an\n                inverse association between striatal size and the degree of clinical improvement,\n                and a direct association between the degree of insular volume deficit and its\n                improvement. The non-responders to risperidone or olanzapine showed a significant\n                decrease in their left rectal gyrus as compared with the responder group. (Vicente\n                M et al., 2010).\n\n             -  Nielsen et al reported that after 6 weeks of amisulpride treatment, patients with\n                schizophrenia showed an increase in the anticipation-related functional MRI signal\n                (Nielsen et al., 2012). This suggested that amisulpride could affect the brain\n                structures and that responses to amisulpride could be associated by the brain\n                structures as seen previous studies about treatment response to antipsychotics and\n                brain structures. But to date, no study has examined the impact of brain structure\n                alterations on amisulpride treatment for schizophrenia and its potential clinical\n                significance..\n\n        2.
