The prevalence of environmental contamination and infections is higher than expected.\n- Endogenous factors. These factors (hyperinflation, pulmonary embolism, cardiac dysfunction, mucus hypersecretion) are present in a proportion higher than expected\n- During exacerbations of COPD serum markers of inflammation and autoimmunity are high relative to baseline in COPD and decrease progressively during the follow-up, after controlling the acute episode"
