The brand names that the Concept Foundation has registered internationally\n      include Cyclofem\u00ae, and Novafem\u00ae (Pharmacia Pharmaceuticals, Peapack NJ, formerly (Pharmacia\n      and Upjohn of Kalamazoo, Michigan). The company launched its product under license from\n      Concept Foundation with their own brand name, Lunelle\u2122 in the US market. Lunelle\u2122 was\n      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in October, 2000 following which\n      approximately 350,000 women had used the product. However, following the acquisition of\n      Pharmacia and Upjohn by Pfizer and due to several production problems, Pfizer withdrew\n      Lunelle\u2122 from the US market. Concept Foundation has licensed Sun Pharmaceutical Industries\n      Ltd, Mumbai, India to manufacture and market Cyclofem\u00ae in India and other developing\n      countries. US FDA approval of Cyclofem\u00ae is pivotal to the ultimate acceptance of such\n      products in many countries because of the rigorous standards applied by the FDA for drug\n      safety and efficacy. This initial PK study is the first step on the road to FDA approval\n      with the ultimate goal to expand the access and range of methods available to women in the\n      public sector. Approval of Cyclofem\u00ae by the US FDA would also allow the reintroduction of\n      CICs to the US market."
