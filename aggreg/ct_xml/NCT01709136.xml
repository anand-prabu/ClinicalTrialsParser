  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Liver transplant patients treated with tacrolimus, who are clinically stable for at least 3
      months, who are on antihypertensive drug treatment, and/or have renal dysfunction due to
      tacrolimus use, will be eligible for conversion to sirolimus and withdrawl of Tacrolimus.
      The study will include 60 subjects, both male and female, age 5-30. This study will evaluate
      allograft function by serial clinical lab testing, the pharmacokinetics of sirolimus and
      tacrolimus, the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as measured clearance of iothalamate, and
      the potential side effect of sirolimus, such as marrow suppression and hyperlipidemia. Two
      pharmacokinetic evlauations are planned: once around the third post-transplant month and
      another one at about 12 months. Expected outcomes are, a better understanding of sirolimus
      pharmacokinetic parameters over time in pediatric/adult liver recipients and early efficacy
      and safety data of the sirolimus as a non-nephrotoxic alternative to tacrolimus.

    <description>Single dose SRL pharmacokinetics and TAC steady state pharmacokinetics: This phase is applicable to both sets of patients: those with nephrotoxicity and those with hypertension. Patients will receive a single dose of SRL of 2 mg/m2. Blood sampling will be performed over a 24 hour stay in the PCTRC , and the sampling for 48 hour and 72 hour PK studies can be done at the outpatient lab. This phase can either be performed immediately after the 12-hour iothalamate GFR evaluation, or a few days later at the convenience of the subject.</description>
