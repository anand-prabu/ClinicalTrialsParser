Nasopharyngeal\n      carcinoma is both radiosensitive and chemosensitive. The National Comprehensive Cancer\n      Network (NCCN) guidelines (version 1, 2013), have recommended use of concurrent\n      chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) with or without adjuvant chemotherapy (AC) and induction\n      chemotherapy (IC) followed by CCRT plus AC as standard treatment for NPC. However, it was\n      unclear whether patients with NPC could benefit from IC. Recently, many new drugs including\n      docetaxel and gemcitabine have been incorporated in the induction chemotherapy phase of NPC.\n      The investigators designed the present study with induction chemotherapy follow by CCRT for\n      locoregionally advanced NPC, comparing induction chemotherapy regime of gemcitabine plus\n      cisplatin (GP) and docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (TPF)."
