  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to undertake a randomized placebo controlled trial of cognitive
      remediation therapy (CRT) that focuses on working memory training in a sample of community
      based patients with chronic schizophrenia or other psychoses.

      Cognitive deficits are a problem for many people with schizophrenia. This study will use
      computerized cognitive remediation training (which the participant can carry out at home)
      over a period of a few months.

      The aim of this project is to undertake a randomized placebo controlled trial of cognitive
      remediation therapy (CRT) that focuses on working memory training in a sample of community
      based patients with schizophrenia. Pre and Post neuropsychological assessment and Magnetic
      Resonance Imagery (MRI) will be used to determine the effects of CR training on

        1. Neuropsychological performance

        2. Brain Structure using voxel-based morphometry (VBM)

        3. Brain function using functional MRI (fMRI)

        4. Social and occupational functioning

      The cognitive remediation intervention is a computerised programme whose training level is
      dynamically varied to suit participants individual ability level. Motivation to learn and
      generalization to real world function are a particular focus of the intervention and are
      supported with ongoing therapist interaction in addition to personal training.
