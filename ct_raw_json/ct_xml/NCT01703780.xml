  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is still one of the major preventable risk factor for cardiovascular as well as
      cerebrovascular diseases globally, including ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, and
      renal impairment. Despite knowledge on hypertension and the availability of effective
      antihypertensive medications have progressed dramatically in recent years, the rate of
      uncontrolled hypertension ( reached 90%) remains high in China(1). Among those with
      uncontrolled hypertension，it has been reported that 8.9% in all individuals with
      hypertension, and 12.8% in the hypertensive drug-treated population[2] are attributed to
      resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension has been defined by AHA as high blood
      pressure (BP) in spite of appropriate lifestyle interventions and treatment of three or more
      different types of antihypertensive drugs at optimal dose, including at least one
      diuretics[3,4] or achieving adequate BP control with optimal doses of 4 or more
      antihypertensive drugs.

      At present, not many specifically designed prospective researches concerning resistant
      hypertension are available. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is not well established
      and most knowledge about resistant hypertension derives from cross-sectional analyses and
      clinical trials. The patients with resistant hypertension have been expected to have server
      target damage, and worse prognosis than those who are non-resistant, but not well
      established either in the literature[2].

      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and the prognosis of resistant
      hypertension ascertained with systemic investigation and optimal treatment with
      antihypertensive drugs in community populations and clinic as well as the prognosis among
      patients with resistant hypertension compared with those who are non-resistant.

      Hypertension is still one of the major preventable risk factor for cardiovascular as well as
      cerebrovascular diseases globally, including ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, and
      renal impairment. Despite knowledge on hypertension and the availability of effective
      antihypertensive medications have progressed dramatically in recent years, the rate of
      uncontrolled hypertension ( reached 90%) remains high in China(1). Among those with
      uncontrolled hypertension，it has been reported that 8.9% in all individuals with
      hypertension, and 12.8% in the hypertensive drug-treated population[2] are attributed to
      resistant hypertension. Resistant hypertension has been defined by AHA as high blood
      pressure (BP) in spite of appropriate lifestyle interventions and treatment of three or more
      different types of antihypertensive drugs at optimal dose, including at least one
      diuretics[3,4] or achieving adequate BP control with optimal doses of 4 or more
      antihypertensive drugs. Due to an increasing in incidence of comorbidities related to
      resistant hypertension such as diabetes, obesity and renal impairment, the prevalence of
      resistant-to-treatment hypertension is much more likely to increase in older population.The
      burden of resistant hypertension is going to be bigger and bigger.

      At present, not many specifically designed prospective researches concerning resistant
      hypertension are available. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is not well established
      and most knowledge about resistant hypertension derives from cross-sectional analyses and
      clinical trials. The patients with resistant hypertension have been expected to have server
      target damage, and worse prognosis than those who are non-resistant, but not well
      established either in the literature[2].

      The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence and the prognosis of resistant
      hypertension ascertained with systemic investigation and optimal treatment with
      antihypertensive drugs in community populations and the prognosis among patients with
      resistant hypertension compared with those who are non-resistant.

      Subjects：Total 10000 patients with hypertension are going to be recruited， 50% from 5
      communities screening, 50% from consecutive clinic hypertensive patients. The Expected rate
      of resistant hypertension is 10% in hypertensive population.

      Objectives:

        1. True prevalence of resistant hypertension In order to obtain the true burden of
           resistant hypertension, a uniform definition of resistant hypertension were applied,
           AHA definition(4), &quot;high blood pressure (BP) remained in spite of appropriate lifestyle
           interventions and treatment of three or more different types of antihypertensive drugs
           at optimal dose, including at least one diuretics or achieving adequate BP control with
           optimal doses of 4 or more antihypertensive drugs.

             1. To exclude pseudoresistant hypertension

             2. To avoid inaccurate measurement of blood pressure

             3. To make sure that both the patients and the physicians are adherent to therapeutic
                plans and to lifestyle interventions.The physicians comply with guidelines and
                actively pursue adequate blood pressure for their patients. Ninety per cent of the
                patients take recommended optimal daily doses of their antihypertensive
                medications at follow-up for 6 months as well as more than 85% for 2 years(less
                than 50% at present) Incidence of resistant hypertension TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS
                This is a practical clinical trial,no specific antihypertensive drugs are going to
                be tested in the trial.The antihypertensive drugs are selected according to
                guidelines.

                Treatment duration: six months of intensive treatment(optimal dose and type of
                drugs),blood pressure does not reach goal.

                The treatment of secondary causes of hypertension are referred to pertinent
                specialists.

                Appropriate lifestyle interventions are always encouraged:

                Nonpharmacological therapy:

                Reversal of lifestyle factors contributing to treatment resistance,

                  -  DASH diet is encouraged to follow, lower salt diet (ideal goal&lt; 100 mEq of
                     sodium/24 h,evaluated with 24h urine collection), low fat and high fibre
                     diet,

                  -  weight loss if obese or overweight,

                  -  moderation of alcohol intake to no more than two drinks per day for  men and
                     one drink for women or lighter-weight persons,

                  -  smoking cessation,

                  -  regular physical activity.

                Optimal pharmacological therapy

                Drug treatment of resistant hypertension:

                  -  Diuretics: Usually taking thiazide, among patients with an estimated
                     glomerular filtration &lt; 40 mL/min per m2(body surface area), thiazide
                     diuretics become less effective and loop diuretics should be used instead,
                     such as furosemide, which needs at least twice daily dosing due to its short
                     half-life.

                  -  Aldosterone antagonists, add-on therapy to use in resistant hypertension:
                     spironolactone 25 mg once a day.

                  -  In order to get better adherence to antihypertensive drug therapy, and better
                     antihypertensive effects and less side effects, combination medicine is
                     encouraged to use and the use of which class combinations follows guidelines
                     and ASH recommendation(2011),but this is the choice of patients and
                     physicians.

                  -  Renal denervation with catheter-based radiofrequency ablation is not
                     performed in this trial.

             4. To rule out white-coat effect：It has been reported that 20%-30% of patients with
                apparent resistant hypertension referred for ambulatory BP monitoring in fact have
                normal BP readings[5].When patients have higher BP levels than 140 over 90 mmHg
                when measured by the physician than when assessed at home or with AMBP( ambulatory
                monitoring blood pressure) which is called white-coat hypertension. The patients
                with white-coat hypertension have less severe target organ damage and
                cardiovascular risk than those with persistent elevated blood pressure in
                ambulatory monitoring.

             5. Reversing of contributing lifestyle factors for high blood pressure.

                  -  Obesity

                  -  High dietary salt intake (controlled at 6 grams daily as possible as we can).

                  -  The recognition and avoid of other common contributing factors such as
                     non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug use, oral contraceptive hormones

                  -  The recognition and treatment of progressive renal impairment.

             6. To rule out carefully the potential reversible causes of hypertension by medical
                history, physical examination, biochemical evaluation, and/ or non-invasive
                imaging. If diagnosed， pertinent therapy is given to the secondary hypertension:

                  -  Sleep apnoea

                  -  Primary aldosteronism , reported prevalence of approximately 20% in resistant
                     hypertension[6]

                  -  Renal parenchymal disease and renal artery stenosis

                  -  Aortic coarctation

                  -  Cushing syndrome

                  -  pheochromocytoma

             7. Biochemical evaluation, including serum sodium, potassium, glucose, and creatinine
                (creatinine clearance); plasma aldosterone and renin activity.

             8. 24-h urine collection to estimate dietary sodium, potassium, and aldosterone
                excretion. Testing for urinary or plasma metanephrines/catecholamines is indicated
                only when pheochromocytoma is suspected

             9. Non-invasive imaging is mandatory when there is a suspicion of renal artery
                stenosis, adrenal adenoma/tumour, parenchymal renal disease or aortic coarctation

        2. Target damage:

             1. left ventricular hypertrophy: ECG and echocardiography

             2. periphery artery disease: ABI,carotid

             3. kidney function: urinary microalbumin,cystatin C,creatinine eGFR

             4. coronary heart disease

             5. Stroke

        3. Prognosis: hard endpoint: acute coronary syndrome(including unstable angina,fatal and
           non-fatal myocardial infarction), stroke, all cause death,cardiovascular death
