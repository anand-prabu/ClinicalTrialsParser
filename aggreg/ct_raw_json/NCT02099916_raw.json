All patients will be  counseled regarding\n      their prognosis and other  treatment options including oocyte donation as well as adoption\n      were also presented and discussed in detail. All patients will be  aware that the use of\n      DHEA is experimental   and informed consent was obtained for those agreeing to use the\n      medication. Women in the DHEA group will receive 25 mg of DHEA three times a day for at\n      least 12 weeks. During this period, women will be  subjected to monthly measurements of\n      early follicular phase FSH and estradiol. Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) will be  measured\n      prior to the initiation of treatment and at the end of the observation period. Patients will\n      be  stimulated with a short GnRH-antagonist protocol. Briefly, all women will have\n      measurements of serum FSH and estradiol and a pelvic sonogram on the second day of their\n      cycle.  Providing that serum FSH is < 17 mIU/ml and estradiol is < 70 pg/ml on day 2 ,\n      ovarian stimulation will be  initiated with 450 IU of gonadotropins either in the form of a\n      combination of highly purified  urinary FSH and LH or with a combination of Rec FSH and Rec\n      LH. All patients will be  re-evaluated on day 5 of the stimulation, and  dosage adjustments\n      will be made and the antagonists (Cetrorelix or ganirelix  0.25 mg/day) will be  initiated.\n      When at least 2 follicles reach an average diameter of 17 mm, final oocyte maturation will\n      be  triggered with 10,000IU of  hCG ( Pregnyl, Organon, Greece Inc.). Oocyte retrieval will\n      be  performed 34 to 36 hours later. All patients will undergo ICSI. Patients with successful\n      fertilization will have  embryo transfer under sonographic guidance on day 3 after\n      retrieval."
