Blood glucose will be measured on a YSI blood glucose\n      analyzer.  Subjects may adjust food intake and insulin administration so device performance\n      is evaluated across a broad range of glucose concentrations.  Glucose measurements will be\n      time matched and paired for comparison.  Skin effects and adverse events will be evaluated."
