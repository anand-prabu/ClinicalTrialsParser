This is a\n      randomized controlled trial at the village level, taking place in 6 districts in Eastern\n      Uganda. Licensed drug shops in selected villages were trained in proper RDT storage,\n      administration, interpretation and disposal and were given access to subsidized RDTs for\n      sale. This study explores whether drug shop owners--when given access to training and\n      subsidized RDTs--will choose to promote and sell RDTs to customers and, if so, at what\n      volume and what price. The investigators also explore whether shops will safely store,\n      administer, interpret and dispose of RDTs and to what extent they will use RDT results to\n      guide treatment recommendations. Finally, the study explores whether making RDTs available\n      for sale in local drug shops has a community level impact on diagnostic testing and\n      appropriate treatment for malaria."
