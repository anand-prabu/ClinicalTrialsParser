  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open, randomized study involving 72 patients with microvascular
      complications of T2DM (Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus) and obesity, who will undergo gastric
      bypass (Roux-en-Y gastric bypass ARM A) or receive best medical treatment (ARM B, control
      arm).

      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of Roux-en-Y gastric bypass in the control
      of diabetic nephropathy in diabetic patients with BMI between 30 and 35 kg/m2.

      The medical community is confronted with many different studies using various methodologies
      to investigate the best pharmacological treatment for T2DM. The treatment algorithm offers
      several different options according to the stage of the disease (which is different in each
      study). In addition, new drugs are being developed over the years, but are not always a
      guarantee of effective T2DM control [MENDES, 2010]. Furthermore, these drugs do not prevent
      the development of this disease, consequently increasing the risks of microvascular and
      macrovascular complications.

      Conversely, there is considerable evidence that surgery can be an adequate tool to promote
      T2DM remission in patients who are unresponsive to clinical treatment. Gastric bypass
      surgery is one of the most popular bariatric surgeries in the world, but its effects on
      microvascular and macrovascular complications of T2DM have not been established. Specialists
      suggest that the rapid and uncontrollable decrease in blood glucose adds to the concern that
      the surgery may paradoxically cause exacerbation of microvascular complications [LEOW,
      2005], whereas gradual improvement in blood glucose before gastric bypass surgery may
      prevent this paradoxical worsening, leading to an interruption of this process, or even
      retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy remission.

      However, there are no studies comparing the results of these two types of treatment
      (clinical vs. surgical) in a similar population and assessing the development of
      microvascular complications of T2DM. Therefore, in order to clarify such doubts, it is
      necessary and extremely desirable to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing gastric
      bypass with the best and most modern clinical treatment. Its findings could have a direct
      impact on hundreds of millions of diabetics by allowing the inclusion of surgical treatment
      as a safe and feasible therapeutic option for a significant portion of these patients.
