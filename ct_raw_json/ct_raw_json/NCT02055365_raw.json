            "textblock": "Vaccines have been responsible for preventing millions of deaths and extending the average\n      human lifespan. Effective vaccines stimulate the cells of the immune system to activate\n      genes and associated functions that bring about protective immunity. Knowledge of those\n      genes and cellular functions activated by effective vaccination can improve our\n      understanding of how the immune system works and define the features necessary for a\n      successful vaccine response. This study aims to define cellular functions important for the\n      hepatitis B (HBV) vaccine immune response in healthy individuals. The investigators will\n      identify those genes that are activated or suppressed in immune cells at various times after\n      each dose of the HBV vaccine. The investigators will explore these vaccine-induced \"gene\n      signatures\" to characterize the cellular functions associated with an effective immune\n      response to HBV vaccination. The investigators hypothesize that many genes associated with\n      innate and adaptive immune functions are important for an effective HBV vaccine response."
