The\n      morbidity of this approach is very low with good results and become the gold standard in\n      different pleural diseases. The medical drainage can be also very efficient but its results\n      depends of the evolution of the pleural effusion. The rate of failure is estimated around\n      25%.\n\n      Then, the aim of our study is to compare surgical drainage and medical drainage in first\n      intention. The first end-point will be the hospital stay (day). Hospital discharge will be\n      strict, following different objective criteria  of healing allowing comparison between these\n      two approaches of drainage.\n\n      To answer this question we will randomized 50 patients in 2 years with a multicenter\n      recruitment."
