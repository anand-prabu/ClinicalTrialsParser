Researchers want to see how well it works for\n      scans for people who have kidney cancer.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of 18F-VM4-037 during imaging studies of kidney\n      cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults at least 18 years of age with kidney cancer that will be treated with surgery.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected.\n\n        -  Participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans of their kidneys.\n           They will have the scans before and after receiving an injection of 18F-VM4-037. The\n           scans will take about 2 hours to complete.\n\n        -  About 3 weeks after the PET scans, participants will provide tumor tissue samples from\n           their kidneys.\n\n        -  This is a scanning study only. Treatment will not be provided as part of this study."

Wepropose to evaluate 18F-VM4-037 as a PET\n           radiopharmaceutical for the in vivo detection of CA-IX and CAXII in renal tumors.\n\n      STUDY OBJECTIVES\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\n\n        -  To evaluate the biodistribution of 18F-VM4-037 within tumor and non-tumor tissues.\n\n        -  To assess safety of 18F-VM4-037 in patients with primary or metastatic RCC.\n\n      ELIGIBILITY:\n\n        -  Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old, ECOG 0-2.\n\n        -  Subject must have confirmed primary RCC (greater than or equal to 2.5cm) in diameter on\n           conventional imaging modality or extrarenal/extrahepatic RCC lesion (greater than or\n           equal to 1cm).\n\n      DESIGN:\n\n      - Twenty subjects with primary RCC greater than or equal to 2.5cm in diameter or\n      extrarenal/extrahepatic lesion suspicious for metastatic RCC (greater than or equal to 1cm\n      in diameter) scheduled for clinically indicated surgery or biopsy will undergo dynamic\n      18F-VM4-037 PET/CT imaging.
