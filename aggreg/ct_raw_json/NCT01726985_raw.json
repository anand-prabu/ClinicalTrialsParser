There is currently, based on\n      national averages, a 30% readmission rate and 10% mortality rate within 3 months of being\n      hospitalized for heart failure. Retrospective studies have shown benefit to using biomarkers\n      such as BNP to guide inpatient heart failure management. Our own CCF retrospective study\n      showed that decreasing NT-ProBNP by 23%, making patients fluid negative by more than 1.3L,\n      and discharging patients with serum sodium above 135 reduces readmission rates\n      significantly. The purpose of this study is to prospectively use the above mentioned goals\n      in the treatment of heart failure in order to reduce heart failure readmission and mortality\n      rates."
