(Arm III\n           (MVAC) closed to accrual effective 07/23/2001.)\n\n        -  Compare the toxic effects of these regimens in this patient population.\n\n        -  Compare health-related quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to GOG\n      performance status. Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. (Arm III closed\n      to accrual effective 07/23/2001.)\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin IV once every 21 days.\n\n        -  Arm II:Patients receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and cisplatin IV\n           (beginning after topotecan infusion) on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days.\n\n        -  Arm III:Patients receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 15, and 22, vinblastine IV on days\n           2, 15, and 22, and doxorubicin IV and cisplatin IV on day 2. Courses repeat every 28\n           days. (Arm III closed to accrual effective 07/23/2001.) Treatment in all arms continues\n           for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity. (Arm III closed to accrual effective 07/23/2001.)\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before randomization, before course 2, before course 5 (arms I\n      and II), before course 4 (arm III), and at 9 months. (Arm III closed to accrual effective\n      07/23/2001.)\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients (133 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2 years.
