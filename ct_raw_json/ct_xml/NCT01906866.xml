  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this   study is to establish the efficacy and safety of Circadin in children
      with neurodevelopmental disorders and to determine the dose, this randomized,
      placebo-controlled study is planned to evaluate the efficacy of a double-blind, 13 week
      treatment period with Circadin 2/5mg in improving maintenance of sleep, sleep latency and
      additional parameters in children with neurodevelopmental disabilities.  The efficacy and
      safety of Circadin 2/5 mg will continue to be assessed during an open-label extension period
      of 13 weeks.

             neurodevelopmental disabilities caused by neurogenetic diseases (Smith-Magenis
             syndrome [SMS], Angelman syndrome, Bourneville's disease [tuberous sclerosis]) as
             confirmed by case note review showing that diagnosis was reached through assessment
             by a community paediatrician or paediatric neurologist, who took into account early
             developmental history and school records.

          4. Must have current sleep problems including: A minimum of 3 months of impaired sleep
             defined as &lt;6 hours of continuous sleep with more than 0.5 hour sleep latency from
             light off in 3 out of 5 nights.

          5. Must be on a stable dose of non-excluded medication for 3 months, including
             anti-epileptics, anti-depressants (SSRIs), stimulants, all mood changing drugs and
             beta blockers.

          6. The sleep disturbance is not due to the direct physiological effects of the
             medication (SSRIs, stimulants, etc.).

        will be eligible to continue the study if they comply with the following:

          1. Continue to fulfil sleep problem criteria (see Inclusion Criterion 4).

          2. Parents demonstrate compliance in Sleep and Nap Diary completion (5 out of 7 nights).

          4. Have untreated medical/ineffectively treated/psychological condition that may be the
             etiology of sleep disturbances.

             the last 2 years.

          6. Are taking or have been taking disallowed medication within 2 weeks prior to Visit 1.
