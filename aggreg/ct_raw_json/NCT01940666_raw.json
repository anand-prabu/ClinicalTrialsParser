SUMMARY ANSWER: Subjects with\n      excess free androgen index tend to be obese and face the highest metabolic syndrome risk,\n      adipocytokine alterations, insulin resistance (IR) and cardiovascular risk. The excess TT\n      group presents with a marginal IR risk, while the excess A4 group has the highest\n      antim\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH), and may counterbalance obesity; this group and the excess\n      DHEA-S group have a favorable association with IR."
