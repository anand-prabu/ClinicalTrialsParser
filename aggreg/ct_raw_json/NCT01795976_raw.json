The T cells undergo lentiviral transduction with NY-ESO-1 specific nucleic acid under Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) conditions. The patient will then undergo preconditioning chemotherapy with a regime of cyclophosphamide 60mg/kg/day day -7 and -6 followed by fludarabine 25mg/m2 day -5 to -1. They will receive autologous NY-ESO-1 T cells on day 0 and following on from that they will receive up to 14 doses of intravenous IL-2 at a dose of 100000 units per kg.."

The\n      NY-ESO-1 gene modified cells will be re-infused on day 0 and the patients will receive up to\n      14 doses of intravenous Interleukin2 (100000 U/kg) from day 0 to day 4.\n\n      The primary objective of response rate according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid\n      Tumours (RECIST) 1.1 criteria will be assessed by CT scans carried out at week 6, week 12\n      and at 12 weekly intervals thereafter."
