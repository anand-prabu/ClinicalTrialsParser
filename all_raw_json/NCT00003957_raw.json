Combining chemotherapy with autologous peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have relapsed non-Hodgkin's\n      lymphoma."

Determine how many patients with chemotherapy sensitive relapsed\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma receiving sequential high dose chemotherapy achieve a collection of a\n      minimum 5 million CD34+ cells/kg in one large volume apheresis. II. Determine the\n      feasibility and safety of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine disease free and\n      overall survival of patients receiving this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour followed by paclitaxel IV over 24\n      hours on day 1. Filgrastim (G-CSF) and stem cell factor (SCF) are administered\n      subcutaneously beginning on day 3 for approximately 7-14 days (until the completion of\n      leukapheresis). Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected over 3-5 days. Three weeks\n      after leukapheresis is completed, patients receive cytarabine IV over 2 hours twice a day on\n      days -6 to -3. Mitoxantrone IV is administered over 1 hour on day -6. CD34+ PBSC are\n      reinfused on day 0. Four weeks later, patients receive etoposide IV over 11 hours on day -2\n      and melphalan IV over 30 minutes twice on day -1. CD34+ PBSC are reinfused on day 0.\n      Concurrent G-CSF is administered subcutaneously and continues until blood counts recover.\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for the first 2 years, and then every 6\n      months for the next 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
