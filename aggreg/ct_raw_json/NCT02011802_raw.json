Calcium alginate dressings form a natural gel of the exudates against the healing tissue that keeps it moist and supple, aiding in healing and tissue growth. In addition, this gel material forms a natural barrier to bacteria that may complicate healing with secondary infections of the wound. Alginates are the reference of dressing after sinus pilonidal excision."

Eradication of pilonidal sinus is based on a wide\n      surgical excision and at the end of the procedure, the wound is dressed with an alginate\n      dressing (Algosteril\u00ae).\n\n      The objective is to show a better efficiency of Sorbact TM (trademark) dressings compared to\n      Alginates that are standardized dressings after pilonidal sinus excision during a period of\n      75 days. The main objective is to show a difference of 20% of wounds completely healed in 75\n      days between the two types of dressing: 50% of wounds healed with Algosteril TM compared to\n      70% of wounds healed with Sorbact TM."
