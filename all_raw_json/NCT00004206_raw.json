Determine the efficacy of oxaliplatin in combination with fluorouracil in\n      terms of response rate, time to tumor progression, and overall survival in patients with\n      recurrent ovarian cancer. II. Evaluate the safety profile of this combination regimen in\n      this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label study. Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours once\n      every 2 weeks and fluorouracil IV and leucovorin calcium IV once weekly. Treatment repeats\n      every 2 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with stable or responding disease are followed at 1 month and at 3 months, then\n      every 3 months for disease relapse and survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
