Patients will be randomly assigned to either receive ioxaglate or iodixanol during coronary angiography. The primary outcome measure will be a change in thrombin generation test from baseline to after coronary angiography. Secondary outcomes will include a change in other markers of platelet activity and thrombogenesis between baseline and after coronary angiography. In addition, in patients undergoing PCI, differences in markers after the administration of bivalirudin and after PCI will be evaluated."

Despite the use of antiplatelet and anticoagulant pharmacotherapy,\n      thrombotic complications of PCI continue to cause significant morbidity, especially in\n      already high risk patients. In addition to adjunctive anti- thrombotic and anti-platelet\n      therapy, the type of contrast agent used may also affect thrombus formation by directly\n      affecting specific coagulation factors, fibrinolytic factors, and platelet degranulation,\n      aggregation, or adhesion.\n\n      Optimizing thrombotic risk in patients requiring coronary angiography with or without\n      intervention is paramount to patient care. This is especially true if a type of contrast\n      agent is found to have a superior role in reducing factors known to increase peri-procedural\n      thromboembolic events."
