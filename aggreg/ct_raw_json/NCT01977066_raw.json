The intervention programs will be (1) a 6-month supervised moderate-to-high-intensity,\n      progressive resistance training, and (2) a 6-month home-based exercise training. Thus, the\n      two interventions differ primarily by the intensity and mode-of-administration of the\n      intervention. Both interventions will start 8 weeks after surgery to allow for wound\n      healing. The supervised progressive training will start with only moderate-intensity\n      training during the first 4 weeks. Only patients without comorbidities that preclude\n      participation in the intervention arms (e.g. severe pain, heart insufficiency, reduced\n      standing or walking ability) are eligible. Patients who exercise more than 150 minutes per\n      week will be excluded.\n\n      The primary objective is to compare the effects of the different interventions on physical\n      functioning, measured as change from baseline to 6 months. Additional endpoints are overall\n      quality of life, fatigue, endurance, and strength performance, adherence to the\n      interventions, discontinuation of adjuvant therapy, body weight and composition, disease\n      progression, overall and progression-free survival. All outcomes will be assessed every 3\n      months for a minimum follow-up period of 12 months.\n\n      The investigators expect that supervised training is most beneficial to the patients.\n      However, they also expect some benefit for patients in the home-based training."
