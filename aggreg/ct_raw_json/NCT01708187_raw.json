            "textblock": "Peroneal tendon tears are a common etiology encountered by foot and ankle surgeons.  Like\n      all flexor tendon repairs adhesions are one of the more common challenges after surgery.\n      Peroneal tendon gliding is key to their function as effective plantar flexors and evertors\n      of the hindfoot.  Scarring and adhesion correlate directly with the amount of inflammatory\n      reaction at the wound site (Adzick 1994).  Our goal is to have a surgical technique that\n      allows for standard suture repair of the tendon yet allows for smooth gliding of the tendon\n      with minimal adhesions. A prospective review on the surgical repair of the peroneal tendons\n      utilizing NEOX\u21221k (Amniox Medical, Marietta, GA), cryopreserved Human Amniotic Membrane\n      (C-HAM) graft will be performed.  The investigators hypothesize that the use of\n      cryopreserved Human Amniotic Membrane in conjunction with a peroneal tendon repair will\n      decrease that amount of inflammation, overall recovery time of surgically repaired peroneal\n      tendon tears, and adhesions."
