Vaccines made from a person's\n      cancer cells may make the body build an immune response to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining monoclonal antibody therapy\n      and vaccine therapy in treating patients who have stage III or stage IV melanoma that has\n      been removed during surgery."
