It is currently managed by chronic steroid use, multiple endoscopic sinus\n      surgeries and/or aspirin desensitization. However, these treatments have potential adverse\n      effects.\n\n      A theory has been postulated that decreasing the level of dietary salicylates may help in\n      long-term control of disease.  A current trial is in the works to evaluate the clinical\n      outcomes of decreased salicylate, but measurements of biochemical markers of disease has not\n      yet been done.  The hypothesis is that decreased dietary salicylates will result in a\n      decrease in urinary salicylates and inflammatory markers of disease, cys-leukotrienes, which\n      are typically elevated in this disease."
