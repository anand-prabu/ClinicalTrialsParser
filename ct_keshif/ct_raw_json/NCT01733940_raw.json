The use of dressings containing chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) can\n      decrease the catheters colonization, closely related to infection thereof.\n\n      Objective: To determine the efficacy of the dressing \"Tegaderm CHG\" dressings versus\n      \"Tegaderm IV\" dressings in reducing the risk of colonization of central intravascular\n      catheters in the intensive care unit (ICU).\n\n      Methods: Randomized controlled trial with blinding professional who reviews the main\n      outcome. The study included patients over 18 years, indicating the central intravascular\n      catheter implantation in the ICU or in the operating room, prior informed consent. Excluding\n      subjects with positive blood culture at the time of catheter implantation.\n\n      The estimated sample size is 398 patients, with a confidence level of 95% and a statistical\n      power of 80%. The study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the hospital.\n\n      Be made prospectively followed subjects from study entry until catheter removal collecting\n      information on age, sex, APACHEII, antibiotic therapy, duration of catheter insertion site\n      and removal, reason for withdrawal and microbiological information.\n\n      For statistical analysis, a model is adjusted multivariate logistic regression, determining\n      the interaction of variables with the likelihood ratio test and confusion by switching\n      between the crude and adjusted effect greater than 10%.\n\n      Results and conclusions: The recruitment has started in November 2012 and is scheduled for\n      completion in March 2013. This study will determine whether these new dressings are\n      effective in our environment."
