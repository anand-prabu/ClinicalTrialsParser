  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile crime imposes enormous costs on victims, on society, and on juvenile offenders
      themselves. However, research assessing the efficacy of interventions for young offenders
      show, on average, only small effects on recidivism, substance abuse, and other behavioral
      outcomes. A major problem with existing interventions is that they tend to neglect
      individual differences in motivation and readiness to make positive changes. In earlier
      research, we used an empirically validated model of behavior change, the Transtheoretical
      Model (TTM, the &quot;stage&quot; model), and expert system technology to develop the Rise Above Your
      Situation program (RAYS), a prototype of a multimedia computerized tailored intervention
      designed as an adjunct to traditional juvenile justice programs. The intervention delivers
      assessments and individualized feedback matched to readiness to stay out of trouble with the
      law and quit alcohol and drugs. At the end each session the program also generates a
      counselor report that summarizes the youth's feedback and presents concrete,
      easy-to-implement strategies counselors can use to reinforce stage-matched concepts. In the
      current research, the goals are to complete development of the computerized tailored
      intervention; develop training and other support materials for counselors; and assess the
      efficacy of the intervention package in a randomized clinical trial involving 1,000
      court-involved juveniles aged 13-17. Primary outcomes will be criminal recidivism and
      substance abuse abstinence at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

    <description>The Rise Above Your Situation program (RAYS) is a multimedia computer-tailored intervention that relies on the Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change (TTM) and expert system technology to deliver assessments, feedback, printed reports, and helpgiver reports with intervention ideas. Helpgivers (probation officers in this case) use the reports to guide 1/2 hour follow-up discussions to reinforce intervention ideas and provide support.</description>
