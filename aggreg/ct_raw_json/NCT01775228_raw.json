The high prevalence of postoperative\n      depression in this population may threaten optimal recovery. Peer support over the recovery\n      period has promise to mitigate this threat. The purpose of this study was to examine the\n      effect of a professionally-guided telephone peer support intervention on recovery outcomes\n      including depression, social support and health care resource utilization.\n\n      In a randomized controlled trial, 185 male CABG surgery patients randomly assigned to an\n      intervention (n=61) or usual care (n=124) group. Participants in the intervention group\n      received weekly telephone calls from a peer volunteer over 6 weeks post discharge. At\n      hospital discharge and at 6 and 12 weeks follow up, depression was measured using the Beck\n      Depression Scale-II,  social support was measured using the Shortened Social Support Scale\n      and health care resource utilization was measured using items in the Postoperative Self\n      Report of Recovery Questionnaire. Participants in the intervention group were also asked\n      questions about their perceptions regarding peer support using the Peer Support Evaluation\n      Inventory."
