            "textblock": "The study investigators hypothesize that neoadjuvant FOLFIRINOX can be safely and\n      efficaciously delivered using a sequential regimen with SBRT as an alternative to standard\n      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy.  Standard of care neoadjuvant treatment typically requires\n      about six weeks of treatment with sub-systemic dosing of chemotherapy.  The feasibility of\n      the sequential delivery of the FOLFIRINOX followed by SBRT will be evaluated by capturing\n      the prevalence of grade 3 toxicity and the treatment delay rate.\n\n      In our study, SBRT is planned sequentially to follow cycle 4 of chemotherapy treatment,\n      provided toxicity has resolved to grade 2 or less.  Thus, allowing for resolution of\n      chemotherapy toxicity prior to initiation of radiation therapy.  This interval and the fact\n      that there is no concurrent delivery of chemo-RT, based on previously discussed experiences,\n      including approaches where SBRT safely follows other intense chemotherapy regimens (see\n      Polistina et al and Chuong [35,36]) makes this study feasible without establishing toxicity\n      profile.\n\n      The proposed regimen of 4 cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by 30 Gy/5 fractions using SBRT will\n      be safely tolerated and will improve resectability rates in borderline resectable PDAC\n      patients.  In addition, this regimen will not compromise the ability to achieve a successful\n      Whipple resection.\n\n      This regimen will improve the local control rate and overall disease free survival in this\n      patient population. The investigators further hypothesize that early administration of\n      FOLFIRNOX will provide optimal systemic therapy to control clinically occult\n      micrometastases."
