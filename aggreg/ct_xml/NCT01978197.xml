  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act enacted by the US Congress in 2009
      gave the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) the authority to regulate tobacco products. In
      July 2011, the FDA's Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee (TPSAC) submitted its
      final report that included a recommendation that &quot;removal of menthol cigarettes from the
      marketplace would benefit public health in the US&quot;. Available evidence suggest that  a ban
      on menthol cigarettes from US markets could create a situation in which up to 3 million
      menthol smokers would be interested in quitting smoking and the majority of whom will be
      ethnic minorities and other at risk groups including youths, and female smokers. However,
      little empirical evidence is available to guide treatment options for menthol smokers.

      The primary aim of this study is to determine menthol smokers' perception, product
      preference, and pattern of use across six products including, 1) mint-flavored 2mg nicotine
      gum ; 2) mint-flavored 4mg nicotine gum; 3) non-flavored 2mg nicotine gum; 4) non-flavored
      4mg nicotine gum; 5) mint-flavored electronic cigarette; and 6) non-flavored electronic
      cigarette.  Fifty smokers (all African American menthol smokers) will be recruited for this
      study. Participants will undergo a baseline assessment followed by a 2-week product sampling
      phase.  At the end of the 2 weeks of sampling, subjects will select a product to use during
      the following 2-week smoking cessation phase.  This 2-week cessation phase is followed by
      one week of abrupt withdrawal of the product.  We will use the two-way ANOVA by ranks to
      test differences of rank of choice among the six products. We will use a binary variable to
      record the product each individual chooses. We will apply a repeated-measures logistic
      regression with generalized estimating equations (GEE) to identify factors associated with
      their choice of product.

      Dissemination activities will occur at local and national levels. At the local level, study
      findings will be presented at seminars and conferences at the University of Minnesota (UMN)
      and the Twin Cities area. We will also work with project staff at ClearWay to identify other
      relevant policy and community stakeholder audiences across the state especially those
      serving priority populations.  At the national level, abstracts of study findings will be
      presented at national scientific.  The research proposed in the current application is an
      important step to developing an evidence base for effective smoking cessation treatments for
      menthol smokers.
