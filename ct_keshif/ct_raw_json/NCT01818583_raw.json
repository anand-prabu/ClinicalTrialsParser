            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation is a condition in which the heart's upper chambers, the atria, contract\n      at an abnormally rapid rate. It is a common type of arrhythmia, and occurs in 1-2% of the\n      general population. The prevalence of atrial fibrillation increases with age. Between 50 and\n      70% of patients with atrial fibrillation lasting <48 hours spontaneously convert to normal\n      sinus rhythm, and drug therapy increases the likelihood of conversion to sinus rhythm.\n      Another treatment option for conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter is\n      electrical conversion. This is an effective treatment but requires anesthesia.\n\n      Current treatment strategy for medical conversion of atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter\n      is to employ drugs that affect ion channel activity in atrial cardiomyocytes. However, such\n      converting drugs all have potentially serious side effects and are expensive. Potassium,\n      sodium, calcium, and magnesium molecules are the most important ions causing electric\n      current in the heart tissue. Our hypothesis is that hypokalemia promotes atrial\n      fibrillation/atrial flutter by a direct effect on cardiomyocytes. Accordingly, we also\n      hypothesize that potassium infusion may convert atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter to normal\n      sinus rhythm. If so, this would be an inexpensive treatment with potentially very few side\n      effects."
