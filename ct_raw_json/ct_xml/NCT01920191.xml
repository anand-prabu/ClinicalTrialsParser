      RATIONALE : IMA 950 is multi tumour-associated peptides (TUMAPs) vaccine, these peptides
      have been identified on primary glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) cells. Poly-ICLC is a potent
      vaccine adjuvant with broad innate and adaptive immune enhancing effects. IMA 950 and
      Poly-ICLC will be administered to patients alongside standard primary therapy for
      glioblastoma. This includes the alkylating drug temozolomide (TMZ). Effective
      vaccine-induced immune responses associated with prolonged survival have been observed in
      glioblastoma patients during TMZ adjuvant therapy, suggesting a possible synergistic effect.
      A second component of glioblastoma standard treatment is external beam irradiation of the
      tumor site post-surgery. As a side effect, potentially beneficial tumor-infiltrating immune
      cells may also be killed by radiation. However, the combination of radiation with
      immunotherapy has been suggested to be favorable both in pre-clinical models.

      OBJECTIVES

      Primary

        -  Tolerability and safety of IMA950 adjuvanted with Poly-ICLC when given together with
           temozolomide, using CTCAE V 4.0.

        -  Immunogenicity of IMA950 plus Poly-ICLC when given together with temozolomide.

      Secondary

        -  6, 9 month progression free survival (PFS) using gadolinium enhanced MRI and clinical
           assessment according to revised RANO criteria

        -  Overall survival (OS)

        -  Immunologic endpoints (correlation between clinical and immunological responses):

        -  evaluation of peptide immunogenicity by tetramer staining

        -  analysis of memory, activation and homing marker expression by tetramer positive cells

        -  analysis of cytokine secretion and proliferation by antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 T
           cells

        -  analysis of the presence of T regulatory and myeloid-derived suppressor cells

        -  The immunological analyses will be performed on:

        -  peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC)

        -  cultures of skin punch biopsy at delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) site

        -  tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) if brain tissue is available at recurrence

      OUTLINE

      This is a multi-centre, open label, one cohort, safety and immunogenicity, Phase I/II study.

      A maximum of 16 HLA -A2 positive patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma will be enrolled
      into the study after treatment with radiation therapy and concurrent temozolomide.

      All patients will receive the same dose of IMA950 with Poly-ICLC and follow the same
      vaccination schedule which comprises a Vaccination Induction Phase of six intensive
      vaccinations, followed by a Vaccination Maintenance Phase of five vaccinations over a longer
      period.

      The Vaccination Induction Phase will start a minimum of 7 days after the final
      radiotherapy/TMZ dose of CRT and 28 days (+7 days) prior to the first scheduled dose of
      adjuvant TMZ.

      This will ensure that all six vaccinations in the Induction Phase will be administered a
      week after immunosuppressive therapy (i.e. combined radiotherapy and temozolomide) and will
      finish a week prior to the start of adjuvant TMZ.

      Two Phases :

      Induction phase, patient receive the first 6 doses of Poly ICLC (IM) followed by IMA 950
      Peptide based vaccine (ID) on days 1,2,3,8,15, and 21 in absence of unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Maintenance Phase, patient receive Poly ICLC (IM) followed by IMA 950 Peptide based vaccine
      (ID)on day 21 of each adjuvant temozolomide cycle in absence unacceptable toxicity or
      disease progression.

      Immunomonitoring assessments will be performed at 8 time points with blood samples
      collection and one DTH site analysis(after vaccination 7).

      Brain MRI will be performed every two months for disease assessment.
