            "textblock": "Kinesio taping is a novel method which recently has emerged as a viable option to treat of\n      various musculoskeletal and neuromuscular deficits. The application of tape to injured soft\n      tissues and joints provides support and protection for these structures.  Many different\n      techniques are used for injury prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, proprioception and\n      sport. Elastic adhesive tape may be used to unload Myofacial Trigger Points (MTrPs), A\n      trigger point can be located in fascia, ligaments, muscles, and tendons; however, MTrPs are\n      also found in skeletal muscles and/or their fascia. An MTrP is a hyperirritable spot,\n      associated with a taut band of a skeletal muscle that is painful on compression or stretch,\n      and that can give rise to a typical referred pain pattern as well as autonomic phenomena.\n      The use of tape along muscle to unload affected soft tissue seems to be effective in the\n      treatment of trigger points by inhibiting overactive muscle, changing the orientation of\n      fascia and a proprioceptive effect. The purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of\n      Kinesio taping application on trigger point of piriformis muscle."

            "textblock": "Piriformis syndrome is a peripheral neuritis of the sciatic nerve caused by an abnormal\n      condition of the piriformis muscle. Some investigators consider it as a form of Myofacial\n      pain syndrome which defined as the presence of exquisite tenderness at a nodule in a\n      palpable taut band of muscle. Trigger points are able to produce referred pain, either\n      spontaneously or on digital compression. Although myofascial trigger points are a widely\n      recognized phenomenon in clinical practice, there remains much to be elucidated with regards\n      to their pathophysiology. Conservative pharmacotherapy with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory\n      drugs (NSAID), muscle relaxants, and physical therapy modalities such as heat therapy, cold\n      therapy, ultrasound, electrical current and stretching were traditionally used in the\n      treatment of trigger points.\n\n      The utilization of Kinesio taping regarding to the proposed mechanisms including 1)\n      restoring correct muscle function by supporting weakened muscles, (2) reducing congestion by\n      improving the flow of blood and lymphatic fluid, (3) decreasing pain by stimulating\n      neurological system, and (4) correcting misaligned joints by retrieving muscle spasm  (5)\n      enhancing proprioception through increased stimulation to cutaneous mechanoreceptors can be\n      helpful in restoring muscle function in patients with Myofacial trigger points . However,\n      there are not many controlled studies that have analyzed the effects of the Kinesio taping\n      in their treatment. Therefore, the purpose of study was to determine the efficacy of KT\n      application as an easy and appropriate method on trigger point of piriformis muscle."
