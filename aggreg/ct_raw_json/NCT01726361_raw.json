Although the number of\n      adolescents displaying serious behaviour problems is limited, they are a serious concern to\n      the society e.g. because of their frequent violent behaviour, criminal activities and lack\n      of school adherence.\n\n      Multidimensional Treatment Foster Care (MTFC)is a community-based treatment program\n      developed in USA. The goal of the MTFC program is to decrease problem behaviour and to\n      increase developmentally appropriate normative and prosocial behavior in adolescents who are\n      in need of out-of-home placement.\n\n      This study will evaluate the effect of MTFC on adolescents in out-of-home placement.\n\n      Participants will be recruited by caseworkers in the municipalities and randomly assigned to\n      either MTFC or TAU. TAU will consist of other kinds of out-of-home placements. Outcomes will\n      be assessed for all participants at baseline, post-treatment (12 months), and 12 months\n      post-treatment. Parents and youth will be asked to fill out questionnaires on e.g.\n      behaviour, parental stress, sense of cohesion, general health."
