Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal cells from the side\n      effects of radiation therapy and chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus combination\n      chemotherapy and amifostine in treating patients who have stage II, stage III, or stage IV\n      head and neck cancer that cannot be surgically removed."

Assess the impact of amifostine on the acute tolerance of combined\n      hyperfractionated radiation therapy and fluorouracil, cisplatin, and paclitaxel with\n      amifostine, in terms of the grade and duration of acute mucositis and dermatitis, and acute\n      hematologic tolerance in patients with stage III or IV unresectable head and neck carcinoma.\n      II. Determine the local control and survival associated with this regimen in these patients.\n      III. Determine the long term chronic toxic effects of this regimen in terms of swallowing\n      dysfunction, PEG dependency, and xerostomia in these patients. IV. Determine the quality of\n      life post therapy by assessment of speech and swallowing function in these patients. V.\n      Determine if radiation dose escalation in patients with treatment interruption achieve an\n      isoeffect on locoregional control. VI. Determine the safe optimal dose of paclitaxel to be\n      combined with hyperfractionated radiation therapy, fluorouracil, cisplatin, and amifostine\n      in these patients. VII. Determine the correlation of p53 chromosome expression on\n      locoregional control and survival of these patients. VIII. Quantitate tumor volumetrics and\n      correlate with stage, resectability status, and locoregional control and survival of these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation of paclitaxel, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      by performance status, stage, institution, tumor volumetrics, resectability, and p53\n      expression. Patients receive amifostine IV over 10 minutes on Monday of weeks 1, 5, and 9,\n      and over 5-7 minutes Tuesday through Friday of weeks 1, 5, and 9 and Monday through Friday\n      of weeks 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7. Within 10-15 minutes of amifostine administration, patients\n      receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours, cisplatin IV over 2 hours on days 1, 29, and 56, and\n      fluorouracil IV over 72 hours on days 1-4, 29-33, and 56-60. Starting on day 2, patients\n      receive hyperfractionated external beam radiotherapy twice daily over 6.5 weeks, following\n      amifostine IV over 5-7 minutes Monday through Friday. Cohorts of 6-20 patients each receive\n      escalating doses of paclitaxel. Quality of life is assessed. Patients are followed monthly\n      for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually\n      thereafter until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months."
