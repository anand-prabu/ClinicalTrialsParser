However, any weight gained while taking antiretrovirals is\n      mostly fat.  A patient's viral load may affect whether weight gained is a result of\n      increased fat or increased muscle.  A large-scale study is needed to closely evaluate the\n      effects of antiretroviral therapy on body composition."

            "textblock": "Effective antiretroviral therapy, as measured by a decrease in HIV-1 RNA levels, may sustain\n      or improve important components of body composition, perhaps through a decrease in the\n      underlying pro-inflammatory activity and resting energy expenditure. Moderate weight gain\n      has been reported to be associated with HAART. Meaningful increase in total body weight,\n      however, may need to be comprised of augmentation of lean body mass (primarily muscle),\n      since mortality in HIV and cancer wasting is associated with sizable decreases in lean body\n      mass (LBM) and there is no evidence that increases in fat cell mass are protective. To date,\n      there has not been any large-scale prospective evaluation of the effects of HAART on body\n      composition. Nor has it been determined whether increasing body weight or specific\n      components of body composition (fat or lean body mass) in persons who have lost substantive\n      amounts of weight protects against AIDS-defining complications or prolongs survival.\n\n      This is a 48-week, observational study of lean body mass, appetite, functional performance,\n      and systemic markers of inflammation during highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) in\n      patients co-enrolled in ACTG antiretroviral studies. Patients are stratified by body mass\n      index (BMI) into 2 cohorts: less than 23 kg/m2 versus greater than or equal to 23 to 28\n      kg/m2.  At selected study visits, times of antiretroviral medication change, and following\n      the diagnosis of an AIDS-defining event, the following are assessed: height (screening visit\n      only), weight, lean body mass, appetite (by questionnaire), functional performance (by\n      questionnaire), and markers of systemic inflammation."
