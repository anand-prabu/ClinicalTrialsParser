All subjects will\n      participate in leadin periods prior to double-blind randomization to assess normal smoking\n      behavior and then to establish ability to tolerate research cigarettes prior to\n      randomization.\n\n      It is our hypothesis that nicotine intake, as measured by plasma cotinine concentration,\n      will decline as a function of cigarette nicotine content in the RNC group. Further, it is\n      our hypothesis that by gradually reducing the nicotine content of the cigarettes on a\n      monthly basis, there will not be significant increases in biomarkers of tobacco smoke\n      exposure, severity of nicotine withdrawal symptoms, mood and anxiety symptomatology or\n      protocol non-adherence over time in the experimental group (RNC) as compared with the UNC\n      control  group."
