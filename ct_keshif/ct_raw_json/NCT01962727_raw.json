This method classified the\n      scapular movements during arm raising/lowing movements in scapular plane as single abnormal\n      scapular patterns (inferior angle/ medial border/ superior border of scapula prominence and\n      abnormal scapulohumeral rhythm) or mixed abnormal scapular patterns. Different patterns of\n      scapular dyskinesis were also validated by corresponding alternation of the scapular\n      kinematics and muscular activities assessed by electromagnetic motion-capturing system and\n      surface electromyography (EMG)."
