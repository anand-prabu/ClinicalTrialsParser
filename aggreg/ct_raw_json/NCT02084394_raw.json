This monitor can also measureblood flow velocity\n      in  blood vessels in  the forehead.\n\n      This will only be done while the subject is on the cardiac bypass machine during the surgery\n      and end shortly after entering the intensive care unit.Prior to surgery and then once a day\n      on three of the first four postoperative days, patients will be assessed for the presence\n      and severity of delirium with brief standard psychological exams. We will compare rSO2 and\n      CBF changes between patients with and without delirium"
