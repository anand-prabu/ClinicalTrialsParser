A accurate initial staging is of paramount\n      importance for an appropriate treatment (neoadjuvant chemiotherapy and radiotherapy,\n      surgery).\n\n      Actually, there is no international consensus concerning imaging for the staging of rectal\n      cancer and modalities used are variable from one center to another.\n\n      WB-MRI represented a attractive and promising technique for the staging of rectal cancer,\n      free of ionizing radiation ."
