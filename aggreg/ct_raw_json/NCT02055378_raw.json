Atropine is a long-acting non-selective muscarinic antagonist that\n      blocks accommodation by paralyzing ciliary muscles; it may affect remodeling of the sclera\n      and suppress the elongation of axial length.   Acupuncture and acupressure have been widely\n      used in traditional Chinese medicine for thousands of years. Auricular acupoint stimulation\n      by acupuncture or acupressure has been reported to improve visual acuity in myopic patients.\n      Therefore, we want to compare the effect of myopia control between patients treated with\n      low-concentration atropine eye drops combined with auricular acupoint stimulation and those\n      who treated with atropine alone."
