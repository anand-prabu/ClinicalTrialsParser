  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, biotransformation, and
      excretion of [14C]AMG 416. Approximately six (6) adult male or female subjects with end
      stage renal disease requiring hemodialysis will be enrolled to receive 750 nCi of
      [14C]-labeled AMG 416 formulated in 10 mg AMG 416 administered as a single 2 mL intravenous
      dose at the end of hemodialysis.

      Subjects will spend the first approximately 12 days in confinement at the clinic (day -1
      until completion of day 11 study procedures). Blood samples, and complete collections of
      dialysate, dialysis membrane (as necessary), urine (as available), and feces will be
      analyzed for radioactivity content by accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS). Following the
      confinement period, subjects will return to the site on an outpatient basis in accordance to
      their routine dialysis sessions up to day 39. Blood and dialysate samples and dialysis
      membranes will be collected at specified times during the outpatient visit period.
