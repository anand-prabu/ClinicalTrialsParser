  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase IV trial , comparing HMS 90® versus
      placebo (soy protein) as add-on (adjuvant) therapy in subjects with idiopathic Parkinson's
      Disease.

      The principal objective is to evaluate the changes in biomarkers of oxidative stress
      and,plasma amino acids, as well as improvement of clinical symptoms and brain function
