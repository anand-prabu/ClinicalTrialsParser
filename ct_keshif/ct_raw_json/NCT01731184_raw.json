Assessment will be done at the baseline using a\n      validated numeric rating scale (NRS).\n\n      The primary outcome will be the proportion of patients with a pain score less than or equal\n      to 3 after 20 minutes. The secondary outcomes will be in between-group comparison of: the\n      treatment safety, pain score every 5 minutes during 30 minutes and the total morphine dose\n      required until obtaining a pain score less than or equal to 3."
