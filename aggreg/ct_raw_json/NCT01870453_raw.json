The study will first be introduced to patients at their\n      preoperative surgical clinic appointment by his/her surgeon.  If patients are interested in\n      participating, they will notify their surgeons, and subsequent recruitment will take place\n      at the MGH Pre-Admission Testing Area (PATA), a clinic for preoperative evaluation and\n      medical optimization.  Patient contact and recruitment, however, will only proceed with\n      permission from (1) the patient him/herself and (2) the patient's surgeon.  Per the Partners\n      Human Research Committees-approved criteria, if patients do not have capacity for\n      clinical-decision making but express a willingness to participate in the study, a surrogate\n      (i.e. healthcare proxy and/or family member) co-signature will be required on the consent\n      form.  On the day of the subject's surgery, the anesthesia team will be allowed to choose\n      one of four anesthetic options (i.e. propofol anesthesia, isoflurane anesthesia, sevoflurane\n      anesthesia, or desflurane anesthesia) based on clinical preference and appropriateness.  The\n      research team will be blinded to the anesthetic to which subjects are assigned.  Finally,\n      patients will be followed for one year post-operatively with a battery of cognitive tests to\n      determine differences in cognitive trajectory."
