This trial will investigate whether effective medication therapy\n      used in non-incarcerated populations will also be effective in incarcerated individuals.\n      Empirical evidence demonstrates that starting treatment before release greatly increases the\n      probability of successful outcome including reduced alcohol and drug use, increased\n      employment rates, and reduced recidivism rates."

Before release from jail,\n      participants in the XR_NTX and XR-NTX+PN conditions will receive their first Vivitrol\n      injection (and those in the XR-NTX+PN condition will meet with a Patient Navigator) and will\n      then be scheduled for medication management sessions twice monthly for months 1-3, with\n      monthly injections in months 4-6. Participants in the XR-NTX+PN condition will meet with a\n      PN who will provide behavioral assistance to overcome possible barriers to community\n      outpatient treatment and will be provided with referrals for community treatment programs.\n      Participants in the ETAU condition will receive education designed to reduce the likelihood\n      of overdose on the same schedule as the XR-NTX and XR-NTX+PN groups.\n\n      Participants will be 150 individuals, who meet DSM-5 (via CIDI-2) criteria for opioid use\n      disorders, are 18 years and older, who have been detoxified from opioids in the Metropolitan\n      Detention Center in Albuquerque, New Mexico. This study will include only those participants\n      for whom the study physician determines that possible treatment with the study drug is in\n      the best interest, and informed consent will be obtained.\n\n      All participants will be scheduled for twice-monthly medical management and assessment\n      appointments for the first three months of the 24-week post-release intervention phase, with\n      monthly appointments for months 4-6. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to\n      treatment condition (XR-NTX, XR-NTX+PN, ETAU) in equal numbers. XR-NTX and XR-NTX+PN\n      participants will undergo a naloxone challenge to ensure opioid abstinence at the time of\n      Vivitrol induction. Those in the XR-NTX+PN condition will be provided with aPN who will\n      facilitate attendance at outpatient treatment programs as well as assist with other needs.\n      The ETAU group will not receive any medication but will be scheduled for assessments and\n      education on drugs of abuse, maintaining abstinence, and methods for avoiding overdoses on\n      the same schedule as the other two groups. All groups will also be provided with referrals\n      to community-based substance abuse treatment programs."
