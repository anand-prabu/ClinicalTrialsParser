We do this by designing both\n      patient education materials and physician communication strategies to increase literacy and\n      volitional components of patients. We will test two conditions using a website called\n      Oneself: one providing only information (literacy-only control) and a second providing\n      relational communications designed to increase both literacy and volitional empowerment. To\n      test the self-management enhancing effects of empowerment and health literacy, we will\n      conduct a longitudinal experiment with 51 chronich back pain patients over two months. This\n      span of time is the minimum necessary to achieve a systematic change in self-management and\n      literacy skills, increasing also the range of possible decisions to be made and actions to\n      be real-ized by the patients."
