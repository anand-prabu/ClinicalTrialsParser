However, one of the feared complication\n      of this technique is acute pancreatitis, which happens in 5 to 25% of cases. Some patient\n      groups have been demonstrated to present a higher risk linked to individual factors or to\n      the procedure. Some interventions (endoscopic or pharmacologic) have been evaluated to\n      reduce the incidence of this complication but each has his own inconvenient. Recently, the\n      activation of heme oxygenase (HO) by intraperitoneal administration of hemin has been\n      demonstrated to be effective in prevention and treatment of acute pancreatitis mice models.\n      This protective effect has been associated to intrapancreatic HO-1 positive macrophage\n      recruitment activated by hemin. The investigators thus propose to conduct a prospective\n      randomized double blind controlled trial to demonstrate a protective effect of hemin\n      administration against post-ERCP acute pancreatitis in high risk patients."
