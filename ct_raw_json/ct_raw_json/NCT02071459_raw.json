            "textblock": "Background :\n\n      Multiple system atrophy (MSA) is a rare, sporadic progressive neurodegenerative disorder,\n      rapidly leading to severe disability and impairment of quality of life. MSA is characterized\n      by a variable combination of a poor levodopa parkinsonism and /or cerebellar ataxia and\n      autonomic failure (cardiovascular and / or bladder and sexual dysfunction) (Gilman et al,\n      2008). The prevalence is approximately 4-5 cases per 100 000 inhabitants.\n\n      Orthostatic hypotension (OH) is one of the major symptoms of MSA, present in a large\n      majority of patients, leading to significant disability because of impaired balance, falls\n      and possibly syncope. Drugs available to treat OH in this disease are very limited.\n\n      L-ThreoDOPS (L DOPS or DroxiDopa) is an orally administered synthetic catecholamine acid\n      that is converted to the sympathetic neurotransmitter norepinephrine (NE) through a single\n      step of decarboxylation by the endogenous enzyme 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)\n      decarboxylase.  It prevents symptoms related to OH by central and/peripheral mechanisms.\n      This drug is currently developed for \"neurogenic OH\" by Chelsea Therapeutics on the basis of\n      short duration placebo-controlled randomized trials. Besides an expected effect on OH,\n      L-DOPS may also, by noradrenergic stimulation, improve some motor and non-motor symptoms\n      common and disabling in MSA patients such as akinesia and fatigue.\n\n      In this context, the French reference center for MSA and the 12 national centers with\n      identified skills to manage this disease, propose to conduct  a national multicenter\n      randomized clinical trial versus placebo to evaluate the long term efficacy (3 months) of\n      L-threo DOPS on the OH and other non-motor symptoms in MSA patients."
