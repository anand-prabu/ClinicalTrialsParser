  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether noninvasive hemoglobin monitoring is
      sensitive and accurate enough to detect a significant downward trend in hemoglobin in
      patients at risk for significant bleeding. If this can be shown, it has the potential to
      spare patients multiple invasive blood draws as well as allow for earlier detection of
      significant blood loss and therefore positively impact on patient morbidity and mortality.
      Additionally, it may represent significant financial cost savings in that it may allow for
      patients to be monitored in a non-intensive care unit setting.

      This will be an observational study. The continuous hemoglobin monitor will be connected to
      the patient and hemoglobin measurement data will be collected. Routine laboratory hemoglobin
      monitoring will occur concurrently at a pre-specified frequency as well as at the
      physician's discretion based on usual clinical information. The physician will be blinded to
      the continuous hemoglobin monitoring readings and therefore patient care will not be
      affected by the use of the monitor. Once the study has ended, the data will then be analyzed
      to assess for correlation between continuous hemoglobin monitoring readings and laboratory
      hemoglobin measurement.
