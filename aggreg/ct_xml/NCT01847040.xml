  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will provide evidence on the long term outcomes of mTBI in service members
      returning from Afghanistan and Iraq.  In addition, the study will provide evidence on mTBI
      incidence, and symptom patterns.  Self-reported assessments at baseline and follow-ups will
      be combined with data on health care utilization and military job performance.  The work,
      symptoms, and family  interaction outcomes of returning soldiers screening positive for
      mTBI, combined mTBI and PTSD, and soldier controls will be compared at 3 months, 6 months,
      and at one year.  The assessments over time will permit descriptions of symptom changes for
      these populations.  It is likely the study will find similar findings to those of previous
      civilian studies - that concussive symptoms often resolve within months of injury.  However,
      some soldier subsets may have chronic problems.  Determining the incidence and outcomes of
      individuals with mTBI will assist medical providers in determining the types of follow-ups
      needed by returning service members and suggest the development of additional treatment
      interventions.  These results may also inform treatment of civilian populations with mTBI.

      The three primary hypotheses are:

        1. Concussive symptoms at the time of return from serving in Afghanistan and Iraq and
           symptoms persisting 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after return will be associated
           with extent of exposure to combat, injury mechanism, associated injuries (co-occuring
           injuries), PTSD and other psychiatric co-morbidities, and number of deployment-related
           mTBIs.

        2. Returning troops reporting concussive symptoms at the time of return from deployment
           will have more work related problems at each follow-up (including lower rates of return
           to duty, return to work, and poor quality of work).

        3. The mTBI screening tool will be sensitive and specific to mTBI when compared to the
           criterion measure, which is a structured interview conducted by clinicians blinded to
           the screening results.
