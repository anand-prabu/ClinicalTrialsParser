Several\n      strategies have been used to decrease the incidence of RAO including the use of\n      anticoagulation, maintenance of patency during hemostasis, or shortening the duration of\n      compression. Currently, there is no data whether vasoactive pharmacological therapy such as\n      nitroglycerin administered intra-arterially at the end of the procedure may reduce the\n      incidence of RAO. It is hypothesized that the addition of nitroglycerin (nitric oxide donor)\n      at the end of a TRA procedure may reduce the incidence of RAO."
