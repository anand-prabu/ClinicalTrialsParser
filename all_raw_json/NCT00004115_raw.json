It is not yet known whether\n      monoclonal antibody therapy is more effective than observation for ovarian cancer or primary\n      peritoneal cancer that is in remission.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody\n      therapy with that of observation in treating patients who have ovarian cancer or primary\n      peritoneal cancer in remission following surgery and chemotherapy."

Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive standard therapy (observation).\n\n        -  Arm II: After imaging studies of the peritoneal cavity to verify adequate fluid\n           distribution, patients receive yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody HMFG1 intraperitoneally\n           over 1 minute.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed in all patients prior to randomization, at weeks 4 and 8, at 3\n      months, and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      Patients in arm I are followed at weeks 1, 4, and 8. Patients in arm II are followed weekly\n      for 6 weeks and at weeks 8 and 12. All patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 420 patients (210 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
