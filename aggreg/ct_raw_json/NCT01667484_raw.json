            "textblock": "Cognitive impairment, or problems with thinking and memory, is common in multiple sclerosis\n      (MS) and can occur independently of physical disability. It is the most common reason, along\n      with physical fatigue, for MS patients to stop working. The most frequent complaint is\n      problems with multi-tasking or thinking quickly, which corresponds to impairment in the\n      cognitive domain of processing speed.  Currently there is treatment available to prevent\n      relapses and physical disability but there are no medications that have been shown to treat\n      cognitive impairment. Amphetamines have been beneficial for selective attention and\n      processing speed in attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and traumatic brain\n      injury. This is study will determine whether Adderall XR improves objective measures of\n      processing speed and attention in MS patients impaired in this cognitive domain, by\n      comparing two doses of Adderall XR (5 and 10mg) to placebo before and after the medication\n      is administered. The results of this study will help provide data to design a larger study\n      to determine if Adderall XR, and potentially other amphetamine drugs, will help treat\n      cognitive impairment in MS patients."
