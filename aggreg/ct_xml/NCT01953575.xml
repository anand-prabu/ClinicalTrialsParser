  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Do patients with eosinophilic esophagitis have baseline increased esophageal mucosal
      impedance?

      And will treatment that reverses esophageal eosinophilia in patients, correct abnormalities
      in mucosal impedance?

    <description>As a pilot, ten patients will be studied before and after treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis.  This number of patients will be increased if there are treatment failures until there is a total of ten effectively treated patients studied.  Effective treatment is defined by the elimination of esophageal eosinophilia on follow up endoscopic biopsy.  Ten control patients without esophageal disease will be studied.</description>

    <description>Patients with Eosinophilic Esophagitis and patient without trouble swallowing,during your clinical endoscopy (a standard procedure that allows your doctor to look at the inside of your swallowing tube), the 2.13 mm catheter (tiny tube), called an Intraluminal Impedance, will be passed through the channel of the standard endoscope. This device has not been approved by the Food and Drug Admistration (FDA) but it is considered to be minimal risk related to using it.
The catheter (tiny tube) will be placed  through the endoscope in your esophagus (swallowing tube)  5 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet for 5 seconds.
At 10 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds
And at 20 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds.</description>

    <description>Mucosal impedance- a (tiny tube) will be placed through the endoscope in your esophagus (swallowing tube)  5 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet for 5 seconds.
At 10 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds
And at 20 cm above where your stomach and esophagus meet the catheter will be placed for 5 seconds.
This will determine if people with eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) have an increased esophageal mucosa impedance (food getting into the esophageal tissue).</description>

        Inclusion criteria:

          -  Adults ages 18-90 undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy

          -  Patients with EoE, defined as dysphagia with histologic finding of greater than or
             equal to 15 eosinophils per high powered field on esophageal biopsy despite at least
             6 weeks of twice daily proton pump inhibitor therapy

          -  Patients undergoing clinically indicated upper endoscopy for indications other than
             dysphagia or GERD with normal appearing esophageal mucosa.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Medical conditions such as severe heart or lung disease that preclude safe
             performance of endoscopy

          -  Patients with conditions known to be associated with esophageal eosinophilia,
             including Crohn's disease, Churg-Strauss, achalasia, and hypereosinophilic syndrome

          -  Inability to read due to: Blindness, cognitive dysfunction, or English language
