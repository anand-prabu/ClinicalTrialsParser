      The purpose of this study aims to investigate the utility of Pivotal Response Treatment
      (PRT), a behaviorally derived intervention, to improve the quality and frequency of
      communication and social engagement of toddlers with siblings who have an autism spectrum
      disorder (SIBS - ASD) and who demonstrate developmental delays and impairments in social
      interaction between 12 and 15 months of age.

    <description>Assessment of Outcome:
Attendance. Attendance to parent education sessions will be recorded by the therapist.
Parent utilization. To assess the acceptability of the PRT approach, parents will be asked to keep a weekly log of procedure use, including overall estimated duration and choice of activities.</description>
