EPI-MAL-006 will be conducted in\n      advance of EPI-MAL-002/-003 in order to assess PP and malaria control measures to inform\n      enrollment in these studies. The age group for enrollment (\u22656 months - <10 years) will\n      permit analysis of PP according to the World Health Organization (WHO) definition (2-9\n      years) and by the Joint Technical Expert Group (JTEG) suggested age (<5 years)."
