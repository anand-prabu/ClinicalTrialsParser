MEASUREMENTS: The main result will\n      be changes in general health scores of the SF-36. It will also measure the change in\n      frequency and intensity of anxiety-depressive symptoms on the scales HARS, HDRS, STAI and\n      BDI at baseline and at 2, 6 and 12 months. In addition, also collected for drug use and\n      health services.\n\n      ANALYSIS: Analyses were performed by intention to treat, comparing the change obtained in\n      both groups at the end of the 12 month follow up. Estimates of the effect attributable to\n      the intervention by the difference in those changes, adjusting in addition to the baseline,\n      the possible confounding covariates or effect modifiers of the intervention, using\n      longitudinal mixed-effects models."
