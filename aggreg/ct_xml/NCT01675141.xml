      Background:

        -  Multiple myeloma is rarely curable, but it is treatable. Initial treatment is directed
           at controlling symptoms and reducing the number of myeloma cells. It continues until
           the cancer stops responding to treatment. At that time, treatment may switch to
           maintenance therapy, which is given to try to extend the response of the first therapy
           for as long as possible. Research suggests that lenalidomide maintenance therapy may
           delay the time for myeloma cells to start to grow and possibly improve survival.

        -  Lenalidomide is a drug that may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.
           Researchers want to look at the long-term effect of lenalidomide on immune cells. It
           will also look at the effects of extended treatment on the cancer and the immune
           system.

      Objectives:

      - To test the long-term effectiveness of lenalidomide therapy for multiple myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age with newly diagnosed or relapsed multiple myeloma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           sample will be collected. A bone scan and bone marrow biopsy will also be performed.

        -  Participants will receive lenalidomide maintenance treatment. It will be given
           according to the standard of care for multiple myeloma. Participants will take
           lenalidomide every day for 21 days of repeated 28-day cycles.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests. Blood tests will look at the
           effect of the treatment on the immune system.

        -  Treatment will continue as long as the cancer does not worsen and the side effects are
           not severe.

      Background:

      Multiple myeloma (MM) remains largely an incurable disease with an estimated median survival
      of 6-7 years in standard risk myeloma and 2-3 years in high risk disease despite treatment
      with autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT).

      Maintenance therapy to achieve sustained suppression of residual disease following
      chemotherapy or ASCT has long been viewed as a desirable approach for extending survival in
      MM.

      Giving the immunomodulatory drug lenalidomide after induction or re-induction treatment may
      stimulate the immune system in various ways to stop or slow the return of cancer.

      It is not yet known how immune stimulatory effects of extended dosing with lenalidomide in
      the maintenance setting correlate with clinical benefits.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objective:

      Assess T cell (CD4, CD8), NKT and NK cell numbers in peripheral blood during the

      course of lenalidomide maintenance therapy in treated MM patients.

      Secondary Objectives:

      Determine progression free survival

      Determine duration of response

      Assess NK cell function and activity

      Assess changes in B cell subsets, myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and T regulatory
      cells by phenotypic analysis during the course of therapy

      Assess expression of cereblon (CRBN), and how it relates to NK cell number and activity

      Eligibility:

      Patients with multiple myeloma who have achieved stable disease or better response, assessed
      at greater than or equal to 4 weeks after completing induction or re-induction treatment

      Age greater than or equal to 18 years

      ECOG PS of 0-2

      Adequate hematological parameters defined by: absolute neutrophil count greater than or
      equal to 1.0 K/microL, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 8 g/dL, and platelet count
      greater than or equal to 75 K/microL

      Adequate hepatic function, with bilirubin &lt;  1.5 times the ULN, and AST and ALT &lt;  3 times
      ULN

      Adequate renal function with creatinine clearance (CrCl) of greater than or equal to 40
      mL/min. CrCl will be calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault method. If the calculated CrCl
      based on Cockcroft-Gault method is &lt; 40 mL/min, patient will have a 24 hr urine collection
      to measure CrCl. The measured CrCl must also be greater than or equal to 40 ml/min

      Design:

      Single arm, single stage, phase II trial of lenalidomide maintenance for treated MM patients
      who have stable or responsive disease.

      After screening, eligibility determination, and enrollment; subjects will receive
      lenalidomide 10 mg by mouth daily on days 1-21 of repeated 28-day cycles. When necessary,
      lenalidomide will be held and restarted in accordance with accepted clinical dose
      modification guidelines.

      Subjects may continue lenalidomide until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      Blood will be obtained to assess changes in T cell (CD4, CD8), NKT and NK cell numbers by
      flow-cytometric analysis at pre-specified time points during lenalidomide maintenance.

      Blood samples and/or bone marrow samples where possible, will be used for additional
      research studies, which may include functional analyses of immune-cell subsets, analyses for
      cytokines, chemokines, antibodies, tumor cell antigen targets, and/or other markers.

             condom, diaphragm, cervical cap). FCBP must be referred to a qualified provider of
             contraceptive methods if needed.

          -  A FCBP is defined as a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy
             or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least
             24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24
             consecutive months).

          -  A FCBP must have two negative serum or urine pregnancy tests prior to starting study
             drug. The first pregnancy test must be performed within 10-14 days prior to the start
             of study drug and the second pregnancy test must be performed within 24 hours prior

          -  Patient must be able to take aspirin (81 or 325 mg) daily as prophylactic
             anticoagulation. Patients intolerant to ASA may use warfarin or low molecular weight
             heparin.

          -  Patient must understand and voluntarily sign an informed consent form, with the
             understanding that the patient may withdraw consent at any time without prejudice to
             future medical care.
