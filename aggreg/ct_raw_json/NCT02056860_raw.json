Once again, much like a flip of a coin, each participant will be randomly assigned to receive HFO at either a low (0.75 cmH2O) or high (1.25 cm H2O) intensity on HFO Day 1.  Participants receiving low intensity HFO on Day 1 will receive high intensity HFO on Day 2, and vice versa. Between HFO Testing Day 1 and 2 there will be a washout period of at least 24 hours.",

The purpose of Phase II experiments is to characterize the biological constituents produced from the oscillation enhanced sampling and contrast these constituents with those obtained during non-oscillation enhanced sampling.
