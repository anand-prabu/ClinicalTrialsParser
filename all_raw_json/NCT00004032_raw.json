Determine whether intraperitoneal (IP) injections of epithelial ovarian carcinoma cells\n      infected with ALVAC-hB7.1 and IP interferon gamma have acceptable toxicity and produce any\n      clinical responses in patients with refractory ovarian epithelial cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ALVAC-hB7.1 infected tumor cells.\n\n      Patients receive ALVAC-hB7.1 infected tumor cells intraperitoneally (IP) on days 4, 11, and\n      18. Patients also receive interferon gamma IP on days 8, 10, 15, and 17. In the absence of\n      disease progression, up to 6 courses of therapy may be given. If insufficient tumor cells\n      are available to continue treatment with tumor cell derived vaccine, interferon gamma may be\n      given alone. Cohorts of 3 to 6 patients receive escalating doses of ALVAC-hB7.1 infected\n      tumor cells until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
