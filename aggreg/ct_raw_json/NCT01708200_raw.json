Performance on ecologically\n      validated memory tasks will be measured before and after each intervention protocol.\n      Improvements are expected following each protocol.  However, there is no evidence available\n      to support added benefits from one protocol over another.  As such, the current study will\n      endeavour to contrast the two intervention types (top-down vs. bottom-up) to determine\n      which, if any, provides maximal benefit."
