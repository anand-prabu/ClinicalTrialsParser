  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed as a 3-year extension to the phase III core study CAIN457F2306. It
      aims to provide continuous treatment with secukinumab in pre-filled syringes (PFS) for
      subjects who completed the core study CAIN457F2306, to obtain further long term efficacy,
      safety and tolerability information in subjects with active psoriatic arthritis receiving
      secukinumab every 4 weeks. At Week 104 of the study CAIN457F2306, eligible subjects will
      complete the assessments associated with the core study visit and will subsequently continue
      in the extension study on the same dose that they were receiving during the core study. The
      regular assessments of disease activity will ensure that subjects who are experiencing
      worsening of disease in any of the treatment groups can exit the study upon their own wish
      or based on the advice of the investigator at any time.

    <description>Changes in DAS28 (utilizing hsCRP) from baseline to over entire study duration up to Month 60.

A DAS28 score greater than 5.1 implies active disease, equal to or less than 3.2 low disease activity, and less than 2.6 remission.</description>

    <description>Secukinumab is a human monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are proteins that recognize and bind to unique proteins that your body produces. Secukinumab binds and reduces the activity of a cytokine (a &quot;messenger&quot; protein in the body) called Interleukin 17 (IL-17).</description>
