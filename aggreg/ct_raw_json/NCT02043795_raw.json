            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Currently, DM foot admissions account for up to 2% of all admissions in CGH, with up to 50%\n      of patients with peripheral vascular disease (PVD).   CGH Vascular service performs 100-150\n      peripheral angioplasties for limb ischaemia per 6 months, the majority of which are for limb\n      salvage procedures.  The angioplasty procedure is performed below the knee (BTK) and the BTK\n      vessels are involved in more than 80% of the time.  Restenosis is common in peripheral\n      interventions.\n\n      In the recently published DESTINY trial, the superiority of Everolimus DES (XIENCE, Abbott\n      Vascular) was proven over BMS (Bare Metal Stents).  This landmark study suggests that for\n      short lesions in the BTK segment, DES improved patency rates and reduced the need for\n      re-interventions for restenosis.\n\n      Re-interventions for previously stented arteries are technically difficult.  In the coronary\n      bed, the Bioabsorbable stents have been developed to provide the functions of a drug eluting\n      stent but yet provide a temporary scaffold to allow the vessel to heal.  The absence of a\n      permanent metallic implant in the vascular tissue may facilitate any required\n      re-interventions on the target vessel / lesion or side branches either by percutaneous or\n      surgical means, thus enabling a broader range of treatment options after bioresorption of\n      the scaffold. In addition, unlike permanent metal implants, polymeric implants do not cause\n      imaging artifacts during non-invasive CT or MR evaluation providing additional benefit\n\n      Rationate and justification for the study\n\n      The safety of the BVS has already been demonstrated in man in the Coronary Bed.  It is\n      currently CE marked for this indication.\n\n      In the ABSORB Cohort A Study, it showed excellent long term clinical outcomes with low MACE\n      rates out to 4 years with absence of any target lesion revascularization, Q-wave myocardial\n      infarction, and scaffold thrombosis. Cohort B confirms these findings out to 1 year;\n      including patency comparable to XIENCE V. Absorb BVS thus performs all the functions of a\n      drug-eluting stent while offering future potential benefits resulting from the absence of a\n      permanent metallic implant.\n\n      An optimal post procedural follow-up imaging technique is as yet uncertain for this stent.\n      Assessment of conventional stents with CT angiography has been limited by streak and\n      susceptibility artefact on MRA. Doppler Ultrasound is known to be time intensive. Hence, if\n      MRA or CTA proof to be accurate modalities for evaluation, it would be easier for follow-up\n      and evaluation of these patients.\n\n      The aims of this study are:\n\n        1. to study which non-invasive imaging modality would be most appropriate in follow-up for\n           Bioabsorbable Everolimus Eluting Bioresorbable Vascular Scaffold System (BVS, Abbott\n           Vascular) patency deployed in subjects with critical limb ischemia (CLI) following\n           percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) of the tibial arteries. The aim is to\n           establish stent patency as well as imaging features of the stent.\n\n        2. to investigate the effects of percutaneous transluminal angioplasty using Bioabsorbable\n           Vascular Scaffold (BVS) in patients with Critical Limb Ischaemia CLI) and Below the\n           Knee (BTK) lesions in an Asian Population. One of the side arms of the study is to\n           establish imaging features of this new stent system with Doppler ultrasound, CT\n           angiography and MR angiography. The study aims to establish stent patency, as well as\n           imaging features of stent as it bio reabsorbs.\n\n      Study design\n\n      The study will prospectively collect consecutive cases treated with BVS for patients with\n      CLI and BTK lesions recruited over a 2 year period and followed up for 1 year.  The results\n      of these patients will be compared to a similar historical cohort consecutively treated with\n      XIENCE DES (metallic Drug Eluting Stents, Abbott Vascular).\n\n      This pilot study will involve recruitment of 12 patients x 1 year followed by another year\n      of post implantation follow-up.  If feasible, the recruitment will be extended to another\n      year for another 12 patients giving a total of 24 patients.\n\n      Patients not on chronic antiplatelets therapy should receive a loading dose of Plavix 300 mg\n      and Aspirin 300 mg started 6 to 72 hours prior and not later than 1 hour after the\n      procedure.  Pre procedure clinical assessment including pulses and Transcutaneous O2\n      measurement around the affected wound.  In the absence of a wound, this will be performed on\n      the dorsum of the foot.  Demographic data including comorbidities, medication history,\n      Rutherford class will be recorded.\n\n      Symptomatic patients would be screened with a duplex ultrasound prior to intervention.\n      After informed consent for a standard angiography/intervention, the patient will undergo a\n      planned intervention under general or local anaesthesia in an angiographic facility.  Either\n      antegrade or retrograde approach is allowed.  After common femoral artery sheath access, a\n      diagnostic angiogram will be performed as per any standard angioplasty procedure.  2 plane\n      angiography of the target lesions will be performed.  Of note will be the lesion\n      characteristics like length, location, and degree of stenosis and calcification.  Degree of\n      runoff will also be assessed on angiography.  If the 2 plane angiography confirms > 50%\n      stenosis or occlusion, the patient will be eligible for BVS.  The target vessel chosen\n      should preferably be but should not limited to, the wound relate artery in accordance to the\n      angiosome concept.   There should at least be one vessel runoff to the foot.\n\n      After angiographic assessment for suitability for BVS, heparin 2500 to 5000 IU will be\n      administered intra-arterially as per standard angioplasty according to body weight.  The\n      stenosis of occlusion will be crossed (true lumen or subintimal crossing is allowed) with a\n      guidewire of choice and pre-dilatation with a balloon catheter will be performed.\n      Pre-dilatation should be in accordance with manufacturer guidelines an should not extend\n      beyond the proposed treated segment\n\n      Post intervention angiography will subsequently be performed to assess the success of\n      treatment repeat balloon inflation is allowed.  Any residual stenosis and the degree of\n      stenosis at the end of the intervention will also be recorded. Post dilatation should be\n      confined to the previously scaffolded area and not exceed manufacturer recommendations with\n      respect to size. Subsequent treatment of the runoff tibial vessels is allowed.\n\n      Post procedure, standard post angioplasty regimes will be followed.  Patients will be\n      started on supplementary Clopidogrel (Plavix) 75 mg once a day together with Aspirin 100mg\n      once a day i.e. dual antiplatelets for 6month post intervention followed by Aspirin for life\n      unless contraindicated.\n\n      Clinical follow-up will be performed immediately post procedure at 1 month, 6 months and 1\n      year post intervention.  Assessment of the pulse, clinical patency will be performed at each\n      visit.  TCOMs will be performed at 6 and 12 months.   Duplex ultrasound to assess for\n      re-stenosis will be performed at 6 and 12 months, while CT angiography and MR angiography\n      will be performed at 12-month post-procedure."
