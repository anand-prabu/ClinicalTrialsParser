            "textblock": "Uganda is one of the countries with highest fertility rate in the world, 6.7 children per\n      women. It is estimated that 56 percent of all pregnancies are unintended and the\n      contraceptive prevalence rate in Uganda is 23 percent. Unwanted pregnancy is common and\n      induced abortion is illegal. Unsafe abortion is responsible for significant morbidity and\n      mortality among women in Uganda. Almost 40% of admissions to emergency obstetric care units\n      in Uganda due to unsafe abortion is reported and considered high in international\n      comparison. Studies have revealed that trained midlevel providers can deliver safe post\n      abortion care (PAC) for incomplete abortion and use manual vacuum aspiration. The\n      prostaglandin E1 analogue misoprostol has been shown to be an effective tool in the\n      treatment of incomplete abortions. This option is so far under-used in developing countries,\n      especially outside the larger hospitals and private clinics. One significant limiting factor\n      in providing safe PAC is the lack of providers. So far technical training has been mainly\n      limited to physicians. The long-term goal of this project is to provide evidence based\n      information that will contribute to the development of strategies to increase women's access\n      to high level post- abortion care at primary health care level provided by midlevel\n      providers in Uganda. A task shift to midlevel provider in providing treatment of incomplete\n      abortion will increase access to safe PAC and is a key to Millenium Development Goal 5.\n      Misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion remains underused and in accessible to a\n      majority of women in Uganda because national regulations restricts its prescription and\n      supervision to doctors.  However, the safety of misoprostol treatment should make it\n      amenable to provision by midlevel providers. Training of midlevel providers in misoprostol\n      treatment of incomplete abortion will support task shifting in places where doctors are\n      costly and scarce. By evaluating the effectiveness of mid-level providers (midwives);\n      administering misoprostol treatment of incomplete abortion the project is attempting to\n      contribute to the reduction of maternal mortality and morbidity and safeguard high quality\n      of post-abortion care. A direct economic impact can also be expected due to reduced\n      treatment costs of complications from unsafely induced abortion and incomplete abortions.\n      The involvement of midlevel providers in medical treatment of incomplete abortion has\n      previously not been systematically evaluated in African primary health care setting."
