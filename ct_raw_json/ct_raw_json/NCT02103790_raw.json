Currently, the NIV installation is done during an\n      hospitalization of several days. This hospitalization is problematic because of availability\n      of beds, logistical difficulties for the patient and estrangement from the usual\n      environment.\n\n      For this reasons, the NIV installation at home could be an interesting alternative for both\n      the patient and the medical staff.\n\n      The aim of this pilot study is to test the feasibility of NIV installation at home, using\n      telemedicine as a remote monitoring tool, and to assess its impact on the ventilation\n      compliance."
