    <description>BOR is defined as the confirmed best response (complete response [CR] or partial response [PR]) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST Version 1.1) as determined by Independent Endpoint Review Committee (IERC), obtained from start of study drug until documented disease progression, assessed every 6 weeks up to 3 years. CR or PR must be confirmed by a subsequent tumor assessment preferably at the next scheduled 6-weekly assessment, but no sooner than 5 weeks after the initial documentation of CR or PR. CR are those that persist on repeat imaging study at least 28 days after initial documentation of response. PR are those with greater than or equal to 30 percent decrease in the sum of the products of diameters (SOPD) of index lesions compared to the baseline SOPD, with no evidence of progressive disease (PD).</description>

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 to 1 at trial entry

          -  Disease must be measurable with at least 1 uni-dimensional measurable lesion by
             RECIST Version 1.1 (including skin lesions)

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  Effective contraception for both male and female subjects if the risk of conception
             exists

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participation in another clinical trial within the past 30 days

          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug

          -  Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T-cell co-regulatory proteins (immune
             checkpoints) such as anti-programmed death 1 (PD-1), anti-programmed death ligand 1
             (anti-PD-L1), or anticytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment as defined in the protocol. Radiotherapy administered
             to superficial lesions is not allowed if such lesions are considered target lesions
             in the efficacy evaluation or may influence the efficacy evaluation of the
             investigational agent

          -  Major surgery for any reason, except diagnostic biopsy, within 4 weeks and/or if the

          -  Pregnancy or lactation

          -  Known alcohol or drug abuse

          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial
             treatment
