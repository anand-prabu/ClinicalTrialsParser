      This Post-Marketing Observational Study (PMOS) aims to assess the effectiveness of
      Adalimumab on reducing synovitis This is assessed by ultrasonography in Rheumatoid Arthritis
      (RA) patients in Egypt. The study will collect B-mode ultrasonography data from RA patients
      who are on Adalimumab and have not been treated with any other anti-TNF therapy in the past.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the changes in synovitis of  Egyptian rheumatoid
      arthritis patients who are on Adalimumab.

      A sample size of 60 patients is targeted. The number of sites targeted is around 5 sites
      with approximately 12 patients per site.

      Patients are observed over a period of maximum 13 weeks of treatment with Adalimumab during
      which a maximum of 5 visits are performed.

      Analysis will be performed on the intention-to-treat population. Missing data will be
      counted as missed and patients whose ultrasonography or appropriate American College of
      Rheumatology (ACR) assessments are missing will be ignored from the analysis of the
      assessment for which data was missing.

      All variables recorded during the study will be summarized. Absolute and relative
      frequencies will be provided for categorical endpoints. Mean, standard deviation, median,
      quartiles, minimum and maximum will be provided for continuous endpoints. Two-sided 95%
      confidence intervals will be provided as appropriate. All adverse events reported during the
      study will be tabulated using frequency tables with intensity and actions taken.
