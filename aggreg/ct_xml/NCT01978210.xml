  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is designed to investigate the feasibility of comparing a standard
      behavioral intervention and an innovative intervention that incorporates the use of a
      wireless moisture alarm in training children with autism how to independently use the toilet
      for urination. We hypothesize that the study protocol will be feasible, as measured through
      review of achieved recruitment targets, successful randomization, and &gt;80% retention of
      subjects with com- plete data collection. Our second hypothesis is that therapists will
      deliver experimental and standard behavioral treatment  intervention with ≥80% fidelity and
      parents in both intervention groups will adhere to the intervention with ≥80% fidelity. A
      secondary aim of this study is to examine trends in outcome data by conducting a small RCT
      (N = 30) of wireless moisture alarm and standard behavioral toilet training, with the
      hypothesis that the moisture alarm intervention will result in fewer toileting accidents, a
      higher rate of toileting success and greater parental satisfaction.

    <description>Data logs maintained by parents during the 3 consecutive days prior to office visits will be used to measure toileting accidents.

    <description>Toileting logs maintained by parents for 3 consecutive days prior to study visit will be used to measure the daily rate of toilet use for participants. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that children in the WMP group will demonstrate more rapid acquisition of toileting skills than children in the SBT group. This will be assessed at 3 months (close of active intervention) and at a 6-month follow-up appointment.</description>

    <description>A parent satisfaction rating scale will be used to measure their satisfaction with their experience with the toilet training intervention for their child. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that parents participating in the WMP intervention will report overall greater satisfaction with their training experience relative to the SBT group. This will be assessed at 3 months (close of active intervention) and at a 6-month follow-up appointment.</description>

    <description>Parent(s) of subjects will participate in training and follow-up sessions in a  toilet training intervention for their child that incorporates use of the Autism Treatment Network's Toilet Training Tool Kit. The Tool Kit is a publication widely available to parents and clinicians that is designed to serve as an aid in the toilet training of children with autism. In this study, it is being used as a standard treatment control.</description>

    <intervention_name>Wireless Moisture Pager (WMP)</intervention_name>
    <description>The WMP is composed of a three key components: (1) the disposable sensor; (2) the transmitter; and (3) the receiver. The disposable sensor is placed by the parent in the child's underwear and detects small amounts of urine. The transmitter is housed in hardened plastic, attached to the disposable sensor, and, upon activation, emits a radio signal to the receiver. The receiver is an iPod-based app that emits an audible and/or vibration signal to the parent and child at the onset of a toileting accident. A step-by-step manualized curriculum is used to teach parents how to incorporate the device in the toilet training of their child.</description>

          4. A positive determination of readiness for toilet training, as determined through
             aToileting Readiness Checklist developed through a review of relevant literature on
             toilet training with children with autism (with 4 or more of 7 signs in the
             checklist, with 3 of these criteria required).

          5. Consent from parent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical conditions that would interfere with toilet training procedures (e.g.,
             physical disabilities)

          2. Physical disorder that may contribute to incontinence (e.g., diabetes, urinary tract
             infection, or seizures)

          3. Anticipation of medication changes to occur during the 3-month intervention period

          4. Medication for enuresis

          5. A parent report that the child has urinated into a toilet  2 times or more when
             toilet trips are initiated by child, AND/OR 20% or more of the total instances in
             which a caretaker had initiated a toileting opportunity (to be estimated by study
             team member during initial conversation. If parent is unsure, they may be asked to
             monitor toileting behavior for a week, and the team member can call back to review
             with parent).

          6. Parent report that the child has participated in systematic training efforts, under
             the guidance of a clinician (e.g., physician, psychologist) for more than 8 weeks
             (total) in the previous 6months.

          7. Active drug or alcohol use or dependence on the part of the parent that, in the
             opinion of the site investigator, would interfere with adherence to study re-
             quirements.
