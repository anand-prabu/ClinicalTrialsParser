In these patients, increase\n      of afterload leads to hypertrophy and late RV dilatation. The stress exercised  on RV walls\n      could play a role in adaptative mechanisms to systemic afterload. Beyond a  remodelling\n      threshold, it could cause fibrosis damage and RV systolic failure. Magnetic resonance\n      imaging, which has a major potential in estimation of RV remodelling, wall stress and\n      fibrosis, could shed light on RV adaptation to systemic afterload and evolution towards\n      failure. Systemic RV remodelling and function could also depend on the neuro-hormone\n      secretion and mechanical arterial properties, that have a direct influence on patients\n      afterload. The first purpose of the study is to determine the adaptative mechanisms of RV to\n      systemic afterload, and the mechanisms of RV failure, in patients with congenital heart\n      disease and subaortic RV, using cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR).The mechanisms are\n      evaluated by measures of RV remodelling and RV wall stress using CMR.
