Therefore, the main goal of the present study is to assess whether high dose\n      vitamin D supplementation results in a suppression of the stress-axis, as measured by\n      decreased levels of cortisol."

            "textblock": "The lifetime incidence of a major depression in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is 50%. (Patten et\n      al. Neurology 2003; 61(11):1524-7) Our group reported a negative correlation between vitamin\n      D status and depression score of the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) in a\n      cross-sectional dataset of Dutch MS patients. (Knippenberg et al. Acta Neurol Scand 2011;\n      124(3):171-5) This suggests an interaction between vitamin D and biological mechanisms\n      affecting susceptibility to depression. Currently, we have two main hypotheses: 1) Vitamin D\n      regulates the hypothalamic stress axis in MS. Based on our findings that cortisol releasing\n      hormone (CRH)-positive hypothalamic neurons in the brains of MS patients stained positive\n      for the vitamin D receptor (VDR) and 1,25(OH)2D-24-hydroxylase (24-OHase). (smolders et al.\n      J Neuropathol Exp Neurol 2013;72(2):91-105) 2) Vitamin D affects T cell cytokine profile and\n      hereby the odds of developing depression. Also in non-MS depressed patients increased levels\n      of pro-inflammatory cytokines are detected (Maes et al. Metab Brain Dis 2009; 24: 27-53).\n      Vitamin D3 has shown to be a potent promotor of T cell regulation both in vitro and in vivo.\n      (Smolders et al. J Neuroimmunol 2008;194:7-17 and Smolders et al. PLoS One 2010;5:e15235)\n      The main goal of this study is to assess whether supplementation of high doses vitamin D3\n      results in a suppression of saliva cortisol day-curves in subjects with multiple sclerosis,\n      and we will explore whether the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of T lymphocytes is\n      regulated."
