      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate if a negative-pressure dressing placed
      over a surgical incision can reduce the risk of developing a surgical site infection
      compared to a commonly-used sterile gauze incision dressing. In this study, the
      negative-pressure dressing will be compared to a standard post-surgical sterile gauze
      dressing. In this study patients will either receive a negative-pressure dressing or a
      standard sterile gauze dressing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether negative pressure therapy applied to closed laparotomy incisions can
      decrease the incidence of incisional surgical site infections in patients undergoing
      clean-contaminated resections for colorectal, pancreatic, and peritoneal surface
      malignancies compared to standard post-operative sterile gauze dressings.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive standard sterile dressing (SSD) over their closed laparotomy
      incision at the conclusion of their surgery.

      ARM II: Patients receive negative pressure therapy (NPT) dressing over their closed
      laparotomy incision at the conclusion of their surgery.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Surgical resection for a colorectal, pancreatic, or peritoneal surface malignancy

          -  The scheduled procedure will be performed via midline laparotomy

          -  The planned procedure is a clean-contaminated (class II) case (includes gastric,
             small bowel, and colorectal resections, as well as bile or pancreatic duct
             transections)

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document
             (either directly or via a legally authorized representative)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Emergent cases will not be included in the study

          -  Pregnant patients will not be included in the study as pregnancy is a relative
             contraindication for these types of surgical procedures

          -  Clean (class I), contaminated (class III) and dirty (class IV) procedures will
             likewise be excluded

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive medications, including steroids, within the
             past three months

          -  Patients with a history of skin allergy to iodine or adhesive drapes

          -  The planned procedure involves foreign material (such as mesh or subcutaneous drains)
             being left in the subcutaneous space at the time of surgery (for example, a ventral
             hernia repair); surgical drains that are placed to drain an intraabdominal space and
             exit the abdominal wall remote from the incision are allowed in the study
