If these smallest infants\n      suffer in addition to prematurity a second hit, such as intraventricular hemorrhage or\n      parenchymal infarction, they are at high risk for learning disabilities, mental retardation,\n      and cerebral palsy in later life.\n\n      Intraventricular hemorrhage and parenchymal infarction occur in about 12% of very preterm\n      infants, mostly in the very smallest and within the first few days after birth, and can be\n      recorded by cranial ultrasound. Except for shunt insertion to divert cerebrospinal fluid in\n      infants with posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus and possibly the removal of blood clots, there is\n      no treatment for established intracerebral bleeding, and no medical therapies exist to\n      ameliorate the neurodevelopmental sequelae.\n\n      Apart from stimulating production of red blood cells in the bone marrow, recombinant human\n      erythropoietin (Epo) has been shown to exert neuroprotective action in a variety of animal\n      models and in clinical studies. Epo administration has been found to be beneficial and safe\n      in randomized controlled trials (RCT) involving adult and infant patients.\n\n      Observational data suggest that Epo administered to very preterm infants in order to prevent\n      from anemia improves long-term cognitive outcomes until school-age especially in those\n      infants who had suffered intracerebral bleeding. These data, however, are observational and\n      therefore do not allow for any firm conclusions or recommendations. The hypothesis generated\n      by these data calls for confirmation or refutation by an RCT designed to address this\n      question."
