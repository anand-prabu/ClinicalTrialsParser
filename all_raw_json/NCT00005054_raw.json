II. Assess the\n      extent of ATase depletion and DNA methylation in the peripheral blood of these patients\n      undergoing this regimen and investigate the relationship between these parameters and tumor\n      response.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral temozolomide every 4 hours for a total of 5 doses. Treatment\n      continues every 28 days for a minimum of 2 courses and a maximum of 1 year in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are followed at 30 days, and then\n      every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
