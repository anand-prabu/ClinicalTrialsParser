The ability of\n      the device to reduce pain, increase mobility, increase range of motion and muscle strength\n      of the affected leg, and improve quality of life in patients with knee osteoarthritis will\n      be evaluated.\n\n      While the use of ultrasound to treat pain is established in the field, the ability to\n      deliver low intensity, therapeutic ultrasound on a daily basis is new. The use of a wearable\n      ultrasound device to deliver daily, low intensity, long duration ultrasound has been\n      approved by the FDA for pain relief, relief of joint contracture, relief of muscle spasm,\n      and increased circulation; however, it is not yet indicated for relief of knee\n      osteoarthritis. The interventional device in this study is self-applied by the patient and\n      worn daily for 4 hours of continuous therapy."

The device, Sam\u00ae has been FDA-cleared for use. For the first two weeks of\n      the study, baseline data will be collected as patients report pain scores (VAS) and an\n      actigraph worn by the patient digitally records mobility data. During the following 6 weeks,\n      patients will self-apply the wearable low intensity ultrasound device to their affected knee\n      for 4 hours daily. Each day of the study, pain scores (VAS) and mobility data (actigraph)\n      will be recorded. A quality of life assessment (WOMAC), muscle strength and range of motion\n      assessment (JTech) will be performed prior to the patient beginning the protocol and at the\n      conclusion of the protocol.\n\n      80 subjects will be recruited from neighboring communities to the study site. The study is\n      designed to reach a target patient population which includes rural citizens and\n      socioeconomic disadvantaged individuals where non-pharmacotherapies do not exist to manage\n      pain. Subjects will be randomly assigned to active (60%) and placebo groups (40%). The\n      sponsor and investigators are blinded as to which type of device each patient is assigned.\n\n      The study will be monitored by an external monitor and a data safety monitoring board\n      (DSMB)."
