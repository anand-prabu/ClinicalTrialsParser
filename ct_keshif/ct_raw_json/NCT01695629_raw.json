Therefore, our goal is to develop a non-invasive diagnostic\n      protocol as a quantitative tool for the evaluation of DPN. The protocol and the tool we seek\n      to develop could ultimately be used in large-scale clinical trials and in clinical practice\n      to assess DPN severity and progression.\n\n      We hypothesize that in vivo confocal imaging of the corneal nerve layer is a clinically\n      viable method to assess and quantify systemic peripheral nerve health. We emphasize that\n      this imaging method can be used in both humans and animal models to provide quantifiable,\n      longitudinal data on the same live individual to advance our understanding of the\n      development and progression of DPN, and to evaluate treatment effectiveness."
