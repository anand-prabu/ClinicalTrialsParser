  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to investigate the potential efficacy of exogenous
      progesterone (with supplemental relapse prevention counseling) on postpartum relapse in new
      mothers.  Also to determine the feasibility of enhanced compliance monitoring and
      identification of collateral factors effecting outcomes.

    <textblock>
      Pregnant women will be recruited at gestational weeks 33-36 who have quit smoking during
      pregnancy and are motivated to maintain abstinence after delivery.  At the time of delivery,
      women will be randomly assigned to receive 4 weeks of active or placebo exogenous
      progesterone starting on the 4th day postpartum.  Participants will be in contact with study
      staff either by phone or clinic visits until 12 weeks postpartum to collect data on smoking
      status and protocol compliance, measure serum progesterone levels and receive behavioral
      counseling.

    <description>Defined by continuous abstinence (CA) and prolonged abstinence (PA). CA defined as a single puff of a cigarette as a relapse. PA measure reflects sustained abstinence and defines relapse as seven consecutive slip (e.g., a puff or more) without a 24 hours period between any slip.</description>

    <description>This is a questionnaire assessing participant expectations, satisfaction and study protocol, study medication and electronic data capture. It contains 10 scaled items adapted from a published instrument; all questions are answered with a four-point Likert-type scale. The score of the feasibility questionnaire will be determined by computing a sum, yielding an acceptability score.</description>
