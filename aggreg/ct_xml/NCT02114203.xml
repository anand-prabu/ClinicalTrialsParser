  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of  an investigational drug, PF-04447943, in subjects with stable sickle
      cell disease with and without co-administration with hydroxyurea.  This study will also aid
      in selecting the  doses for future studies and evaluation of substances in the blood which
      may help access the effectiveness of the drug.

             arrhythmia

          -  Systemic therapy with any of the following medications that are strong or moderate

             inducers within 28 days prior to the first dose of the trial medication, or during
             the trial.

          -  Use  of  PDE5 inhibitors within 7 days  prior to the first dose of the trial
             medication, or at any time during the trial.

          -  Creatinine clearance &lt;30ml/min.

          -  Hemoglobin level &lt;5 gm/dL.

          -  Alanine transaminase (ALT/SGPT) and Aspartate aminotransferase (AST/SGOT)  &gt;2x upper

          -  Any condition possibly affecting drug absorption (eg, gastrectomy).

          -  A positive urine drug screen for illicit drug.

          -  History of regular alcohol consumption exceeding 7 drinks/week for females or 14
             drinks/week for males (1 drink = 5 ounces (150 mL) of wine or 12 ounces (360 mL) of
             beer or 1.5 ounces (45 mL) of hard liquor) within 6 months of Screening.

          -  Treatment with an investigational drug within 3 months (or as determined by the local
             requirement, whichever is longer) or 5 half-lives preceding the first dose of study
             medication.

          -  12-lead ECG demonstrating QTc &gt;450 or a QRS interval &gt;120 msec msec at Screening.

          -  Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
