    <textblock>
      Hypothesis:  Exercise will reduce morbidity and mortality rates in an elderly population.
      The extent of reduction will be intensity dependent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Literature lacks large controlled randomized studies that look at the effect of exercise
      training on morbidity and mortality.  Generation 100 will be the first randomized,
      controlled clinical study where the primary objective is to study the effects of exercise
      training on morbidity and mortality in the elderly.  Furthermore, the researchers will
      investigate  whether there is a relationship between the exercise intensity and health
      benefits, with particular focus on major health problems in the elderly population.  In
      addition to being a study, this is also an initiative to improve public health in all
      healthy individuals between 70-75 years of age in the Trondheim municipality.  The
      participants will either be randomized to supervised exercise or follow current guidelines
      for physical activity on their own.  Clinical examinations, as well as questionnaires, will
      be administered to all participants at baseline, after one year, after three years, and
      after five years.  Additionally, participants will be followed-up by linking to relevant
      registers for up to 20 years.

      Also data will be collected with the purposes of (a) investigating genetic predisposition
      for fitness and cardiovascular diseases, and (b) identification of potential targets for
      therapies.

      The study seeks to determine if exercise training gives the seniors a longer active and
      healthy life.
