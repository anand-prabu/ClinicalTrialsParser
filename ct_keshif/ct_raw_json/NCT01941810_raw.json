To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the baseline lipid peroxidation\n      byproducts in saliva in cancer patients as measured by the thiobarbituric acid reactive\n      substances (TBARs) assay.\n\n      II. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on the ability of cancer patients to\n      generate increased lipid peroxidation byproducts when challenged with a weak iron-containing\n      solution.\n\n      III. To assess the impact of lactoferrin supplementation on self-reported general quality of\n      life and on specific self-reported anorexia/cachexia issues in cancer patients with\n      established chemotherapy-induced taste disturbances.\n\n      IV. To assess the incidence of vitamin D deficiency in cancer patients with chemotherapy\n      induced taste changes.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive bovine lactoferrin supplement orally (PO) three times daily (TID) for 1\n      month.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2 weeks and 1 month."
