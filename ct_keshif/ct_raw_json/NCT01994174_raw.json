The underlying hypothesis is that anti-VEGF drugs increase intraocular\n      pressure (IOP) by increasing aqueous inflow, decreasing uveoscleral outflow or both. The\n      specific aim is to evaluate the changes produced in AHD after 3 monthly injections of anti\n      VEGF agents."

            "textblock": "Intravitreal injection of different anti-VEGF agents such as bevacizumab (Avastin\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,\n      Genentech, Inc., South San Francisco, CA, USA) ranibizumab (Lucentis\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd; Genentech, Inc.,\n      South San Francisco, CA, USA) and aflibercept (Eylea\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd, Regeneron, Tarrytown, NY, USA) has\n      been a widely common practice for treatment of choroidal neovascularization and retinal\n      vascular diseases [1]. Several ocular and systemic adverse events have been reported with\n      the use of anti-VEGF agents [7]. Elevation of intraocular pressure (IOP) is a serious ocular\n      adverse event that may be associated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. IOP\n      elevation with anti-VEGF injection may have variable presentation ranging from acute\n      transient post injection elevation to the development of persistent IOP elevation that\n      mandates pressure lowering therapy[8].\n\n      Patients with previously existing glaucoma may have a higher rate of persistent IOP\n      elevation associated with intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents. Good et al, reported\n      the rate of persistent IOP elevation after intravitreal anti-VEGF tobe 33% in glaucoma\n      patients versus 3.1% in eyes without previous diagnosis ofglaucoma [9]. Tseng et al,\n      reported 25 eyes with sustained elevation of IOP after serial intravitreal injections of\n      anti-VEGF agents (mean = 20injections). All the 25 eyes were normotensive prior to the study\n      and 23 of them were not previously diagnosed with glaucoma[10].\n\n      Multicenter clinical trials that studied the intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents,\n      such as MARINA and ANCHOR for ranibizumab, VISION for pegaptanib and PACORES for\n      bevacizumab, did not show sustained IOP elevation with the intravitreal injection of the\n      study agents [12-15]. However, a subgroup analysis of the data of MARINA and ANCHOR trials\n      showed at least 6 mm Hg increase of IOP from baseline in 2.1% of eyes in MARINA trial and\n      3.6% of eyes in ANCHOR trial [16]. A retrospective chart review of 207 patients over a\n      6-months follow up period after serial intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF reported an IOP\n      elevation greater than 5 mm Hg in 2 consecutive visits compared to baseline in 11.6% of the\n      treated eyes versus 5.3% in control eyes [17].\n\n      The pathophysiology of the reported IOP elevation associated with intravitreal injection of\n      anti-VEGF is unknown. Anti-VEGF compounds might increase aqueous humor inflow by the\n      breakdown of the blood-aqueous barrier or reduce uveoscleral outflow by the ciliary body\n      vasculature. These potential changes could translate into elevated IOP and glaucoma."
