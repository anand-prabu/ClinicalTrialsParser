This 11-day on-site period is repeated three times so that\n      all subjects are dosed under all conditions. Each period is separated by 7 days off site.\n\n      Subjects return for an End of Study Visit (ESV) at least 7 days after the last 11 day\n      on-site period, or after withdrawal.\n\n      On Day 1 of each of 3 periods, subjects are given a single dose of EC905 under three\n      conditions (high fat breakfast, low fat breakfast and fasting) in order to evaluate the\n      effect of food on the PK of solifenacin and tamsulosin HCl. The aim is to show the absence\n      of a food effect after a low fat breakfast vs. fasting conditions, and to evaluate the food\n      effect after a high fat breakfast vs. fasting conditions.\n\n      Subjects are randomized to one of 6 possible sequences of fasted or fed conditions.\n\n      Screening takes place from Day -21 to Day -1. They are admitted to the clinic on Day -1.\n      Blood sampling for PK assessment is performed from Day 1 to Day 11 of each period. This 11\n      day on-site period is repeated three times in order to allow all subjects to be dosed under\n      fed (low and high fat) and fasting conditions.\n\n      The 11 day on-site periods are separated by 7-day off site periods; subjects are checked for\n      eligibility again one day prior to the start of a new dosing day.\n\n      Safety assessments are performed throughout the investigational period.
