In the PLATO trial, it\n      was found to be superior to clopidogrel with respect to cardiovascular outcomes and total\n      mortality without increasing the risk of bleedings.\n\n      More potent and reversible receptor bindings are possible explanation for the superior\n      outcomes. Beside the potent effect on inhibition of antiplatelet function, ticagrelor has\n      previously been demonstrated to increase adenosine levels by inhibiting adenosine re-uptake\n      in tissue level and can induce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) release from human red cells,\n      which both stimulate vasodilation of  in red blood cells."
