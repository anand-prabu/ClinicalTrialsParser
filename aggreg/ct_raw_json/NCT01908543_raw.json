            "textblock": "Managing iron deficiency is important for more than 1 billion individuals worldwide, to\n      avoid blood transfusions, or excessive strain on vital organs that depend on iron-containing\n      haemoglobin to deliver oxygen to the tissues. Iron deficiency is a particular problem for\n      people with the inherited condition hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT).  Their\n      iron deficiency and anaemia results from blood losses, especially from the nose (nosebleeds,\n      and they often need additional iron to replace that lost through bleeding.\n\n      Our goal is to stratify HHT patients into high/low absorbers of iron; to define what extra\n      iron they need to adjust for their current and likely future blood losses; and to work out\n      how to achieve  this most safely for each individual to improve their later health.\n\n      We will test the hypothesis that informed assessment of iron intake and post absorption\n      cellular profiles changes the recommendations for iron intake for HHT patients."
