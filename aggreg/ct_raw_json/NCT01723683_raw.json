            "textblock": "Background. Reducing incidence of pneumothorax, PIE and the combined outcome of death or BPD\n      has been achieved since the development of Surfactant therapy. It is also approved that\n      initial stabilization with CPAP and rescue surfactant administration, if necessary, resulted\n      in less ventilator days and a trend towards lower risk of CLD. However, the number of\n      infants who are started on CPAP but ultimately require intubation for the administration of\n      surfactant within the first 72 hours remains high in the very preterm infants. Usually CPAP\n      failure is due to unremitting RDS requiring surfactant therapy. Outcomes in the infants with\n      CPAP as a whole could be improved further if the subgroup of infants showing early signs of\n      surfactant deficiency was to receive an early dose of surfactant.\n\n      Objective. This study intents to develop a method of minimally invasive surfactant therapy\n      followed by early CPAP (MISTCPAP) in preterm Infants with high risk of RDS for improving the\n      outcomes and reducing the incidence of BPD.  We propose a prospective randomized controlled\n      trial to compare the MISTCPAP technique with the INSURE technique of surfactant\n      administration, which involves intubation solely for the purpose of surfactant\n      administration followed by immediate extubation to CPAP. The outcome of this trial could\n      declare the effect of the intubation and positive pressure ventilation on the effectiveness\n      of surfactant therapy.\n\n      Methods. This study will be approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of CMUH.Very\n      preterm infants (GA < 32 wks) admitted to NICU at CMUH from 1 February 2012 to 31 January\n      2013 are enrolled for the study. Infants who stayed in the hospital for less than 10 days or\n      those admitted after 24 hours of birth or with major congenital malformations will be\n      excluded. Eligible infants will be randomized to allocate to the 2 groups after birth using\n      simple randomization with sealed nontransparent envelopes after parental consent has been\n      obtained. MISTCPAP group: The 16Gz 13 cm length Angio-Cath is used and marked at a point\n      comparable to the level of infant's lip (weight in Kg + 6 cm as the routine ETT intubation)\n      to give the operator mark to secure the Angio-Cath during the procedure and prevent it from\n      going too far in or out of the trachea. The infant will be kept supine with upper part of\n      body raised about 30 degree, an oro-gastric (OG) tube should be inserted,and the infant\n      should not receive sedation. The CPAP may be removed transiently and the oxygen cannula or\n      O2 flow over face may be given as indicated by saturation monitoring during the procedure.\n      After inserting the Angio-Cath, the laryngoscope should be removed after stabilizing the\n      Catheter with 2 fingers. Surfactant (Survanta\u00a9, Abbott, USA) 100 mg/kgBW, equivalent to 4\n      ml/kgBW per dose will be drawn to a 10 ml syringe and should be instillated via the\n      Angio-Cath. Prior to the beginning of the clinical trial, every neonatal fellows should be\n      trained to familiar the procedure under the supervision of the PI (BH Su), and the average\n      duration of procedure has been achieved in the range of 1-3 minutes. All the vital signs,\n      including Heart Rate, Respiratory Rate,Oxygen Saturation (SpO2) and FiO2 (Fraction of\n      Inspired Oxygen) requirements should be monitored. After the procedure of surfactant\n      instillation, the Angio-Cath should be removed and the nCPAP should be resumed with CPAP\n      level keep constant at 5 cmH2O. The oro-gastric (OG) tube should be draw to check if any\n      surfactant was instillated or reflexed back to the stomach. As to the INSURE group, the\n      procedure should be according to the conventional surfactant treatment which involves\n      intubation, surfactant(Survanta\u00a9, Abbott, USA) 100 mg/kgBW, equivalent to 4 ml/kgBW divided\n      to 4 liquors to inject into 4 positions followed by amubagging and then extubation to CPAP.\n      The clinical course in NICU of all studied infants, including intraventricular hemorrhage\n      (IVH), retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), duration of ventilation, duration of hospital stay,\n      infection, duration of oxygen requirement and BPD should be recorded."
