We will enroll 10 alcohol dependent individuals in a\n      placebo-controlled randomized pilot safety trial of IVM (30 mg orally once) over a 2-day\n      (1-night) inpatient stay at the UCLA CTRC and employ a well-characterized battery of\n      behavioral paradigms (i.e., alcohol administration and cue exposure). The goals of the study\n      are to test: (a) the safety of combining IVM, at a dose currently shown to be safe in humans\n      (30 mg), with moderate doses of alcohol (0.08 g/dl); and (b) whether IVM reduces the\n      reinforcing effects of alcohol during alcohol administration and whether it reduces alcohol\n      craving during cue exposure, as compared to placebo."
