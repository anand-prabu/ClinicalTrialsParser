Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve complete remission (CR) receive 2\n      additional courses past CR.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating dose levels of cladribine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 15 patients will be accrued for this study."
