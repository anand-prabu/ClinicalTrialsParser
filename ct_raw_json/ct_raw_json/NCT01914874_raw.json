An exploratory\n      aim of the study is to evaluate the effects of the mindfulness intervention on biological\n      markers of stress reactivity, including salivary cortisoland salivary alpha-amylase. The\n      study is a two-arm, parallel design, prospective study comparing 12 weekly sessions of\n      MIND-SAD delivered in a group format versus a wait-list control (WLC)."
