        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Availability for the entire study period and willingness to adhere to the protocol

             before day 1 of this study

          -  The informed consent form must be signed by all volunteers, prior to their

             conditions known to interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or
             excretion of drugs or known to potentiate or predispose to undesired effects

          -  History of significant gastrointestinal, liver or kidney disease that may affect drug
             bioavailability

          -  Presence or history of significant cardiovascular, pulmonary, hematologic,
             neurologic, psychiatric, endocrine, immunologic, dermatologic or connective tissue

          -  Any clinically significant illness in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study

          -  Use of any enzyme-modifying drugs, including strong inhibitors of cytochrome P450
             (CYP) enzymes (such as cimetidine, fluoxetine, quinidine, erythromycin,
             ciprofloxacin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, diltiazem and HIV antivirals) and strong
             inducers of CYP enzymes (such as barbiturates, carbamazepine, glucocorticoids,
             phenytoin and rifampin), in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study

          -  Volunteers who took an Investigational Product  (in another clinical trial) or
             donated 50 mL or more of blood  in the previous 28 days before day 1 of this study

          -  Poor motivation, intellectual problems likely to limit the validity of consent to
             participate in the study or limit the ability to comply with the protocol
             requirements or inability to cooperate adequately, inability to understand and to
             observe the instructions of the physician

          -  Donation of 500 mL or more of blood (Canadian Blood Services, Hema-Quebec, clinical
             studies, etc.) in the previous 56 days before day 1 of this study
