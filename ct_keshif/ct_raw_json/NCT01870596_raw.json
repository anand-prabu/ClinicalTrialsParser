Drugs used in chemotherapy,\n      such as cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by\n      killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. SCH 900776 may stop the growth of cancer\n      cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It is not yet known whether\n      cytarabine is more effective with or without SCH 900776 in treating acute myeloid leukemia."
