This can attribute to prolonged admission, prolonged mechanical ventilation,\n      increased mortality and might have a negative impact on the physical function, degree of\n      independence and quality of life. The pathophysiological background for the loss of muscle\n      mass as well as possible effective treatment is still not well established. In the\n      NONSEDA-trial we randomise critically ill patients to non-sedation or sedation with a daily\n      wake-up trial during mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU). It has never\n      been assessed whether non-sedation reduces the loss of muscle mass and strength.\n\n      Aim: To assess the effects of non-sedation versus sedation with a daily wake-up trial on\n      physical function after discharge from ICU.\n\n      Hypothesis: that non-sedation during ventilator-treatment will improve the physical function\n      after ICU-discharge, compared with standard treatment of sedation with a daily wake-up."
