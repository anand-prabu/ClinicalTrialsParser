  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess whether the antidepressant effect from intravenous
      (IV) ketamine treatment can be maintained by minocycline compared to placebo after IV
      ketamine treatment is stopped.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a placebo-controlled (i.e., an inactive substance that is compared with a drug to
      test whether the drug has a real effect in a clinical trial), double-blind (neither
      physician nor patient knows the treatment that the patient receives) randomized (the drug is
      assigned by chance) study in patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar
      Disorder Type II. The study is designed to assess whether the antidepressant response to
      treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine can be maintained by treatment with minocycline in
      patients with MDD and  Bipolar Depression Type II (compared to placebo). Both hospitalized
      patients as well as patients being treated as an outpatient for their current episode of
      depression can qualify for participation in this study. The study has four sequential
      phases: if eligibility for the study has been confirmed during the 21-day screening phase,
      the patients will enter a 12-day open-label (ie, patient and physician know the intervention
      that is being administered) treatment phase during which the patient will receive 6
      open-label IV infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine on Day 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12 in combination
      with open-label minocycline, orally administered twice daily. All patients will remain at
      the study site for at least 4 hours after the IV ketamine administrations. Response to
      treatment will be assessed using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) which
      is designed to measure the overall severity of depressive symptoms. Patients responding to
      ketamine/minocycline treatment will be randomized to receive minocycline or placebo for 6
      weeks during a 6-week blinded treatment phase or until relapse. A patient will be defined as
      a &quot;ketamine responder&quot; if there is a 50% or more decrease in comparison to baseline values
      (Day 1 predose) in the MADRS total score performed at 3 to 4 hours postdose on Days 8, 10,
      or 12, with a 40% or  more decrease from baseline in the MADRS total score on Day 12.
      Patients not responding to treatment with ketamine/minocycline will be given the option to
      receive 100 mg minocycline twice daily as open-label treatment for a maximum of 6 weeks. The
      patients (both responders and non-responders) will have weekly visits following last dose of
      ketamine until Day 54 (responders/non-responders) or until relapse (responders) whichever
      comes first, to determine the duration of the antidepressant effect and to assess safety and
      tolerability after completion of treatment.  Upon completion of the study (Day 54) or at
      time of relapse all patients will have an end-of-study visit. All patients can return to
      standard of care treatment at the end of the study. The total study duration for each
      patient will be maximally 11 weeks.
