            "textblock": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of our most common chronic joint disorders. The World Health\n      Organization (WHO) has estimated that every second woman and every fourth man over the age\n      of 60 suffer some form of OA. OA is most common in hands, knee, hip and back. OA is a\n      rheumatic disorder which affects the whole joint and may start as early as in the age of 30.\n      The main symptoms are pain, stiffness and decreased quality of life.\n\n      The primary goals of OA management are to reduce the symptoms. Patient education and\n      exercises are recommended as basic treatment according to national as well as international\n      guidelines.\n\n      It is known that the level of physical activity decreases with age and that woman are less\n      physical active than men. A study of healthy women older than 56 years showed that the level\n      of activity decreased by 10 minutes per year, for every five year increase in age. OA is\n      more common in women and is an irreversible disease, which means that the proportion of\n      older women with osteoarthritis is large.\n\n      In addition OA is the most common cause of inactivity among the elderly and many fear that\n      activity will further damage the joints. Inactivity is a large risk factor for poor physical\n      and psychological health as well as premature death. Level of physical activity in people\n      with OA has mainly been evaluated by self-assessment questionnaires. People with hip OA are\n      more active than people with knee OA and the correlation between the degree of radiographic\n      changes and physical activity is weak. Only 30% with early OA of the knee in the age group\n      35-65 years meet the recommendations for physical activity performed at least 30 minutes per\n      day of moderate intensity, five days per week, measured by an accelerometer.\n\n      The primary aim of this study is to determine the effects of structured information and\n      individually adapted exercises, delivered as a supported self-management osteoarthritis\n      program, on overall levels of physical activity of moderate and vigorous intensity in\n      patients with hip or knee OA. The secondary aim is to compare the level of physical activity\n      in patients with hip and knee OA.\n\n      Supported self-management program for patients with osteoarthritis has been studied before\n      and it's shown that it improves the quality of life, the physical function and decrease\n      pain. No studies have investigated the effect of supported self-management on the level of\n      physical activity.\n\n      This is an observational study with control group. Assessments are made at baseline and at 3\n      and 12 month after the supported self-management course.\n\n      The self-management program comprise three theoretical sessions, each of about 90 minutes,\n      led by a physical therapist and held as group sessions with about 10 participants in each\n      group. On the third session an osteoarthritis communicator participates. That is a person\n      with osteoarthritis who communicate the lifestyle changes  he/she have done to live a good\n      life with OA.  After the theoretical part the patients are offered an individually adapted\n      exercise program, and the opportunity to practice this program together with others under\n      supervision of a physical therapist twice per week for 6 weeks. Patients are also encouraged\n      to find one or two exercises to perform continuously as home exercises. During the program\n      home exercise and other alternatives as changing activity, using walking sticks, pain\n      management ect  are introduced in order to maintain the level of physical activity over an\n      extended period of time. The importance of being physically active for a long time is\n      accentuated in all aspects of the patient education. The primary aim of the supported\n      self-management program is to increase the level of physical activity and empower patients\n      to manage their disease, avoid illness and live a good life despite osteoarthritis.\n\n      Physical activity is measured with an accelerometer at baseline, 3 month and 12 month. We\n      will also study the correlation between objectivity measured physical activity with physical\n      activity questionnaire (UCLA), quality of life (EQ-5D), pain (VAS 0-100) and comorbidity.\n\n      All subjects in our study are also registered in a Swedish national quality register called\n      Better management of patients with osteoarthritis (BOA). Some of the data used in the\n      present study are collected from the register."
