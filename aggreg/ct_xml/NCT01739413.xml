  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epidural anesthesia has been found to manipulate the hyperglycemic response to surgery. It
      is unclear, however, whether the preoperative metabolic status of the surgical patient plays
      a role in the degree of this hyperglycemic response. For instance, the presence of low
      insulin sensitivity before surgery could predispose the individual to an altered metabolic
      response after surgery. In this case, it would be appropriate to identify adequate
      interventions that attenuate the response to surgical stress and facilitate the recovery
      process.

      The aims of this research projects are the following:

        1. To determine the extent in which epidural local anesthetics, initiated before surgery
           and continued after surgery, improves insulin secretion in patients with preoperative
           low insulin sensitivity.

        2. To understand  which measures of postoperative recovery are sensitive to the
           restoration of insulin secretion in this particular group of patients

    <description>The Hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp is the gold standard for measuring insulin sensitivity. Patients receive a 2 hour infusion of glucose and insulin, which is adjusted throughout the study period in order to maintain a blood glucose concentration at 5.5mmol/L. The test will take place one week before surgery and on the second postoperative day.</description>
