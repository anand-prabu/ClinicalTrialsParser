This study looked at the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic\n      properties (how the drug moves throughout the body) of the drug and safety (lab results and\n      side effects) in people who took TAK-438.\n\n      This study was designed to consist of 4 sequential substudies: a single rising dose study\n      (Cohorts 1 to 7), a food-effect study (Cohort 8), a multiple rising dose study (Cohorts 9 to\n      11), and a Japanese bridging study (Cohort 12). However, the protocol was halted during the\n      food effect study (Cohort 8) following the discovery of previously unidentified metabolites\n      and as a result, the multiple rising dose (Cohorts 9-11) and ethnicity (Cohort 12) studies\n      were not carried out.\n\n      The study population for each of Cohorts 1 to 7 consisted of 9 subjects; with 6 subjects\n      randomized to receive a single dose of TAK-438, and 3 subjects to receive placebo. Subjects\n      in Cohorts 1 to 7 received a single dose of study drug after a 10-hour fast. The starting\n      dose was 1 mg followed by administrations of 5, 10, 20, 15, 40, and 30 mg.\n\n      In Cohort 8 the plan was to assign 12 participants in a 2-sequence, 2-period crossover\n      design. Six participants were to receive a single dose of TAK-438 on Day 1, in the fasted\n      state, followed by a second single dose of TAK-438 on Day 15 in the alternative fed state.\n      The other 6 participants were to receive the study drug like-wise but in the fed then fasted\n      state.\n\n      To investigate the effect of multiple dosing, a further 3 cohorts (Cohorts 9-11), each\n      comprising 12 participants were to be introduced to the protocol following completion of the\n      single rising dose study. A final cohort, Cohort 12, consisting of 24 Western participants\n      and 24 Japanese participants was to be used to assess the effect of TAK-438 and esomeprazole\n      on the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and pH of the stomach between these 2 ethnic\n      groups.\n\n      This single-centre trial was conducted in the United Kingdom."
