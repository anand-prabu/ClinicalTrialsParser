In the elderly with\n      considerable medical burden, a relatively new non-invasive valve replacement technique\n      called Transcatheter Aortic Valve Implantation (TAVI) can be used instead of open-heart\n      surgery. However, long term changes in cognition after TAVI remain unclear and previous\n      studies have suggested an increased risk of cognitive decline in patients following the\n      surgical procedure. In this pilot study, the investigators will characterize changes in\n      cognition, physical capacity, overall quality of life and neuropsychiatric symptoms\n      (depression and apathy) over 6 months after TAVI."
