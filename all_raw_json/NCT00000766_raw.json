Patients in whom the\n      retinitis continues to progress or who are intolerant of the initial treatment switch to the\n      alternative drug for further cycles of induction and maintenance. Patients on the\n      combination arm in whom retinitis continues to progress are given further cycles of the\n      combination at an increased dose, or, if one drug is causing toxicity, are given further\n      cycles with the alternative drug.
