Results from\n      genetic studies reveal one pathway associated with susceptibility to ASDs, which includes\n      synaptic cell adhesion molecules. Among the factors that could modulate this pathway are the\n      genes controlling circadian rhythms. Sleep disorders and low melatonin levels are frequently\n      observed in ASDs. Thus investigator will characterize the circadian rhythms of patients with\n      ASD and search for circadian rhythms genes polymorphisms."
