            "textblock": "We are studying new ways to look for abnormal areas/tissues of the colon during a\n      colonoscopy. The current scopes used for colonoscopies are very good.  But if the area\n      doesn't look different to the naked eye, then the scope can't improve on that.  We are using\n      special stains or dyes and special scopes to see abnormal areas that are hard to see with\n      the naked eye.  The stain or dye is \"fluorescent\", meaning it glows when special light is\n      used in the colonoscopy scope.\n\n      You are being asked to let us spray a peptide with a fluorescent tag onto your colon.\n      Peptides are small chains of amino acids (the building blocks that make up proteins) linked\n      together.  The peptide we use has 7 amino acids attached to a fluorescent tag (\"FIT C\" or\n      Fluoresceinisothiocyanate).   FITC is used by eye doctors to examine your eyes (the yellow\n      eye drops).\n\n      We are testing this \"fluorescent peptide\" to see if it will stick if there are any abnormal\n      areas. If the peptide \"sticks\", it will \"glow\" when a special light in the scope is used.\n      In this study, we will apply the  fluorescent peptide to your colon by using a spray tube\n      that fits in the colonoscope.\n\n      This is a phase IB study.  This means that although we have applied the peptide to 25 people\n      in our first research study, we still need to learn more about \"fluorescent peptide\" in\n      people.  The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved this agent, but is allowing\n      us to test it in this study.  The main goal of this study is to see if the peptide \"glows\"\n      well and if we can take pictures of areas that do glow.\n\n      This is a research study of the peptide and our ability to see it \"glow or fluoresce\".\n      Being in this study and applying the peptide won't change how our biopsies are taken or how\n      your colonoscopy is done."

Your doctor will select one area to apply the peptide in your colon.  The peptide comes in a single-use sealed vial from the investigational pharmacy.  Sterile saline (salt-water) is added to the vial.  The powder is mixed well and pulled into a syringe.  The peptide is then \"injected\" into a special, single-use \"sprayer\", like a garden hose, that fits down the endoscope channel.  The peptide will be sprayed in your colon.  This is part of the study.\nThe endoscopist will take pictures of the area before and after the peptide spraying.  They will use the camera that is part of the colonoscope.\nWe will obtain copies of your endoscopy report and  any pathology reports.",
