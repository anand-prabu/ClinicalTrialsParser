Bone marrow\n      mononuclear cells have been proved to have multiple functions including the differentiation\n      and proliferation. In animal model, bone marrow mononuclear cells could induce angiogenesis\n      and may have therapeutic usage for ischemia disease. The investigators thereby design the\n      study to investigate the possible therapy of diabetic lower limb ischemia with autologous\n      bone marrow mononuclear cells. Patient with diabetic lower limb ischemia was treated with\n      colony stimulating factor for improvement of bone marrow hematopoiesis. Then bone marrow was\n      taken and mononuclear cells were isolated with deleting erythrocyte by density gradient\n      centrifugation. Bone marrow mononuclear cells were transplanted into ischemia regions of\n      lower limb through intramuscular injection. The investigators investigated the safety of the\n      therapy with life signs like temperature, pulse, blood pressure, routine analysis of blood\n      and urine etc. post the transplantation. And the efficacy was evaluated with the measurement\n      of ulcer size, rest pain score, cold sensation score, resting ABI, resting TcPO2, collateral\n      vessel score and skin microcirculation."
