Assess the qualitative and quantitative nature of the toxic effects encountered in this\n      treatment.\n\n      III. Estimate the tissue and tumor TOPO concentrations during radiotherapy by evaluating\n      plasma TOPO levels.\n\n      IV. Evaluate, using Western blot and immunohistochemical stain, the effects of\n      TOPO/radiotherapy on topoisomerase I levels in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL).\n\n      V. Determine whether TOPO induces apoptosis in PBL from this patient population.\n\n      VI. Examine tumor tissue pre- and post-treatment (if available) for topoisomerase I levels,\n      DNA damage, topoisomerase I/DNA complexes, and apoptotic events.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Radiosensitization plus Radiotherapy.
