  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticosteroid treatment in diabetic patients admitted for COPD exacerbation are expected to
      significantly increase hemoglobin A1C levels

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HbA1C levels were evaluated in diabetic patients with COPD exacerbation on admission to the
      hospital and 3-months later. Demographic, clinical, laboratory variables and total steroid
      dose were documented. Age- and sex-matched group of diabetic patients with COPD who were
      admitted for other reasons, were asked to participate as a control group. Mann-Whitney and
      Chi square/Fischer's exact tests were used to compare between the parameters of the two
      groups. Wilcoxon signed rank test was used to compare between HbA1C levels at baseline and 3
      months later. Multi-variate linear regression analysis was used to find predictors for
      increase in HbA1C levels in the patients' group.
