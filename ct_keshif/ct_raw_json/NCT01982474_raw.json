            "textblock": "Specific immunotherapy (SIT) has been used in the treatment of allergic disease for over one\n      hundred years. SIT for environmental allergies consists of allergen extracts that have been\n      traditionally administered by subcutaneous or sublingual routes to both children and adults.\n      In the United States, subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) is currently the only FDA-approved\n      route of administration for allergenic extracts. In recent years, a novel method of\n      administering allergen immunotherapy, intralymphatic immunotherapy (ILIT), has been\n      developed, which has shown to be safer, more efficacious, and less painful than traditional\n      SCIT. ILIT can dramatically decrease treatment time from 3 - 5 years to 8 weeks.  It has\n      only been studied in European adults. The aim of this project is to study efficacy and\n      safety of intralymphatic immunotherapy in adolescents and young adults with allergic\n      rhinoconjunctivitis, using currently available allergen extracts. Patients with clinical\n      history suspicious for rhinitis with or without conjunctivitis, correlating with positive\n      allergy skin and/or blood tests to grass pollen, will be randomized to either placebo\n      (normal saline) or treatment (Center-Al grass pollen extract) arms. A total of 3 injections\n      over eight weeks will be administered intralymphatically. A third arm will include an\n      observational group of grass-allergic subjects already receiving SCIT for 1 year. Primary\n      outcome will be comparison of a safety score between arms 1 and 2. We will follow adverse\n      events, as well as serum markers for Th2 and Th1 phenotypes, and objective respiratory\n      measures (spirometry and FeNO) in those with asthma. Visits will occur at baseline for\n      screening/enrollment, on day 0/week4/week 8 for injections (injection visit for arms 1 and 2\n      only), and for follow-up at 12 weeks and near end of grass pollen season.  Results could\n      help in dramatically decreasing treatment time, as well as increasing safety of allergen\n      immunotherapy."

This group was included for comparison between traditional\n             IT and ILIT, and these subjects will continue SCIT during this study.  Since patients\n             undergoing SCIT may not see clinical response to therapy until 12 months, we selected\n             this time point to better compare with the more rapid immunologic and clinical\n             changes expected with ILIT.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Significant year-round allergy symptoms and year-round symptoms without worsening\n             during grass pollen season (summer).
