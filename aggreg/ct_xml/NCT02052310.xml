  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether FG-4592 is safe and effective in the
      treatment of anemia in patients who have just begun dialysis treatment for end stage renal
      disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a screening period of up to 6 weeks, a treatment period of a minimum of 52 weeks
      and a maximum of approximately 3 years after last patient is randomized, and a
      post-treatment follow-up period of 4 weeks. A total of up to 750 patients will be randomized
      in a 1:1 ratio to receive either open-label FG-4592 or Active Control (Epoetin alfa).
