However, in endemic regions of H. pylori infection such as in East Asian countries\n      (Korea, Japan, and China), most of the aged population are have current or had past H.\n      pylori infection. Therefore, in this study, we are going to uncover whether the risk of\n      gastric neoplasm is significantly higher in the atrophy(+)/H. pylori(-) group followed by\n      atrophy(+)/H. pylori(+), atrophy(-)/H. pylori(+), and atrophy(-)/H. pylori(-) groups. In\n      addition, we are going to investigate whether those slow-growing gastric neoplasms such as\n      differentiated gastric cancers with Lauren's intestinal type and gastric adenoma are more\n      commonly developed in atrophy group following the Correa's hypothesis, whereas rapid-growing\n      gastric neoplasms such as poorly-cohesive carcinoma or undifferentiated gastric cancers with\n      Lauren's diffuse type are more commonly developed in the subjects without atrophy. Taken as\n      a whole, our study result will provide an evidence whether this biomarker strategy are\n      useful for the detection of individuals at increased risk of gastric neoplasm."
