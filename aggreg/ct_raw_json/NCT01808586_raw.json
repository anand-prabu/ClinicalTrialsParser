            "textblock": "A) Background Chronic neck pain is a significant and common issue which is difficult to\n      treat. Tight bands of muscle (trigger points) can be a source of chronic neck pain and they\n      are sometimes injected to manage chronic neck pain. However, these injections seldom lead to\n      significant, long-lasting relief. In some cases, these trigger points may originate from\n      injury or damage to a specific joint in the neck (the facet joint). Treatment of this joint\n      with cortisone injection may lead to improved pain relief and function.\n\n      B) Hypothesis By injecting the facet joint with cortisone, the pain associated with tight\n      bands of muscle in the neck and shoulders will be relieved to a greater extent than that\n      attained through trigger point injection.\n\n      C) Methods Patients with neck pain will have a test to determine if any pain originates from\n      the facet joint. Among those who have significant pain from these joints, a comparison\n      between the effect of cortisone injection into these joints versus injection into the\n      trigger points will be evaluated.\n\n      D) Expected Results and Significance\n\n      It is expected that injection with cortisone into the facet joints will lead to improved\n      pain and function when compared to that attained from trigger point injection. In addition,\n      the number of trigger points, and the pain and headache that originate from these trigger\n      points, are expected to decrease with cortisone injection into the facets to a statistically\n      and clinically significant extent.  Results from this pilot study will then influence the\n      design of future trials into chronic neck pain treatment, leading to better clinical\n      recommendations.  A peer-reviewed publication and conference presentations will facilitate\n      dissemination."
