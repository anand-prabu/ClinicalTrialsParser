Participants will monitor and record their daily desires to\n      drink, environmental circumstances in which urges occur, and drinking behavior using a palm\n      top computer.  Participants will receive naltrexone or a placebo. One week after receiving\n      medication, all participants will be asked to respond to alcohol-related cues that may or\n      may not arouse the desire to drink."
