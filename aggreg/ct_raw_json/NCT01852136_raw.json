Subjects will use the investigational (BD NEXT) PN and their usual conventional PN\n      each for one week in a randomly assigned sequence, and will be asked to evaluate and compare\n      characteristics of the BD NEXT pen needle versus their usual pen needle when used for all\n      their pen injections performed at home.

Based on their current pen needle gauge and length, subjects will\n      be assigned to the BD NEXT pen needle with the most comparable gauge (G) and length, in\n      millimeters (mm). The three possible sizes are BD NEXT 32G x 4mm pen needle, BD NEXT 31G x\n      5mm pen needle, or BD NEXT 31G x 8 mm pen needle.\n\n      Both study pen needles will be used by the subject on the same pen device/insulin brand.  If\n      subjects are using two different pens, comparison data will be collected for both pen\n      devices.\n\n      Each subject will participate in three study visits over the course of approximately 3\n      weeks.  Study conduct will include two in-home use study periods each lasting approximately\n      (1) one week.\n\n      During Visit 1, after subjects are enrolled and assigned to a pen device group, subjects\n      will be randomly assigned to use the BD NEXT or their usual PN for use during a 1 week home\n      use period (Period 1).  After approximately 1 week, at Visit 2, subjects will be\n      crossed-over to the other study PN per the randomization schedule.\n\n      After approximately 1 week of home use with the second study PN (Period 2), at Visit 3,\n      subjects will be asked to complete Visual Analog Scales (VAS) and answer questions comparing\n      their injection experiences with the two different PNs.\n\n      The primary and secondary objectives will be assessed for all pen users combined.  In\n      addition, preference, thumb force, and confidence in full dose delivery will be compared\n      among the subsets of subjects using each of the following pen devices: sanofi-aventis\n      SoloSTAR\u00ae, Lilly KwikPen\u2122, Novo Nordisk FlexPen\u00ae.  In order to achieve a minimum of 60\n      evaluable subjects in each of these pen user groups approximately 210 subjects will be\n      enrolled (70 subjects per pen group)."
