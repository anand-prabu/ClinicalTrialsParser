  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the bioavailability of nanoparticulate OZ439
      delivered to the proximal small bowel (PSB) via the Enterion™ capsule relative to oral OZ439
      suspension (current &quot;powder in bottle&quot; [PIB]) and oral nanoparticulate OZ439.

      The study will also characterise the plasma concentration time profile of OZ439 when
      delivered via Enterion capsule to the PSB in comparison with OZ439 PIB formulation delivered
      orally and nanoparticulate OZ439 delivered orally Safety and tolerability of OZ439
      formulations will be determined following delivery to the PSB and administered orally

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous clinical studies with OZ439 have shown variable PK and a food effect. One
      hypothesis is that this may be related to a 'common ion effect' leading to precipitation of
      the drug as a less soluble hydrochloride salt in the stomach, resulting in variable
      absorption of the drug. This study is designed to investigate the possibility of improving
      the PK profile by delivering the drug directly to the PSB, thereby bypassing the stomach.
      The study will compare a previously dosed PIB formulation with oral delivery of a
      nanoparticulate as a caplet formulation. The same caplet formulation containing
      nanoparticulate will be administered to the PSB via the Enterion capsule.
