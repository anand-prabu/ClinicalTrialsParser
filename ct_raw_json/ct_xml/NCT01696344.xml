    <textblock>
      This prospective study aims to investigate if termination of atrial fibrillation (AF) after
      pulmonary vein antrum isolation (PVAI) without additional ablation of non-PV triggers, in
      long-standing persistent (LSP) AF, is enough to ensure long-term success.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: AF is a heterogeneous arrhythmia. At its simplest, it is triggered by rapidly
      firing foci around pulmonary veins (PV) and can be cured by isolation of PV alone. Evidences
      suggest that when high frequency of atrial activation is maintained for relatively longer
      period (as in persistent or long-standing AF), ion channel remodeling changes the
      electrophysiologic substrate and lead to AF permanence. Therefore, PVAI alone, as
      anticipated, demonstrates to have limited success rate in persistent and LSP AF and
      additional ablations beyond PVAI involving substrate modification are advocated by many
      experts in electrophysiology. However, there is yet no consensus on the ablation strategy
      for long-standing AF. It is still not clear whether AF termination during ablation could be
      considered as an ablation endpoint or not, as earlier studies have reported results that are
      at variance with each other. Some studies have suggested that termination of AF during
      ablation is associated with reduced recurrence of arrhythmia while others detected no
      association of AF termination with long-term maintenance of sinus rhythm (SR) in persistent
      or LSP-AF.Therefore this study aims to examine ablation outcomes in LSP-AF patients with AF
      termination with or without additional ablation of extra-PV triggers.

      Hypothesis: AF termination does not eliminate the need for additional ablations in achieving
      long-term ablation success in LSP-AF.
