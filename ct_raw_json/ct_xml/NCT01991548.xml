  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This four center international study will include two United Kingdom National Health Service
      centers, and two centers in Melbourne, Australia. The objective of the study is to evaluate
      subject acceptance of a new insulin pump and transmitter together with the accompanying
      training materials. Descriptive data from participant questionnaires and device uploads will
      be evaluated.

      Pediatric subjects between the ages of 7 - 18 years and adults from the age of 19 years of
      age upwards, who currently use an insulin pump in the management of their type 1 or type 2
      diabetes, will be invited to participate. Each subject will be trained on the study device
      and then use it for approximately four weeks. During this time there will be three in-clinic
      visits and four follow-up phone calls, scheduled at the subjects' convenience. At the end of
      this period, they will revert back to their original insulin pump and complete a
      questionnaire on the study pump training materials, features and usability.

    <description>Descriptive summary will be used to characterize the results of the study questionnaires. The questionnaire will use a Likert scale (rating of 1 to 7) to assess overall subject acceptance of the MiniMed 640G and Guardian Link Transmitter. A response of 4 or greater on the Likert scale will be considered positive and indicate and product acceptance.</description>

        Criteria for Inclusion: A subject is eligible for the user evaluation study if all of the
        following criteria are met:

          1. Subject is 7 years or older at time of screening

          2. Subject is current insulin pump user for at least 3 months

          3. Subject has the following CGM experience as determined by the Investigator:

               -  Has experience and can recharge the transmitter and

               -  Has experience and can read sensor data in real-time on her/his pump screen

          4. Subject/legal representative has signed a Patient Informed Consent and is willing to
             comply with the study procedures;

          5. Subject is willing to complete study questionnaires throughout the study

        1. Type 1 diabetes,  for a minimum of 6 months prior to enrollment

        Criteria for Exclusion: A subject is excluded from the user evaluation if any of the
        following criteria are met:

          1. Female subject has a positive urine pregnancy screening test.

          2. Female subject who plans to become pregnant during the course of study. If a woman
             becomes pregnant during participation, she will be withdrawn

          3. Subject has any condition that, in the opinion of the Investigator or qualified

             the device as determined by Investigator or qualified Investigational Centre staff

          5. Subject is unable to tolerate tape adhesive in the area of sensor placement

          6. Subject has any unresolved adverse skin condition in the area of sensor placement
             (e.g. psoriasis, rash, Staphylococcus infection)

          7. Subject has travel plans which would make it difficult for the subject to attend
             on-site study visits as scheduled

          8. Subject is actively participating in an investigational study (drug or device)
             wherein he/she has received treatment from an investigational study drug or
             investigational study device in the last 2 weeks (CEP267 User Evaluation is not
             included in this exclusion criteria).
