  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The gait symptoms are usually refractory to the dopaminergic agents and some other
      resolutions, i.e. repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) should be searched for
      in this regard. To study the impact of rTMS, investigators will adopt a domestically
      developed ambulatory recorder (PK-16CH EXG) for the concomitant recording of the
      electroencephalographic and electromyographic signals for PD patients when walking in the
      gait laboratory or when conducting leg dorsiflexion movement on sitting.

    <textblock>
      The Bereitschaftspotential (BP), event related synchronization (ERS) and event related
      dysynchronization (ERD) will be analyzed for the investigation of the possible differences
      of brain activities prior to leg voluntary movement between patients and controls. In
      addition, the synchronized recorded gait parameters for gait ignition,turning and
      termination will also be analyzed. The information gathered will allow us to further
      understand the pathophysiology of the gait freezing in PD. Investigators will deliver a
      course of rTMS with intermittent theta burst paradigm of the leg motor cortex to investigate
      whether the non-invasive brain stimulation can ameliorate the gait freezing in PD patients.
      The subjects will be assessed before and 4 times after rTMS during an 8-week period with
      clinical scoring batteries and electrophysiological recording as aforementioned. At the end
      of the 8th week, the test group and sham group will cross over and undergo the same
      procedures as aforementioned. The serial comprehensive investigations in this project will
      not only promote our understanding of the gait freezing pathophysiology but also may charge
      a novel trail for the management of long suffering symptom of the PD patients.

    <description>The paradigm will use a theta burst stimulation pattern (TBS) in which 3 pulses of stimulation will be given at 50Hz, repeated every 200 ms. In the iTBS, a 2-second train of TBS is repeated every 10 seconds for a total of 190 seconds (600 pulses). Subjects will be 8 courses of iTBS stimulation in 10 business days.</description>
