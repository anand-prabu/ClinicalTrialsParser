Patients with complete response after 4 doses\n           receive a maximum of 2 additional doses. Patients with stable disease or minor, mixed,\n           or partial response after 4 doses receive a maximum of 12 additional doses. Patients\n           with no response after 4 doses receive immunization with the same peptides and\n           interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours for a maximum of 12 doses beginning 1\n           day after each immunization.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3-4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 45-75 patients (15-25 per immunization group) will be accrued\n      for this study within 2 years."
