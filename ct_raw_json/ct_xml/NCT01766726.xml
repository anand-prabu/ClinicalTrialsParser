  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aims of this study are to determine whether: a) ART-naïve HIV+ subjects have
      increased artherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability, b) newly-initiated
      QUAD/Stribild therapy will decrease plaque inflammation/vulnerability in these subjects, and
      c) QUAD/Stribild therapy will improve indices of immune dysregulation and lipid dysfunction
      as a mechanism of improved plaque inflammation/vulnerability.

    <textblock>
      Patients with HIV are at higher risk of morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease
      than healthy subjects. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) has greatly increased the lifespan of
      HIV+ patients, but their risk of CVD remains higher than normal. Previously, it has been
      shown that compared to healthy control subjects, ART-treated HIV+ patients have more
      atherosclerotic plaque inflammation in the aorta. This study is intended to determine
      whether atherosclerotic plaque inflammation/vulnerability is increased in ART-naïve HIV+
      patients and whether these parameters can be improved through 6 months of newly-initiated
      QUAD/Stribild therapy.
