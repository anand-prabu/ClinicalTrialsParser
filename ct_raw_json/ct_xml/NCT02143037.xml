  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Contingency management (CM) is highly efficacious for reducing substance use, and recent
      data suggest that reinforcing attendance at treatment can significantly improve treatment
      outcomes. Importantly, CM interventions that reinforce attendance are more likely to be
      adopted clinically than those that reinforce abstinence. Having objective indicators of
      drinking outcomes, nevertheless, is critical for quantifying the benefits of
      attendance-based CM treatment in alcohol abusing populations. New technology is now
      available to gauge alcohol use in patients' natural environments. The Secure Continuous
      Remote Alcohol Monitor (SCRAMx®) continuously monitors alcohol consumption 24 hours a day.
      As such, it may be ideal for objective evaluation of alcohol consumption during treatment
      intervention studies, including those that involve CM.

      In this study, 114 patients participating in community based outpatient treatment programs
      for alcohol use disorders will wear SCRAMx for a 12-week period. They will be randomized to
      standard care or standard care plus CM, with reinforcement contingent upon attendance at
      treatment. The investigators will assess treatment attendance and alcohol use via SCRAMx and
      self reports. The investigators expect that patients randomized to the CM intervention will
      remain in treatment longer and show reductions in both SCRAMx assessed and self reported
      drinking days relative to those randomized to standard care.
