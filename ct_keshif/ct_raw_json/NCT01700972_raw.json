            "textblock": "The current MPI protocol entails imaging within 30-45 minutes after radiotracer injection\n      (W30 imaging), for both the rest and stress part. This delay between the radiotracer\n      injection and imaging is intended to limit the nonspecific liver and gut radioactivity to\n      the heart and allows an optimal imaging of the heart. A recent publication however indicates\n      that an early imaging within 10 minutes after radiotracer injection (W10 imaging) appears\n      feasible and may be as good as W30 imaging.\n\n      Encouraged by the recent data, we think that a waiting time of 10 minutes is feasible while\n      preserving the image quality; thus, we would like to assess the feasibility and accuracy of\n      W10 imaging compared with W30 imaging in this study. The main purpose of this study is to\n      obtain imaging information on the use of early imaging (W10). The feasibility of W10 imaging\n      will be assessed visually using a 3-point scale as well as semiquantitatively using\n      region-of-interest measurements. The accuracy of W10 imaging will be determined by comparing\n      the findings of W10 with those of coronary angiography, which will be obtained within 30\n      days of the MPI and serve as reference standard. The tolerability of W10 will be assessed\n      using 3-point scale Questionnaires.\n\n      This study will determine if early MPI imaging within 10 minutes works as well as imaging\n      after 30-45 minutes waiting and its role in the diagnosis of coronary artery disease. The\n      major advantages of this new imaging procedure include the shortening of the procedure time,\n      the reduction of patient discomfort and improvement of patient care."
