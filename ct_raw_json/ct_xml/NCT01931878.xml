  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare the safety and effectiveness of local
      injections of botulinum toxin A (XeominÂ®) to an inactive test substance (placebo) in a
      medical condition called Restless Leg Syndrome. This study has a double blind cross over
      design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. The first set of
      injections can be either Xeomin or placebo. The order of injection will be reversed at the
      three month point following the first injection. Double blind means neither the
      investigators nor you know which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) you received.

    <description>The subject may be randomly assigned to receive Xeomin which is an active drug for the first treatment intervention. Xeomin is a neurotoxin Which is approved for use by the FDA  for certain conditions. This study has a double blind cross over design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. If the first set of injections is Xeomin, the second injections after a three month interval will be the inactive placebo. Double blind means neither the investigators nor the subject knows which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) is received with the first or second injections.</description>

    <description>The subject may be randomly assigned to receive Placebo which is an inactive test substance which has no active ingredient. In this protocol we use sterile salt water as placebo.This study has a double blind cross over design. Cross over means that you will have two sets of injections. If the first set of injections is placebo, the second injections after a three month interval will be active study drug. Double blind means neither the investigators nor the subject knows which one of the two (Xeomin or placebo) is received with the first or second injections.</description>
