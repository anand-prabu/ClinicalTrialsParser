        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age

          2. Patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus for more than 5 years duration

          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) 4. Fulfill one or more of the following:

        1. Manifest signs and symptoms that are severe enough to be incapacitating. Incapacitating
        signs and symptoms include hypoglycemic episodes requiring assistance by others and
        hypoglycemia unawareness, (the inability to recognize low blood glucoses; glucoses &lt;54
        mg/dl). These patients are at high risk for involvement in accidents (they can lose
        consciousness or act irrationally), thus causing harm to themselves and/or others; and/or
        2. Patients with poor diabetes control (HbA1c &gt; 8.0% but &lt; 12%), despite intensive insulin
        therapy, as defined by: self monitoring of blood glucose ≥ 4 times/day, and multiple
        insulin injections (≥ 3/day) or insulin pump, and close monitoring of blood glucose
        control by an Endocrinologist. These patients can experience acute, rapid hyperglycemia
        secondary to several stress factors, that can lead to dehydration, disorientation, and in
        some instances, ketoacidosis; and/or 3. Progressive diabetic complications. These patients
        with chronically poor glycemic control are at higher risk for the development of a wide
        variety of complications (retinopathy, neuropathy, nephropathy, and cardiovascular
        disease) associated with diabetes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Potential candidates will be excluded as per following criteria:

          1. Age &lt;18 or &gt;65 years;

          2. Duration of diabetes &lt;5 years;

          3. Do not have a physician that is monitoring diabetes for &gt; 6 months;

          4. Body Mass Index &gt;30

          5. Weight &gt;80 kg;

          6. Insulin requirement &gt;1.0 u/kg/d;

          7. HbA1C &gt;12%;

          8. Stimulated or basal C-peptide &gt;0.3 ng/ml;

          9. Iohexol GFR&lt;80

         10. Macroalbuminuria (&gt;300 mg/24 hours);

         11. Anemia consistently lower than the normal range.

         12. Hyperlipidemia (fasting LDL cholesterol&gt;130mg/dl and/or fasting triglycerides
             &gt;200mg/dl);

         13. Abnormal liver function tests (consistently &gt;1.5 x normal range);

         14. Serological evidence of HIV, HBsAg and/or HBcAb, HBsAb without history of
             vaccination, HTLV-1 or HCV;

         15. Negative serology for Epstein Barr virus (EBV) or evidence of acute or chronic
             infection (IgM≥IgG);

         16. Lack of updated immunizations per current CDC guidelines (including Lack of
             immunization against hepatitis B, pneumococcus and influenza - during season);

         17. Presence of panel reactive antibodies by flow cytometry

         18. Prostate specific antigen (PSA) &gt;4 ng/ml unless malignancy ruled out;

         19. Positive tuberculin test (unless proof of adequate treatment for latent tuberculosis
             can be provided);

         20. X-ray evidence of pulmonary infection or other significant pathology;

         21. Gall stones and/or portal hypertension and/or hemangioma on liver ultrasound;

         22. Abnormal abdominal or pelvic ultrasound (evidence of masses that are considered
             suspicious for malignancy or adenopathy);

         23. Active peptic ulcer disease;

         24. Active infections;

         25. Unstable cardiovascular status (including positive stress echocardiography if &gt;age
             35)/MI in the past 6 months/LVEF&lt;30%)

         26. Untreated or unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy;

             Depo-Provera, and barrier devices with spermicide are acceptable; condoms used alone
             are not acceptable);

         32. Positive pregnancy test or intent for future pregnancy, or male subject's intent to
             procreate;

         33. Any condition or any circumstances that makes it unsafe to undergo an islet cell
