The safety of C1-esterase inhibitor will also be assessed. Each\n      subject will enter a run-in period of up to 8-weeks. Subjects who complete the run-in period\n      and who are eligible will then enter the treatment phase which comprises two sequential\n      treatment periods. In the treatment phase, subjects will be randomized to one of four arms\n      consisting of treatment with low- or higher-volume C1-esterase inhibitor in one treatment\n      period and treatment with low- or higher-volume placebo in the other treatment period. The\n      study will measure the number of hereditary angioedema attacks that subjects experience\n      while receiving each treatment."
