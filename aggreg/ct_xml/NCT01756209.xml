      Aim: The purpose of this study was to evaluate both the effects of ibuprofen and/or
      acetaminophen for the acute treatment of primary migraine in children in or out prophylactic
      treatment with magnesium.

      Methods: The study had been approved by the Researchers Ethics Committee of the
      &quot;Pugliese-Ciaccio&quot; Hospital (protocol number 720/2010; EUDRACT NUMBER 2012-005737-36) and
      the  children ranging from the ages of 5 to 18 years with at least four attack/month of
      primary migraine were enrolled. A Visual Analogical Scale was used to evaluate pain
      intensity at the moment of admission to the study (start of the study) and every month up to
      18 months later (end of the study).

    <description>The primary endpoint was when pain-relief took place and pain intensity differences from baseline (0 hour) to 3 hours after drug treatment. This measurement was defined as the AUC for the sum of the 2 measurements (pain relief and pain intensity difference) at each time point from 0 to 3 hours.</description>
