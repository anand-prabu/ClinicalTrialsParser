This includes: providing more structure and guidance\n           as participants work in the Tool Box section of the program; simplifying the content of\n           the Tool Box; further R&D in the text messaging feature for 2nd and 3rd tier cellular\n           providers; implement a customized pdf report function for progress reports from the\n           program to users' probation officers (under control of the user); developing a\n           follow-up component and outcome reports; and revising the videos in the Tool Box to\n           reflect greater diversity and a younger population of drinkers.\n\n        -  Conducting a randomized clinical trial of the program with first time DWI/DUI offenders\n           who are recruited locally, collecting follow-up data, analyzing the data, and reporting\n           the results."
