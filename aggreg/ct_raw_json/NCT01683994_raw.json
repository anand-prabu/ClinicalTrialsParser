However, studies have shown that prostate tumors respond\n      to it. Docetaxel and prednisone are standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer.\n      Researchers want see if adding cabozantinib to these two drugs can be a safe and effective\n      treatment for this type of cancer.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of cabozantinib with standard treatments for advanced\n      prostate cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have advanced prostate cancer that has not\n      responded to standard treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will receive the cancer drugs over 21-day cycles of treatment. They will\n           take docetaxel and cabozantinib on day 1 of each cycle. Each docetaxel infusion will\n           take about 1 hour. They will also take prednisone by mouth twice each day.\n\n        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.\n\n        -  Participants will continue to take the study drugs for as long as their cancer does not\n           worsen and side effects are not too severe."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Docetaxel is established as first-line chemotherapy in patients with metastatic\n           castrate resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). However; it is increasingly recognized that\n           combining docetaxel with other agents of clinical activities without overlapping\n           toxicities could simultaneously target different cellular signaling pathways vital for\n           tumor survival, producing either additive or synergistic activities.\n\n        -  Inhibition of angiogenesis, either as a stand-alone approach or in combination with\n           chemotherapy, has demonstrable antitumor efficacy against CRPC and there are several\n           antiangiogenic agents that are now in clinical trials in this population of patients.\n\n        -  Cabozantinib (XL184) was developed as an inhibitor of both angiogenesis and of its\n           resistance mechanism. It is an inhibitor of multiple receptor tyrosine kinases\n           including c- Met, VEGFR2 and RET.\n\n        -  In single agent clinical studies, cabozantinib demonstrated, broad anti-tumor\n           activities across many solid tumor types. Cabozantinib has yielded one of the highest\n           rates of response with disease control rate, defined as SD or confirmed response, of\n           68% in CRPC patients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      -To determine the safety profile of cabozantinib in combination with docetaxel and\n      prednisone, and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) as recommended phase II dose\n      in combination with docetaxel.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Patients must have progressive metastatic CRPC. There must be radiographic evidence of\n           disease after primary treatment with surgery or radiotherapy. If patients had been on\n           flutamide, they must have disease progression at least 4 weeks after withdrawal.\n           Patients on bicalutamide or nilutamide must have progression at least 6 weeks after\n           withdrawal. Withdrawal criteria apply only to patients on the above anti-androgens for\n           at least the prior 6 months.\n\n        -  Patients must be at least 18 years of age and able to give informed consent.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This is a single arm phase I study of fixed dose of docetaxel and prednisone in\n           combination with cabozantinib at three escalating doses. Using a standard 3 plus 3\n           design, three patients will initially be treated at each dose level until MTD has been\n           defined.\n\n        -  An expansion cohort will then be enrolled at the MTD to further characterize safety,\n           toxicity and pharmacokinetic data and to obtain preliminary information on the efficacy\n           of the combination treatment.\n\n        -  The accrual ceiling for the study, including both the dose escalation and the expansion\n           phases, is set at 24."

In addition,\n             these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n\n          -  Patients who require taking drugs that are strong inhibitors/inducers of CYP3A4 and\n             cannot be switched to an alternative medication.\n\n        Because the lists of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to regularly\n        consult a frequently-updated list such as http://medicine.iupui.edu/clinpharm/ddis/;\n        medical reference texts such as the Physicians    Desk Reference may also provide this\n        information. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient will be\n        counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new medications\n        need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new over-thecounter medicine or\n        herbal product.\n\n        -Patients with greater than or equal to grade 2 peripheral neuropathy at baseline."
