  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm study will evaluate the safety and efficacy of
      subcutaneously administered RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with active
      rheumatoid arthritis who are either naïve to or have an inadequate response to prior
      non-biologic or/and biologic DMARDs. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg
      subcutaneously weekly as monotherapy or in combination with methotrexate or other
      non-biologic DMARDs for 24 weeks. Depending on response, patients will either continue
      treatment with RoActemra/Actemra and discontinue methotrexate/non-biologic DMARDs or
      continue combination treatment with RoActemra/Actemra and methotrexate/non-biologic DMARDs
      for a further 28 weeks, or discontinue RoActemra/Actemra treatment.
