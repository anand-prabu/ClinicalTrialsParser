The proposed project addresses unmet public health\n      needs for a historically hard-to-reach group of individuals with epilepsy and comorbid\n      serious mental illnesses, and as the intervention is an adjunct to care that individuals\n      with serious mental illness are already receiving, and uses staff already likely to be\n      present in a care system, it is ideally suited for \"real-world\" implementation in people\n      with epilepsy and serious mental illness (E-SMI).\n\n      The purpose of this study is to try and engage individuals with E-SMI to actively\n      participate in illness self-management and treatment adherence that are crucial in\n      minimizing the morbidity and mortality associated with both chronic mental disorders and\n      chronic neurological conditions."
