The main Aim is to assess whether reducing\n      treatment intensity, by replacing concurrent chemotherapy with cetuximab, will indeed\n      achieve improved long-term toxicity.\n\n      The primary objectives include the following: to confirm that reducing treatment intensity\n      in patients with HPV-related oropharyngeal cancer and < 10 pack-year smoking history by\n      replacing concurrent chemotherapy with concurrent cetuximab, does not significantly increase\n      the proportion of patients whose tumors recur, compared to our previous experience in\n      similar patients receiving chemo-RT and to compare the toxicity in patients receiving\n      cetuximab-RT to similar patients treated with 7 weeks of chemotherapy concurrent with RT\n      (\"standard therapy\") in UMCC 2-21."

            "textblock": "The investigators have shown in past experience a high success in getting rid of\n      oropharyngeal cancer (tonsil or base of tongue cancer) using chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy in patients who have not smoked, or only smoked a minimal amount of cigarettes or\n      equivalent. In these patients, the cancer is thought to be caused by a virus (Human\n      Papilloma Virus, or HPV). HPV is a virus that infects the epidermis (outermost layer of\n      skin) and mucous membranes of humans.   In general, patients with HPV-related cancer such as\n      yours have a better prognosis compared with patients whose tumors are smoking-related.\n      Taking into account the good prognosis, it is possible that reducing the intensity of\n      therapy will not affect the high rate of tumor control, while reducing the side-effects of\n      therapy.  In this study, the investigators plan to reduce the intensity of treatment by\n      replacing the currently used chemotherapy drugs with an FDA approved drug, cetuximab, which\n      is a monoclonal antibody to a growth factor which helps cancer cells grow.  By opposing the\n      effect of the growth factor, cetuximab may help radiotherapy kill cancer cells without a lot\n      of effect on the normal tissue. It differs from chemotherapy in its more selective activity\n      against tumors compared to normal tissue Cetuximab has the chance to preserve the high rate\n      of success in killing the tumor but may reduce the side effects and complications of therapy\n      in comparison to chemotherapy drugs.\n\n      The investigators would also like to know if taking cetuximab has any effect on certain\n      cancer-related molecules in the cancer and the normal cells inside the cheek. They would\n      like to test this by taking a small biopsy of the tumor, as well as a swab of the inside of\n      the cheek, before and shortly after the start of therapy."

Radiation will be delivered concurrent with weekly cetuximab 250 mg/m2, delivered on Monday or Tuesday each week. In order to evaluate swallowing problems from radiotherapy, patients will undergo an evaluation of swallowing by videofluoroscopy (VF).
