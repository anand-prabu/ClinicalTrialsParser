To compare the rates of completion of\n      therapy within 22 weeks for the two study regimens.\n\n      To compare the rate of development of drug-resistant tuberculosis in the two study regimens\n      among study patients classified as treatment failures or relapses.\n\n      To compare all of the above performance characteristics for the two study regimens in a\n      small subset of HIV seropositive patients.\n\n      To compare attitudes and beliefs about participation in this study between patients who\n      complete study therapy and those who fail to complete study therapy."
