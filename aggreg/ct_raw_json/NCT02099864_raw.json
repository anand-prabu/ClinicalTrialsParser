Androgens can cause the growth\n      of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount\n      of androgens made by the body. Studying samples of tissue and blood in the laboratory from\n      patients with prostate cancer may help doctors better understand hormone resistant prostate\n      cancer. It may also help doctors make improvements in prostate cancer treatment."
