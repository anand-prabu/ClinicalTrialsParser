            "textblock": "Non-ambulatory children with a neuromuscular disability are at significant risk for poor\n      bone health as reflected by low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased propensity to\n      fracture. In large part, this is due to abnormally low levels of load experienced by the\n      skeleton. A common approach for increasing BMD is to stimulate the musculoskeletal system by\n      increasing the amount and duration of weight-bearing in the lower extremities. For\n      non-ambulatory individuals, this typically takes the form of using an assisted standing\n      device to enable the child to spend time in a standing position so that their lower limbs\n      can experience some degree of body weight. Some of these physical interventions result in\n      varying degrees of improvement in BMD, and some do not. This lack of clarity in outcomes may\n      result from a failure to objectively measure the magnitude and duration of the load\n      experienced by the lower extremities. A lack of change in BMD may be due to the extremities\n      experiencing only a fraction of the body weight due to load-sharing with the assistive\n      device, or to an inadequate duration of standing time. The goal of this project will be to\n      design and validate a force-measuring platform that will measure the magnitude and duration\n      of the load experienced by the lower extremities of individuals with a neuromuscular\n      disability who use a stationary assisted standing device to increase their BMD."
