The eating plan in the study was based on the DASH\n      diet, also known as the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet. This plan is rich in\n      fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy, and is recommended to decrease blood pressure in\n      patients with hypertension. Current medical guidelines also recommend that both patients\n      with hypertension and those with heart failure should decrease their dietary salt intake.\n\n      The diets that patients will eat in this study are the DASH/sodium-restricted (DASH/SRD)\n      diet as well as a control diet based on the average reported diet collected using Food\n      Frequency Questionnaires during our pilot study. Patients will be randomized to one diet for\n      three weeks and then crossover to the other diet for three weeks. Patients will then be\n      asked to eat the DASH/sodium-restricted diet on their own at home with dietary support for\n      an additional eight weeks.\n\n      In this study, the main goal is to confirm the findings of our earlier study. The\n      investigators would also like to understand how the DASH/SRD changes the function of the\n      heart and blood vessels during exercise and the activity of genes that could be involved in\n      HFPEF."
