  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study compares the safety and efficacy of GDTs using standard pressure-related
      parameters vs. dynamic hemodynamic indices associated with fluid compartment monitoring, in
      trauma patients requiring emergency surgery.

    <description>In the CONTROL group, the administration of fluid (250-500ml crystalloids or colloids) and cardiovascular supportive drugs will be guided to maintain standard pressure-related parameters within a normal range: MAP &gt; 65mmHg, HR &lt; 90/min, CVP &gt;8-12&lt; cm H20, urinary output &gt; 0.5 ml/kg/h. In line with the conventional approach, other physiological parameters will also be targeted: T° &gt; 35.5°C, Sp02 &gt; 95%, lactate &lt; 2.5 mmol/L, normalisation of the BE. The maximal infused volume of hydroxyethyl starch (Voluven®) will be 33 ml/kg.</description>

The administration of fluid (250-500ml crystalloids or colloids) and cardiovascular supportive drugs will be guided by an algorithm taking into account standard parameters (HR, MAP, lactate, Hb), as well as static and dynamic volumetric parameters (SVI, CI, GEDVI, EVLWI, SVV, PPV, PVI).</description>
