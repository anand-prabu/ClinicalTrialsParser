To determine in a Phase II study the efficacy of FU in combination with PB, indomethacin\n      and rhIFNg in patients with advanced colorectal cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of fluorouracil (5-FU).\n\n      Phase I: Patients receive 5-FU IV over 24 hours on day 1; phenylbutyrate IV over 120 hours\n      and oral indomethacin daily on days 2-6; and interferon gamma subcutaneously on days 2, 4,\n      and 6.
