  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the aim of the neurosurgical treatment of brain tumor is to offer the maximal
      resection with the minimal neurological risk. The presurgical mapping of eloquent areas with
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is helpful to plan the surgery. BOLD fMRI is
      now the gold standard to map language areas. However, BOLD signal is diminished near the
      brain tumor. It is now possible to detect cortical activation with arterial spin labeling
      (ASL) techniques, detecting variations of perfusion during an activation paradigm (fASL),
      fASL could be interesting to detect eloquent areas near a brain tumor.
