            "textblock": "Background: Traumatically injured patients continue to be plagued with uncontrolled\n      hemorrhage resulting in significant morbidity and early mortality. A primary driving force\n      for this unbridled hemorrhage is known to be the early coagulopathy which complicates severe\n      injury. Trauma induced coagulopathy has been postulated to be an equilibrium imbalance\n      between pro and anticoagulant factors, platelets, endothelium and fibrinolysis soon after\n      injury. Recent evidence demonstrates that the early use of the antifibrinolytic agent\n      tranexamic acid (TXA) after trauma center arrival results in improved survival in patients\n      at risk for bleeding. Bringing this proven treatment to the prehospital arena and\n      intervening earlier in those patients who would otherwise not be candidates for treatment\n      has the real potential to further reduce or prevent the vicious hemorrhagic cascade, improve\n      clinical outcomes and provide insight into the underlying mechanisms responsible for and\n      which maximize its benefit.\n\n      Objective/Hypothesis: The primary hypothesis will be that prehospital infusion of tranexamic\n      acid in patients at risk for bleeding will reduce the incidence of 30 day mortality. The\n      secondary hypotheses include that prehospital tranexamic acid will reduce the incidence of\n      hyperfibrinolysis, acute lung injury, multiple organ failure, nosocomial infection,\n      mortality, early seizures, pulmonary embolism and early resuscitation needs, reduce or\n      prevent the early coagulopathy as demonstrated by improving presenting INR and rapid\n      thromboelastography parameters, reduce the early inflammatory response, plasmin levels,\n      leukocyte, platelet and complement activation, and determine the optimal dosing of\n      tranexamic acid post-injury."
