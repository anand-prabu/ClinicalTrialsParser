This test is done two times\n      during the study.

Glucose and\n      insulin levels, electrolytes, lipids, fatty acids, cytokines and hesperidin levels are\n      measured. We will also use tracer-labeled glucose to determine how much glucose the body\n      produces in the fasting state and during the clamp. This type of glucose has low levels of\n      radiation.\n\n      Forearm blood flow measurement with finger plethysmography device. Before beginning the\n      glucose clamp test, a test of how well the blood vessels relax is done. A device that\n      measures the blood flow in the vessels of the forefingers is used. The test is performed at\n      the before the glucose clamp test and again 2 hours after the beginning of the clamp."
