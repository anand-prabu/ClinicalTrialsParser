Participants: Medical students (4th years) of\n      the University Paris Descartes. Methods: participants will be randomized in 2 groups. The\n      allocation of participants will be done by a computerized randomization list, the sequence\n      will be created by an independent statistician. Participants will be blinded of the study\n      hypothesis. Allocation concealment will be provided because only the statistician will have\n      access to the randomization list.\n\n      A  program of Narrative Medicine with lesson in small group of \"workshop reading patients'\n      diaries \" vs  \"workshop reading literature\".\n\n      Outcome: The primary endpoint will be a first measure of the empathy of the medical\n      students. The secondary endpoints will be a second measure of the empathy of the medical\n      student; satisfaction of the student relative to the educational program .\n\n      Potential interests: We believe that the workshop \"reading patients' diaries\" can develop\n      the thinking of the student with respect to his behavior with the patient, and so the\n      relation between student and patient.\n\n      Sample size expected: 200 participants."
