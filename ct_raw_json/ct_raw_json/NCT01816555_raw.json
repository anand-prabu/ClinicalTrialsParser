This is a research study combining\n      Vitamin D (an over the counter medication) with the standard of care (or the established and\n      approved treatment), surgery. Evidence shows that women who are Vitamin D3 deficient have a\n      higher risk of breast cancer and breast cancer recurrence. The purpose of this study is to\n      find out the effects of Vitamin D3 during the treatment period for Stage I-II breast cancer.\n      Screening tests will be done to determine if subjects are eligible to participate in this\n      study. If subjects are eligible and they agree to participate, they will be assigned to one\n      of two groups which will receive different amounts of vitamin D. Subjects will be asked to\n      keep a medication diary. Subjects may remain on treatment for approximately 56 days."
