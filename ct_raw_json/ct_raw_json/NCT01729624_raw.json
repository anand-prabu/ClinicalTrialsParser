            "textblock": "Patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) associated vasculitis (AAV) have\n      inflammation in the small blood vessels leading to involvement in different body areas,\n      e.g., the kidneys, lungs and skin. Untreated, the risk of death is over 80%\u037e with current\n      treatment, patients often suffer from ongoing disease activity, damage or treatment side\n      effects which have a negative impact on quality of life. Because patients with AAV can have\n      a wide range of disease features, the investigators hypothesise that general patient\n      reported outcome (PROs) measurements, may not be specific enough to describe the full impact\n      on quality of life.\n\n      The main objective of this project is to start from patients' experiences to develop a\n      disease specific PRO for patients with AAV. Patients diagnosed with AAV will be recruited\n      through clinics or inpatients at the Oxford University Hospitals (OUH) National Health\n      Service (NHS) Trust, or, if the patients have previously consented to be contacted about\n      future studies, through the Diagnostic and Classification of Vasculitis (DCVAS) or The\n      Characterisation and Determinants of Quality of Life in ANCA Associated Vasculitis (VasQoL)\n      study databases. After informed consent is obtained, individual patient interviews will be\n      conducted\u037e these will last for approximately one hour and will be recorded and transcribed.\n      Themes will be independently extracted and amalgamated by the researchers. Approximately 25\n      patients with different types of ANCAassociated vasculitis and varying disease duration will\n      be interviewed until saturation, i.e., no new substantive themes emerge. These themes will\n      then evolve into individual candidate questionnaire items. Candidate items will be piloted\n      on approximately 25 different patients with AAV using questionnaires and interviews, until\n      no further comments arise, to produce a final set of candidate questionnaire items. The\n      duration of the study 1.5 years."
