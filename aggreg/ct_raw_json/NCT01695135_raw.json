Approximately 200 (133 in the abiraterone acetate group and 67 in\n      the placebo group) medically or surgically castrated male patients with mCRPC who have\n      failed docetaxel-based chemotherapy will be enrolled in this study for up to 27 months. The\n      study protocol includes the following phases: screening (within 28 days prior to\n      randomization on Cycle 1 Day 1), double-blind treatment (28-day cycles until\n      protocol-defined disease progression or unacceptable toxicity), and survival follow-up (up\n      to Month 60). During the follow-up phase, patients with disease progression will be provided\n      open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known) extension treatment with\n      abiraterone acetate. Abiraterone acetate 1000 mg tablets or placebo will be taken orally (by\n      mouth) once daily plus prednisone 5 mg tablet orally twice daily. Efficacy and safety will\n      be monitored throughout the study."
