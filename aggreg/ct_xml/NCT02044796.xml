    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of mitoxantrone hydrochloride
      when given together with filgrastim, cladribine, and cytarabine and to see how well they
      work in treating patients with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia or high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as filgrastim, cladribine,
      cytarabine, and mitoxantrone hydrochloride, work in different ways to stop the growth of
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of dose-intensified mitoxantrone (mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride) as part of the G-CSF (filgrastim), cladribine, cytarabine, mitoxantrone
      hydrochloride (G-CLAM) regimen in adults with relapsed/refractory acute myeloid leukemia
      (AML) receiving first or greater salvage therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, disease response and duration of
      remission.

      II. To describe, within the limits of a phase 1/2 study, the toxicity profile of the study
      regimen.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of mitoxantrone hydrochloride followed by
      phase II study.

      INDUCTION CHEMOTHERAPY (G-CLAM): Patients receive G-CLAM chemotherapy comprising filgrastim
      subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 0-5, mitoxantrone hydrochloride intravenously (IV) over 60
      minutes on days 1-3, cladribine IV over 2 hours daily on days 1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2
      hours daily on days 1-5. Patients with persistent disease may receive a second course of
      induction chemotherapy. Patients achieving complete remission (CR) or CR with incomplete
      platelet count recovery (CRp) may continue on to Consolidation Chemotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY (G-CLA): Beginning within 6 weeks of achieving CR/CRp, patients
      receive G-CLA comprising filgrastim SC on days 0-5, cladribine IV over 2 hours daily on days
      1-5, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues for up to 4
      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for up to 5
      years.

             biphenotypic AML are eligible

          -  Relapsed/refractory disease according to standard criteria requiring first or
             subsequent salvage therapy; outside diagnostic material is acceptable as long as
             peripheral blood and/or bone marrow slides are reviewed at the study institution;
             flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood and/or bone marrow should be performed
             according to institutional practice guidelines

          -  Patients with prior autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)
             are eligible if relapse occurs provided symptoms of graft-versus host disease are

             disease, and all grade 2-4 non-hematologic toxicities should have resolved; patients
             with symptoms/signs of hyperleukocytosis or white blood cell (WBC) &gt; 100,000/uL can
             be treated with leukapheresis or may receive up to 2 doses of cytarabine (up to 500
