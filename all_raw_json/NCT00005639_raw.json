Treatment repeats every 35 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses and durations of treatment with azacitidine\n      and phenylbutyrate until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
