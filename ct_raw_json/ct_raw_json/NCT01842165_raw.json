(Before amino acid nephroprotection solution, ondansetron, methylprednisolone\n      and metoclopramid, are given intravenously in order to prevent nausea or vomiting).\n      Approximately 30 min after the beginning of the amino acid solution, 177Lu-octreotate is\n      co-infused over 15-30 minutes. The amino acid infusion is continued at the same rate for 3-5\n      more hours (total infusion lasts 4-6 hours).\n\n      In total, 4 cycles are planned. However, the total number of administered cycles will be\n      limited by critical organ (kidneys and bone marrow) cumulated absorbed doses.\n\n      Treatment efficacy will be assessed:\n\n        -  on a lesion-basis (change of longest transversal diameter).\n\n        -  on a patient-basis using Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors  (RECIST) 1.1."
