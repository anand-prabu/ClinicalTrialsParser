  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In addition to a genetic susceptibility, the immune system and the intestinal microbiota,
      diet is hypothesized to be an important factor in the onset and progression of Inflammatory
      Bowel Diseases (IBD). Further insight in factors affecting disease activity may contribute
      to targeted interventions improving disease burden and healthcare costs for these patients.
      However, well-designed studies exploring the role of diet in the development of
      exacerbations are hardly available.

      The investigators hypothesize that differences in dietary patterns affects the intestinal
      microbiota composition and thereby contributes to the development of exacerbations in IBD.

      Furthermore, a subgroup of patients suffers from malnutrition, although the exact prevalence
      is unknown since simple noninvasive screening tools have not been validated for IBD. The
      investigators hypothesize that malnutrition is fequently present in IBD patients and
      associated with dietary intake and disease characteristics.
