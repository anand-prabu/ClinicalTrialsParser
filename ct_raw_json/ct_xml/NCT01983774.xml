  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastroesophageal reflux disease is a common problem in cystic fibrosis(CF). It may lead to
      worsening lung function and more respiratory infections for a person with CF. This study
      will look at treating GERD with a medication, esopmeprazole. The medication stops stomach
      acid from being made. The study will see if there are fewer respiratory infections and
      improved lung function in patients with CF when taking esomeprazole.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled intervention study in patients with CF who have a
      history of frequent exacerbations. Treatment duration is 6 months.
