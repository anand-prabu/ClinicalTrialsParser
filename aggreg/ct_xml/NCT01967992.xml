  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot, designed to provide data regarding the feasibility and acceptability
      of conducting such a study on a larger scale. The present study is a randomized controlled
      clinical trial comparing two  programs to help people manage diabetes and lose weight, one
      using a moderate-carbohydrate diet promoted by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and
      the other using on a low-carbohydrate diet (LC) and mindfulness and positive affect
      lifestyle modifications. Intervention content will include information about nutrition
      (American Diabetes Association recommended diet or carbohydrate restriction) and, in the LC
      group, emotion regulation, positive affect, and mindful eating strategies.

      Approximately individuals with type 2 diabetes will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to
      treatment groups. Classes will occur online. Participants will be evaluated at 0, 16, and 32
      weeks. Our main outcome of interest is HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of
      blood glucose levels and tied to diabetes severity).

    <description>Participants in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet group will receive standard ADA advice. The diet includes high-fiber foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, fresh fish, and foods low in saturated fat.  They will be asked to use the &quot;plate method&quot; to guide their nutritional choices.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Carbohydrate Diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet: carbohydrate intake 20-35 grams a day not including fiber. Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables. Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.
Participants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness.</description>

          4. A substance abuse, mental health, or medical condition that, in the opinion of
             investigators, will make it difficult for the potential participant to participate in
             the intervention.  Such conditions may include: cancer, liver failure, unstable
             coronary artery disease, severe emphysema, binge eating disorder or history of binge

             used in the study: current use of insulin; use of systemic (oral or IV)
             corticosteroids in the 6 months prior to enrollment or severe autoimmune disorders or
             other conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis, lupus), that are likely to require these
             medications; and initiation of new class of psychiatric medications in past 2 months.

          6. Pregnant or planning to get pregnant in the next 12 months, breastfeeding or less
             than 6 months post-partum.

          7. Current use of weight loss medications or supplements such as Alli or
             amphetamine-based drugs that are believed to have some effect on weight.

          8. History of or planned weight loss surgery.

          9. Vegan or vegetarian.  The intervention diets are more challenging for vegan and
             vegetarian participants.

         10. No or very limited internet access at a computer. Must be able to complete the online
             assessments and access the online class materials.
