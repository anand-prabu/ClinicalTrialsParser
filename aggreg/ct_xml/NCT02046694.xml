      This research is being done to determine if allopurinol can change the metabolism of the
      oral chemotherapeutic medication 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) in children with acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). 6-MP is originally started at a standard dose in children with
      ALL, but the dose is adjusted according to the absolute neutrophil count (ANC).
      Occasionally, 6-MP doses need to be increased in order to get the ANC into a specific target
      range. Also, increasing the 6-MP dose can lead to unwanted side effects, such as
      inflammation of the liver as shown by increases in laboratory values (ALT, aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin), nausea, and abdominal discomfort. Previous studies in
      children with inflammatory bowel disease has shown that combining allopurinol with 6-MP can
      decrease side effects associated with high doses of 6-MP and also increase the efficacy of
      6-MP. Allopurinol is approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of tumor
      lysis syndrome in ALL. Through this research study, we hope to show that the combination of
      allopurinol and 6-MP will be safe, tolerable, and effective in children with ALL.

      -  Patients will have several visits to the Pediatric Oncology outpatient clinic. Each
           visit will consist of a physical examination and laboratory evaluation. Each laboratory
           evaluation will consist of taking approximately 10 to 15 milliliters of blood (or
           approximately three teaspoons). These clinic visits may actually coincide with clinic
           visits that were previously scheduled according to the patient's treatment protocol.

        -  At the first study visit, patients will have a physical examination and laboratory
           evaluation. At that visit, patients will be asked to stop taking 6-MP and methotrexate.

        -  At the second study visit, which is one week later, patients will again have a physical
           examination and laboratory evaluation. We will prescribe allopurinol and restart 6-MP
           and methotrexate at half of the patient's previous doses.

        -  Clinic visits for physical examination and laboratory evaluation will be scheduled
           every 1-2 weeks for a total of 5 more visits. Doses of allopurinol, 6-MP, and
           methotrexate may be adjusted at these visits based on laboratory values or clinical
           symptoms.

    <description>Patients will stop taking their 6-MP and methotrexate at week 0. One week later (week 1), patients will begin allopurinol daily (100 mg for weight &gt;30 kg, 50 mg for weight ≤30 kg) and will restart 6-MP and methotrexate at 50 percent of the most recent dose. Patients will continue taking allopurinol in combination with 6-MP and methotrexate for the duration of the study (total of 8 weeks). Dose adjustments of 6-MP and methotrexate will be directed by the guidelines outlined in the study protocol.</description>
