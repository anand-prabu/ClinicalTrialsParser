  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the impact of reminders for serum potassium monitoring and of hyperkalemia
      alerts during potassium-increasing drug-drug-interactions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The development of hyperkalemia during potassium-increasing drug-drug-interactions (DDIs) is
      associated with (i) unknown or elevated serum potassium level at onset of treatment and (ii)
      insufficient monitoring of serum potassium during therapy. However, potassium-increasing
      DDIs are frequently started despite an unknown or elevated serum potassium level, and
      monitoring intervals often exceed 48 hours.

      This study investigates the impact of reminders for serum potassium monitoring and
      hyperkalemia alerts. Both reminders and alerts are displayed in the electronic patient chart
      of in-patients treated with potassium-increasing DDIs.
