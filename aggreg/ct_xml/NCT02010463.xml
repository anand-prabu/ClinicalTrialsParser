  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to support the hypothesis that brain processes underlying reward processing
      and impulse control contribute to obesity and to adherence in a new exercise regimen.

    <description>Body weights will be recorded using a digital scale accurate to + 0.1 kg (Befour Inc Model #PS6600, Saukville, WI). Participants will report to the Center between 7 and 10 AM and will be weighed prior to breakfast and after attempting to void. Participants will wear a standard hospital gown at the time of weighing.</description>

    <measure>Treadmill testing for maximum oxygen consumption</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Baseline to 4 Months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Participants will undergo a physician supervised maximal treadmill test to assess changes in maximal oxygen consumption. Furthermore, maximal heart rate obtained from the baseline test will be used to target the appropriate exercise intensity. Participants will walk at 3.4 mph beginning at 0% grade. The grade will be increased 2.5% at 2 minute intervals until exhaustion occurs. Heart rates will be recorded at one minute intervals with a multiple channel electrocardiograph. Expired air will be measured for oxygen and carbon dioxide at 20-second intervals using a ParvoMedics TrueOne 2400 indirect calorimetry system. The system will be and calibrated before each test according to the specifications of the manufacturer (ParvoMedics, Inc Sandy, Utah). Maximal oxygen consumption will be considered as the highest observed value (American College of Sports Medicine 2000).</description>
