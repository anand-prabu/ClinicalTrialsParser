If there is truly no difference between groups (Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure\n      and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure), then total 40 patients for both groups are\n      required to be 70% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or\n      equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) would exclude a difference in favour of\n      the Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure of more than 14%.  The blinding process is applied\n      to a patient, who is informed about received valve-sparing operation, but don't know the\n      type of the last. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board. Depending on a type\n      of the procedure, the patients are divided into two groups: Aortic Root Reimplantation\n      Procedure  group includes 30 patients and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure group\n      consists of 30 patients. Randomization is conducted intraoperatively by using accidental\n      sampling after examining the aortic valve and making a decision on the possibility of a\n      valve-sparing operation."
