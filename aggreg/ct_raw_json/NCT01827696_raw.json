Participants will consume one pill with\n      breakfast, one pill with lunch, one pill with dinner and another pill with a snack either\n      between meals or prior to bedtime. The exercise will be consist of five, eight minute bouts\n      of jogging with two minutes of rest/recovery in between. The degree of muscle soreness will\n      be assessed using a Biodex strength testing machine (isometric and concentric isokinetic\n      torque), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and a self-rating of perceived soreness on a\n      scale from zero to ten.  All of the above measures will be taken before and several times\n      after the downhill jogging protocol."
