As exhaled\n      nitric oxide responds rapidly to environmental changes and can act as a marker of underlying\n      inflammation it is proposed that incorporating eNO monitoring into routine asthma management\n      treatment allows strategies to be more accurately tailored to the patients needs, increasing\n      the probability of good asthma control."
