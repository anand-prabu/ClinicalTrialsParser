  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of a drug called
      atomoxetine for the treatment of cognitive impairment for Parkinson 's disease.  Atomoxetine
      (ATM) is an approved drug currently on the market for the treatment of attention deficit.
      It works to increase the amount of norepinephrine (a chemical in the brain that helps keep
      us awake and alert) in our brain. ATM has not been approved by the Food and Drug
      Administration (FDA) to be used in the treatment of PD.

    <description>To examine in a 12-week, single-site, parallel, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial the efficacy of ATM for the treatment of attention, set-shifting, information processing speed and working memory deficits in cognitively impaired, non-demented patients with PD. The primary outcome for this study is the Global Treatment effect (GTE) at 10 weeks of combined ATM sensitive neuropsychological measures. Secondary outcomes are a set of neuropsychological measures that we hypothesize are not sensitive to treatment with ATM.</description>

    <description>To examine the safety of ATM in patients with PD. Safety will be determined through assessments of Vital Signs, Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), adverse events, Non motor symptom scale (NMSS), comprehensive metabolic panel, and ECG.</description>

    <description>To examine clinical predictors of response to ATM therapy. We will examine four groups of baseline predictors of outcome on the above primary measures:
Cognitive impairment (Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA score), PD motor symptoms (Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Quality of life (Parkinson's Disease Questionnaire (PDQ-39), and Mood disturbance (Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Geriatric Anxiety Scale (GAI).</description>

    <description>The study drug target dose is ATM 80mg per day; given as a once daily dose of an 80mg capsule. Patients will titrate up to target dose by starting on ATM 40mg capsules: 1 capsule daily for 14 days. Following study visit 3 (after 2 weeks on the titration dose), patients will increase the dose of ATM to 80mg daily.</description>

    <description>Patients in the placebo arm will follow the same titration schedule as those in teh active arm.  Patients will titrate up to target dose by starting 40mg capsules: 1 capsule daily for 14 days. Following study visit 3 (after 2 weeks on the titration dose), patients will increase the dose to 80mg daily.</description>
