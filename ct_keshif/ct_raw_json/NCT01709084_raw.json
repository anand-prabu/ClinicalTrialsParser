The study consists of 3\n      phases including, the screening phase (of 6 weeks), treatment phase (of 48 weeks), and\n      follow up phase (of 30 to 35 days after the last dose of study medication). During the 48\n      weeks treatment phase, patients currently with HIV-1 RNA suppression less than 50 copies per\n      mL on their first-line antiretroviral regimen, will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio, in 2\n      groups, ie, Group 1 (treatment group) and Group 2 (control group). Both these groups will\n      receive a fixed dose combination (FDC) regimen (ie, FDC tablet: one tablet per day) of\n      either TDF/FTC/RPV in Group 1 or TDF/FTC/EFV in Group 2. Patients will return for study\n      visits at Week 4, 12, 24, 36, and 48 during the treatment period, and then every 24 weeks\n      thereafter during the extended treatment period until the last patient has his or her Week\n      48 (or treatment discontinuation) visit. Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical\n      laboratory (central and local) tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs, and physical\n      examination will be performed throughout the study. The treatment duration for each patient\n      will be expected to be between 48 and 108 weeks."
