FeNO is measured with a medical\n      device called the NIOX MINO\u00ae.  The NIOX MINO\u00ae device has been cleared by the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) for use in children and adults age 7 and older to measure Fractional\n      Exhaled Nitric Oxide (FeNO) in human breath.This information will be useful for determining\n      whether FeNO may help predict the development of a COPD exacerbation and/or be useful for\n      identifying patients who will have a beneficial therapeutic response to inhaled or systemic\n      corticosteroids during a COPD exacerbation."
