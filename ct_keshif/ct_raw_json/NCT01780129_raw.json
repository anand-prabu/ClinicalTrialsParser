HW6 enhances cardiac\n      function, improves microcirculation, and increases blood pressure and pulse pressure, and\n      improves blood perfusion of important organs; HW6's anti-shock activity comes from a\n      combined multiple target pharmacological effects.\n\n      Based on a completed phase II trial conducted in China, HW6 can effectively treatment shock\n      patient.\n\n      This is a phase II clinical study to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of Polydatin\n      Injectable 100mg/5mL/via (HW6) in the treatment of shock in the United States. Patients with\n      traumatic/hemorrhagic shock or septic shock admitted to the emergency room or ICU with\n      systolic blood pressure < 90mmHg, or is on vasopressor(s) for systolic blood pressure\n      stabilization, regardless the types of completed, on-going, or projected Standard of Care or\n      surgery will be recruited to participant in the trial. A total of 120 patients with\n      traumatic/hemorrhagic shock and 120 patients with septic shock will be enrolled. For each\n      type of shock, sixty patients each will be in test group and control group.  Both adult\n      males and females aged 18-80 years are eligible. The primary clinical endpoint is the time\n      length (TL) between the start of HW6 administration to the onset of the first treatment\n      success, that is: the systolic blood pressure is stabilized at \u226590mmHg and MAP\u226565mmHg for 1\n      hour without the use of vasopressors. Several secondary endpoints and biomarkers will be\n      measured.\n\n      Efficacy data will be compared using group t-test or Wilcoxon log-rank test between\n      treatment groups and placebo groups. Safety data will also be reported accordingly."
