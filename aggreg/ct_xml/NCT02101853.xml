      This randomized phase III trial compares how well blinatumomab works compared with standard
      combination chemotherapy in treating patients with B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia that
      has returned after a period of improvement (relapsed). Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      blinatumomab, can block cancer growth by finding cancer cells and helping to kill them or
      carrying cancer-killing substances to them. It is not yet known whether standard combination
      chemotherapy is more effective than blinatumomab in treating relapsed B-cell acute
      lymphoblastic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the 2-year disease free survival (DFS) of high risk (HR) and intermediate risk
      (IR) relapse B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) patients who are randomized
      following induction block 1 chemotherapy to receive either two intensive chemotherapy blocks
      or two 5-week blocks of blinatumomab (randomization R1).

      II. To compare the 3-year DFS of low risk (LR) relapse B-ALL patients who are randomized
      following block 2 chemotherapy to receive either chemotherapy alone or chemotherapy plus
      blinatumomab (randomization R2).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare the rates of minimal residual disease (MRD) &gt;= 0.01% at the end of block 2 and
      block 3 for HR and IR relapse B-ALL patients in randomization R1.

      II. To estimate, for treatment failure (TF) patients not previously receiving blinatumomab,
      the hematologic complete remission rate (CR), rate of MRD &lt; 0.01%, and proportion able to
      proceed to hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in CR after treatment with
      blinatumomab.

      III. To assess the feasibility and safety of rapid taper of immune suppression for the
      subset of HSCT patients with MRD &gt;= 0.01% pre- and/or post-HSCT with no acute graft versus
      host disease (aGVHD).

      OUTLINE:

      All patients receive Block 1 over 4 weeks.

      BLOCK 1: Patients receive dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or intravenously (IV)
      on days 1-5 and 15-19; vincristine sulfate IV over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, and 22;
      pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 3 and 17; and mitoxantrone hydrochloride IV over

          -  Patients with pre-existing significant central nervous system pathology that would
             preclude treatment with blinatumomab, including: seizure disorder that has required
             prolonged (at least 4 weeks) of continuous treatment with an antiepileptic drug

             severe brain injury, dementia, cerebellar disease, organic brain syndrome, psychosis,
             coordination /movement disorder, or autoimmune disease with CNS involvement

          -  Pre-randomization R1 and R2: interval development of significant central nervous
             system pathology that would preclude treatment with blinatumomab

          -  Pre-hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT): interval development of significant
             pathology that would preclude HSCT including the following infectious and organ

               -  Organ function requirements for HSCT: must meet the criteria for renal, biliary
                  and cardiac function as outlined above; in addition, must have adequate
                  pulmonary function defined as a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1),
                  forced vital capacity (FVC), and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon
                  monoxide (DLCO) (corrected for hemoglobin [Hgb]) &gt;= 60% by pulmonary function
                  tests (PFTs)

               -  For children who are unable to cooperate for PFTs, the criteria are: no evidence
                  of dyspnea at rest, no exercise intolerance, and not requiring supplemental
                  oxygen therapy
