These microelectrodes will be custom-made and are not available for\n      commercial distribution. The investigators hypothesize that recording neural signals from a\n      large number of microelectrodes will provide selective motor information in high enough\n      numbers to allow control over future artificial devices with many moving parts, i.e.\n      artificial limbs with shoulder, elbow, wrist, and/or individual fingers that move. These\n      studies will also investigate to what extent microstimulation of nerve fibers can provide\n      sensory feedback from a prosthetic limb.\n\n      The investigators will also conduct up to three acute surgeries where a Utah slanted\n      Electrode Array (USEA) will be implanted in volunteers who are about to undergo limb\n      amputations.  These acute implantations will provide Dr. Hutchinson with human surgical\n      experience in implanting USEAs and evaluating the containment system we will be using to\n      immobilize the implanted USEA in the nerve."
