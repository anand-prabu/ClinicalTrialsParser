This is\n      of interest because this information may help to predict strokes or heart attacks and may\n      guide new therapies which act on white blood cells to reduce the risk of cardiovascular\n      disease.\n\n      The hypothesis is that counts of particular types of white blood cell are associated with a\n      range of cardiovascular diseases."

Patients enter the study when they have a full blood count\n      (complete blood count) recorded in the dataset, and they are followed up until they\n      experience one of the cardiovascular endpoints, death or transfer out of the participating\n      primary care practice.\n\n      This study is part of the CALIBER (Cardiovascular disease research using linked bespoke\n      studies and electronic records) programme funded over 5 years from the National Institute\n      for Health Research (NIHR) and Wellcome Trust. The central theme of the CALIBER research is\n      linkage of the Myocardial Ischaemia National Audit Project (MINAP) with primary care\n      (Clinical Practice Research Datalink) and other resources. The overarching aim of CALIBER is\n      to better understand the aetiology and prognosis of specific coronary phenotypes across a\n      range of causal domains, particularly where electronic records provide a contribution beyond\n      traditional studies. CALIBER has received both Ethics approval (ref 09/H0810/16) and ECC\n      approval (ref ECC 2-06(b)/2009 CALIBER dataset)."
