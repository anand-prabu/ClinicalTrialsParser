      Primary Objective:

      - To compare the glucose control during treatment with a new formulation of insulin glargine
      and Lantus in adult patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus

      Secondary Objectives:

        -  To compare a new formulation of insulin glargine and Lantus given in the morning or in
           the evening

        -  To compare the incidence and frequency of hypoglycemic episodes

        -  To assess the safety and tolerability of the new formulation of insulin glargine

      -  Up to 4-week screening period;

        -  16-week open-label comparative efficacy and safety treatment period;

        -  4-week post-treatment safety follow-up period.

             3 months before screening visit;

          -  Use of an insulin pump in the last 6 months before screening visit;

          -  Any contraindication to use of insulin glargine as defined in the national product
             label;

          -  Not willing to inject insulin glargine as assigned by the randomization process once
             daily in the morning or evening;

          -  Hospitalization for diabetic ketoacidosis or history of severe hypoglycemia
             (requiring 3rd party assistance) in the last 6 months prior to randomization;

          -  Initiation of any glucose-lowering agents in the last 3 months before screening
             visit;

          -  Weight change of ≥5 kg during the last 3 months prior to screening visit;

          -  Unstable proliferative diabetic retinopathy or any other rapidly progressive diabetic
             retinopathy or macular edema likely to require laser, surgical treatment or
             injectable drugs during the study period;

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
