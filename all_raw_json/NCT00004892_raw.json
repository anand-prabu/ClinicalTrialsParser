Evaluate the safety and tolerance of\n      increasing duration for up to 2 weeks of continuously infused O6-benzylguanine at a dose\n      that will completely suppress tumor AGT activity combined with intracranially implanted\n      polifeprosan 20 with carmustine implants (Gliadel wafers) in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of O6-benzylguanine (O6-BG). Patients in the first\n      cohort receive O6-BG IV over 1 hour followed by continuous infusion of O6-BG for 2 days\n      prior to surgery. Patients undergo surgical resection and receive up to 8 polifeprosan 20\n      with carmustine implants (Gliadel wafers) in the resected tumor cavity. Cohorts of 14\n      patients receive escalating doses of O6-BG until 11 out of 14 patients in a cohort have\n      complete suppression of AGT levels. Once the dose of O6-BG that completely suppresses AGT\n      has been established, subsequent patients receive O6-BG IV beginning at least 1 hour prior\n      to surgery followed by the established continuous infusion dose beginning on the day of\n      surgery. The infusion continues for up to 14 days postoperatively. Cohorts of 6-12 patients\n      receive lengthened durations of continuous infusion O6-BG until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined or the length of the infusion reaches 14 days. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 3 of 6 or 5 of 12 patients experience dose limiting toxicities.\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months, and then until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 38 patients will be accrued for this study over 9.5 months."
