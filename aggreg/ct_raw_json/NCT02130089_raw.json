Patients who usually gain more fluid than is\n      considered ideal will be recruited for this project.  Because all patients gain different\n      amounts to start, data will be collected for 3 months while the patients receive their usual\n      amount of dietitian education.  Then the patients will receive intensive (2x/month)\n      education on reducing sodium intake from the dietitian and the same data will be collected\n      to see if they gain less after the education.  After 3 months of intensive education, data\n      will be collected for one more month to see if patients keep gaining less or if they go back\n      to their old patterns."
