  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the present proposal is to compare the clinical, endocrine and metabolic
      effects of therapy with combination saxagliptin and metformin to saxagliptin and metformin
      monotherapy in women with PCOS and prediabetic hyperglycemia (IFG, IGT or IFG/IGT).
      Saxagliptin is an oral dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitor whose mechanism of action
      is to prolong the duration of blood glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent
      insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels by inhibiting their degradation and thereby
      augmenting insulin secretion.  This study will serve as a pilot investigation to open
      perspectives for future studies to explore the potential of combining anti-diabetic drugs
      with different mechanisms of action in in patients with PCOS and impaired glucose regulation
      (IGR), especially ones for whom standard treatment with metformin is less effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A major change in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) was initiated by the
      understanding that many women with this disorder compensate insulin resistance with a period
      of hypersecretion of insulin by the pancreatic ß-cell.  In addition, women with PCOS have
      significantly higher basal insulin secretory rates, reduced insulin clearance rates, and
      attenuated secretory responses to meals.  The decreased postprandial response in these
      patients resembles the ß-cell dysfunction of type 2 diabetes (DM2) and may account for the
      increased incidence of impaired glucose tolerance in this population.  Current research has
      shown that the use of diabetes management practices aimed at reducing insulin resistance and
      hyperinsulinemia (such as weight reduction and the administration of oral antidiabetic
      drugs) in women with PCOS can not only improve glucose and lipid metabolism but can also
      reverse testosterone abnormalities and restore menstrual cycles.

      The optimal modality for long-term treatment of PCOS should positively influence androgen
      synthesis, sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG) production, the lipid profile, insulin
      sensitivity, and clinical symptoms including hirsutism and irregular menstrual cycles.
      Improvement of insulin sensitivity may reverse some of the demand on the ß-cell and promote
      improvement in glucose tolerance. However, while insulin resistance plays a key role in the
      predisposition to diabetes in PCOS; defects in insulin secretion also appear to contribute
      to its development. Preferably therapy for women with PCOS should also produce no weight
      gain, hypoglycemia, or other limiting or unmanageable side effects as well as preserve or
      enhance ß-cell function.

      Presently, in the literature, there are described new, more efficient methods of diabetes
      prevention in groups with a high risk of this disorder, which involve both, lifestyle
      modification and pharmacological therapies.  Lifestyle intervention was found to reduce the
      incidence of type 2 diabetes by 58% and metformin by 31% as compared with placebo.  The use
      of rosiglitazone in subjects with prediabetes resulted in a 60% reduction of the diabetes
      incidence rate.  Whether pharmacological therapy should be prescribed for diabetes
      prevention is an open question given that waiting to add drug therapy until diabetes
      develops can arrest β-cell decline, albeit at a lower level of β-cell function than when
      medications are used for prevention.  Studies are needed for optimal postpartum and
      long-term health of women who have had GDM.  Considerable recent evidence suggests that
      incretin-based therapies may be useful for the prevention of DM2.  Whereas native GLP-1 has
      a very short half-life, continuous infusion of GLP-1 improves first and second-phase insulin
      secretion suggesting that early GLP-1 therapy may preserve ß-cell function in subjects with
      IGT or mild DM2.  Incretin mimetics and inhibitors of the protease dipeptidyl peptidase
      (DPP)-4 use the anti-diabetic properties of the incretin hormone, glucagon-like peptide
      (GLP)-1 hormone to augment glucose-induced insulin secretion in a highly glucose-dependent
      manner, thus preventing GLP-1 alone from provoking hypoglycemia.  Additional beneficial
      effects of GLP-1 on endocrine pancreatic islets are that it 1) supports the synthesis of
      proinsulin to replenish insulin stores in β-cells; 2) reduces the rate of β-cell apoptosis
      when islets are incubated in a toxic environment (glucotoxicity, lipotoxicity, cytotoxic
      cytokines); and 3) promotes differentiation of precursor cells with the ability to develop
      into β-cells and proliferation of β-cell lines, and in whole animals (rodent studies), this
      leads to an increased β-cell mass within a few days or weeks.  Furthermore, GLP-1 can lower
      glucagon concentrations, i.e., induce α-cells to respond again to the inhibitory action of
      hyperglycemia, while leaving the counterregulatory glucagon responses undisturbed, as in the
      case of hypoglycemia.  Additional activities of GLP-1 are the deceleration of gastric
      emptying, which slows the entry of nutrients into the circulation after meals, a reduction
      in appetite, and earlier induction of satiety,  leading to weight reduction with chronic
      exposure.  Inhibition of DPP-4 increases the concentration of GLP-1 and may potentially
      delay disease progression in prediabetes considering the β-cell function improvement in DM2
      and β-cell mass shown to increase in animal models.  The objective of the present proposal
      is to compare the clinical, endocrine and metabolic effects of therapy with combination
      saxagliptin and metformin to saxagliptin and metformin monotherapy in women with PCOS and
      prediabetic hyperglycemia (IFG, IGT or IFG/IGT).  Since aberrant first-phase insulin
      secretion and impaired suppression of endogenous glucose production are major contributors
      to postprandial hyperglycemia and development of DM2, the effects of saxagliptin to target
      these defects, and normalize glucose excursions are likely to be clinically significant in
      patients with PCOS and impaired glucose regulation.  This study will evaluate the impact of
      treatment with combination of metformin and saxagliptin (Kombiglyze XR) compared to
      saxagliptin (Onglyza) or metformin XR (Glucophage XR) monotherapy over a 16-week period on
      glycemia and insulin action (fasting, 2 hour, and mean stimulated glucose levels, insulin
      sensitivity and secretion), hyperandrogenism (total T, DHEAS, SHBG and calculated free
      androgen index [FAI]), cardiometabolic markers (lipid profile, blood pressure), and
      anthropometric measurements (BMI, waist: hip ratio, absolute weight) in patients with PCOS
      and prediabetic hyperglycemia
