  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we will investigate the expression of the fructose transport protein GLUT5 in
      the small intestine in patients with functional GI disoders and fructose intolerance
      compared to matched healthy controls.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Intolerances to food are a major complaint of patients with functional gastrointestinal
      disorders (FGID) and even commoner in patients with inflammatory bowel disorders (IBD)
      (Barrett JS et al. Aliment Pharmacol Therap 2009;30:165-174). The most common forms of food
      intolerance are FODMAP (fermentable oligo-, di- and monosaccharide and polyol) -related, of
      which fructose and lactose are the best known. The prevalence of lactose and fructose
      intolerance in IBS patients is between 50 and 70% (Wilder-Smith CH et al. Gastroenterology
      2009;136 (Suppl. 1): A324). Recent high quality studies have shown that the reduction of
      ingested FODMAP can lead to significant and long-term symptom improvement in patients shown
      to be intolerant by breath-testing. While the pathophysiology behind lactose intolerance is
      the reduction in small intestinal lactase availability, the mechanism in fructose
      intolerance and its relationship to malabsorption are unknown. One possible and so far
      uninvestigated mechanism is a reduction in the expression or activity of the specific
      fructose transporter, GLUT5, which is mainly responsible for luminal absorption of fructose.
      GLUT5 is mainly found in the small intestine, as well as various extra-intestinal organs.
      The clinical relevance of GLUT5 expression for food intolerances in humans has not been
      reported, but in a mouse model deletion of GLUT5 led to decreased absorption of dietary
      fructose and typical signs of malabsorption (Barone S et al. J Biol Chem
      2009;284:5056-5066). The control of GLUT5 is dynamic and considerable upregulation together
      with increased absorption of fructose is evident in diabetes mellitus, while expression is
      decreased by inflammation and lipopolysaccharide endotoxin, an integral component of the
      outer membrane of all gram-negative bacteria, through the action of pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, such as TFN-a.
