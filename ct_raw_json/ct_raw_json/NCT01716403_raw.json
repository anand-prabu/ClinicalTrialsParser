The underlying mechanisms involved in this toxicity remain\n      unexplored but could also depend on the global exposure of telaprevir. The trough\n      concentration or AUC of telaprevir could therefore be a predictive factor of the onset of\n      anemia in patients treated by ribavirin/PEG-INF/telaprevir. The early measurement of\n      telaprevir and ribavirin concentrations could help to manage HCV tri-therapy to improve\n      tolerance and SVR."
