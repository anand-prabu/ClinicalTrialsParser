Subsequently, one group gets Ranibizumab in intervals of 2 months, whereas a second\n      group is treated on demand.\n\n      The primary end point of the study is the change of best-corrected visual acuity after 12\n      month.\n\n      Secondary end points include the impact of Ranibizumab on morphological changes of the\n      retina, the number of patients with gain or loss of 15 or more letters visual acuity after\n      12 months, changes in quality of life and the number of injections required during the first\n      12 months of treatment."
