This pilot will examine initial\n      feasibility, usability, acceptability, and child engagement/ comprehension of the\n      intervention.\n\n      RCT: A wait-list design will compare intervention use with a waitlist control on proximal\n      and child health outcomes at 6, 12, and 18 weeks after baseline enrollment. The Coping Coach\n      intervention will be provided to the waitlist control after the 12 week assessment.  70\n      children will be enrolled, 35 in each arm. (Assessment of feasibility and engagement will\n      continue in this stage.)\n\n      The rest of this CLINICALTRIALS.GOV record describes the RCT (N=70).\n\n      The Pilot and RCT combined will help us prepare for rigorous large-scale RCT of Coping\n      Coach."

The feelings module targets recognition of emotions after potentially traumatic experiences. The appraisals module targets the connection of helpful or unhelpful thoughts to feelings and behavior. The avoidance module targets reducing reliance on avoidance as a (maladaptive) coping response. Promoting social support is folded throughout the intervention. Information will be provided to parents about how to access additional resources and  when to get additional professional help.",
