Treatment continues every 28\n      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of R115777 and topotecan until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
