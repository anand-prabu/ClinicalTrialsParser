Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy or\n      radiation therapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy with topotecan,\n      cyclophosphamide, cisplatin, and vincristine plus radiation therapy and peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation in treating children with newly diagnosed medulloblastoma or supratentorial\n      primitive neuroectodermal tumor."

(Topotecan window closed to accrual 9/10/2001)\n\n        -  Determine the feasibility of four courses of high-dose chemotherapy (vincristine,\n           cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide) with peripheral blood stem cell support after\n           craniospinal irradiation (CSI) in these patients.\n\n        -  Estimate the 5-year overall survival and progression-free survival in patients treated\n           with risk-adapted CSI and high-dose chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Compare changes in intellectual functioning in patients treated with reduced-dose vs\n           standard-dose CSI.\n\n        -  Estimate the incidence of ototoxicity associated with risk-adapted CSI and posterior\n           fossa boost(s) given by 3-D conformal radiotherapy technique combined with amifostine\n           and cisplatin.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups based\n      on risk status.\n\n        -  Group 1 (average-risk): Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) or IV\n           daily until peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. PBSC are harvested when\n           blood counts recover. Patients then receive craniospinal irradiation (CSI) 5 days a\n           week for 6 weeks. Beginning 6 weeks after completion of CSI, patients receive high-dose\n           chemotherapy comprising vincristine IV followed by cisplatin IV over 6 hours on day -4\n           and cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. Patients receive amifostine IV\n           over 1 minute a maximum of 5 minutes prior to cisplatin infusion and then 3 hours into\n           cisplatin infusion. PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients receive G-CSF SC beginning on\n           day 1 and continuing for a minimum of 7 days or until blood counts recover. Vincristine\n           IV is administered on day 6. G-CSF is stopped 48 hours prior to beginning subsequent\n           courses of chemotherapy. High-dose chemotherapy repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n        -  Group 2 (high-risk): Patients receive topotecan IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 and G-CSF\n           SC or IV beginning 24 hours after completion of the first course of topotecan and\n           continuing until PBSC are harvested. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 2 courses. If\n           an adequate number of PBSC are not harvested, the patient undergoes a second harvest of\n           PBSC after the second course of topotecan. Patients then receive CSI, high-dose\n           chemotherapy, amifostine, and PBSC support as in group 1. (Topotecan window closed to\n           accrual 9/10/2001) Patients undergo neuropsychological testing prior to radiotherapy\n           and chemotherapy and then at 1, 2, and 5 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, and 24 months and then every 6 months\n      for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
