Hydration with a saline solution may protect kidney cells from\n      the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of glufosfamide with or\n      without hydration in treating patients who have pancreatic cancer that is metastatic or\n      cannot be removed by surgery."

Determine the activity of glufosfamide as determined by objective response in\n      patients with metastatic or inoperable locally advanced pancreatic cancer. II. Determine the\n      response rate in this patient population after this treatment. III. Determine the duration\n      of objective response in these patients on this treatment. IV. Determine the toxic effects\n      of this regimen in these patients. V. Assess the impact of hydration on the toxicity profile\n      of this treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms: Arm I: Patients receive glufosfamide IV over 1 hour on day 1. Arm II:\n      Patients receive glufosfamide as in arm I. Patients are hydrated with excess physiological\n      saline solution 4 hours before and for 3 hours after treatment with glufosfamide. Treatment\n      repeats every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Patients with an objective complete response continue treatment for a maximum of 2 courses\n      beyond confirmation of response. Patients are followed every 6 weeks until disease\n      progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-32 patients (8-16 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
