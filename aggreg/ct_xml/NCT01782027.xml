  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the use of radiolabeled particulate cholesterol
      administered intravenously in association with albumin, as a method to study reverse
      cholesterol transport (RCT) in people carrying mutations in genes known to affect HDL
      metabolism by analyzing changes in the tracer activity in total plasma, lipoproteins
      fractions and feces.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will use 3H-cholesterol bound to albumin (particulate cholesterol) to assess the
      ability of HDL to transport cholesterol from the periphery to the liver to be eliminated.
      This process is called reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) and is one of the main mechanisms
      by which HDL protect against atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Mutations in some of
      the genes affecting HDL metabolism, may results in changes in RCT. The validation of a
      method assessing RCT is important for the development of new drugs which affect RCT and may
      result in useful treatments for atherosclerosis.

      Subjects carrying mutations in genes known to affect HDL metabolism and healthy controls
      will be enrolled in the study. Changes in the tracer activity in total plasma, lipoproteins
      fractions and feces will be analyzed following the intravenous administration of
      radiolabeled particulate cholesterol.
