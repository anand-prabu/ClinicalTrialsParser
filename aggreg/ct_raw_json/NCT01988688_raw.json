Up to 10 subjects will be implanted.  The DBS stimulation parameters are\n      patient-specific and will be allowed to vary over the course of the treatment periods,\n      calibrated by the TFI.  During Period I, stimulation will be continuous. During  Period II,\n      there  will  be  three  stimulation OFF/ON epochs, where the stimulation will be turned OFF\n      and then turned back ON when the tinnitus loudness returns to a certain level (based on a\n      change in the TFI score).  During Period III, stimulation will be \"on demand,\" i.e.\n      controlled by the subject and determined by subject preference.  An important goal is to\n      determine whether tinnitus can be controlled through optimization of stimulation parameters."
