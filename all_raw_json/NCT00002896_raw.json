Combining more than one drug, giving the drugs in different\n      ways, and combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus\n      fluorouracil and leucovorin before surgery given with or without fluorouracil and leucovorin\n      after surgery in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer."

Assess the local recurrence rate, cost-benefit ratio, and acute and late\n      toxicity associated with concomitant preoperative radiotherapy and fluorouracil/leucovorin\n      (5-FU/CF) in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum. II. Compare the\n      relapse rate, survival rate, disease-free interval, and cost-benefit ratio associated with 6\n      courses of postoperative 5-FU/CF vs. no further treatment in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by tumor stage, age, type of\n      surgery, and participating institution. Patients are randomly assigned to one of two groups.\n      The first group receives radiotherapy to the tumor over 5 weeks and concomitant\n      fluorouracil/leucovorin for 5 consecutive days on the first and fifth weeks. Four to six\n      weeks later, patients undergo complete resection, followed upon recovery by\n      fluorouracil/leucovorin every 4 weeks for 6 courses. The second group receives preoperative\n      chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery, as above, with no postoperative treatment. Patients\n      are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 774 patients will be entered on this multicenter study."
