Baseline information about the company's\n      practices and employees' physical activity is collected in November 2013 with questionnaires\n      and accelerometers. The teams are supported with materials and three meetings and the\n      opportunity to obtain physical activity services from the regional offices of the Finnish\n      Sport Confederation. The development process is carried out in Fall 2013 and the actions to\n      promote physical activity and to reduce sedentary behavior are implemented in the companies\n      during spring and fall 2014. The follow-up evaluation with the same measures as at baseline\n      will be conducted in November 2014."
