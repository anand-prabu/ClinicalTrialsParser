  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multiple-arm, multiple-stage (MAMS), phase 2, open label, randomized,
      controlled clinical trial that will compare the efficacy and safety of four experimental
      four drug regimens with a standard control regimen in patients with smear positive,
      pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Patients will be randomly allocated to the control or one of
      the four experimental regimens in the ratio 2:1:1:1:1. Experimental regimens will be given
      for 12 weeks. Thereafter, participants in the experimental arms will receive continuation
      phase treatment for 14 weeks containing standard-dose rifampicin and isoniazid. All
      participants will receive 25 mg of vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with every dose of INH to prevent
      INH‐related neuropathy. Interim analyses will be conducted during the trial for efficacy,
      with the aim of identifying experimental arms that perform below a pre‐specified efficacy
      threshold; these arms will then be stopped from further recruitment.

      Following the first scheduled interim analysis on March 3rd, the Trial Steering Committee
      (TSC) followed a recommendation of the independent data monitoring committee (IDMC) and has
      stopped the enrolment into two of the arms in the MAMS-TB trial: HRZQ and HR20ZQ, based on
      these arms not meeting the pre-specified gain in efficacy over control. Importantly, there
      was no safety concern that prompted stopping recruitment to these arms. They recommended
      that recruitment to arm 2 (HRZQ) and 3 (HR20ZQ) be terminated as there was insufficient
      evidence that these regimens could shorten treatment. Importantly, there was no evidence
      that either arm was inferior to standard treatment (the control arm) with regards to
      efficacy. There was, however, sufficient evidence that the other intervention arms HR35ZE
      and HR20ZM could shorten treatment to continue enrolling patients.

      This Phase II, multi‐arm, multi‐stage, open label, prospectively randomized, controlled
      clinical trial will compare the efficacy and safety of four experimental regimens with the
      control, standard treatment regimen in patients with smear positive, pulmonary tuberculosis
      (TB). There will be four experimental regimens. Participants will be randomly allocated to
      control or one of the four experimental intensive phase regimens in the ratio 2:1:1:1:1. The
      control and 4 experimental regimens are:

      Control: HRZE isoniazid, rifampicin standard, pyrazinamide, ethambutol Arm 1: HRZQlow
      isoniazid, rifampicin standard, pyrazinamide, SQ109 150 mg Arm 2: HRZQhigh isoniazid,
      rifampicin standard, pyrazinamide, SQ109 300 mg Arm 3: HR20ZQhigh isoniazid, rifampicin 20
      mg/kg, pyrazinamide, SQ109 300 mg Arm 4: HR20ZM isoniazid, rifampicin 20 mg/kg,
      pyrazinamide, moxifloxacin 400mg

      Up to 372 participants will be randomized into this study, with 124 participants being
      randomized to the control arm and 62 participants to each experimental arm. With an expected
      loss to follow‐up of 5%, the final power of the study to detect a hazard ratio of 1.8 for
      culture conversion to negative will be 90%, at the 5% significance level.

      Participants will be randomised using a probabilistic minimisation algorithm based on site,
      baseline bacterial load as measured by GeneXpert MTB/RIF®, and HIV status. The allocated
      intensive phase of the four experimental arms will be administered daily for twelve weeks.
      During this time, participants will visit the study clinic on a weekly basis for sputum
      collection, safety monitoring and receipt of study medication. After the completion of the
      experimental treatment, participants in the experimental arms will receive daily standard
      continuation phase treatment for 14 weeks containing standard‐dose RIF and INH to complete
      their TB treatment course. Participants in the control arm will receive eight weeks of
      intensive four‐drug treatment (HRZE, followed by 18 weeks of the HR continuation phase
      treatment in line with the current WHO recommendations.

      All participants will receive 25mg of Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) with every dose of treatment
      in order to prevent INH‐related neuropathy.

      Interim analyses will be conducted during the trial for efficacy at predetermined times,
      with the aim of identifying experimental arms that perform below a pre‐specified efficacy
      threshold. There will be no further recruitment to these arms.

        Inclusion Criteria

          1. The patient has given free, signed written or witnessed oral informed consent for
             study participation prior to all trial‐related procedures, including HIV testing if
             HIV serostatus is not known or the last documented negative is more than four weeks
             ago.

          2. The patient has a diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis from a health clinic
             established by sputum smear and/or GeneXpert MTB/RIF® and/or chest X‐ray.

          3. An adequate sputum bacterial load is confirmed by a Ziehl‐Neelsen stained smear in
             the study laboratory, done from concentrated sputum found at least 1+ on the
             IUATLD/WHO scale.

          4. The patient has a valid rapid test result (GeneXpert MTB/RIF®) from the sputum
             positive for MTB complex, and indicating susceptibility to Rifampicin. This test must
             be done in the study laboratory.

          5. The patient is aged at least 18 years at the day of informed consent.

          6. The patient has a body weight in light clothing and without shoes of at least 35 kg,

             birth control for female patients has to include two methods, including methods that
             the patient's sexual partner(s) use. At least one must be a barrier method. Female
             patients are considered not to be of childbearing potential if they are
             post‐menopausal with no menses for the last 12 months, or surgically sterile (this
             condition is fulfilled by bilateral oophorectomy, hysterectomy, and by tubal ligation
             which is done at least 12 months prior to enrolment).

          8. Male patients must consent to use an effective contraceptive method, if their sexual
             partner(s) is/are of childbearing potential, and if they are not surgically sterile
             (see 6.). Contraception by male participants must be practised until at least week 24
             to cover the period of spermatogenesis. Contraceptive methods used by male
             participants may include hormonal methods used by the partner(s).

          9. The patient has a firm home address that is readily accessible for visiting and
             willingness to inform the study team of any change of address during trial
             participation, or will be compliant to study schedule, in the discretion of the
             investigator.

             clinically significant evidence of severe TB (e.g. miliary TB, TB meningitis. Limited
             lymph node involvement will not lead to exclusion); serious lung conditions other
             than TB or severe respiratory impairment in the discretion of the investigator;
             neuropathy, epilepsy or significant psychiatric disorder; uncontrolled and/or
             insulin‐dependent diabetes; cardiovascular disease such as myocardial infarction,
             heart failure, coronary heart disease, uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood
