This can be achieve by using SPY\n      intra-operative vascular angiography, which is commonly used in clinical practice to assess\n      perfusion of wound closure at the clinic. By understanding the differences in perfusion\n      afforded by different closure techniques, surgeons will then be able to select the technique\n      that optimizes this parameter so as to avoid complications such as tissue necrosis,  wound\n      dehiscence, or infection."
