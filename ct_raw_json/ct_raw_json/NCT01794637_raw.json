            "textblock": "End - stage liver disease can cause many problems to the patients including fatigue,\n      weakness,jaundice, confusion, abdominal pain and distension. Another important problem is\n      the cardiovascular system (heart and blood vessels). There will be the impairment of heart\n      function to pump blood to the distal part of the body. Blood vessels are also affected by\n      the imbalance of chemical agents which are not detoxified by diseased liver, resulting in\n      impairment of oxygen carrying capacity and tissue oxygen exchange. Mechanism of this process\n      is still poorly understood.\n\n      This is a study about the peripheral vascular dysfunction by means of vascular occlusion\n      test (VOT). Blood pressure cuff is inflated (to occlude the proximal vessels and induce\n      distal part ischemia), then deflated and observing the distal tissue oxygenation\n      (StO2)change by the probe (Near-infrared spectroscopy : NIRS) at the hand. From our\n      knowledge, there is no study in patients undergoing liver transplantation.\n\n      The study investigator would like to observe the change in peripheral tissue oxygenation in\n      different time points during the liver transplantation. We hypothesize that there is a\n      change in microcirculatory function and StO2 in end-stage liver disease patients detected by\n      VOT and NIRS."
