  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder that primarily affects female
      children. Rett syndrome is characterized by significant elevation in blood markers of
      oxidative stress. EPI-743 is a novel therapeutic with demonstrated efficacy and safety in
      the treatment of disorders characterized by oxidative stress. The purpose of this study is
      to examine the safety and efficacy of EPI-743 in a population of children with Rett
      syndrome.
