            "textblock": "The group A streptococcus (GAS) or Streptococcus pyogenes is a strictly human pathogen ,\n      which can cause a wide variety of infections. These range from a simple asymptomatic\n      carriage up to 20 % of children , or minor illnesses such as sore throat or impetigo, to\n      severe conditions such as necrotizing fasciitis and toxic shock syndrome .\n\n      The pathophysiological mechanisms of invasive GAS infections are poorly understood. These\n      mechanisms could involve not only virulence factors of the bacterium ( M protein determines\n      the emm genotype , but also super- antigenic exotoxins SpeA , Spe C, Ssa, Sme z or other\n      virulence genes , SilC , ... Sic ), but also in some cases, factors associated with host\n      immunity in particular in the absence of risk factors for invasive skin infection such as\n      cutaneous effraction ( wound , burn , chicken pox ) , corticosteroids or other\n      immunosuppressive therapy and recent surgery .\n\n      The investigators assume that in some invasive GAS infections, especially in children\n      without risk factors, Mendelian susceptibility to infection may be involved . This\n      hypothesis could be tested by studying the molecular characteristics of strains isolated SGA\n      and innate and adaptive immunity in children hospitalised for invasive GAS infection with or\n      without identified risk factors for infection.\n\n      This study could not only lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiological\n      mechanisms of invasive GAS infections but also to detect in children who underwent invasive\n      GAS genetic susceptibility to infections requiring specific care . Finally, it could also\n      identify specific strains of SGA or molecular profiles, whose detection in practice, lead to\n      a suspicion of hereditary immune deficiency."
