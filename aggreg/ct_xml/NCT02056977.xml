      The purpose of this study is to:

        -  Compare PEEP level selected by individualized PEEP titration by electrical impedance
           tomography and PEEP level routinely used in post-operative cardiac patients with ARDS;

        -  Compare the stability of the selected PEEP in both groups: individualized PEEP
           titration by electrical impedance tomography and the Control group (default strategy
           currently used in the institution)

        -  Evaluate the agreement between the results of a rapid titration (total procedure
           duration = 5 min) versus an already validated slow titration (total procedure duration
           = 40 min) of the same patient, sequentially. Specifically, degree of collapse and
           degree of distention in each PEEP level, estimated by EIT;

        -  Compare hemodynamic and oxygenation effects during the two maneuvers titration;

        -  Evaluate the stability of the selected PEEP according to the rapid titration (minimum
           PEEP capable of collapsing equal or less 1%) in the maintenance of three variables over
           a four hour period: arterial oxygenation, respiratory system compliance, and degree of
           collapse by EIT;

        -  Compare these results (evolution of the three variables, within 4 hours) compared to
           control (default strategy currently used in the institution) group.

        -  Evaluate collapse amount determined by electrical impedance tomography (collapse &lt; 1%)
           and compares with collapse amount determined by pulmonary ultrasound during PEEP
           titration and pulmonary recruitment maneuver .

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) increases the morbidity and mortality of
      patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). In the postoperative period of cardiac
      surgery, the use of intraoperative extracorporeal circulation is one of the factors
      triggering the syndrome, its incidence increasing.

      Potentially, a protective ventilatory strategy with optimal positive end expiratory pressure
      (PEEP) could improve the prognosis of those patients with ARDS.

      An already validated maneuver to titrate the ideal PEEP to these patients has a longer
      duration, about 40 minutes. The lung Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) monitors
      respiratory system mechanics and intrathoracic lung volume changes and provides information
      about regional behavior and recruitability of lung tissue and thereby allows shortening
      titration maneuver, reducing its hemodynamic effects.

      Pulmonary Ultrasound (PU) is a useful tool in the alveolar-interstitial syndrome,
      consolidations, pleural effusion and pneumothorax diagnosis, and often has higher accuracy
      than chest radiography performed at bedside. Furthermore, recent studies have shown that PU
      can identify and quantify the changes in lung aeration secondary to different treatments and
      procedures, and individual optimization of the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP).

      Will participate this study patients in the postoperative period of cardiac surgery with a
      diagnosis of ARDS diagnosed from PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt; 250 mmHg calculated values supplied by
      arterial blood gas collected with FiO2 60% and presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest
      radiography, admitted to the surgical ICU from Heart Institute, University of SÃ£o Paulo.

      Recruitment maneuver and PEEP titration maneuver will be monitored by EIT and PU.

      All patients will be followed and monitored for 4 hours, with measures of the evolution of
      alveolar collapse . Hemodynamic and oxygenation data will also be recorded .
