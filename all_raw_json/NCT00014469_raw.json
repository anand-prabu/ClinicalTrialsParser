Combining chemotherapy with bone marrow transplantation may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of busulfan and melphalan followed by\n      donor bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have advanced hematologic cancer."

Patients undergo T-cell replete allogeneic bone marrow transplantation on day\n      0. For graft-versus-host disease prophylaxis, patients receive tacrolimus IV continuously or\n      every 12 hours beginning on day -1 and continuing for 50 days to 6 months followed by a\n      taper. Once oral medications are tolerated, patients switch to oral tacrolimus every 12\n      hours. Patients also receive methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly through day 100, every 6 weeks for 3 months, every 3 months for\n      1 year, and then every 3-6 months for 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
