The significance of the vasopressin system during physical exercise is unclear. If\n      vasopressin is a significant regulator of exercise hemodynamics in HF, strategies to\n      intervene against activation of the V1A-receptor might be expected to improve HF symptoms\n      and possibly outcome.\n\n      The potential effects of the central hemodynamic system will be evaluated with a Swan-Ganz\n      catheter. Echocardiography will be performed at rest and during submaximal working capacity\n      before and during the infusion of a vasopressin receptor antagonist (conivaptan) or placebo.\n      Cardiac output will be measured by thermodilution. The exercise test will be performed at 50\n      % of VO2 max and hemodynamic and echocardiographic measurements will be collected. The\n      exercise test will be performed on a supine multistage bicycle."
