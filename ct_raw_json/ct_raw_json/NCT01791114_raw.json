            "textblock": "Recent findings document the presence of active brown adipose tissue (BAT) in humans. Cold\n      exposure via adrenergic stimulation activates BAT, which combusts significant amounts of\n      blood glucose and free fatty acid (FFA) to produce heat. Animal studies suggest that BAT\n      activation improves insulin sensitivity. However, the effect of cold-induced BAT activation\n      on insulin sensitivity and glucose kinetics in humans remains unknown. The investigators'\n      central hypothesis is that cold-induced BAT activation increases whole body insulin\n      sensitivity in humans via augmented plasma glucose and FFA clearance. The specific aims of\n      this study are to define the effects of prolonged (8h) cold exposure BAT activation on:\n      insulin sensitivity (Aim 1); lipolysis and plasma glucose and FFA kinetics (Aim 2).\n      Moreover, the investigators plan to investigate for alternative ways, which can activate BAT\n      including cold water ingestion, a single meal ingestion, and a single bout of moderate\n      intensity exercise (Aim 3). For the cold exposure study, subjects will complete 3 trials: a)\n      8hrs of cold exposure at their individually determined shivering threshold; b) 8hrs of cold\n      exposure at their individually determined shivering threshold plus propranolol; c) 8hrs in\n      thermoneutral conditions (26 - 28\u00b0C). For the rest of the arms of subjects will complete two\n      trials: cold  or tepid water ingestion, a single meal ingestion or no food ingestion, and a\n      single bout of moderate intensity exercise or no exercise.To study the above aims, the\n      investigators will use positron emission tomography - computed tomography, hyperinsulinemic\n      euglycemic clamp, infusion of stable isotopes, and tissue biopsies. The findings will\n      illuminate the role of BAT on plasma substrate regulation and insulin sensitivity and may\n      aid in the development of lifestyle recommendations and pharmacotherapy for the prevention\n      and treatment of diabetes and insulin resistance."
