      Hispanic Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders are underrepresented in cancer clinical
      trials. The purpose of this study is to develop and test education programs designed to
      reduce barriers and Increase facilitators associated with cancer clinical trials
      participation for Hispanic Americans and Asian/Pacific Islanders. Focus groups were
      conducted with Hispanic American men and women to obtain culturally-linked attitudes related
      to clinical trials participation. This information was used to create a prototypic
      educational program anticipated to increase participation in clinical trials.  It was then
      vetted and honed via additional focus groups.

      Simultaneously, a validation study was conducted with Hispanic Americans for a packet of
      psychosocial instruments  that could be used for a subsequent randomized controlled trial to
      evaluate the impact of the clinical trials education program.

      The finalized clinical trials education program was tested via a randomized controlled
      trial.  Participants assigned to the experimental group received the  clinical trials
      education program, while participants in the control arm were administered a comparable, but
      non-relevant education program.  Recruitment to this study has been completed.

      A comparable approach is being used to develop a program(s) for Asian/Pacific Islanders.
      Recruitment to the focus groups is still underway.
