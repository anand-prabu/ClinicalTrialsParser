Determine qualitative and quantitative\n      toxicities of bryostatin 1 in these patients. III. Determine duration of response and\n      survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive bryostatin 1 by continuous IV infusion over 72 hours. Courses\n      repeat every 14 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for at\n      least 4 courses. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) are treated with 4 additional\n      courses beyond CR.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-27 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
