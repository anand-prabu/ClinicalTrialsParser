And the color of the anterior teeth higher is classified as A2 or greater value ,\n      according to the scale VITA Classical (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany) and the\n      spectrophotometer Easyshade Vita (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). Evaluation of\n      color through the VITA scale Classical will be made independently by two calibrated\n      investigators and blind.\n\n      Be excluded from the study patients: they have already made treatment tooth whitening, or\n      dental prosthesis having options at the upper front teeth , who are pregnant or lactating ,\n      presenting gingival recession, sensitivity dental, endodontic treatment in anterior\n      maxillary teeth, which have a coloring severe internal, if they have non-carious cervical\n      lesions, are taking medications , using fixed orthodontic appliances, submit bruxism habits,\n      which have visible teeth cranks and those who are not available to attend the controls.\n\n      Study Design Patients will be divided into two groups (n = 60 ), GC (control group) and GE\n      (group experimental ). At the initial consultation volunteers will be asked about smoking\n      habits daily. Patients who do not smoke will be part of the GC, and heavy smokers (more than\n      10 day ) will be part of GE.A cigarettes all smokers are complementary be given a booklet of\n      tips for quitting smoking and damage, and sites where to find more information. (Annex C )\n      The teeth whitening technique selected for this study, is the technique of home bleaching,\n      validated for both groups. Treatment and follow-up will no cost to the patient . For the\n      development of individual buckets, this will be through impression of the upper and lower\n      arch of each patient Jeltrate Plus alginate ( Dentply, Petr\u00f3polis, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil),\n      the molds will be cast in plaster and immediately after printing. After obtaining this\n      plaster model is cut and taken to the vacuum laminator ( Prot\u00e9cni, Araraquara, Sao Paulo,\n      Brazil) for making buckets individual vinyl acetate 1 mm thick (Plate Pail Whiteness -FGM,\n      Joinville, Santa Catarina, Brazil). Cuvettes acetate be cut an inch margin on gingival . For\n      both groups of PC gel will be used 10% ( Whiteness Perfect, FGM, Joinville, Santa Catarina,\n      Brazil ), for a period of 3 hours a day for three weeks ) . After the test cuvette acetate\n      individual, the method of application of the product will be carefully explained to each\n      patient in the study as follows : Dispense a drop in the region of the product corresponding\n      to the buccal surface of each tooth in the tray. The amount of gel should be sufficient to\n      remain in contact with the buccal tooth surface without covering the gingival third,\n      preventing injuries from it. After this period, patients will be instructed to withdraw the\n      tray with the whitening gel and perform vigorous mouth rinsed with water to complete removal\n      of the product.\n\n      Evaluation of Color Subjective method Color will be assessed by the scale VITA Classical\n      (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany ), consisting of 16 color guides, organized by\n      value, higher value (B1 ) to low value ( C4 ). Although this scale is not linear, it is\n      organized according to a ranking range valor. Represent and the purpose of analysis.\n\n      Two blind reviewers record the color of the right maxillary central incisor patients through\n      the scale VITA Classical (Vita Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany). At the following times :\n      initial, 1st week, 2nd week, 3rd week (active phase bleaching) and post- bleaching periods :\n      1 week, 1 month, 2 and 3 months. Evaluators always record the color independently in the\n      same room with the same lighting. If there is a discrepancy in the color registration, a new\n      evaluation will be conducted together until a consenso. The area chosen for color\n      measurement is the middle third of the labial surface of the central incisor, according to\n      the ADA specifications . The color change will be evaluated by means of varying scale Vita\n      units ( \u0394UEV ) organized by value.\n\n      Objective method The color will also be measured with the spectrophotometer Easyshade ( Vita\n      Zahnfabrik, Bad Sackingen, Germany ) according to the CIELab system of Vita. Calibration of\n      equipment will always be made \u200b\u200bbefore each measurement, and three measurements for each\n      tooth will be made. The evaluation will be conducted at the same times that the method\n      subjective. For standardize the measuring of color, a mold of the teeth of the upper arch\n      with heavy condensation silicone (Coltoflax profile and cub, Vigodent, Rio de Janeiro will\n      be held, Brazil ) for making a silicone matrix. The matrix was used to standardize the\n      region of the tooth in which the color is measured with the spectrophotometer. The matrix\n      will be drilled in the vestibular region, in the middle third, in the upper teeth, using a\n      scalpel circular 6 mm in diameter, Biopsy punch ( Miltex, York, PA  USA), similar diameter\n      to the tip of the spectrophotometer Vita Easyshade. Color recurrence begins the day the\n      patient is bleached, the spectrophotometer used has a sufficient sensitivity to determine\n      minimal color changes, is based on the construction algorithm for the detection of the\n      dimensions h and b color . (Jadad et al. , 2011)\n\n      Evaluation of the Dental Sensitivity In the initial clinical examination of patients ,\n      baseline sensitivity is measured by the vertical , horizontal drum , air jet application and\n      probing of all teeth, so it can be compared with the sensitivity during the whitening\n      dental.Durante whitening, patients record the presence or absence of tooth sensitivity, in a\n      newspaper of tooth sensitivity using analog numerical scale (ENR ), with values \u200b\u200bfrom 0 to\n      4, where: 0 = no tenderness, 1 = Slight, 2 = moderate 3 = considerably and 4 = severe. And\n      on the visual analogue scale (VAS ) with values \u200b\u200bfrom 0 to 10 where 0 = no sensitivity and\n      10 = severe. Patients mark a vertical line across the horizontal line of the scale\n      corresponding to the intensity of tooth sensitivity. After measurement in millimeters are\n      made \u200b\u200bwith the aid of a millimeter ruler. Annex 5 and 6 values \u200b\u200bwill be organized into two\n      categories: percentage of patients with tooth sensitivity at some time during treatment (\n      absolute risk sensitivity ) and intensity of tooth sensitivity.\n\n      Patients with severe sensitivity will be immediately assisted by investigators to reverse\n      the painful picture using desensitizing and / or analgesics and anti-inflammatories for pain\n      relief, the patient will be removed from study. If sensitivity is used desensitizing FMG KF\n      2% ( nitrate Potassium and Sodium Fluoride 2%, Joinville, Brazil) , the literature does not\n      present any report about RAM, if for any reason there is any Medical Adverse Event the\n      research team will be responsible for any additional medical or dental treatment required\n      and its follow-up, in the wake of whitening procedure ( restorations, endodontics, etc. )\n\n      Statistical Analysis The color data obtained by the objective and subjective analysis will\n      be evaluated by analysis of variance of two factors (ANOVA ) for repeated measures ( time\n      vs. treatment groups ) ( \u03b1 = 0.05). Tukey's test performed to test the means ( \u03b1 = 0.05).\n      The absolute risk of sensitivity will be evaluated by the Fisher exact test .\n\n      Sampling calculation was obtained by the G -Power 3.1 program considering a Beta error 0.8,\n      and an alpha error 0.05, meaning a sample calculation of 25 patients per group per center,\n      considering the drop-out reported in other published work ( 5%) was decided to increase to\n      30 the n sample size for each group per center. Coincident with the Odds Ratio of all\n      clinical work whitening the past 10 years."
