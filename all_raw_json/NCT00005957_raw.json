It is not yet known if radiation\n      therapy to the breast alone following surgery is more effective than radiation therapy to\n      the breast plus surrounding tissue in treating invasive breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy to the breast alone\n      to see how well it works compared to radiation therapy to the breast plus surrounding tissue\n      in treating women who have undergone surgery for early-stage invasive breast cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      number of positive nodes (0 vs 1-3 vs more than 3), number of axillary nodes removed (<10, >\n      or equal to 10);  type of chemotherapy (anthracycline containing vs other vs none), hormonal\n      therapy (yes vs no), number of axillary lymph nodes excised*, and participating center.\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n      NOTE: * Patients with a negative sentinel node dissection with or without an axillary\n      dissection will be stratified according to the total number of nodes removed\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo standard breast radiotherapy alone 5 days a week for 5 weeks in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo breast and regional radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Radiotherapy in both arms begins as soon as possible after randomization. Radiotherapy must\n      begin within 8 weeks after completion of adjuvant IV chemotherapy, unless radiotherapy is\n      administered concurrently with chemotherapy (i.e., cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and\n      fluorouracil [CMF]), or within 16 weeks after the last breast surgery for patients treated\n      with hormonal therapy alone.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed (in patients in certain participating centers) within 2 weeks\n      prior to randomization, during the last week of radiotherapy, at 3 and 9 months after\n      completion of radiotherapy, and then annually until first distant disease recurrence.\n\n      Cosmetic outcome is assessed (in patients in certain participating centers) within 2 weeks\n      prior to randomization, and then at 3 and 5 years after completion of radiotherapy or until\n      first distant disease recurrence.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 9 months, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1,822 patients will be accrued for this study within\n      approximately 4 years."
