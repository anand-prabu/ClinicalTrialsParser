Patients\n      are stratified according to planned radiotherapy dose (less than 6,000 cGy vs at least 6,000\n      cGy), estimated amount of oral mucosa in the radiation field (60% or less vs more than 60%),\n      age (under 50 vs 50 and over), concurrent chemotherapy (yes vs no), and smoking (yes vs no).\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral zinc sulfate 3 times daily beginning the first week of\n           radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebo 3 times daily beginning the first week of\n           radiotherapy.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues daily during and for 1 month after radiotherapy in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, weekly during treatment, and then at 1, 2, 3, and 6\n      months after the completion of treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 3, and 6 months after the completion of treatment and then\n      every 6 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 168 patients (84 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
