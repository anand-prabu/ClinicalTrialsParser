It is used to treat stroke (mild-to-moderate cerebral infarction) in recovery\n      phlegm and Syndrome of Intermingled Phlegm and Blood Stasis.\n\n      The aim of this study is to explore the rule of absorption, distribution, metabolism and\n      elimination after intravenous administration of Ginkgolides Meglumine Injection healthy\n      subjects. The plasma drug profiles will be important to assess the potential clinical\n      drug-drug interactions.\n\n      Biological sample including blood and urine for PK is collected during the study. In the\n      first stage, the biological sample of two subjects will be collected at different time\n      points. In the second stage, the biological sample of another two subjects will be collected\n      at the time points which are adjusted according to the results of the first stage."
