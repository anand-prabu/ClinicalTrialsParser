    <textblock>
      Healthy volunteers without concussion, currently participating in non-or-limited contact
      sports teams at Emory University will undergo Display Enhanced Testing for Concussion and
      mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (DETECT) on three separate days: at baseline, day 50, and
      day 90. Prior to enrollment participants will be allocated to the test-retest arm or the
      exercise arm.
