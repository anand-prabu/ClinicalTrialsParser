Second group is for control subjects without\n      depression. An option for a third group is planned to include first degree relatives of the\n      depressed patients. After giving their informed consents, subjects and patients will go\n      through standard clinical psychiatric interview, and routine clinical lab tests. Clinical\n      standard, specific depression and anxiety questionnaires will be held at four follow-up\n      meetings: at start; after 2 weeks; 4 weeks; and 10 weeks. Subjects and patients will be\n      asked to give blood samples at these points of time for the lab processing: Complete plasma\n      proteomics and specific micro-RNA levels."
