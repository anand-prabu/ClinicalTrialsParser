      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety of long-term ivacaftor treatment in
      subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) from Studies 110 (NCT01614457, 111 (NCT01614470)or 113
      (NCT01685801).

      Ivacaftor is the first CFTR modulator to show an improvement in CFTR function and clinical
      benefit in patients with CF. Results from Phase 3 studies (VX08-770-102 [Study 102] and
      VX08-770-103 [Study 103]) showed that ivacaftor is effective in the treatment of patients
      with CF who have the G551D-CFTR mutation, as evidenced by sustained improvements in CFTR
      channel function (measured by reduction in sweat chloride concentration) and corresponding
      substantial, durable improvements in lung function, pulmonary exacerbations, respiratory
      symptoms, and weight gain. Ivacaftor was also well tolerated, as evidenced by the rates and
      reasons for premature discontinuation and results of safety assessments.

      Ivacaftor (Trade Name Kalydeco; 150 mg tablets) was initially approved in the United States
      for the treatment of CF in patients 6 years of age and older who have a G551D mutation in
      the CFTR gene.
