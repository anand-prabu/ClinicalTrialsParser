Currently, if a patient is receiving\n      cisplatin, hearing is tested and monitored only when it is requested by their physician.\n      Researchers think that hearing testing prior to each treatment with cisplatin may reduce the\n      number of Veterans who get disabling hearing loss from treatment. The purpose of this study\n      is to compare the current method of monitoring hearing (only when requested by the\n      physician) with a new hearing monitoring program that tests hearing prior to each cisplatin\n      treatment.\n\n      Approximately, 320 Veterans receiving cisplatin chemotherapy and an additional 120 healthy\n      subjects not administered chemotherapy will be enrolled at the Portland VA Medical Center.\n      Subjects will be randomly assigned to one monitoring method. Answers to questionaires will\n      be obtained and phone calls will be made at pre-arranged intervals All will be followed for\n      1 year. Healthy subjects will be tested at 5 specified timess only."

Research objectives are:  to compare the effectiveness of\n      ototoxicity monitoring implemented using Comp-VA and standard of care testing (SOC) with\n      regard to (1) improving Veterans' hearing and quality of life outcomes and use of\n      audiological rehabilitation services and (2) assisting Oncologists in chemotherapeutic\n      planning and counseling. In order to achieve these objectives, we propose a randomized trial\n      conducted at the Portland VA Medical Center.  We plan to recruit a total of 320 Veterans\n      undergoing cisplatin chemotherapeutic treatment over 4 years and 120 control subjects.\n\n      Program Evaluation: Hearing testing prior to treatment will be done by an NCRAR research\n      audiologist not associated with the intervention groups in order to establish eligibility,\n      enroll and randomize each subject into one of two study arms. At 5 weeks and at one year\n      post-randomization hearing will be re-tested in order to obtain an estimate of longitudinal\n      trends in hearing and quality of life assessment. Use of audiological services following\n      treatment from the randomized subjects will be tracked. Finally, data will also be collected\n      at each treatment interval to track use of counseling tools and oncology personnel treatment\n      decisions.\n\n      Proposed Intervention Groups: Serial measurements from subjects receiving cisplatin prior to\n      treatment who are randomized to the Comp-VA group will be obtained at each treatment\n      interval and at one-month post-treatment. Auditory testing will be done on the Chemo Unit\n      and will include otoscopy, immittance testing, automated air conduction hearing testing, and\n      distortion product otoacoustic emissions (DPOAEs). The SOC group will receive the current\n      standard of care:  full audiometric evaluations (otoscopy, immittance testing, air\n      conduction and bone conduction hearing testing, speech audiometry, and DPOAEs) in a\n      sound-treated booth before chemotherapy with any further testing done by oncology request.\n      Additional data will also be collected from control subjects who are similar in age and are\n      tested at intervals similar to the chemotherapy subjects."
