      Hsp90 is a chemical in the body that is involved in the promotion of cancer. SNX-5422 is an
      experimental drug that blocks Hsp90

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) chaperone proteins stabilize well over 200 different known
      client proteins helping them to fold correctly as they take up their rightful positions in
      the cell. Hsp90 has a special fondness for oncoproteins whose structures shift according to
      functional state. Among Hsp90's clients, a surprising number are well recognized targets in
      oncology, including human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). SNX-5422 is a pro-drug
      of SNX-2112, a potent, highly selective, small-molecule inhibitor of the molecular chaperone
      heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Treatment of HER2-positive cell lines such as BT-474 with the
      Hsp90 inhibitor SNX-2112 results in cellular degradation, decreased levels of
      phospho-AKT/cyclin D1, and increased apoptosis. Furthermore, treatment with SNX-5542 caused
      tumor regression, including remission in a HER2-overexpressing breast cancer xenograft
      model. SNX-5422 has demonstrated significant antitumor activity in mouse xenograft models of
      various human malignancies, including breast (BT474, MX-1), lung (H1975, H1650, EBC-1),
      colon (HT29), prostate (PC3), and melanoma (A375) with multiple oral dosing regimens.
