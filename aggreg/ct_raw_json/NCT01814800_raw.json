As most subjects with PIDDs present with infections, the differential diagnosis\n      and initial investigations for an underlying immune defect are typically guided by the\n      clinical presentation. In subjects with PIDDs, individual infections are not necessarily\n      more severe than those that occur in a normal host. Rather, the clinical features suggestive\n      of an immune defect may be the recurring and/or chronic nature of infections with common\n      pathogens that may result in end organ damage, such as bronchiectasis.  Several immune\n      globulin products have already been approved by the FDA."
