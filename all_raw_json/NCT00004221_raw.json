Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy and\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have undergone surgery for\n      stage III ovarian cancer."

One quarter of\n           the PBSC are reinfused beginning 2 days after completion of topotecan infusion.\n\n      Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with radiographic and biochemical complete response undergo laparoscopy as second\n      look surgery within 8 weeks of the last course of chemotherapy. If no evidence of disease is\n      found during laparoscopy, then exploratory laparotomy must also be performed.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter or at time of recurrence until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-41 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
