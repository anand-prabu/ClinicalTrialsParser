  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Essential Tremor (ET) is characterized by tremors affecting the arms. The investigators will
      examine the effects of non-pharmacological limb cooling on clinical and physiological
      characteristics in patients presenting with ET at three different temperatures; and will
      measure changes in tremor amplitude after cooling of the upper limb.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Once the subject has agreed to participate in the study the following assessments will be
      performed.

      Three non-pharmacological assessments will be performed at different temperature to the
      upper limbs. The first will be a baseline assessment with upper limbs maintaining a normal
      body temperature (96-98°F). The second assessment will be performed with upper limbs at a
      temperature of 59°F and the third will be performed at a temperature of 80°F for a period of
      10 minutes. At the end of 10 minutes, tremor measurements will be 15, 40, and 60 minutes.

        1. Assessments will include the Tremor Rating Scale (TRS), Handwriting Assessment Battery
           (HAB) and the Functional Dexterity Test (FDT).

        2. The Bagnoli and Trigno EMG systems will record surface EMG signals from muscles and
           accelerometer readings.
