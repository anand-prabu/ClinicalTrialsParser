            "textblock": "The goal of the proposed study is to test an adjunctive intervention to reduce suicide\n      behaviors and re-hospitalization in military veterans at risk for suicidal behavior. Suicide\n      is one of the leading causes of death for military personnel and for the first time in\n      recorded history the rates of military suicides are exceeding civilian rates. Despite the\n      public and patient health costs associated with suicidal ideation and behavior, existing\n      efforts have not appreciably reduced the rates of suicidal behavior in the military.\n      Consequently, finding novel efficacious and acceptable methods to reduce suicide behaviors\n      is of great military health relevance and should be a fundamental goal of clinical research\n      with military veterans. The Veterans Coping Long Term with Active Suicide Program (CLASP-VA)\n      is an adjunctive intervention, modified specifically for VA patients and health care system\n      that combines aspects of problem-solving therapy, case management, family support, and\n      assessment. The program is a 6-month, telephone-based program designed for patients at risk\n      for suicidal behavior. The program is designed to be easily integrated into the VA's current\n      system and will integrate with, and compliment the role of the National Suicide Coordinator.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to test the efficacy of CLASP-VA in a sample of\n      veterans at risk for suicide behavior. A sample of at-risk veterans will be randomly\n      assigned to either the CLASP-VA intervention or to a Enhanced Treatment as Usual control\n      condition, composed of usual VA care, including safety planning and brief telephone\n      follow-up by the Suicide Coordinator, plus regular assessments and feedback to treating\n      clinicians. Participants will be assessed at the end of the active intervention phase (3 and\n      6 months post-discharge from the hospital) and again at 9 and 12 months post discharge.\n      Efficacy of the program will be determined by several primary outcomes including number of\n      attempts, number of re-hospitalizations, severity and chronicity of suicidal ideation.\n      Secondary analyses will be conducted to help identify the types of patients who will receive\n      the most benefit from the CLASP-VA intervention."
