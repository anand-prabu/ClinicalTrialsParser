  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bioequivalence study to confirm that a NTS with a polyisobutylene (PIB) adhesive from an
      alternative supplier delivers the same nicotine blood profile as that of the currently
      approved NTS with a polyisobutylene adhesive from the current supplier.
