  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this study is to examine the impact of varying supervision strategies on
       clinician fidelity and client outcomes in a community-based setting. Prior research has
      established that training approaches that do not include a period of intervention-specific
      supervision or consultation are ineffective and that implementation efforts that include
      only an initial period of supervision show an eventual attenuation of gains in knowledge and
      fidelity in practice. Ongoing supervision may be required for effective and sustained
      implementation of evidence-based practices (EBPs) in community-based settings. However,
      supervision is one of the least investigated aspects of training. &quot;Gold standard&quot; elements
      of supervision from efficacy trials include review of sessions, standardized procedures for
      monitoring client outcomes and model fidelity, and ongoing skill-building (e.g., behavioral
      rehearsal). The degree (e.g., frequency, intensity) to which these strategies are used in
      community-based settings is unknown.

      There are a growing number of national and statewide efforts to increase the reach of EBPs
      through dissemination and implementation initiatives. There are 18 statewide initiatives to
      implement Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT), an EBP for child trauma
      exposure and sequelae.  Many of the community based TF-CBT implementation efforts, and those
      for other EBPs, include a specific focus on supervisors. However, the limited scientific
      literature provides very little guidance for these efforts. Aims of the current trial
      include 1) studying supervision with existing implementation supports; particularly presence
      of gold standard elements; 2) evaluating the effects of varying supervision strategies on
      fidelity and client outcomes; and 3) testing the mediating effect of treatment fidelity on
      the relationship between supervision type and client outcomes. We propose a two-phased,
      within-subjects and between subjects design. In Phase I (9 months), we will examine
      supervision with implementation support. In Phase II (30 months), we will examine two
      specific supervision conditions, each including varying EBP supervision elements.

    <description>Evidence-Based Practices such as Trauma-focused Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (TF-CBT) usually include ongoing supervision to assess how true (e.g. fidelity) clinicians stay to their training in the specific treatment. We will be coding therapy audio recordings using the TF-CBT Checklist Scoring Sheet. We will also use clinician self-report of fidelity with the Brief Practice Checklist, and supervisor-report of fidelity using the Brief Practice Checklist- Supervisor Version.
We will ultimately be assessing how fidelity serves as a mediator for the relationship between supervision condition and client outcomes.</description>

    <description>We will complete phone interviews with children and guardians to assess the client outcomes at baseline, 3 months post-baseline, and 6 months post-baseline. We will use the UCLA Post Traumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD RI) to assess trauma exposure and post-traumatic stress symptoms. We will use the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), a short behavioral screening survey, to assess overall functioning.</description>
