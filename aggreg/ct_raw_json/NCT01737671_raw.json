            "textblock": "Catheter Placement:\n\n      If you are eligible to take part in this study, you will have surgery to place a catheter\n      into the ommaya reservoir.  The ommaya reservoir is a catheter system that allows drugs to\n      be administered directly to parts of the brain.  In this study, the catheter will be used to\n      collect about 1 teaspoon of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF - the fluid surrounding the brain and\n      spinal cord) to check the status of the disease and for the infusion of methotrexate\n      directly into the 4th ventricle of the brain, which is 1 of the 4 connected fluid-filled\n      cavities in the brain.\n\n      If the study doctor thinks it is necessary, based on the location of the tumor, the tumor\n      may also be removed while you are already under anesthesia just before the catheter is\n      placed.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Each cycle is 4 days long and will consist of 4 daily infusions of methotrexate.  You will\n      have at least a 2 week rest period between each cycle.\n\n      Methotrexate will be infused through the ommaya reservoir catheter directly into the 4th\n      ventricle of the brain starting 2-4 weeks after the catheter placement surgery.  The\n      infusion should last about 3 minutes each time.\n\n      You may also be given leucovorin, a drug used to help prevent or treat the side effects of\n      methotrexate, by intravenous (IV) infusion through a catheter or port you have already had\n      placed in your arm.  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, this infusion will be given\n      after each cycle to help with the possible side effects you may experience from\n      methotrexate.  The infusion should last about 5 minutes each time.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Within 72 hours after catheter placement surgery:\n\n        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  You will have an MRI scan of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease and\n           the flow of brain fluid.\n\n      Ten (10) days after catheter placement surgery:\n\n        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have a spinal tap (also called a lumbar puncture).  A lumbar puncture is a\n           procedure where fluid surrounding the spinal cord is removed by inserting a needle into\n           the lower back. The affected area is numbed with local anesthetic during the procedure.\n\n        -  You will have a neuropsychological evaluation.\n\n      Within 1 week before the first dose of methotrexate at each cycle, blood (about 1 teaspoon)\n      will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Daily during each methotrexate infusion for Cycles 1-3:\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  You will have an Ommaya reservoir tap (a catheter is placed into the Ommaya reservoir\n           to give the methotrexate infusion).\n\n        -  CSF (about 1 teaspoon) will be collected for routine tests.\n\n      Within 1 week after the dose of methotrexate, a spinal tap may be performed if the prior one\n      was positive.  If it was negative after the first cycle, then it will be repeated only after\n      the third cycle.  You will also have an MRI scan of the brain to check the status of the\n      disease.  If the study doctor thinks it is needed, you will also have an MRI of the spine.\n\n      Within 1 month after the dose at Cycle 3, you will have a neuropsychological exam.\n\n      If the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you will continue with additional\n      cycles of methotrexate therapy. Your doctor may recommend additional surgery.\n\n      Also, if the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, methotrexate may be given\n      together with other chemotherapy after completion of Cycle 3.  If you will be receiving\n      other chemotherapy, the study doctor will speak with you in more detail about what drugs you\n      will receive and how you will receive them.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You will receive up to 3 cycles of the methotrexate, or as long as the doctor thinks it is\n      your best interest.  You will no longer be able to receive the study drug if the disease\n      gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study\n      directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over after you complete the follow-up visits.\n\n      Follow-Up Visit:\n\n      3 months after the final dose of study drug:\n\n        -  Any updates to your health will be recorded.\n\n        -  You will have a neurological exam.\n\n        -  You will have an MRI scan of the brain and spine to check the status of the disease.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Methotrexate is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for infusion directly into brain tumors.  The infusion of methotrexate into the 4th\n      ventricle of the brain is investigational.\n\n      Up to 10 patients will be enrolled in this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
