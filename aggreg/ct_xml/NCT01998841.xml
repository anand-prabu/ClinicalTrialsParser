  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This  randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, adaptive stu dy will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of crenezumab versus placebo in individ uals who carry the
      PSEN1 E280A autosomal-dominant mutation and do not meet  the criteria for mild cognitive
      impairment due to Alzheimer disease or dementia due to Alzheimer disease and are, thus, in a
      preclinical phase of Alzheimer disease.

      Patients will be randomized 1 : 1 to receive either crenezumab or placebo subcu taneously
      every 2 weeks for 260 weeks. The study also includes a cohort of PSEN1 E280A mutation
      noncarriers who will be dosed with placebo only.
