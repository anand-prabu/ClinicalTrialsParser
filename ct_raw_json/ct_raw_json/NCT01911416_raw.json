However, pancreatic cancer\n      is more common in developed countries where the rate of this tumor is on the rise compared\n      to other types of cancer.\n\n      LDE225 is a new medicine that blocks a cellular pathway (called Hedgehog pathway) that is\n      thought to be changed in some patients with pancreatic cancer.  LDE225 is a medicine which\n      has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of people with your medical condition.\n      The medicine being tested in this study is currently not \"on the market\" (available to buy)\n      in any country.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to see the effect LDE225 has on blood and tumors."

NB: Muscular\n             activities, such as strenuous exercise, that can result in significant increases in\n             plasma CK levels should be avoided whilst on LDE225 treatment.\n\n          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study within 4 weeks of\n             initiating treatment with LDE225.\n\n          -  Patients who are receiving other anti-neoplastic therapy (e.g. chemotherapy, targeted\n             therapy or radiotherapy) concurrently or within 2 weeks of starting treatment with\n             LDE225.\n\n          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong\n             inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A4/5 or drugs metabolized by CYP2B6 or CYP2C9 that have\n             narrow therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment\n             with LDE225. Medications that are strong CYP3A4/5 inhibitors should be discontinued\n             at least 7 days and strong CYP3A/5 inducers for at least 2 weeks prior to starting\n             treatment with LDE225.\n\n          -  Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a\n             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a\n             positive hCG laboratory test (> 5 mIU/mL).\n\n          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of\n             becoming pregnant, including women whose career, lifestyle, or sexual orientation\n             precludes intercourse with a male partner and women whose partners have been\n             sterilized by vasectomy or other means, UNLESS they are using two birth control\n             methods. The two methods can be a double barrier method or a barrier method plus a\n             hormonal method. Adequate barrier methods of contraception include:\n\n             \u2022 Diaphragm, condom (by the partner), intrauterine device (copper or hormonal),\n             sponge or spermicide. Hormonal contraceptives include any marketed contraceptive\n             agent that includes an estrogen and/or a progestational agent.\n\n          -  Reliable contraception should be maintained throughout the study and for 3 months\n             after study drug discontinuation.\n\n          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol.\n\n          -  Patients who are not candidates to undergo laparoscopic examination and biopsy"
