    <description>We will use a method to analyze the length-scale of perfusion heterogeneity before and after surgery for CTEPH. Briefly, this method consists of filtering the images with filters of different spatial size (length, mm) and measuring the coefficient of variation (CV) of perfusion in the imaged field. We then bin the CV into the following intervals: 12-36 mm, 36-60 mm, 60-84 mm, 84-108 mm and &gt;108 mm and compare the CV in each bin among subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is diagnosed with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (WHO Group
             IV) and planning to undergo pulmonary thromboendarterectomy.

          2. Subject is male or female aged &gt; or =18 years of age and &lt; or = 70 years.

          3. Subject has undergone RHC within six months of entering the study.

          4. The subject is capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.

          5. A signed and dated written informed consent is obtained from the subject.

          6. Available to complete the study.

          7. Able to lie flat and able to perform a 30 second breath hold.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. FEV1 and/or TLC &lt; 70% predicted.

          2. Inability to perform the study (by primary MD or investigator assessment).

          3. Inability to perform the respiratory maneuvers necessary for the exam.

          4. Subjects who have a past or present disease, which as judged by the Investigators may
             affect the outcome of this study.

          5. The subject has suspected history of drugs or alcohol abuse within the six months
             prior to the screening visit.

          6. The subject is a woman of childbearing potential who is pregnant, seeking to become
             pregnant, or has a positive pregnancy test.

          7. Subject with clinical instability in the judgment of the investigator, with a heart
             rate &gt; 120 bpm, respiratory rate &gt; 24, SpO2 &lt; 88%, blood pressure &lt; 90/60 or &gt; 140/90
             or fever &gt; 101, or subjects with hospitalization for progression of pulmonary
             hypertension or right heart failure in the three months prior to the study.

          8. Subject with diagnosis of active tuberculosis, lung cancer, clinically overt
             bronchiectasis, allergic rhinitis, asthma, heart failure, ischemic heart disease, or
             COPD.

          9. Subject that had a respiratory tract infection in the 4 weeks prior to the screening
             visit and throughout the duration of the study.

         10. The subject has been exposed to a radiation dose over the past year that, when added
             to the radiation dose expected in this study, would exceed permissible yearly
             exposure as determined by the MGH radiation safety committee.
