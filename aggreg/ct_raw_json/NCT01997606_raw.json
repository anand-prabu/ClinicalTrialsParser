One arm (Arm 1) in which the\n           subjects will first use the Purotex impregnated covers (Set A=Purotex) during 2 months\n           (=period A) and, after a wash out period of 1 month, the untreated covers (set\n           B=placebo) during 2 months (=period B). In the second arm (Arm 2), the subjects will\n           first use the untreated set (set A=placebo) and, after a wash out period the Purotex\n           impregnated covers (set B=Purotex).\n\n        -  Randomized: The subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Double blind: both the subjects and the investigators will not know to which treatment\n           arm the subjects are assigned.\n\n      Study hypothesis:\n\n      We want to investigate:\n\n        -  if there is a reduced concentration of HDM allergen in Purotex covers compared to\n           untreated covers in real life\n\n        -  if patients with allergic rhinitis to house dust mite use the Purotex covers, they\n           experience an improvement of their quality of life and sleep, and an improvement of\n           their allergic symptoms and global discomfort"

The active probiotics are placed inside of millions of capsules and are introduced during the textile production. These human friendly bacteria remain non-active until friction force is created between the mattress/pillow and the sleeper's body. Under the friction force a small part of the capsules is opened and probiotics become active. They saturate the bacterial capacity of the textile and by doing so, reduce the risk of dust mite allergen development and growth of molds and harmful bacteria.  The patients will apply the covers around their mattress and around their pillow. On top of these covers the patients will apply their own fitted sheet and pillowcase (which they will change every 4 weeks).",
