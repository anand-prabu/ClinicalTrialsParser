            "textblock": "Stroke is a leading cause of disability; most strokes (80%) are subcortical, with ischemic\n      damage due to occlusion in penetrating arteries. Although ischemic white matter disease\n      (iWMD) may lack gross clinical manifestation, it causes significant cognitive impairment,\n      particularly on measures of executive function, attention, and memory. This impairment is\n      attributable to diffuse damage affecting network connections.\n\n      While there are many studies concerning rehabilitation of motor function and language in\n      patients with large focal strokes, few studies have addressed attentional and executive\n      functions. To our knowledge, there are no such studies on iWMD. In this study, patients will\n      be randomized to a novel intervention for improving executive function and a control\n      condition matched for therapist exposure. Patients will be assessed pre-intervention,\n      post-intervention, and at long-term follow-up using a battery of behavioural and\n      neuroimaging tasks. We predict that the novel intervention will be associated with improved\n      executive function, as assessed behaviourally, and improved frontal network function, as\n      assessed through neuroimaging markers."
