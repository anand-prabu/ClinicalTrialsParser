Dissemination can be assessed in terms of the number of views which can\n      increase as a result from sharing and forwarding of the video.\n\n      In this study, an experiment video and a control video, both of which are approximately 2.5\n      minutes long, will be uploaded on YouTube, the most visited video sharing website. The\n      videos concern the WOMAN trial, a large RCT of tranexamic acid in postpartum hemorrhage. The\n      experimental group will receive a video with strongly emotional content (an interview with a\n      postpartum hemorrhage survivor) and her husband. The control group will receive a short\n      video in which a researcher conveys the same information (but without the first hand\n      experience of the survivor and her husband). Otherwise, the two videos are identical.\n\n      Participants, selected from clinicians and researchers in obstetrics and gynecology, will be\n      randomly allocated to two groups. An e-mail with a link to either of the videos will be sent\n      to the participants. In the e-mail, they will be asked to watch the video and forward the\n      link to their colleagues if they find it helpful.\n\n      The primary outcome is video forwarding. The secondary outcome is the number of access to\n      the video that each participant generated.\n\n      Data will be collected for 14 days after the e-mails are sent to the participants. The\n      relative risk (RR) of forwarding the videos will be calculated as effect measure and\n      compared using chi-square test. The distribution of the numbers of access to the video that\n      each participant generated will be compared using t-test, Wilcoxon signed-rank test and\n      chi-square test.\n\n      The hypothesis is that an online video with emotional content has higher chance of being\n      forwarded to other people and therefore, gets higher number of views than an less emotional\n      online video."

            "textblock": "[Statistical analysis plan for the DIFFUSION trial]\n\n      SETTING\n\n      Two videos will be uploaded on YouTube through a new account created for this study. The\n      uploaded videos will be embedded in two independent websites with white background. A\n      computer programme has been created to collect the data of access to the videos.\n\n      International journals in obstetrics and gynaecology published in 2013 and 2014 will be\n      sought for participant recruitment. The authors of the articles published in the journals\n      who met the inclusion criteria will be assigned ID numbers and randomised to receive either\n      the intervention or control video. Randomised participants will be sent a unique web address\n      (URL) of the video that they are allocated to by e-mail from accounts (Gmail) created for\n      this study. Each URL will be linked to the participant's ID number in the database. They\n      will be asked to watch the video and forward it to their colleagues if they find it helpful.\n      If a randomized participant forwards their URL to another person, and that person clicks on\n      it, the click will be recorded against the participant's ID number in the computer\n      programme. Therefore, if there are multiple accesses from the same ID number, it is either\n      because the participant watched the video more than once or because the participant\n      forwarded the URL and other people watched the video.\n\n      This trial will be coordinated from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine\n      (University of London) and conducted worldwide online.\n\n      DURATION OF INTERVENTION\n\n      The e-mail accounts have limitation of e-mails that can be sent out a day. Therefore, the\n      participants in both groups will be divided into four subgroups and the e-mails with the\n      links to the videos will be sent to them over four days.\n\n      CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION\n\n      All participants randomly assigned to one of the videos will be analysed together,\n      regardless of whether or not they watched the video, on an intention to treat basis. This\n      analysis is to examine the effect of the intervention in a practical scenario. In addition,\n      only those who watched the videos will be analysed on an on-treatment basis to estimate the\n      effect closer to the true effect of the intervention.\n\n      RANDOMISATION\n\n      An independent statistician will randomly allocate the ID numbers of the participants to\n      either the intervention or the control groups using a computer programme. Allocation will be\n      concealed to a person who will recruit participants. Randomisations were balanced 1:1.\n\n      BLINDING AND UNBLINDING\n\n      As two videos are apparently different, participants cannot be blinded in this trial.\n      However, each participant is not sent the other video so in principle they cannot tell if\n      they received a video with more or less emotional content. The study coordinator who will\n      conduct data analyses is masked to the allocation. The data will be unblinded after this SAP\n      is submitted to the ClinicalTrial.gov and all data analyses have been completed. The data\n      are kept in a password-secured online archive (Google drive). Access to the data is limited\n      to the trial coordinator and technical assistant who developed the computer programme for\n      data collection.\n\n      DEFINITION OF OUTCOMES\n\n      PRIMARY OUTCOMES: The primary outcome is video forwarding. Based on the data of access to\n      the videos collected with the computer programme, the investigators will identify access by\n      a unique individual. If there are more than one accesses to the video from the same ID\n      number and different IP addresses, it is assumed that those accesses are by different\n      persons, namely, the participant has forwarded the video to other people. The proportion of\n      participants that forwarded the video at least once in each arm can then be calculated.\n\n      SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Number of unique access to the video that each participant generated.\n      Although it is impossible to count actual forwarding by each participant, it can be\n      approximated with the number of views that each participant generated. The distribution of\n      number of views generated by each participant is available for both video. Comparing these\n      distributions will help understand how different kind of videos generate different patterns\n      of sharing. For example, one kind of video could be shared similarly by all the participants\n      while another kind might be shared highly frequently by a few people but scarcely by the\n      rest. The investigators will count accesses with the same ID number and from different IP\n      addresses that each participant generated.\n\n      ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES FOR FINAL ANALYSIS\n\n        -  Two different analyses will be conducted for the primary outcome on an\n           intention-to-treat basis and an on-treatment basis.\n\n        -  All tests will be two-sided, and the nominal level of \u03b1 will be 5% for the main\n           analysis.\n\n        -  All statistical analyses will be unadjusted except where indicated.\n\n        -  Missing values will not be imputed unless specified otherwise. Where the number of\n           missing observations is substantial, the number of observations used in the analysis\n           will be reported.\n\n        -  P values will not be adjusted for multiplicity. However, the outcomes are clearly\n           categorised by degree of importance (primary and secondary).\n\n      DATA COLLECTION AND OUTCOME ASSESSMENT\n\n      Every time someone clicks on a URL to access a video our computer program collects four\n      variables: (a) ID number (b) IP address from which the URL is clicked, (c) date and time of\n      access (recorded in Great British Time regardless of the country of the IP address) and (d)\n      type of device (web browser, phone or computer device)\n\n      Definition of access by the same person to a video:\n\n      As there is no way to detect forwarding, accesses to the video by unique individuals will be\n      counted as the closest indicator of forwarding. It is also impossible to precisely\n      distinguish an access by a unique individual, in other words, to tell if the video was\n      accessed more than once by the same person or by different people. Therefore, the\n      investigators need to make assumptions based on the data collected by our programme. In the\n      main analysis, the investigators will consider that accesses with the same ID number from\n      the same IP address mean that a person watched the video more than once. Accesses with the\n      same ID number from different IP addresses will be considered as accesses by unique\n      individuals. The data of the other variables (time and type of device) will be considered in\n      the sensitivity analysis. Multiple accesses with the same ID from the same IP address within\n      five minutes will be counted as one access, allow for the possibility that a person watched\n      the video more than once because the video did not play the first time or the parson wanted\n      to confirm the information in the video.\n\n      Due to the limit of e-mails that can be sent a day, participants in the intervention and the\n      control arms will be divided into four subgroups and the e-mails will be sent to them over\n      four days. Although all groups receive the intervention at different times, the data of each\n      subgroup will be collected equally over 14 days.\n\n      SAMPLE SIZE AND STATISTICAL POWER\n\n      Two main factors determine the number of patients needed in a trial. These are the estimated\n      event rate and size of the treatment effect. The investigators will power the trial for our\n      main outcome: percentage of participants that forwarded the video at least once in each arm.\n\n      ESTIMATED EVENT RATE: Based on other studies, baseline e-mail forward rate was assumed to be\n      10%.\n\n      SAMPLE SIZE AND SIZE OF INTERVENTION EFFECT THAT SHOULD BE DETECTABLE: Assuming the change\n      from baseline is 7.5% (75% increase from 10% to 17.5%), the sample size required for this\n      study was calculated. The calculation suggested 936 participants, 468 per group, are\n      required to test the null hypothesis at the 5% significance level with 90% power. Therefore,\n      1000 participants, 500 in the intervention group and 500 in the control group, will be\n      recruited.\n\n      CHARACTERISTICS OF PARTICIPANTS AND BASELINE COMPARISONS\n\n      Description of the baseline characteristics listed below will be presented by intervention\n      group. The countries which the participants are based in were categorised into low, middle\n      and high income countries based on the classification by the World Bank. Discrete variables\n      will be summarised by frequencies and percentages. Percentages will be calculated according\n      to the number of participants for whom data are available. Where values are missing, the\n      denominator (which is less than the number of patients assigned to the treatment group) will\n      be stated in either the body or footnote of the corresponding summary table.\n\n      Continuous variables will be summarised using standard measures of central tendency and\n      dispersion, i.e.  either a mean or a median with SD.\n\n      DESCRIPTION OF ANALYSES\n\n      The outcome assessor will be masked to the identity of each participant by using ID numbers\n      instead of individual names or e-mail addresses.\n\n      Accesses to the videos will be counted as a substitute for the measure of forwarding.\n      Therefore, even if a participant forwarded the URL to another person, if the person does not\n      click on the link, that forwarding will not be counted. This leads to the underestimate of\n      the effect of the intervention.\n\n      PRIMARY OUTCOME: A standard chi-square test will be used as the primary test of statistical\n      significance of the effect of intervention allocation on the proportion of video forwarding.\n      Frequencies and percentages per arm, and a risk ratio measuring the intervention effect and\n      its 95% confidence interval (CI) will also be reported.\n\n      SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Distribution of number of accesses generated by each participant will be\n      compared. The difference in the means (SD) in each arm will be estimated in order to assess\n      the effect of the intervention along with the P value. To test the statistical difference in\n      distribution, Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be conducted. In case the distributions are\n      complex, the data will be stratified into a few groups and chi-square test will be conducted\n      to test the statistical difference in distribution.\n\n      SENSITIVITY ANALYSES: The effect of the intervention may vary according to the definition of\n      an access by a unique person. Therefore, the investigators will conduct sensitivity analyses\n      for all outcomes using two different definitions of an access by a unique person: most\n      conservative definition and most liberal definition.\n\n      The possible largest effect of the intervention and the difference in all the outcomes\n      between the two groups will be estimated using the most liberal definition of forwarding.\n      Likewise, the possible smallest effect of the intervention and the difference in all the\n      outcomes between the two groups will be estimated using the most conservative definition.\n      With the most liberal definition, the investigators will count all accesses as those by\n      different persons. With the most conservative definition, the investigators will count\n      accesses as those by different persons only if the data from all the categories are\n      different."
