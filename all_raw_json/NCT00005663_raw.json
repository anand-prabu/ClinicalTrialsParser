Patients come to the clinic for routine monthly assessments for 6\n      months, and return to the clinic for evaluation within 24 hours of the first signs or\n      symptoms of an ano-genital HSV recurrence.  Once the clinician confirms the presence of at\n      least the macular/papular lesion stage, double-blind suppressive therapy is discontinued and\n      open-label treatment with a higher dose of Valtrex twice daily for 5 days is initiated.  For\n      the first recurrence, patients are instructed to return to the clinic for further clinical\n      assessments on Day 5 of the recurrence.  Patients who have not healed by Day 5 may be\n      offered an additional five days of open-label treatment, as deemed appropriate by the\n      clinical investigator.  If an additional 5-day course of open-label treatment medication is\n      dispensed, the patient returns to the clinic on Day 10 for evaluation.  Patients who have\n      not healed by Day 10 are managed as deemed appropriate by the investigator.  Once treatment\n      of the first ano-genital HSV recurrence is complete and the patient is healed, patients are\n      switched to open-label suppressive therapy with Valtrex for the remainder of the study\n      period (up to a maximum of 6 months).  The total duration of the study for all patients is 6\n      months."

(If patient is taking medication to control HSV,\n             then he/she must have had 4 or more recurrences of ano-genital HSV per year before\n             beginning regular anti-HSV therapy, which is defined as therapy of 12 or more weeks.)\n\n          -  Agree to use effective methods of birth control from 2 weeks before taking study\n             drug, throughout the study, and for 4 weeks after completing  the study.
