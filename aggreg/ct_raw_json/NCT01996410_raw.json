The investigators will further evaluate the difference in MDASI scores for the two groups using linear mixed models that account for multiple measurements within a single patient.  A mixed model is preferable to a repeated measures ANOVA in this case, as it allows for missing time points within a single subject without eliminating that subject from the analysis.\nAdditionally, the investigators are able to specify how our time points are correlated within patients rather than assuming equal correlation across time points.  The MDASI is comprised of 13 separate items that are not summative; therefore, the significance level for all statistical tests will be set at 0.003 (0.05/13) to account for multiple comparisons.",
