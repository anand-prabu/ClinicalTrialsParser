            "textblock": "Rationale: Patients with neuroendocrine tumors (NET) have a rare disease. Due to treating\n      patients with a neuroendocrine tumor in 'NET knowledge centers'  patients often have to\n      travel long distances for follow-up visits at the outpatient clinic. Patients whose medical\n      condition allows videoconsultation could save time by replacing outpatient clinic visits\n      through videoconsultation for receiving follow-up care. Therefore, in this study we aim to\n      introduce videoconsultation as a alternative for follow-up outpatient clinic visits in NET\n      patients.\n\n      Objective: The primary objective is to assess if use of videoconsultation in follow-up care\n      for NET patients is feasible. We hypothesize that videoconsultation is a suitable medium for\n      providing follow-up care in NET patients. Secondary objectives are to explore the amount of\n      time videoconsultation takes in comparison with outpatient clinic visits and the\n      acceptability and satisfaction of physicians and patients with using videoconsultation in\n      follow-up care.\n\n      Study design: The present study is a single-centre prospective feasibility study.\n\n      Study population: Adult NET patients under surveillance or treatment of the department\n      Medical Oncology at the University Medical Centre Groningen (UMCG)  whose medical condition\n      allows videoconsultation will be invited to participate.\n\n      Intervention: Patient who give informed consent will participate in the study. Participants\n      will receive follow-up care through videoconsultation instead of conventional visits at the\n      outpatient clinic.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main endpoint is the feasibility of videoconsultation\n      for follow-up care in NET patients.  We hypothesize that videoconsultation is a suitable\n      medium for providing follow-up care."
