To determine toxicities associated with administration of salicylate in the setting of\n      induction chemotherapy.\n\n      III. To determine if salicylate alters the expression of NF-kB-regulated genes in AML cells.\n\n      IV. To determine if NF-kB modulation by salicylate alters AML chemotherapy drug efflux.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive choline magnesium trisalicylate orally (PO) every 8 hours on days\n      0-7, idarubicin intravenously (IV) on days 1-3, and cytarabine IV continuously on days 1-7.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive idarubicin IV on days 1-3 and cytarabine IV continuously on days\n      1-7.\n\n      In both arms, treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically."
