            "textblock": "Atrial fibrillation (AF), the most common sustained heart rhythm disorder, is becoming\n      increasingly prevalent in the Western world. The number of people with AF in the United\n      States is projected to roughly double by the year 2050, to an estimated 6-12 million. For\n      many patients with AF, rate control with atrioventricular (AV) node blockers is a widely\n      accepted therapeutic strategy. These agents control heart rate, thus preventing symptoms and\n      systolic heart failure associated with tachycardia due to a rapid ventricular response to\n      AF. Beta-blockers are widely accepted as first line agents for rate control in AF,\n      especially when patients have concomitant hypertension (HTN), coronary artery disease,\n      cardiomyopathies, or heart failure (HF). As a class, beta-blockers are among the most\n      commonly prescribed cardiovascular medications.\n\n      Among patients with AF treated with beta-blockers, the heart rate (HR) response varies\n      substantially. Sometimes, adequate rate control can be achieved by titration of the\n      beta-blocker dose; but frequently, additional AV nodal blockers and/or digoxin are\n      necessary. In some cases, adequate rate control cannot be achieved even with the\n      simultaneous use of multiple AV nodal blockers, necessitating mechanical ablation of the AV\n      node and permanent pacemaker implantation.\n\n      Patient-specific variables that influence the response to beta-blockers include comorbid\n      conditions, weight, age, and level of physical activity. Ethnic differences in the response\n      to beta-blockers for the treatment of HTN and HF are well-described. However, the\n      contribution of genetic variants to beta-blocker efficacy in AF is unknown. We propose to\n      study, using a candidate gene approach, the effect of genetic variants on heart rate\n      response to beta-blockade in patients with AF."
