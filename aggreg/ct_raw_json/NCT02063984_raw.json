In\n      particular, this project will be the first to evaluate whether Working Memory Training can\n      enhance cognitive function and reduce impulsive decision making to improve abstinence\n      outcomes. In addition, an adaptive abstinence-based incentive program will be evaluated as a\n      new method for intervening with those who do not respond to their first-line treatment."

            "textblock": "The study will test two novel strategies to enhance outcomes. Working Memory Training (WMT),\n      an efficacious method for strengthening specific cognitive processes, aims to improve\n      factors (e.g., delay discounting / impulsive decision-making) that have shown a strong\n      relation to substance use and treatment response. Second, more intensive and higher\n      magnitude CM (ICM) will be used to motivate abstinence among teens who are not abstinent by\n      Week 6. The investigators hypothesize that these strategies will improve outcomes by\n      modifying a fundamental cognitive system involved in making choices to engage in risky\n      behavior and by increasing motivation to abstain in early nonresponders. Aim 1 will pilot\n      and refine the new procedures in a community clinic in preparation for the randomized trial.\n      A sequential, multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) will allow the study to determine\n      the most effective first-line treatment and the most effective adaptive strategy (Aim 2).\n      All teens will begin treatment with BT/CM or BT/CM/WMT. After 6 weeks, responders will\n      continue in their first-line treatments, while nonresponders will be randomized to ICM or to\n      continue with first-line treatment. Aim 3 will conduct mechanistic analyses to assess\n      whether cognitive changes related to WMT engender increased abstinence, and whether specific\n      tailoring variables moderate treatment effects. Aim 4 will gather formative data on\n      implementation factors to inform future large-scale studies and dissemination efforts.\n      Primary hypotheses are: (1) first-line treatment with WMT will improve abstinence outcomes\n      and reduce relapse; (2) strategies with ICM for nonresponders will result in better outcomes\n      than those without; (3) WMT will reduce delay discounting, which will predict outcome. The\n      unique approach holds promise for reducing multiple types of risky behaviors by affecting\n      basic mechanisms that determine impulsive decision-making."

The investigators expect over 85%\n        of teens will have such access.(US Department of Commerce, 2010). If they do not have such\n        access, the investigators will consider inclusion if they agree to and are able to attend\n        the clinic and complete the WMT training each weekday.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria: DSM criteria for dependence (likely to be adjusted for DSM-5 Use\n        Disorder) on alcohol or other drugs other than marijuana (use of or meeting criteria for\n        abuse of other substances will not be an exclusion criterion), active psychosis, severe\n        medical or psychiatric illness limiting participation, or pregnant or breast-feeding."
