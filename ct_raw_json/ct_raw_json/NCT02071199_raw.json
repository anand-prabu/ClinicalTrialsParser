If there are no safety issues, cohort two will include a higher dose of\n      ACCS randomized with saline.  Pocket depth, plaque index, gingival index, and bleeding on\n      probing will be assessed.  To assess shifts in supragingival flora, a qualitative and\n      quantitative microbial analysis will be performed for common oral bacteria. There will also\n      be an analysis of inflammatory cytokines in crevicular fluid at the beginning and end of the\n      study.  Comparisons of adverse events and outcomes will be made between the subjects\n      receiving low dose ACCS, high dose ACCS, and saline."
