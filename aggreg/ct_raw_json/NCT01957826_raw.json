            "textblock": "Chronic congestive heart failure (CHF) is a public health problem that entails high rates of\n      morbidity and mortality, and enormous costs for health systems worldwide. In the United\n      States there are 5 million people living with CHF, and each year 60.000 people reach\n      terminal phases of the disease, with mortality rates of 70-80% at two years. Although the\n      first cause of CHF in developed countries is atherosclerotic coronary artery disease (CAD),\n      dilated idiopathic cardiomyopathy (DCM) represents almost half of the cases of newly\n      diagnosed CHF. Treatment of CHF includes pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies,\n      including implantable cardioverter defibrillators, cardiac resynchronization therapy and\n      heart transplantation. Despite all these advances, CHF prognosis remains poor. Cardiac stem\n      cell therapy emerged more than ten years ago as a new hope for CHF patients.\n\n      Although the most extensive evidence of the benefits of stem cell therapy for cardiovascular\n      diseases refers to ischemic heart disease (CAD), initial experiences with stem cells for\n      other conditions such as DCM are encouraging.\n\n      This randomized clinical trial will include 70 patients with DCM, left ventricular ejection\n      fraction (LVEF) between 20% and 45%, and who are symptomatic in New York Heart Association\n      (NYHA) functional class II-III/IV. In a first-in-man pilot phase, 10 patients will be\n      treated with transendocardial injections of bone marrow-derived MSCs after cardiac\n      catheterization and NOGA XPTM mapping of the left ventricle. A Data and Safety Monitoring\n      Board (DSMB) will analyse the safety and feasibility of this first phase of the trial, and\n      then 60 patients more will be randomized to receive MSCs or placebo (ratio 3:1).\n\n      Primary objectives include safety and feasibility variables, and secondary objectives\n      include efficacy variables. All patients will be studied with a complete cardiac imaging\n      protocol that includes: electrocardiography, echocardiography, treadmill tests with oxygen\n      consumption, holter, laboratory analyses, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), single photon\n      emission computed tomography (SPECT), electromechanical mapping (NOGA XPTM) and quality of\n      life questionnaires."
