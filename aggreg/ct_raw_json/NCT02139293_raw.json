After acclimatization the stimulation is turned on for 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of paused stimulation, 20 minutes of stimulation, and 10 minutes paused stimulation. This intervention is repeated on four consecutive days, whereas at each intervention only one of the four stimulation points (and one fixed reference point) is stimulated. Needle electrodes are applied at each study visit.\nStimulation points in the auricle are stimulated in random order. One stimulation pattern is tested. Stimulation amplitudes are adjusted with respect to a distinct but comfortable sensation at the auricle.\nDuring the described protocol various biosignals are continuously recorded, including ECG, respiration, blood perfusion, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous oxygen tension, blood pressure and skin temperature."
