    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Absorb BVS System compared to the XIENCE V EECSS
      in the treatment of subjects with ischemic heart disease caused by up to two de novo native
      coronary artery lesions  in separate epicardial vessels.

             subjects with stable coronary artery disease (CAD). For subjects presenting with
             acute coronary syndrome (ACS), LVEF must be assessed during the index hospitalization
             (which may include during the index procedure by contrast left ventriculography) but

        Angiographic Inclusion Criteria

        Assessment of angiographic eligibility is per visual assessment by an investigator both
        for qualitative and quantitative variables. On-line QCA is recommended to be used for
        appropriately sizing of the vessel. If on-line QCA cannot be used, visual estimation is
        required.

          1. One or two de novo target lesions:

               1. If there is one target lesion, a second non-target lesion may be treated but the
                  non-target lesion must be present in a different epicardial vessel, and must be
                  treated first with a successful, uncomplicated result prior to randomization of
                  the target lesion.

               2. If two target lesions are present, they must be present in different epicardial
                  vessels and both satisfy the angiographic eligibility criteria.

               3. The definition of epicardial vessels means the left anterior descending artery
                  (LAD), the left circumflex artery (LCX), and the right coronary artery (RCA) and
                  their branches. Thus, for example, the subject must not have lesions requiring
                  treatment in both the LAD and a diagonal branch.

          2. Target lesion must be located in a native coronary artery with a visually estimated
             or quantitatively assessed %DS of  ≥ 50% and &lt; 100% with a TIMI flow of ≥ 1 and one
             of the following: stenosis ≥ 70%, an abnormal functional test (e.g., fractional flow
             reserve, stress test), unstable angina or post-infarct angina.

          3. Target lesion must have a Dmax (by on-line QCA) or RVD (by visual estimation) ≥ 2.50
             mm and ≤ 3.75 mm (on-line QCA assessment is recommended).

          4. Target lesion must have a lesion length ≤ 24 mm based on either visual estimation or
             on-line QCA.

        Angiographic Exclusion Criteria

        All exclusion criteria apply to the target lesion(s) or target vessel(s). All exclusion
        criteria are based on visual estimation.

          1. Target lesion is located in left main.

          2. Aorto-ostial RCA target lesion (within 3 mm of the ostium).

          3. Target lesion located within 3 mm of the origin of the LAD or LCX.

          4. Lesion involving a bifurcation with a:

               1. Side branch ≥ 2 mm in diameter, or

               2. Side branch with diameter stenosis ≥ 50%, or

               3. Side branch requiring protection guide wire, or

               4. Side branch requiring pre-dilatation

          5. Anatomy proximal to or within the lesion that may impair delivery of the Absorb BVS
             or XIENCE V, including:

               1. Extreme angulation (≥ 90°) proximal to or within the target lesion

               2. Excessive tortuosity (≥ two 45° angles) proximal to or within the  target lesion

               3. Moderate or heavy calcification proximal to or within the target lesion

          6. Target lesion or target vessel involves a myocardial bridge.

          7. Target vessel contains thrombus as indicated in the angiographic images.

          8. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent at any time prior to the index
             procedure such that the Absorb BVS or XIENCE V would need to cross the stent to reach
             the target lesion.

          9. Target vessel has been previously treated with a stent and the target lesion is
             within 5 mm proximal to a previously treated lesion.

         10. Target lesion which prevents complete balloon pre-dilatation, defined as full balloon
             expansion with the following outcomes:

               1. Residual %DS is &lt; 40% (per visual estimation), ≤ 20% is strongly recommended.

               2. TIMI Grade-3 flow (per visual estimation).

               3. No angiographic complications (e.g. distal embolization, side branch closure).

               4. No dissections NHLBI grade D-F.

               5. No chest pain lasting &gt; 5 minutes.

               6. No ST depression or elevation lasting &gt; 5 minutes.
