  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      National, multicenter, prospective, observational, non-interventional study. The objective
      is to determine if the switch from Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) to Xarelto in subjects
      treated with VKA with issues for stroke prevention in non valvular atrial fibrillation is
      associated with an improvement of the treatment satisfaction after 3 months. The treatment
      satisfaction will be measured by the Anti Clot Treatment Scale (ACTS) score.
