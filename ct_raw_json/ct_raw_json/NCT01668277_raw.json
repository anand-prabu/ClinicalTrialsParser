Infusion of hypertonic saline solutions\n      expand the circulating volume, thus allowing more blood to flow and reducing pressure in the\n      artery, vein, and capillaries. Furthermore, infusion of hypertonic saline has been shown to\n      reduce both systemic and pulmonary vascular resistances in adults. If the pulmonary vascular\n      resistance decreases more or to the same degree as the systemic resistance, infusion of\n      hypertonic saline may prove beneficial in the treatment of pulmonary hypertensive crisis.\n      The primary objective of this study is to investigate how a clinically relevant dose of\n      hypertonic saline affects the systemic and pulmonary circulations in children undergoing\n      cardiac catheterization during general anesthesia. This study hypothesizes that an infusion\n      of hypertonic saline over 10 minutes will reduce the pulmonary vascular resistance more than\n      the systemic vascular resistance."
