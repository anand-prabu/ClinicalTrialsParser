            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      By dilating coronary stenoses, PTCA can relieve angina pectoris and improve exercise\n      tolerance and left ventricular function.  However, restenosis occurs in 20-30 percent of\n      dilated stenoses within three to six months following PTCA making it necessary to restrict\n      patient activities, resume antianginal medications, repeat PTCA, or perform coronary artery\n      bypass surgery.\n\n      Balloon dilatation of the atherosclerotic lesion damages the endothelium, intima, and media\n      of the artery.  This may lead to restenosis via platelet deposition, mural thrombus\n      formation, and intimal proliferation by mechanisms that appear similar to those causing\n      aortocoronary vein graft (ACVG) occlusions.  It had been demonstrated that dipyridamole plus\n      aspirin therapy suppressed these mechanisms of ACVG occlusion in the animal model, prolonged\n      a shortened platelet survival in patients with coronary artery disease, and reduced ACVG\n      occlusions in patients both early and late after the operation.  Thus, a trial of these\n      drugs in patients undergoing PTCA was a logical and necessary step to reduce the major\n      shortcoming of the initially successful PTCA therapy, namely the high rate of restenosis.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Randomized, double-blind, fixed sample.  Patients were randomized to treatment with\n      dipyridamole plus aspirin or placebo.\n\n      The study completion date listed in this record was obtained from the Query/View/Report\n      (QVR) System."
