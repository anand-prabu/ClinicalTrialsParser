The study population\n      consists of sixty-eight postmenopausal female patients, who are scheduled to have cementless\n      total hip replacement (THA) for primary hip osteoarthritis. The patients will be stratified\n      based on preoperative DXA screening of systemic bone mineral density (BMD). Patients with\n      normal BMD and patients with low BMD (T-score less than -2) will be randomized within their\n      own stratum. The patients will be randomly assigned to receive a subcutaneous injection of\n      denosumab 60 mg or placebo four weeks before surgery and 22 weeks after surgery. The primary\n      hypothesis is that denosumab is effective in preventing periprosthetic bone loss in the\n      proximal femur as measured by DXA. The secondary hypothesis is that denosumab is effective\n      in enhancement of bone bonding (osseointegration) of cementless femoral stems, as measured\n      by model-based radiostereometric analysis."
