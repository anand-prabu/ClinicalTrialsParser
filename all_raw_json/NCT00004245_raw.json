Intrapatient dose escalation\n      or de-escalation is permitted. Treatment continues for up to 6 weeks in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Responding patients may continue to receive\n      sodium salicylate beyond the 6-week period.\n\n      Patients with acute myelogenous leukemia are followed until the end of therapy. Patients\n      with myelodysplastic syndrome are followed until death or progression to leukemia.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
