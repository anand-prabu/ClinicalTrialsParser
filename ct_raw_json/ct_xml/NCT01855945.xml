             (children). BMI is to be calculated by the following formula: subject weight (kg) at
             baseline divided by (subject height in meters multiplied by the subject height in
             meters).  The numerical result will be rounded to the nearest 0.1.

         23. Individuals with a history of drug or alcohol abuse within the past 2 years.
