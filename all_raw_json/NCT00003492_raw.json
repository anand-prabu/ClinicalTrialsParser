Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for an additional\n      8 months after reaching CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for the second year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
