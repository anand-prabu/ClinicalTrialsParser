    <description>The intervention group will conduct a 12 week training period with two training sessions of 60 minutes per week at a local hospital. The start shall be made within 6 weeks after stroke . The training shall be conducted in a group with a maximum of 10 participants and start running as new participants in the intervention group will be added. The intensity during the exercise program should be individualized and based on the initial tests . Patients should be advised to reach a degree of exertion 13-15/20, Rate of Perceived Exertion (Borg 's RPE scale)
Two fitness goals was to be achieved during the training session:
1. An individual training level corresponded to 50% or more of maximal oxygen uptake for at least 40 min ( Borg 9-11/20 ) . Which corresponds to 70 % of maximum heart rate.
2:nd 80% or more of the estimated maximum oxygen uptake during two periods of 8 minutes( Borg 13-15/20 ) .Which corresponds to 85% of maximum heart rate.</description>
