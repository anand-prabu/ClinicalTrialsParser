Patients receiving ketamine PCA are expected to\n      require less total and breakthrough opioid and to have similar or improved objective pain\n      scores.  Patients receiving ketamine are also expected to have shorter duration of\n      supplemental oxygen requirement, fewer episodes of oxygen desaturation, improved pulmonary\n      toilet, lower use of antiemetics, and shorter times to first bowel movement.  Ketamine is\n      further expected to be associated with decreased intensive care unit and hospital lengths of\n      stay, faster time to maximum allowable ambulation, decreased opioid dosage at discharge, and\n      lower report of chronic pain syndromes."
