Specifically, the\n      device orientation and configuration will be evaluated with respect to renal function.\n      Since detailed CT scan imaging will be performed prior to and after endovascular repair,\n      critical data concerning each branched vessel length, tangential orientation from the aorta,\n      angle of incidence, and diameter can be determined.  This information can then be coupled\n      with hemodynamic data obtained from duplex ultrasonography as well as changes in renal\n      volume, eGFR, and flow characteristics over time.  By analyzing the data in this fashion, it\n      may be possible to determine changes in hemodynamics and/or physiologic conditions with\n      respect to branched stent-graft design characteristics.  These data may be utilized to\n      enhance current device design and improve patient outcomes."
