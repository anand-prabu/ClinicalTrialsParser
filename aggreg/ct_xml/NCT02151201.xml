  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We evaluated the impact of viewing an educational video about influenza vaccination in
      pregnancy  just prior to a routine prenatal visit on vaccination health beliefs and
      vaccination rate. We hypothesized that the video would positively impact both vaccination
      health beliefs and vaccination rate compared to a control video.

      We studied the impact of influenza in pregnancy video education that was developed by the
      CDC and currently available to the public on the internet. We looked to see if viewing the
      video just prior to a routine scheduled prenatal visit could positively influence health
      beliefs regarding vaccination and improve the rate of vaccination that day. Patients were
      randomized to view the intervention video or a control video of similar length about hand
      washing. Pre visit and post visit questionnaires were given about vaccination health
      beliefs. We also asked if the shot had been recommended by the physician. One month after
      the visit, we used a structured phone interview to gather additional information regarding
      why participants who had not been vaccinated made that choice.
