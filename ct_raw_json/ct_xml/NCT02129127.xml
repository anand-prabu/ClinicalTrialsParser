    <textblock>
      This first-in-man study is to evaluate the Drug-Coated Chocolate (DCC) Balloon for
      percutaneous arterial angioplasty in patients with symptomatic peripheral arterial disease.
      The study focuses on acute device performance and peri-procedural safety and also seeks to
      further characterize the performance of the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, single-arm study.  Symptomatic lower extremity
      Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) patients presenting for endovascular revascularization
      will be enrolled in the study if they meet all entry criteria. The study will include
      patients from New Zealand  and the European Union.   The endpoints were designed to
      establish safety of the DCC and to identify long-term clinical benefits of this technology.

      The patients treated in this study will be designated into the above the knee (ATK)
      follow-up schedule if they are treated with the DCC in the SFA or Popliteal vessels.  This
      schedule calls for clinical visits with duplex ultrasounds at 1,6 and 12 months.  Patients
      will be designated into the below the knee (BTK) follow-up schedule if they are treated with
      the DCC in the Peroneal, Anterior Tibial, Posterior Tibial or Pedal vessels.  These patients
      will have clinical visits at 1, 3 and 6 months with duplex ultrasound at the 1 and 6 months
      visits only.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>LLL is determined by assessing the difference between the minimum lumen diameter (MLD) immediately after treatment with the DCC and the MLD at angiographic follow-up. LLL will determined by the Angiographic Core Laboratory.</description>

    <description>This is defined as the percentage of procedures that accomplish less than 30% residual stenosis without flow-limiting dissection at target lesion after DCC treatment.</description>

    <time_frame>approx 1 hour</time_frame>

    <time_frame>30 days / 3 Months (BTK only) / 6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This will calculate the number of patients who do not require a clinically indicated TLR.     Clinically indicated TLR is defined as any repeat percutaneous intervention at the DCC target lesion or bypass surgery at the DCC target vessel performed for &gt;50% restenosis or another complication of the target lesion</description>

    <time_frame>30 days / 3 Months (BTK only) / 6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>This is a composite endpoint which counts the number of patients who experience limb salvage.  Patients will fail this endpoint if they undergo a major amputation (defined as unplanned amputation at or above the ankle) or if a procedure related death occurs.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patency</measure>
    <time_frame>6 Months / 12 Months (ATK only)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
