Blood samples\n      will be drawn and urine samples will be collected immediately before and during a 32-hr\n      period following the dose. The concentrations of maraviroc and its oxidative metabolites\n      from the blood and urine samples will be measured and the pharmacokinetics of maraviroc and\n      its metabolites will be compared among the three groups with different CYP3A5 polymorphic\n      status.\n\n      --------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
