Genetic polymorphisms are the most important factors to clopidogrel resistance.\n\n        3. The purpose of this study is to find the genes which are the related to clopidogrel\n           resistance.\n\n        4. Through gene sequencing, we can filter patient of clopidogrel resistance, so another\n           drug maybe used to avoid the undesired efficacy."
