Accumulated loading of the plantar fascia seems to relate to\n      development of PF, as it is commonly seen in runners and those who are overweight, and\n      number of daily steps or simply time of standing has been shown to be a predisposing factor\n      for PF development.\n\n      Orthosis and glucocorticoid injections are 2 widely used treatments with proven effect.\n      However treatment of overuse injury in other tendon/aponeurosis-like structures, has over\n      the later years been dominated by an increasing documentation of a good curative effect of\n      heavy controlled mechanical loading (eccentric strength exercises or heavy slow concentric\n      strength training) upon tendinopathies  in Achilles or patella tendon. However, no studies\n      have looked at the influence of physical training (e.g. strength training) on the diseased\n      plantar aponeurosis. Also no studies have looked at the effect of a combination of giving\n      local glucocorticoid injection and training on this or other tendon overuse entities.\n\n      We hypothesize that heavy strength training will have a positive effect upon PF, and that a\n      combination of training and glucocorticoid injections will have an additive effect upon this\n      disease and be even more effective than each of the treatments alone. Glucocorticoid\n      injection acting as the standard control treatment."
