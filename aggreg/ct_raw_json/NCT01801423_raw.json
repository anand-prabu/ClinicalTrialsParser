Hydroxyurea will be prescribed as an investigational therapy by the treating physician.  Recommended guidelines for titration of hydroxyurea to maximal tolerated dose are below.  The study intervention will include hydroxyurea to begin at ~ 20 mg/kg/day(range 17.5 - 26 mg/kg/day).  No dose escalation will occur as this dose was shown to have some efficacy in infants with SCA and was associated with rare myelosuppression.(1)"
