The trial is based in previous results with autologous MSC (Orozco et al.,\n      Transplantation  92: 822-828; 2011). Here we propose a phase I-II trial, prospective,\n      randomized, blinded, and controlled for the treatment DDD using MSV, a Good Manufacturing\n      Practice (GMP)-compliant expanded bone marrow MSC  (MSV, PEI Num. 10-134). The assay\n      consists of two arms with 12 patients each one. Patients in the experimental arm will be\n      given a single intra-discal transplantation of MSV (25 millions in 2 ml). Control patients\n      will be infiltrated in the paravertebral muscles close to the lesion with 2 ml of 1%\n      mepivacain. We shall follow the evolution of pain, disability and quality of life as well as\n      disc fluid content by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (T2-calibrated)."
