Colony-stimulating factors such as thrombopoietin and G-CSF may\n      increase the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a\n      person's immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of colony-stimulating factors in treating\n      children who have recurrent or refractory solid tumors and who are receiving chemotherapy."

Chemotherapy is continued in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity for a maximum of 6 courses every\n      21 days.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of recombinant human thrombopoietin IV\n      on days 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose at which fewer than 2 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. After\n      the MTD is determined an additional cohort of patients are treated at this dose level every\n      other day on days 4-20. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day\n      5 and continuing until absolute neutrophil count is greater than 1000/mm3 for 2 consecutive\n      days or day 33.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study."
