  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study aimed to evaluate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and
      biochemical exams in hypertensive elderlies and the influence of the polymorphism of the
      angiotensin converting enzyme in these response.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the chronic effects of resistance training on blood pressure and biochemical
      exams in elderly, 135 hypertensive elderlies were divided into 2 groups: trained and
      control. The trained group was submitted to a resistance training period. Before the 16
      weeks ACE gene was genotyped (PCR). Before and after 16 weeks, blood pressure (ambulatory),
      HDL-cholesterol, Total cholesterol, Glycemia, Triacylglycerol (colorimetric assay) and
      plasminogen activator inhibition (PAI-1), intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1), vascular
      endothelial cell adhesion molecule (VCAM-1), Adiponectin, tumor necrosis factor alpha
      (TNF-alpha), C Reactive Protein, Angiotensin II, Angiotensin Converting Enzyme, Angiotensin
      1-7, (ELISA assay) were measured.
