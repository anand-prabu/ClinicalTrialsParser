The investigators plan to track daily adherence of patients to a\n      prescribed chronic disease drug using a new technology that electronically monitors when a\n      pill bottle has been opened. In our control condition, patients will be monitored but not be\n      provided with any reminders, adherence information, or incentive to adhere to their\n      medication. Our four additional treatments will either: (1) provide the patient with a daily\n      email, text message, or phone call reminder to take the pill; (2) email the patient a weekly\n      summary of his/her performance and an evaluation of performance highlighting the importance\n      of medication adherence; (3) email the patient, as well as patient-selected friends or\n      family members, a weekly summary of his/her performance; or (4) pay patients for each day\n      that they take their pill."
