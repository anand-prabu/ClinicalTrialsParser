  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aim: To evaluate a culturally-adapted method of lifestyle assessment, counseling, and
      education among Arab people with diabetes who have varying literacy skills using an
      interactive computerized tool and graphically-enhanced patient logs for dietary and physical
      activity.

      The investigators hypothesize that this tool will: a) increase patients' knowledge and
      understanding of the role of lifestyle (diet and physical activity) in diabetes management;
      b) improve patients' engagement in monitoring dietary intake and physical activity; c)
      improve dietary and physical activity behaviors and self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM)
      practices; d) improve glycemic control; and, e) improve the efficiency of lifestyle
      assessment, education and counseling while increasing patients' engagement in the process.
