Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more cancer cells.\n      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim allow doctors to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy drugs to kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of lomustine, procarbazine, filgrastim,\n      and radiation therapy in treating patients who have primary central nervous system lymphoma."

Determine response rate, response duration, and survival of patients with\n      AIDS-related or immunocompetent primary central nervous system lymphoma after treatment with\n      oral lomustine and procarbazine, filgrastim (G-CSF), and radiotherapy. II. Determine\n      toxicity of this combined modality in these patients. III. Determine quality of life of\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by CD4 count (50/mm3 and under vs greater than 50/mm3).\n      Patients receive oral lomustine on day 1 and oral procarbazine on days 1-10 and days 22-31.\n      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously daily on days 12-21 and days 33-42, until\n      absolute neutrophil counts recover. Patients with a complete response after 6 weeks receive\n      one additional course of chemotherapy prior to radiotherapy. Patients with a partial\n      response, stable disease, or disease progression after 6 weeks proceed to radiotherapy\n      without receiving a second course of chemotherapy. Whole brain radiotherapy is administered\n      daily for 28 days beginning 1-3 weeks following chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed\n      prior to therapy, at 3 and 6 weeks, and then every 2 months following radiotherapy. Patients\n      are followed every 2 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 16 patients will be accrued for this study."
