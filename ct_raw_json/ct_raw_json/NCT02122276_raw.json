The alternation of muscular property was accompanied by the alternation\n      of spinal circuitry property, and was related to the immobilization adaptation. Previous\n      study showed that remobilization by continuous passive motion (CPM) for one month would\n      restore the function of spinal circuitry in individual with chronic SCI. It is possible that\n      long term application of CPM can reverse the adaptation of contractile properties of the\n      paralyzed muscle after SCI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a four\n      month CPM training on muscular properties in individuals with chronic SCI."
