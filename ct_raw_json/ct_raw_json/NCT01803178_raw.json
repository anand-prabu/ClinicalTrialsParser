At last, the effects of plant sterols on\n      z-scores of circulating biomarkers of endothelial dysfunction and low-grade inflammation\n      will be assessed.\n\n      For all study outcomes, effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated.\n\n      Hypothesis: Based on available evidence, it is hypothesized that plant sterols modestly\n      increase FMD."

Elevated\n      cholesterol and especially LDL-cholesterol concentrations are established risk factors for\n      coronary heart disease (CHD) and reducing these concentrations by dietary modification or\n      drug treatment have been shown to reduce the risk of CHD. Direct evidence supporting a\n      reduced risk of CHD has so far not been generated. Investigating the effects of consuming\n      plant sterols on intermediate risk factors beyond cholesterol-lowering is therefore\n      warranted."
