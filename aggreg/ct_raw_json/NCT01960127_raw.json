The effect of this\n      training has not yet been evaluated in the decompensated cirrhosis patient population. The\n      safety of this intervention also requires further study. Using a randomized controlled\n      design, the investigators aim to determine the safety and efficacy of eight weeks of aerobic\n      exercise training on aerobic capacity, functional performance, and muscle mass in\n      decompensated cirrhosis patients."
