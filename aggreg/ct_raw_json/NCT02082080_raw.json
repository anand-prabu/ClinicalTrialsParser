First, based on WHO (World Health\n      Organization) references obese (BMI-Z score \u2265 2) and overweight (BMI-Z score \u2265 1) students\n      from 12 primary schools (randomly allocated to 6 intervention and 6 comparison) will be\n      screened. Then from the screened students 30 students with the following inclusion criteria\n      will be recruited: not metabolically ill, not on a weight losing diet and not professionally\n      athlete. For selected students BMI-Z score as primary outcome will be calculated.\n      Demographic data, as well as data on waist and hip circumference, triceps skin-fold\n      thickness, food intake for 3 days (2 ordinary week days and 1 weekend) and physical activity\n      will be collected at the beginning and at end of the 6-month intervention. The approach of\n      the study will be Health Promoting Schools. The intervention includes three components,\n      i.e., nutrition education (students and parents), increased physical activity, and changing\n      environment (food items offered in schools' canteens). Nutrition education will be imparted\n      (a 30-minute session per week) by health instructors; physical activity will be done under\n      the supervision of the school coaches (2 one-hour sessions per week). Parents' education (a\n      1.5-hour session) will be monthly. Finally the efficacy of the intervention will be\n      determined and reported."
