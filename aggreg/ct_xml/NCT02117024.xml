  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test whether vaccination with Viagenpumatucel-L combined low-dose
      cyclophosphamide followed by sequential chemotherapy will prolong the survival of patients
      with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who have failed two prior lines of therapy compared
      with chemotherapy alone. Patients will be randomized 2 to 1 into the Viagenpumatucel-L arm
      and the chemotherapy alone arm, respectively.
