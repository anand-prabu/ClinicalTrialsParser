      The main purpose of this study is to study the safety and effectiveness of ADXS11-001 when
      combined with standard chemotherapy and radiation treatment for anal cancer. ADXS11-001 is
      an investigational agent that is not approved by the FDA to treat anal cancer or any other
      cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel treatments are needed in anal cancer. An important percentage of patients with locally
      advanced anal cancer will have persistent loco-regional disease or develop systemic
      metastases. Virtually all cases of anal cancer are related to infection by HPV. Anal cancer
      cells infected with HPV have the tumor associated antigen HPV E7. ADXS11-001 causes antigen
      presenting cells to be stimulated to facilitate immune cells to attack cancer cells
      expressing HPV E7. ADXS11-001, at the phase II dose of 1x109 CFU,  has been shown to be safe
      in patients with advanced cervical cancer which also is caused by HPV infection. Anti-tumor
      activity and safety have been demonstrated in cervical cancer to single agent ADXS11-001 and
      the combination of ADXS11-001 and cisplatin chemotherapy. Data presented at ASCO 2012
      ADXS11-001 is currently being evaluated in women in the United States with cervical
      intraepithelial neoplasia. Radiation may augment the activity of ADXS11-001 increasing the
      exposure of tumor related antigens thereby increasing the chance for loco-regional disease
      eradication and preventing systemic recurrence. Therefore, ADXS11-001 may increase complete
      response, prevent recurrence disease and increase disease-free and overall survival in anal
      cancer. This protocol will develop sufficient preliminary safety and efficacy data to
      facilitate the investigation of ADXS11-001 in anal cancer within &quot;NRG&quot;, the newly formed
      cooperative group based on the merger of the RTOG, NSABP and GOG.

      As described above, Phase I studies and preliminary data from phase II studies have
      demonstrated that ADXS11-001, 1x109 CFU, can be safely administered as a single agent and in
      combination with chemotherapy. For example in over 200 patients treated at the dose of
      1x109CFU there have been no cases of severe listeria bacteremia or grade 3 cardiopulmonary
      toxicity. However, since ADXS11-001 has not previously been administered with radiation, the
      primary objective of this study will be to establish the safety of the addition of
      ADXS11-001 to chemoradiation for anal cancer. The following schedules will be assessed.

        -  Treatment Schedule #1:  The first dose will be given 10-14 days prior to the initiation
           of chemoradiation. The 2nd-4th dosages of ADXS11-001will not be until after completion
           of all chemoradiation. The second dosage of ADXS11-001 will not be administered until a
           minimum of 10 days after completion of chemoradiation, ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3, serum
           creatinine &lt; 1.5 mg/dl and all toxicities from chemoradiation have resolved to grade 2
           or less. The subsequent third and fourth treatment with of ADXS11 will be administered
           at 28 day intervals. This will provide the needed safety data to evaluate Treatment
           Schedule #2.

        -  Treatment Schedule #2: If dose limiting toxicities (defined below) are not exceeded
           during Treatment Schedule #1, then Treatment Schedule #2 will investigate
           administration of the second dose of ADXS11-001 on day 21 of chemoradiation.
           Administration of ADXS11-001 on day 21 of chemoradiation would only be administered if
           ANC &gt; 1,000 cells/mm3, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl and all toxicities from ongoing
           chemoradiation were grade 2 or less. The third treatment with ADXS11-001 would be
           administered no less than 10 days after completion of all chemoradiation, if ANC &gt;
           1,000 cells/mm3, serum creatinine &lt; 1.5mg/dl and all toxicities from ongoing
           chemoradiation were grade 2 or less. The fourth treatment would be 28 days later.

      Standard treatment with mitomycin, 5-FU and radiation for anal cancer has substantial
      toxicity. In RTOG 9811, 74% of patients had grade 3/4 nonhematologic toxicity and 61% of
      patients had grade 3 or grade 4 hematologic toxicity from this regimen. Therefore, the
      toxicities of standard chemoradiation with mitomycin, 5-FU and radiation are well above the
      conventionally accepted parameters in a phase I study even prior to adding ADXS11-001.
      However, it is critical that the addition of ADXS-11-001 does not compromise the delivery of
      potentially curative standard chemoradiation for anal cancer.
