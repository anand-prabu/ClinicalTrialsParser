  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fondaparinux is a parenteral anticoagulant drug approved for the prophylaxis of venous
      thromboembolism in high risk medical patients. A relevant proportion of these patients have
      renal insufficiency and/or thrombocytopenia which represent independent risk factors for
      bleeding. The risk of bleeding may be increased when fondaparinux is administered to
      patients with a reduced renal function and/or low platelet count. A lower dose of
      fondaparinux, 1.5 mg daily, has been approved for patients with renal insufficiency defined
      by a creatinine clearance between 20 and 50 mL/min. However, to our knowledge, there are no
      clinical studies that have specifically evaluated prophylaxis with fondaparinux in
      acutely-ill medical patients with a moderate to severe thrombocytopenia. The scope of this
      study is to evaluate the safety of fondaparinux in high risk hospitalized medical patients
      with a moderate to severe thrombocytopeniada defined by a platelet count between 100,000/uL
      and 30,000/uL.
