  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to learn more about how rTMS works to reduce the symptoms of
      depression. This information can be used to improve the effectiveness of the treatment. The
      study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine changes in brain
      function after treatment with rTMS.  fMRI is a safe and painless technique that allows
      investigators to observe the brain &quot;at work.&quot; The investigators will use fMRI to see what
      regions of the brain become active when you perform a concentration task and how that
      activation is changed after rTMS.

    <description>Our primary hypothesis is that rTMS will increase cortical excitability, leading to more efficient cortex manifested as smaller CBF increases in left dorsolateral Prefrontal Cortex (dlPFC) during working memory activation.  Our secondary hypotheses are that rTMS will increase resting CBF in the dlPFC and will induce plastic changes throughout a network of brain regions connected with the dlPFC, including the medial frontal cortex, a region associated with emotion regulation and known to exhibit aberrant function in major depression disorder(MDD).</description>

    <description>20 active sessions, within a 4 week period, where subjects receive the same repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) treatment parameters as the FDA-approved device label (10 Hz) to a targeted area of the brain.  After these sessions, a second fMRI will be completed then 5 additional tapering treatments of rTMS over a 2 week period.</description>

    <description>20 sham sessions, within a 4 week period, where subjects receive inactive treatments (0 Hz) of repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS).  After 20 sessions and completion of a second fMRI scan, patients in this group will then be unblinded and transitioned to the active arm and will receive a full course (25 sessions) of active rTMS over a 6 week period.</description>
