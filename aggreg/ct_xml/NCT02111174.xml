      The purpose of this study is to see if Scrambler Therapy with the Calmare MC5-A machine will
      relieve chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy (CIPN).

      Scrambler Therapy is a method of pain relief given with common electrocardiography (ECG)
      skin electrodes. The electrodes are placed on the body in pairs, and the Scrambler Therapy
      machine directs electrical signals across the field to simulate non-pain information.

      Based on other studies, we think that we relieve pain with the Scrambler therapy device, but
      it has not been tested in a setting such as this one. This means that some of the pain
      relief could be due to placebo effect, or the CIPN pain going away on its own.  In this
      study we want to compare the Scrambler Therapy with the sham therapy (the therapy that does
      not use the electrical signals).  We hope that this study will help us determine if the
      Scrambler device really helps patients with CIPN.

      Cancer patients with chronic, chemotherapy-related pain of 4 or more (on a 0-10 scale) for
      at least 3 months may be eligible to join this study.

    <description>The device is a cutaneous electrical stimulator that uses electrodes placed on the skin similar to an electrocardiogram (EKG) machine, feeling similar to a tingling or bee-sting like sensation during the therapy.  The electrodes are placed in areas thought to help relieve pain associated with chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.</description>

          -  Men and women, 18 years of age or older with cancer

             taxanes-such as paclitaxel or docetaxel, or platinum-based compounds such as
             carboplatin or cis-platinum or oxaliplatin, or vinca alkaloids such as vincristine,
             vinblastine, or vinorelbine, or proteosome inhibitors such as bortezimib).

             attributed to chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy

             peripheral neuropathy of another etiology: e.g., carpal tunnel syndrome, B12
             deficiency, AIDS, monoclonal gammopathy, diabetes, heavy metal poisoning amyloidosis,
             syphilis, hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, inherited neuropathy, etc.) that might
             be responsible for the patient's current neuropathic symptoms

          -  Skin conditions such as open sores that would prevent proper application of the
             electrodes

          -  Other medical or other condition(s) that in the opinion of the investigators might

          -  Currently receiving anti-convulsants (such as gabapentinoids, e.g. gabapentin
             (Neurontin) or pregabalin (Lyrica). Because of data that support that patients do not
             do as well when on gabapentin or pregabalin, all patients on these medications will
             be weaned off them prior to study initiation.  The study team will provide
             instructions on how to do this
