      -  The purpose of this study is to understand and grasp the incidence rate of hypothermia
           during perioperative period of elective operations under general anaesthesia in
           Beijing.

        -  The purpose of this study is to carry out a subgroup analysis on the survey data and
           explore the high-risk factors for the incidence of hypothermia.

    <textblock>
      The investigators study 800 patients from 24 hospitals who receive elective surgery under
      general anesthesia.Core body temperature is measured using infrared tympanic thermometer and
      at different times:upon the patient's arrival at the operating area,upon entrance in the
      operation room,at the start of anesthesia,every 15 minutes throughout the entire surgery,and
      entrance PACU. The investigators record the type and dosage of anesthesia drug,duration of
      surgery and anesthesia,operation room temperature,the mount of the infusion of intravenous
      fluids and blood at room temperature.
