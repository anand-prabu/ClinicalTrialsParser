    <textblock>
      The Eastern Caribbean Health Outcomes Research Network (ECHORN) has two aims: (1) To form a
      research collaborative across the Eastern Caribbean islands of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin
      Islands, Barbados, and Trinidad &amp; Tobago to recruit and follow a community-dwelling adult
      cohort to estimate the prevalence of known and potential risk factors associated with the
      development of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes and (2) To enhance health outcomes
      research leadership capacity in the region through a series of dedicated activities locally
      and abroad. ECHORN will expand clinical research with racial/ethnic minority populations in
      a transitioning part of the globe now threatened with an epidemic of noncommunicable chronic
      diseases (NCD). ECHORN's findings will have direct implications for the health disparities
      research and policy agenda in the mainland United States. In the long term, the links ECHORN
      will facilitate with local health policy delegations and global strategic organizational
      partners will promote the translation of research to improve health outcomes across the
      region. The collection and storage of biological specimens will also contribute to national
      biomonitoring projects and has the potential to identify unique risk and protective factors
      in the development of NCD.

        We plan to enroll and follow a community-based sample of 1% of the total population of the
        4 ECHORN sites combined (total n = 5,500). We seek to populate the cohort to roughly
        approximate the populations of the participating sites and deliberately oversample from
        Barbados and the U.S.Virgin Islands(USVI) to maximize sample heterogeneity along
        race/ethnicity/culture. Puerto Rico residents will comprise 40% of the cohort (n=2200
        total), Trinidad and Tobago residents at 30% (n=1650 total), Barbados residents at 20% (n
        =1100) and the USVI at 10% (n=550).
