  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the phase Ib, the primary purpose is to establish the maximum tolerated dose
      (MTD)(s)/recommended phase ll dose (RP2D) and schedule of  LEE011 and MEK162 orally
      administered combination. Once the MTD(s)/RP2D have been determined for each tested
      schedule, additional patients will be enrolled in the phase II portion of the study at the
      RP2D on the chosen schedule in order to assess the anti-tumor activity of the combination in
      addition to continued evaluation of safety.

    <description>The phase Ib is the dose escalation part where successive cohorts of 3-6 newly enrolled patients receiving various dose pairs considering the recommendation from an adaptive BLRM incorporating the EWOC principle until MTD(s)/RP2D is defined. Patients with either measurable or evaluable disease will be eligible. If multiple alternate dosing schedules are explored in parallel, the allocation of patients will proceed in an alternating fashion. Approximately 40 patients are expected to be treated during the phase Ib part of the study.</description>
