A pragmatic cluster randomised\n      controlled trial has been established to meet the aims and in total 10.600 individuals from\n      35 practices have been randomized in to two groups that will be invited in 2013-14 and\n      2017-18 respectively. The group offered the preventive health check in 2013-14 will\n      constitute the intervention group and the group examined in 2017 - 18 the control group.  A\n      follow up of the intervention group in 2017 - 18 will provide data for the intention to\n      treat analysis revealing the effect. Outcome measures are level of physical activity, risk\n      of getting cardiovascular disease, sick leave and labor market attachment."
