Typical agents used for treatment include tamoxifen and\n      the aromatase inhibitors. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitor therapy is\n      increasingly common because it is associated with fewer long-term serious toxicities\n      compared to tamoxifen. However, aromatase inhibitors cause arthralgias in 40-50% of\n      patients, which can influence adherence to therapy and can lead to treatment discontinuation\n      in a minority of cases. The mechanism underlying development of this toxicity remains\n      unclear, and predictors of who will develop these symptoms remain undefined. This\n      observational study is designed to collect patient-reported outcomes and serial serum\n      samples in order to investigate potential etiologies of this bothersome toxicity."
