  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if ruxolitinib, in combination with
      Pemetrexed/Cisplatin and Pemetrexed Maintenance, is safe and effective in the treatment of
      nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study consists of an open-label, safety run-in (consisting of 1 to 4 cohorts of 9
      subjects each), to confirm the safety of ruxolitinib in combination with
      pemetrexed/cisplatin in subjects with nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is
      Stage IIIB, Stage IV, or recurrent. Subjects in the safety run-in will receive open-label
      ruxolitinib and pemetrexed and cisplatin.

      In the second part of the study, subjects will be enrolled and randomized  to receive
      pemetrexed and cisplatin (open-label) and either ruxolitinib or placebo in a blinded manner.
      The dose of ruxolitinib administered will be determined from the data produced in the safety
      run-in phase.

      Treatment will consist of repeating 21-day cycles. Subjects will receive infusions of
      pemetrexed and cisplatin on Day 1 of each cycle and ruxolitinib/placebo will be
      self-administered during the entire cycle. Maintenance therapy with ruxolitinib or placebo
      in combination with pemetrexed, based on the original treatment assignment, will be allowed
      for subjects eligible for maintenance therapy.
