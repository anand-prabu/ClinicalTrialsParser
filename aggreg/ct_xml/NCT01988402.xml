    <textblock>
      Traditional teaching holds that starting allopurinol during an acute gout attack will
      prolong the attack.  Recent expert opinion from the American College of Rheumatology
      Guidelines is that allopurinol may be started during an acute, treated gout attack.  This
      study is designed to test the hypothesis that allopurinol does not prolong an acute, treated
      gout attack.  Patients will either take allopurinol capsules or and identical capsule
      containing no allopurinol (placebo) over 28 days, starting within 72 hours of a gout attack
      that is being treated with other standard measures.  During the study, neither the patient
      nor the examiner will know what pills are being taken.  The time to resolution of the attack
      is the primary outcome measure.  Pain level, serum uric acid level, and complications of
      therapy will also be monitored.  A minimum of 32 patients completing the study are needed
      for a meaningful conclusion.
