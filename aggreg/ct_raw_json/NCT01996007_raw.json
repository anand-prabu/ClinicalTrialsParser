            "textblock": "Pneumococcus is a bacteria that causes disease of the respiratory tract (pneumonia and\n      middle ear infections), blood poisoning,  and meningitis. It is frequently carried by people\n      in back of the throat without symptoms. Pneumococcal carriage in the Thames Valley region\n      has been studied over the last 12 years with carriage rates having been shown to be\n      reflective of disease potential and hence vaccine effect.  During this time pneumococcal\n      vaccines have been introduced into the routine immunisation schedules of this community. The\n      PCV7 (A vaccine against 7 types of pneumococcus) vaccine has subsequently been noted to have\n      had a significant impact in reducing vaccine serotype carriage and disease. Herd protection\n      (indirect protection of unvaccinated individuals) has also been implicated with vaccine\n      serotypes not being carried in parents of vaccinated children. The most common serotype\n      carried since the introduction of PCV7 is 19A, which is included in the PCV13 vaccine (A\n      vaccine against 13 types of pneumococcus). PCV13 has superseded PCV7 in the routine\n      immunisation schedule, however its impact on carriage and disease in this community is yet\n      to be evaluated."
