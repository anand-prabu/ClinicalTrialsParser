The reason it may not\n      be safe, is that taking Truvada-PrEP may lead to an increase in risk behaviour. This could\n      mean there was more chance of catching HIV and other infections.\n\n      As well as finding out if a large trial would be possible, this study will looks at other\n      factors including:\n\n        -  Whether people using PrEP change the number of partners they have sex with\n\n        -  Whether people using PrEP change how often they use condoms\n\n        -  Whether PrEP leads to higher rates of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\n      This information on changes in sexual activity over time is one of the most important\n      aspects of the study, because we have never collected this before in the UK. This means we\n      don't know what happens to people's sexual activity without PrEP!"
