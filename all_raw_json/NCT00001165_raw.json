The present study proposes to\n      continue to test the effect of combined chemotherapy with streptozotocin, 5-fluorouracil and\n      doxorubicin in biopsy-proven cases of metastatic non-beta-islet cell tumor in patients with\n      Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.  We published our initial experience with this protocol in 1988.\n       An objective response was observed in 40% of patients."
