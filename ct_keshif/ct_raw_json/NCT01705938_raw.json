Following outpatient screening\n      from approximately 5 to 42 days before dosing, each subject will enter the Clinical\n      Pharmacology Unit (CPU) and will be housed from at least 48 hours, before dosing until 48\n      hours after dosing. Subjects will be given single dose of the study drug on the day of\n      dosing and remain in the CPU for at least 48 hours. Subjects will return to the CPU on Days\n      8\u00b11 and 15\u00b11 for safety follow up.  Safety Committee Meetings will be conducted to review\n      safety, tolerability, and available Pharmacokinetic data from the current and previous\n      treatment group(s), prior to dosing subsequent treatment groups.  Subjects in a given\n      treatment group are considered completers once they have completed the Day 15\u00b11 day Follow\n      up Visit."
