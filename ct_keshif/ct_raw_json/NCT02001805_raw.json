The investigators have already collected muscle\n      biopsies and established stem cells from people with Type 2 diabetes, obese healthy and\n      normal weight healthy. In this study, the investigators will establish a cohort of highly\n      physically active marathon runners.

With the knowledge the\n      investigators have today, there is reason to believe that it is healthy to run both in a\n      physical sense, but perhaps also in terms of brain function. However, there has not\n      previously carried out extensive comparative studies of very active runners and healthy\n      untrained control subjects. In this project the investigators will characterize the degree\n      of training in subjects as the investigators will carry out various forms of physiological\n      studies on the subjects' fitness level. The investigators will examine whether there is a\n      linkage between training level and brain function.\n\n      The investigators will also examine muscle function at the molecular level. The\n      investigators will isolate stem cells (satellite cells) from muscles biopsy and establish\n      primary muscle cell cultures. By electrical stimulation of these cells in vitro, the\n      investigators can emulate a muscle contraction as during physical activity. The\n      investigators will test the overall hypothesis that physical activity affects stem cell\n      function.\n\n      The investigators will further study whether epigenetic phenomena (methylation) of selected\n      DNA sequences are sensitive to training level."
