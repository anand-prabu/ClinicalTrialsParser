  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To compare the effectiveness of two treatment strategies in early rheumatoid arthritis
      (ERA), namely the delayed usual care and early intensive care, in Hong Kong.

        -  The delayed usual care reflects the usual treatment practice in Hong Kong

        -  The early intensive care includes tight monitoring and immediate adjustment of therapy

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a 1-year  non-randomized clinical trial. Two groups of patients (delayed usual
      care and early intensive care) with diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and with symptoms
      onset of less than 2 years and disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) naive will be
      recruited. Remission is reached if patients fulfill the Boolean criteria.

    <description>The various patient-reported outcomes include employment status, Working Ability Index (WAI), disability index of Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy (FACIT), Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) and Health-related quality of life (HRQoL) generic measures</description>

    <description>The Utility score is calculated by EQ-5D self-report questionnaire, which provides a single index value for health status that can be used in the clinical and economic appraisal. Value set derived from a Chinese cohort in Beijing is used, since no value set for Hong Kong Chinese population is available.</description>

    <description>The ACR 20, 50, 70 responses are defined as at least 20%, 50%, 70% improvement in joint swelling and joint tenderness counts, and at least three of five other variables (i.e. erythrocyte sedimentation rate, HAQ score, pain score, and physicians' and patients' global assessments)</description>

    <description>MRI image set is evaluated and scored separately for the presence or absence of MRI erosion, synovitis, and bone marrow oedema. Bone erosions and bone marrow oedema are evaluated separately in each wrist bone, whereas synovitis is evaluated in the three regions of the wrist joint: the radioulnar area, the radiocarpal area, and the intercarpal-carpometacarpal area.</description>
