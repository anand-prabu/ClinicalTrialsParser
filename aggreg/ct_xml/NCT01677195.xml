      The primary purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a naturally occurring
      clay substance  (ACCS100) in reducing harmful effects of aflatoxin exposure (a carcinogen)
      and fumonisin (a cancer promoter). This clay substance contains of a variety of minerals
      including calcium, sodium, potassium, and magnesium. UPSN and similar aluminosilicate
      minerals have been regularly used as dietary supplements by humans and animals, and the
      safety of this naturally occurring clay substance has been tested in clinical trials. The
      FDA treats such minerals or nutritional supplements as a drug when tested for potential of
      lessening the likelihood of disease (i.e., potential for mitigating disease).

      This study involves the use of an investigational drug called Hydrated Sodium Calcium
      Aluminosilicate (ACCS100).  &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the &quot;drug&quot; has not yet been
      approved by the U.S. Food &amp; Drug Administration (FDA) for reducing harmful effects mycotoxin
      exposure in humans.

      This planned clinical trial is a comparative study to determine the safety and effectiveness
      of ACCS100 capsules, the investigational product, vs. placebo in participants for the
      reduction of dietary mycotoxin exposure.  One measure of effectiveness will be the analysis
      of the Bexar County participant's AFB1/FB1 metabolite levels in the blood and urine samples.
       Additionally, this clinical trial will determine the adherence to the dosing schedule of
      the participants; determine the prevalence of mycotoxin exposure in the screened population
      of residence of Bexar County, Texas; and compare side-effects and adverse events between
      ACCS100 and placebo in the participant population.  These data will reveal the value of
      mineral enterosorbent strategies for the improvement of public health and for the well-being
      of humans at risk for dietary mycotoxin exposure and its consequences.

      The proposed indication for ACCS100 is &quot;for the reduction of dietary mycotoxin exposure in
      humans.&quot;

      ACCS100 is made from Hydrated Sodium Calcium Aluminosilicate (HSCAS), a substance generally
      recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA and has previously been shown to have no significant
      adverse effects when given as much as 4 grams per day to healthy study participants or
      immuno-compromised cancer patients.

      Rationale

      Our preliminary studies suggest that ACCS100 contains very low levels of trace metals and
      dioxins than are commonly found in smectite clays, and batch-to-batch QA/QC results for this
      material are more consistent.  We anticipate that ACCS100 can be used as a primary
      intervention to bind both AFB1 and FB1 to decrease the external dose of toxins from the diet
      and in turn reduce the incidence of hepatic cancer and disease in vulnerable communities.
      Using multiple animal models, our laboratory has shown that NS clay is highly effective in
      preventing the adverse effects of dietary mycotoxin. Also, Phase I and IIa clinical trials
      in Texas and Ghana have confirmed that NS is safe for human consumption and significantly
      reduces exposure to both AFB1 and FB1 (Wang et al., 2005; Afriyie-Gyawu et al., 2007, 2008;
      Wang et al., 2008; Phillips et al., 2007; Jiang et al., 2008; Jolly et al., 2006; Robinson,
      et al., 2009). The incidence of human HCC has been shown to be significantly elevated in
      several zip code regions in Bexar County, Texas. Studies conducted by the Agency for Toxic
      Substances and Disease Registry indicate that there are several zip code regions within
      Bexar County, Texas where the incidence of liver cancer is significantly elevated (ATSDR,
      2004). Notably, age-adjusted cancer incidence rates cited by the Texas Department of State
      Health Services from 2002-2006 show that Hispanics in Bexar Co. have an increased HCC
      incidence rate, 16.5 (15.0-18.0), compared to Hispanics in Texas, 10.9 (10.4-11.4); rates
      are per 100,000, and confidence intervals are 95% for rates. Furthermore, the HCC incidence
      rate for Bexar Co. Hispanics was considerably higher than all races in Bexar Co., 10.0
      (9.2-10.8), and all races in Texas, 5.8 (5.7-6.0). Hispanic males in Bexar County (compared
      to females) were shown to have the highest HCC incidence rate during this time period, at
      27.1 (24.2-30.2) versus 8.4 (7.0-9.9). Chronic exposure to low levels of AFB1 and FB1
      contaminated corn and peanuts, is a major risk factor for the development of HCC, and risk
      is significantly increased when exposed individuals are infected with hepatitis virus. An
      association between HCC incidence and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has been evident in
      many developed countries including the U.S., Japan, Egypt, and numerous countries in Europe
      (Seeff, 2004). Interestingly, records from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
      Center have shown that more than 50% of the HCC cases observed in Texas could be attributed
      to HCV infection (Hassan, et al., 2002). The HCV prevalence in Texas has been reported to
      vary from 1.25-2.63%, with higher concentrations in southern Texas and along the
      Texas-Mexico border (Yalamanchili, et al., 2005). Armstrong et al. (2000) estimated that in
      the future HCC incidence may rise in the U.S. due to the problem of chronic hepatitis C.
      While prevention of HCV infection would play a major role in reducing the burden of HCC,
      currently no vaccine is available for HCV. Thus, eliminating AFB1/FB1 exposure at an
      individual level (in the most vulnerable individuals), may contribute to the overall
      reduction of HCC risk and burden. In our recent pilot study, 184 volunteers from a primarily
      Hispanic community within three zip codes in Bexar Co. (with a significantly elevated liver
      cancer incidence rate) provided blood and urine samples for hepatitis screening and
      biomarker analyses at the San Antonio Metropolitan Health District (SAMHD) Environmental
      Health and Wellness Center (Figure 2). Of the participants, 7.1% were hepatitis C virus
      positive, based on anti-HCV antibody measurement. To assess short-term AFB1 exposure,
      urinary aflatoxin M1 (AFM1) levels were measured using high performance liquid
      chromatography with fluorescence detection. AFM1 was detectable in 11.7% of urine samples,
      with the average level at 223.85 Â± 250.56 (range 1.89-935.49) pg/mg creatinine. Results from
      a food frequency questionnaire showed that over 98% of participants reported that they ate
      fresh corn, canned or frozen corn, corn tortillas, Mexican food, rice, peanut butter, corn
      bread, and nuts at various frequencies. A large percentage of the population (44.8%)
      consumed corn tortillas frequently (3-14 times per week), and the majority (57.6%) ate more
      than 2 tortillas at each time of consumption. The detection of urinary AFM1 was
      significantly associated with an increased consumption of tortillas (p = 0.009), peanuts (p
      = 0.033) and rice (p = 0.037). Findings suggested that participants consuming high amounts
      of foods prone to AFB1/FB1 contamination may potentially be exposed to these toxins at
      significant levels. Importantly, strategies that reduce AFB1/FB1 exposure, especially in
      individuals infected with hepatitis, may play an important role in the prevention of HCC in
      at-risk communities in Texas. These preliminary studies provide the groundwork and proof of
      concept for the proposed project. Feasible interventions and therapies to diminish human
      exposure to AFB1/FB1 are imperative. In this proposal, studies will provide an innovative
      strategy that will reduce dietary mycotoxin exposure. Our approach will utilize ACCS100 to
      mitigate dietary exposures to AFB1 (a cancer initiator) and FB1 (a cancer promoter).
