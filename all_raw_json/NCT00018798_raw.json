Because\n      previous studies have focused on the development and persistence of symptoms immediately\n      following a stressor, the course of the chronic disorder has been largely unexplored.\n      Although there is evidence of both persistence and fluctuation of PTSD symptom presentation\n      in Vietnam veterans, little is known about how much and in what ways symptoms change over\n      time. This investigation will increase understanding of the nature and extent of symptom\n      fluctuation as well as the longitudinal course of PTSD as first steps in determining which\n      variables affect that course and how clinicians might intervene to alter it.\n\n      Aversive life events may constitute one factor that influences the course of chronic PTSD.\n      Researchers and clinicians have frequently hypothesized that stressful life events account\n      for much of the variability in course of chronic PTSD (Green, 1994; Resnick, Kilpatrick, and\n      Lipovsky, 199 1); individuals with PTSD may have a compromised ability to cope with\n      stressors, and such events may worsen existing symptoms. Social support is another variable\n      thought to affect the course of post-trauma symptomatology. Support from other persons has\n      been shown to both promote psychological health in general and to protect against\n      psychological deterioration in times of stress (e.g., Cassel, 1976; Cohen and Wills, 1985,\n      Nornis and Kamasty, 1996). This investigation will examine aversive life events and\n      perceived social support to determine their relationships over time to symptoms of PTSD."
