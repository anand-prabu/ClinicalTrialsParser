            "textblock": "Type-2 diabetes, and its most important risk factor, obesity, have become major strains on\n      our nation's health care system. By 2050, one in three U.S. adults could have diabetes\n      (Stobbe, 2010), and obesity currently contributes nearly 17% of U.S. medical costs (Cawley,\n      2010). Our nation's underserved urban minority populations disproportionately suffer from\n      type-2 diabetes and obesity. African-Americans, for example, comprise 12% of the US\n      population but 23% of the extremely obese (Livingston, 2004). To reduce diabetes, obesity\n      must be addressed. Unfortunately, traditional obesity interventions are intrusive and\n      costly.\n\n      This project will test the efficacy of the \"TRIMM\" (Tailored Rapid Interactive Mobile\n      Messaging) program, a user\u2010friendly, semi\u2010individualized text-messaging intervention to\n      facilitate lifestyle change and weight loss among obese African-American adults with or at\n      risk for diabetes, in a pilot, controlled clinical trial.\n\n      The text-messaging intervention will be in addition to, and compared with traditional diet,\n      behavior, and physical activity education. Tips will be designed to increase knowledge,\n      skills, and motivation. Participants will have the option to receive spiritually-based\n      messages, if desired.\n\n      166 overweight or obese men and women will be recruited from 10 Baltimore inner-city\n      churches, and will be assigned to one of two, six\u2010month lifestyle\u2010change programs.\n      Participants must be overweight, aged 21-65, and own a cell phone with text-messaging\n      capability. To be eligible for the study, participants will need to first pass a health\n      screening and meet other study criteria.\n\n      The McKesson Foundation is funding this study, which has a total of 5 visits, ranging from \u00bd\n      hr. to 3 hrs.  The active intervention will last 6 months, with a follow-up visit at month\n      12. The TRIMM Program will feature periodic, individualized text messages and feedback via\n      the participant's mobile phone as well as periodic follow\u2010up appointments. The traditional\n      program will consist of traditional diet, behavior, and physical activity education.\n\n      Qualified participants will receive individualized weight-loss plans and monetary\n      compensation for their time, effort, & parking.\n\n      The long\u2010term goal is to demonstrate, using a real\u2010life setting, the potential superiority\n      in efficacy of a specific mHealth application (text-messaging) for an underserved population\n      at high risk of type\u20102 diabetes, compared to traditional, often more costly, and currently\n      underutilized lifestyle\u2010change interventions."
