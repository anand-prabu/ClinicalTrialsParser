            "textblock": "Primary hyperoxaluria is an inborn error of metabolism that results in marked overproduction\n      of oxalate by the liver.  The excess oxalate causes kidney failure and can cause severe\n      systemic disease due to oxalate deposition in multiple body tissues.\n\n      Metabolic pathways that lead to oxalate are poorly understood, but recent evidence suggests\n      that hydroxyproline may play a role.  Sources of hydroxyproline include the diet and bone\n      turnover.  If  hydroxyproline can be confirmed as a signficant factor in primary\n      hyperoxaluria, diet modification might be of value in reducing the severity of disease.\n\n      This protocol, in which hydroxyproline labelled with a cold isotope is infused intravenously\n      in patients with primary hyperoxaluria, will allow us to measure the amount of oxalate\n      produced from hydroxyproline.  The contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to the amount\n      of oxalate excreted in urine in will be able to be determined for patients with each of the\n      known types of primary hyperoxaluria."

            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to\n      urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion in patients with primary hyperoxaluria.\n\n      Oxalic acid (COOH)2 is an end product of metabolism that is synthesized mainly in the liver.\n      We have estimated that 10 - 20 mg is synthesized in the body of healthy adults each day (1).\n      The main precursor of oxalate is glyoxylate (CHO\u2022COOH). The bulk of the glyoxylate formed is\n      normally transaminated to glycine (NH2\u2022CH2\u2022COOH) by alanine: lyoxylate aminotransferase\n      (AGT) or reduced to glycolate (CHOH\u2022COOH) by glyoxylate reductase (GR). Less than 10% of the\n      glyoxylate is oxidized to oxalate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In individuals with the\n      disease, primary hyperoxaluria, AGT, GR, or HOGA enzyme is deficient and the amount of\n      oxalate synthesized by the liver increases to 80 - 300 mg per day. The increased oxalate\n      excreted in urine can cause damage to kidney tissue.  Calcium oxalate stones may form in the\n      kidney or calcium oxalate crystals may deposit in renal tubules and the renal parenchyma\n      (nephrocalcinosis).  An increased rate of oxalate synthesis could also contribute to\n      idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease. Understanding the pathways of endogenous oxalate\n      synthesis and identifying strategies that decrease oxalate production could be beneficial\n      for individuals with these diseases.\n\n      Hydroxyproline is the primary source of glyoxylate identified in the body (2). Daily\n      collagen turnover of bone results in the formation of 300 - 450 mg of hydroxyproline, which\n      cannot be re-utilized by the body and is broken down. This metabolism yields 180 - 250 mg of\n      glyoxylate. Further hydroxyproline is obtained from the diet, primarily from meat and\n      gelatin-containing products. The bulk of the glyoxylate formed is converted to glycine by\n      the liver enzyme AGT, some to glycolate and a small amount to oxalate. The proportion of\n      these metabolites is not known with any certainty. In this study, a quantitative estimate of\n      the metabolites formed will provide estimates of the contribution of hydroxyproline turnover\n      to daily oxalate production. These experiments will provide valuable information for the\n      future assessment of the contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to oxalate production in\n      individuals with primary hyperoxaluria."
