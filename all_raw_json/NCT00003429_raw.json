Both diagnostic imaging techniques are to assess\n      the abdomen and pelvis, and must be done within 2 weeks prior to surgery. Patients eligible\n      for surgery undergo radical hysterectomy and lymphadenectomy and all specimens are evaluated\n      for correlation with the preoperative diagnostic tests findings.\n\n      Patients with recurrent cervical cancer obtain FDG-PET scan and CT scan of the thorax,\n      abdomen, and pelvis prior to surgical exploration for pelvic exenteration. All biopsy\n      specimens are evaluated for correlation with diagnostic tests findings.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients (20 patients with primary cervical cancer and 10\n      patients with recurrent cervical cancer) will be accrued for this study."
