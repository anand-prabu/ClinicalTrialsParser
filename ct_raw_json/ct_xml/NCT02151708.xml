  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Functional dyspepsia (FD) is a disorder characterized by chronic or recurrent upper
      abdominal pain or discomfort in the absence of a specific structural cause.1 Several
      mechanisms have been suggested to underlie dyspeptic symptoms. In a barostat study by Tack
      et al.2, impaired gastric accommodation to a meal was found in 40% of patients with FD, and
      this abnormality was associated with early satiety. Delayed GE was also found in almost 40%
      of patients with FD, and was associated with the symptoms of postprandial fullness, vomiting
      and early satiety.3-5 Improving gastric accommodation and prokinetic effect seem to be an
      attractive physiological target in patients with FD. Motilitone (Dong-A ST, Yongin, Korea)
      is a new herbal drug that was launched in December 2011 in Korea for treating patients with
      FD. It has multiple mechanisms of action such as fundus relaxation, visceral analgesia and
      prokinetic effects.6 The current study aims to evaluate effects of motilitone on gastric
      emptying and accommodation after a meal in patients with FD using three-dimensional gastric
      volume measurements by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients are randomly allocated to
      receive either motilitone 90 mg daily, motilitone 180 mg daily or placebo in a double
      blinded manner. After 2 weeks of treatment, patients undergo gastric MRI. The primary
      endpoint is gastric emptying rate. The secondary endpoints are gastric accommodation and
      symptom improvement.
