  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if the study drug, AXITINIB, has any effect on
      tumors found in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      NF2 is a condition that mainly affects the skin and nervous system. It causes non-cancerous
      tumors to grow on the nerves around a person's body. Some signs of NF2 include a gradual
      loss of hearing and tumors growing on the skin, the brain and the spinal cord, which can
      lead to complications.

      AXITINIB is an oral drug (taken by mouth) that is approved by the United States Food and
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of other types of tumors. However, in this
      research study, AXITINIB is considered investigational because it is not approved by the FDA
      for treatment of your medical condition (NF2). We know a lot about how well it is tolerated
      (handled), but we do not know if it is effective in treating your condition.

      This research study will test whether AXITINIB may shrink tumors commonly found in patients
      with NF2 or stop them from growing. This will help us to decide if AXITINIB should be used
      to treat NF2 patients in the future. AXITINIB is a drug that has been used to treat various
      forms of cancer. It has not been studied for the treatment of tumors in NF2 patients. We
      have selected AXITINIB for this clinical trial in patients with NF2 and NF2-related tumors
      because a very similar drug, bevacizumab, can shrink VS in some NF2 patients.

      Pfizer, Inc., the manufacturer of the study drug, AXITINIB, will provide the AXITINIB being
      used in this study.

      Primary Objective: To estimate the objective volumetric response rates to axitinib in adult
      NF2 patients with VS.

      Secondary Objectives: To assess the toxicity of axitinib given daily in patients with NF2
      and to examine the association of objective measures of response on MRI, i.e. volumetric
      tumor analysis with clinical measures of response, i.e. (audiogram), as well as quality of
      life assessments (NFTI-QOL). In addition, response in non-VS tumors, such as other
      schwannomas and meningiomas, may be explored.

    <description>Radiographic response: for study purposes, a 20% or greater reduction in tumor volume in any of the target tumors will constitute a partial response (PR). Complete disappearance of any of the target tumors will constitute a complete response (CR).
MRI of the brain and spine (in patients with spinal tumors with medically relevant or symptomatic lesions) with 3D tumor volumetrics will be performed every 3 months.
If an objective response, defined as a 20% reduction in tumor volume compared to baseline is observed in any target tumor or stable disease in all target tumors (i.e. less than 20% increase in size), Axitinib will be continued. Therapy will be discontinued if the primary target tumor enlarges by 20%.</description>

    <measure>Audiologic response</measure>
    <time_frame>Within first 12 months of treatment, or until radiographic progression or unacceptable toxicity</time_frame>

    <description>Audiologic response: improvement in speech discrimination score (SDS), defined as an improvement in the score above the 95% critical difference threshold, compared to baseline audiogram at initiation of treatment. Audiologic worsening: decrease in SDS score below the 95% critical difference threshold, compared to baseline audiogram at initiation of treatment.
Patients with vestibular schwannomas will receive baseline audiograms within 28 days before enrollment and subsequent audiograms at the time of each MRI.
Audiologic responses will be determined, but will not be used as primary response criteria.</description>
