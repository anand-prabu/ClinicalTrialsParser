  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ledipasvir/sofosbuvir
      (LDV/SOF) fixed-dose combination (FDC) in participants with chronic genotype 4 or 5
      hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection as measured by the proportion of subjects with sustained
      virologic response (SVR12), defined as HCV RNA &lt; lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) 12
      weeks after discontinuation of therapy.
