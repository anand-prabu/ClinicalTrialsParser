Clinical analyses have discovered the\n      high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular invasion, distal\n      metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to investigate the\n      VEGF signaling in ECC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating ECC growth.Therefore,we\n      try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in ECC growth,proliferation and apoptosis."
