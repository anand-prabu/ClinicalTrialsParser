    <textblock>
      This phase II pilot trial studies how well ruxolitinib phosphate and danazol work in
      treating anemia in patients with myelofibrosis. Ruxolitinib phosphate and danazol may cause
      the body to make more red blood cells. They are used to treat anemia in patients with
      myelofibrosis

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the efficacy (best overall response) of ruxolitinib (ruxolitinib phosphate)
      and danazol in patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the overall survival of patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia
      initiating ruxolitinib and danazol.

      II. To evaluate the adverse event profile of ruxolitinib and danazol in patients with
      myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate quality of life (QOL) and patient-reported symptoms using the
      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form (MPN-SAF) and European Organization for
      Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30)
      with ruxolitinib and danazol for patients with myelofibrosis suffering from anemia.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) twice daily (BID) and danazol PO thrice
      daily (TID) on days 1-56. Treatment repeats every 56 days for up to 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
