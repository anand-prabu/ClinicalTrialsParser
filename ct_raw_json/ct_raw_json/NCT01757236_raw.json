Men or women \u2265 18 to \u2264 80 years of age, weight \u2265 40 kg, BMI < 35, who have received a\n             diagnosis of chronic PJI (lasting more than 4 weeks but less than 24 months)\n             requiring a one-stage surgical procedure and presenting at least ONE of the following\n             clinical signs and symptoms:\n\n               1. Joint pain\n\n               2. Effusion\n\n               3. Erythema and sensation of heat at the implant site\n\n               4. Limited range of motion in the affected joint\n\n          2. Intraoperative microbiological specimens: during the surgical resection, 5 separate\n             surgical specimens (at least 3) must be sent for culture and susceptibility testing.\n             These specimens must be taken from different locations such as: Hip capsule, femoral\n             membrane, acetabular membrane, synovium, and synovial fluid with separate\n             instruments. A minimum of 2 surgical specimens must be positive. If a preoperative\n             puncture revealed the presence of an acceptable (Gram+) pathogen, it is acceptable if\n             only one pathogen similar to the previously revealed one is identified during the\n             surgical procedure.\n\n          3. Documented presence of Gram-positive bacteria as sole pathogen responsible for the\n             infection.\n\n             Note: This criterion must be verified after obtaining the results of the\n             susceptibility test performed on the specimens taken during the surgical procedure.\n             The verification will occur between Day 2 and Day 7 of the study.\n\n          4. All patients must undergo 1-stage revision surgery.\n\n          5. IRB or IEC approved informed consent form signed and dated.
