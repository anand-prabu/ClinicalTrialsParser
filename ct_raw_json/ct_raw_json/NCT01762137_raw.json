            "textblock": "The primary aim of aneurysm treatment is to achieve occlusion of the intracranial aneurysm\n      (IA) without morbidity or mortality. Using well-established, traditional endovascular\n      techniques, this is generally achievable with a high level of safety and efficacy. These\n      traditional techniques involve either constructive treatment of the aneurysm with coils\n      (with or without an intravascular stent) or deconstruction (coil occlusion) of the aneurysm\n      and the parent artery. While established as safe and efficacious for the majority of\n      aneurysms encountered, the constructive treatment of large and giant aneurysms with coils\n      has typically been associated with relatively lower rates of complete occlusion, often below\n      50%. In addition recurrence after coil embolization of large and giant aneurysms is\n      frequent, with rates estimated as high as 50-80%. Parent artery deconstruction, while\n      immediately efficacious in achieving complete and durable occlusion of the aneurysm, does\n      require occlusion of a major intracranial blood vessel and is also associated with an\n      immediate or delayed risk of stroke due to resultant reduction in blood flow. The\n      endovascular coiling system has physical attributes that are designed specifically to\n      address the challenges associated with both the reconstructive and deconstructive treatment\n      of these large and giant aneurysms.\n\n      Flow diversion represents a new technology that can also be used to constructively treat\n      large and giant aneurysms without embolization coils. Once excluded successfully, the vessel\n      reconstruction and aneurysm occlusion appears durable. The ability to definitively\n      reconstruct cerebral blood vessels is an attractive approach to these large and giant\n      complex aneurysms and it allows the treatment of some aneurysms which were previously not\n      amenable to any other endovascular (and sometimes open surgical techniques). However, for\n      large and giant aneurysms that are amenable to either flow diversion or traditional\n      endovascular treatment, the relative safety and efficacy of the two techniques has not been\n      compared."
