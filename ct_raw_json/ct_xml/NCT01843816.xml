  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tragus-to-wall distance (TWD) measurements is a method to evaluate spinal mobility in
      ankylosing spondylitis (AS) patients and it also takes place in Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis
      Metrology Index (BASMI). Being obese or slim may affect TWD. As well as the person's losing
      or taking weight may lead wrong evaluations, in comparative studies, according to the height
      or weight uneven distribution of groups may affect the results. The aim of this study is to
      investigate whether the body shape affect TWD or not.

      Healthy volunteers between 18-65 ages who have no disorder that may disturb posture or erect
      position (inflammatory diseases, kyphosis, scoliosis, joint deformities)will be included
      into the study. A wall corner will be used as the measurement platform; the evaluated person
      will be positioned as described in BASMI. A rigid ruler will be  placed form anterior
      superior iliac spine (SIAS) to the lateral wall,  parallel to the back wall;  a projection
      point will be determined and its distance from back wall will be measured (SIAS-WD). In the
      same position, projection point of the middle of the humerus head and back wall distance
      (shoulder-WD) and TWD also will be measured. The relationships between these parameters will
      be statistically assessed.
