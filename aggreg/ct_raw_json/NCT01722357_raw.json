The overall goal\n      of the study is to determine the impact of bariatric surgery on physical activity and assess\n      the utility of additional interventions to help postoperative patients adopt a more active\n      lifestyle.  Physiological measures will be assessed to determine whether bariatric surgery\n      and/or improved physical activity levels result in improved physical fitness."

            "textblock": "Bariatric surgery leads to improvement or resolution of a variety of health conditions.  It\n      is also well established that physical activity, with or without weight loss, improves many\n      health-related problems and can have a positive impact on mood.  Therefore, physical\n      activity may amplify the health and psychological benefits often experienced from bariatric\n      surgery.  Prior to surgery many patients are relatively inactive due to physical and social\n      barriers associated with their weight.  In addition, many patients find it difficult to\n      adopt an active lifestyle after surgery, despite an increased capacity to exercise.\n      However, weight loss is associated with physical activity after bariatric surgery.\n      Nonetheless, little is known about the most effective means to promote activity among this\n      group of individuals.  This study will examine changes in physical activity and fitness\n      after bariatric surgery and examine whether the addition of pedometer use and exercise\n      counseling may lead to greater improvements."
