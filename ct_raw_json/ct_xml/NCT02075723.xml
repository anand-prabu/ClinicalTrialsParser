  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if sleep restriction provokes an increase in risk
      factors for metabolic diseases, such as elevation of ectopic fat and decreased sensitivity
      to insulin. We propose to evaluate the effect of sleep restriction in a model of metabolic
      challenge (overfeeding) caricaturing the conditions of modern societies everyday life .

      General hypothesis :

      In overfeeding condition, the stress response generated by partial sleep restriction of six
      days will induce an accumulation of fat in the liver and a decreased insulin sensitivity of
      adipose tissue , liver and muscle,  more pronounced that in overfeeding condition only,
      provoked by a deregulation of the nocturnal lipolysis .

      Specific goals :

      Purpose 1 : To measure the accumulation of fat in the liver (measured by nuclear magnetic
      resonance ) and the tissue insulin sensitivity ( measured by a test meal ) in response to a
      sleep restriction in overfeeding condition .

      Hypothesis 1: In overfeeding condition (130 % of energy requirements ) , hepatic lipid
      accumulation will be higher after 6 days of sleep restriction (4 hours per night) compared
      to a control condition (8 hours of sleep per night ) . Decreased sensitivity to insulin in
      the liver, adipose tissue and the associated muscle will be associated at this ectopic fat
      accumulation.

      Purpose 2 : To determine the alteration of lipolysis in response to sleep restriction in
      overfeeding condition.

      Hypothesis 2: In overfeeding condition, sleep restriction will increase the concentrations
      of circulating fatty acids and glycerol in relation to condition of normal sleep.
