The goal of the\n      study is to evaluate whether or not there is a difference in children treated with and\n      without cast immobilization in regards to time to ambulation; perceived pain; difficulty in\n      dressing & bathing; radiographic displacement or angulation; and time missed from work or\n      daycare. Our null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in clinical or radiographic\n      outcomes between the groups."
