Patients\n      with multiple metastases are typically treated with WBRT. For patients with a few\n      metastases, SRS alone can be used. Vemurafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Combining radiation treatment with\n      vemurafenib for melanoma patients with brain metastases may result in improved local control\n      and prolonged survival."

To determine local control rates of the brain metastases in each arm. II. To determine\n      the rates of developing of new brain metastases in each arm. III. To determine the response\n      of extracranial disease. IV. To determine the overall survival rate and progression free\n      survival rate. V. To determine the safety and tolerability of each arm.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of vemurafenib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2\n      arms based on the number and size of brain metastasis.\n\n      All patients receive vemurafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) beginning 3-5 days before the\n      start of radiation therapy and continuing in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      ARM A: Patients undergo WBRT once daily (QD) for 10 doses.\n\n      ARM B: Patients undergo SRS (gamma knife, tomotherapy, cyberknife, or megavoltage linear\n      accelerator [LINAC] radiation therapy) on day 1.\n\n      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up on weeks 5 or 7, 9 and 13, and\n      then on months 4, 6, 9, and 12."
