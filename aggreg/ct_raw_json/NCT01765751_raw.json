One challenging\n      issue in the study of manual therapies, including spinal manipulation (SM), is the\n      development of sham and/or minimal intervention procedures suitable for use with control\n      groups in clinical trials. With SM, active treatment requires substantial physical contact\n      between a study clinician and the study participant, either directly or through a mechanical\n      intermediary. Consequently, it is difficult to introduce differences in manual therapy\n      procedures that distinguish sham and/or minimal interventions from the active treatment, but\n      are not immediately obvious to the study participant. Another challenging issue is training\n      clinicians to deliver a standardized SM treatment within specified force ranges. The muscles\n      surrounding the neck could alter the forces transmitted to the cervical spine, and could\n      alter the treatment effectiveness. The purpose of this pilot randomized controlled trial is\n      to examine the patient\u2010centered clinical, biomechanical, and believability outcome\n      characteristics of a manually\u2010localized cervical distraction procedure for the treatment of\n      neck or neck-related arm pain or disability. We also will evaluate the ability of the doctor\n      of chiropractic to deliver the MCD treatment within specified force ranges. An exploratory\n      aim of this study is to evaluate EMG measurement during MCD delivery."

MCD procedure is performed with participant lying prone on a load instrumented table with moveable headpiece allowing guided head movement while recumbent. Clinician gently grasps posterior aspect of participant's neck with a broad contact (contact hand) between thumb and index finger at specific vertebral level. With opposite hand, clinician grasps control handle. Using contact hand, clinician exhibits superior traction to maintain a contact at a single vertebral level and ensuring a gentle movement via contact with control handle. Goal is to create a slow rhythmic (1-3 sec) localized distractive movement. In this trial, only axial distraction (Cox protocol 1) will be used.",
