Peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation from a brother or sister may be effective treatment for\n      hematologic cancer. Sometimes the transplanted cells can be rejected by the body's tissue.\n      Mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus, and donor white blood cells may prevent this from\n      happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus,\n      daclizumab, and donor peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      hematologic cancer."

Determine whether donor hematopoiesis can be safely established using a\n      nonmyeloablative conditioning regimen followed by HLA matched sibling donor peripheral blood\n      stem cell transplantation in patients with hematologic malignancies. II. Determine whether\n      mixed chimerism can be safely converted to full donor hematopoiesis with this treatment\n      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity and incidence of aplasia and graft\n      versus host disease in these patients treated with this regimen. IV. Determine the antitumor\n      potential of this treatment regimen in these patients. V. Determine the role of NFkB in the\n      modulation of the cytokine secretion profile of T lymphocytes during an alloimmune response\n      in these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive immunosuppressive medications consisting of oral mycophenolate\n      mofetil and tacrolimus twice a day beginning on day -8 and continuing through day 45 (in the\n      absence of graft versus host disease). Patients also receive daclizumab IV over 30 minutes\n      on days -1, 3, and 8. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC)\n      transplantation with donor CD34+ cells IV on day 0. If there is 0-80% donor hematopoiesis,\n      patients receive donor lymphocyte infusions with CD3+ cells IV on days 75, 165, and 270.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-45 patients will be accrued for this study."
