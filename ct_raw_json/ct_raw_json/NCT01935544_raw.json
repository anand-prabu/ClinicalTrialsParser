Palpatory\n      technique is barely effective and induces a high risk of error. Localization by electro\n      stimulation is frequently used in adults, but often requires multiple painful repositioning\n      of the needle. Ultrasound tracking is sometimes used in children but not much in adults.\n\n      The advantages of ultrasound-guided botulinum toxin injections are a painless localization\n      and greater injection accuracy. Safety is therefore enhanced since intravascular injection\n      is easily avoided.\n\n      The few existing publications on the subject are essentially case reports. Few studies have\n      focused on comparing different injection techniques and so far, no well-conducted study has\n      highlighted superior efficiency of ultrasound-guided injections."

Randomization will determine which technique will be used in the first and the\n      second place.\n\n      Patients will be selected from the cohort of patients supported by consultation of Physical\n      Medicine and Rehabilitation Department of the University Hospital of Clermont-Ferrand.\n      Injections of botulinum toxin and assessments will take place in the same department.\n\n      The study period is five months for each patient. This study does not present a major risk\n      for the subjects. The main inconvenience is injection pain or side effects of botulinum\n      toxin (increase of motor deficits or dysphagia)."
