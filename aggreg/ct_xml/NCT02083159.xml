  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is characterized by an accumulation of fat in the
      liver,  which  is  one  of  the  most  common  forms  of  chronic  liver  disease  in
      developed countries. In  western  countries,  the  prevalence  of  NAFLD  in  the  general
      population  is estimated to be 20-30%; in obese populations, this increases to 57.5-74%.
      But, it hasn`t been clearly elucidated yet regarding the underlying disease pathophysiology
      and treatmet strategy.

      Recently, members of the C1q/tumor necrosis factor-related protein (CTRP) family have been
      reported to share structural homology with adiponectin. To date, 15 CTRP family members have
      been found that might play major roles in glucose metabolism and inflammation.

      The investigators tried to clarify the relationship between CTRP family and NAFLD in Korean
      men and women.
