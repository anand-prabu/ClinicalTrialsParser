Treatment continues in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 18 months."
