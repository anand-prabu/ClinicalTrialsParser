II. Assess the potential utility of\n      FMAU-PET in the imaging evaluation of chemotherapeutic response in 15 patients with breast\n      cancer.    OUTLINE:   Patients receive fluorine F18-clevudine intravenously (IV) over 1\n      minute and then undergo PET/CT scan at baseline. Patients with human epidermal growth factor\n      receptor 2 positive (HER2+) breast cancer also undergo fluorine F 18-clevudine PET/CT scan\n      2-3 weeks after the first course of treatment and after completion of treatment.     After\n      completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours."
