Determine by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging measurements the change\n      in the total volume of brain parenchyma as well as its gray and white matter, T2 and\n      enhanced T1 lesion volume, and the magnetization transfer ratio histogram parameters, and\n      correlate these measurements with clinical measures of disability in patients with multiple\n      sclerosis.\n\n      II.  Measure the quantity of whole brain N-acetylaspartate in patients with multiple\n      sclerosis and compare these values to those from age matched controls.\n\n      III.  Determine the correlation between specific neuropsychological tests which assess\n      global cognitive functioning and the quantitative measurements taken in these patients in\n      this study."
