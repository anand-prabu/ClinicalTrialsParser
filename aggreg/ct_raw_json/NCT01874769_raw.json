However, current medical treatments still cannot prevent the recurrence\n      of the lesions arising from defective expression of type VII collagen (COL7A1), the main\n      constituent of anchoring fibrils which form essential structures for dermal-epidermal\n      adherence.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the capacity of keratinocytes and fibroblasts to\n      repair skin wounds in patients suffering from Recessive Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa\n      (RDEB)."
