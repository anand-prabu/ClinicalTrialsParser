These tests are necessary to keep\n      mothers healthy during pregnancy and lead to healthy babies. This research is taking place\n      in 40 churches in Nigeria."

Four dioceses with forty\n      churches nested in the dioceses, will be randomly assigned to either the IG (N=2; n=20) or\n      the CG (N=2; n=20). The HBI combines a family educational game show and an integrated\n      on-site laboratory testing in the context of a baby shower. Monthly prayer sessions for\n      pregnant women will be used for recruitment and a baby reception following infant baptisms\n      will be used for follow up after delivery. The primary outcome is difference in testing rate\n      among pregnant women in IG compared to CG. The secondary outcomes are HIV testing rate among\n      male partners and PMTCT completion among HIV-infected pregnant women. Pregnant women will\n      complete an investigator-administered questionnaire at the baby reception to collect\n      information on HIV testing and PMTCT completion. Data will be confirmed with Health\n      Facilities and on-site testing data. This proposal is a collaboration among Partners for\n      Prevention, education, Training, Treatment and Research (PeTR-Global Solutions)/AIDSRelief\n      (our PEPFAR-funded partner in Nigeria responsible for training, HIV testing, linkage to\n      treatment and local oversight of the project); New York University School of Medicine\n      (program evaluation and shares oversight with PI), Board of Regents, NSHE, obo University of\n      Nevada, Reno (provide overall oversight, data management and evaluation of program\n      effectiveness)."
