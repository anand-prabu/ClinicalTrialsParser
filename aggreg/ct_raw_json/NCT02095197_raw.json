            "textblock": "Cervical radicular pain is a common, disabling problem, occurs in 83:100,000 individuals per\n      year. Symptoms are most often caused by intervertebral disc herniation (21.9%) or central or\n      foraminal stenosis from spondylosis (68.4%). Patients complain of pain in the head, neck,\n      scapula or arm. The diagnosis of radicular pain is made clinically by history and physical\n      examination, supported by imaging studies and electrodiagnostic tests. No study has compared\n      the differences in pain, medication utilization, functional outcomes, or patient\n      satisfaction between interlaminar and targeted epidural injections in the cervical spine. In\n      theory, the technique of targeted epidural steroid delivery with a catheter has a lower risk\n      of accidental vascular trespass or disc penetration during the procedure, and far less risk\n      of dural penetration or spinal cord injury at rostral levels of the cervical spinal cord as\n      compared with the interlaminar technique. The investigators hypothesize that this technique\n      results in superior pain control, decreased medication use, improved function and fewer\n      repeat injections. This data could improve patient safety and affect the evolving treatment\n      guidelines for cervical epidural injections."
