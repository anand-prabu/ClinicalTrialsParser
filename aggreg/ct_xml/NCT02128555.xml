  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of TARVA is to determine whether Total Ankle Replacement (TAR) provides better
      clinical outcomes than ankle arthrodesis in patients aged 50-85 years with end-stage ankle
      osteoarthritis, and compare cost-effectiveness of the two treatments

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, multi-centre, non-blinded, prospective, parallel-group trial of TAR
      versus ankle arthrodesis in patients with end-stage ankle osteoarthritis (OA) aged between
      50 and 85 years, comparing clinical outcomes (pain-free function, quality of life (QoL),
      range of motion (ROM), and rate of post-procedural complications) and cost-effectiveness.
      TARVA is a clinician-led, pragmatic, superiority trial designed to compare the improvement
      in pain-free function, as assessed by the Manchester-Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ)
      walking/standing domain score from pre-op to 52 weeks post-op for each surgical treatment
      group. A total of 328 patients will be randomly allocated on an equal basis to one of two
      surgical treatments: i) Total Ankle Replacement; and ii) Ankle Arthrodesis.  Randomisation
      will be stratified by surgeon and presence of OA in two adjacent joints as determined by a
      pre-operative MRI scan.
