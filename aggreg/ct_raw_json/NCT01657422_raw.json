PACE+ will evaluate the efficacy of an integrated clinical and\n      home-based intervention to improve physical activity and nutrition behaviors in adolescents\n      ages 11-15 over a period of 2 years.\n\n      This study is unique in that it will be one of the first to evaluate a combined physical\n      activity and nutrition intervention for youth that revolves around the primary health care\n      setting.  The PACE+ intervention is particularly innovative in that three components -\n      computer, provider counseling, and an extended home-based intervention - are unified through\n      a common theoretical framework."

            "textblock": "Improved physical activity (PA) and nutrition behaviors in adolescents show great promise to\n      reduce risk of cancers and other diseases. Fewer than 20% of adolescents meet\n      recommendations for fat or fruits & vegetables consumption, and only 50% of adolescent girls\n      and 67% of boys meet recommendations for vigorous PA. PACE+ will evaluate an integrated\n      clinical and home-based intervention to improve physical activity (PA) and nutrition\n      behaviors in adolescents. The intervention has three integrated components: a computer\n      assessment and action planner; provider counseling; and 24 months of extended phone & mail\n      contact. 768 male and female adolescents age 11 through 15; will be recruited from six\n      healthcare settings. Subjects will be randomly assigned within practices to two successive\n      one-year \"doses\" of PACE+ or a comparison condition involving counseling for sun protection\n      behaviors. PACE+ assesses four behaviors: 1) dietary fat, 2) fruits & vegetable consumption,\n      3) physical activity, and 4) sedentary behavior. Primary behavioral outcomes, secondary\n      outcomes, and selected mediators and process variables will be measured prior to the first\n      office visit and at 6, 12 and 24 months. Primary outcomes will be measured by the 7-day\n      physical activity recall and 3-day food record of fruits & vegetables and fat at 12 months.\n      Secondary outcomes include adiposity, fitness, BMI, psychosocial mediators of change, and\n      body image. Potential risks are psychological and physical, however the risks are slight and\n      of low likelihood. Benefits include helping bring about healthier lifestyles to prevent\n      weight gain and reduce premature morbidity and mortality due to cancer, cardiovascular\n      disease and other health problems. This study will be the first to evaluate a combined\n      physical activity and nutrition intervention for youth that revolves around the primary\n      health care setting."
