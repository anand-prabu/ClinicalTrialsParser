Phase I study will be conducted to define a recommended phase II dose (RPTD)\n      and phase II study will examine the hypothesis that combinational approach will increase\n      response rate of resistant CML/ALL patients, thus evaluating efficacy of the combination\n      regimen."

Three patients will be enrolled per dose level. Accordingly 9\n      patients are expected to be enrolled. If a DLT is observed, 3 more patients will be enrolled\n      at the dose level in which the DLT occurred.\n\n      The study will be conducted at multiple sites across Canada and enrollment will be\n      competitive. Once 3 patients are enrolled in a cohort, that dose level will be closed to\n      enrollment until safety assessment of the 3 subjects is performed at the end of cycle 1.\n      This procedure will be performed for each dosing cohort. Patients will be assigned to a dose\n      level based on authorization from the sponsor in collaboration with Ozmosis Research Inc.\n\n      For the phase II part of the study, once the RPTD has been established in the phase I\n      portion of this trial, the phase II will begin. The phase II portion will be a two-stage,\n      single arm, unblinded study investigating the potential efficacy of the combination of\n      Ruxolitinib and Nilotinib.\n\n      A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued in the phase II portion. Those patients treated in\n      the phase I portion of this trial at the RPTD will be included in the analysis of the Phase\n      II study."
