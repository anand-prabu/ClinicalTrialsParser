Compare the event free survival of children with advanced stage large cell\n      lymphoma treated with modified APO (doxorubicin/prednisone/vincristine/mercaptopurine) with\n      or without intermediate-dose methotrexate/high dose cytarabine as maintenance therapy\n      following induction therapy with APO. II. Characterize further the immunophenotypic and\n      morphologic correlates of pediatric large cell lymphoma.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms, except for those with CNS disease. These patients are assigned to arm II and\n      receive whole brain irradiation on Regimen B. Arm I: Induction (Modified APO): Patients\n      receive vincristine IV on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29, doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on days\n      1 and 22, prednisone three times a day on days 1-28, and methotrexate intrathecally (IT) on\n      days 1, 8, and 22. Patients in complete remission on day 43 proceed to maintenance, those in\n      partial remission undergo biopsy then proceed to maintenance, and those with residual\n      disease receive radiotherapy on regimen A concurrently with maintenance. Maintenance (day 1\n      is day 43 of Induction): Courses of intermediate dose methotrexate/leucovorin calcium and\n      high dose cytarabine (ID MTX/CF/HD ARA-C) and modified APO alternate every 3 weeks. Patients\n      receive a total of 15 courses (8 of ID MTX/CF/HD ARA-C and 7 of Modified APO). ID MTX/CF/HD\n      ARA-C: Patients receive methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1, leucovorin calcium IV or\n      orally every 6 hours on days 2 and 3, cytarabine IV over 48 hours on days 2 to 4, and\n      methotrexate IT on day 1 of courses 1, 3, and 5. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered\n      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover. Modified APO: Patients receive\n      vincristine IV on day 1, oral mercaptopurine on days 1-5, doxorubicin IV over 15 minutes on\n      day 1, and oral prednisone three times a day on days 1-5. Arm II: Induction: Patients\n      receive treatment as in arm I except that patients with CNS disease also receive\n      methotrexate IT on days 15, 29, and 36. Maintenance (day 1 is day 43 of Induction): Modified\n      APO: as in Arm I, with methotrexate administered on day 1 of courses 1, 3, and 5 (days 1-5\n      for patients with CNS disease). Courses repeat every 21 days for a total of 15 courses.\n      Patients with CNS disease begin radiotherapy on Regimen B on week 2 of maintenance. Regimen\n      A: Patients begin radiotherapy (5 days a week for 4.5 weeks) to residual tumor on day 1 of\n      maintenance. Regimen B: Patients receive whole brain irradiation (5 days a week for 3.1\n      weeks) beginning on day 1 of maintenance. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every\n      3 months for 18 months, every 6 months for 3 years, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 242 patients will be accrued for this study over approximately\n      5.4 years."
