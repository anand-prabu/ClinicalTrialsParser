  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a schizophrenia spectrum diagnosis often experience distressing worries or
      beliefs about other people intending to cause them harm (also known as paranoia). Paranoid
      beliefs are associated with significant distress and disruption to the person's life. This
      results in high use of services and costs to mental health providers.

      The National Institute of Clinical Excellence recommends that cognitive behavioural therapy
      for psychosis (CBTp) is offered to everybody with a schizophrenia spectrum psychosis. The
      latest meta analyses report improved outcomes, and reduced inpatient stays following CBTp,
      making it a cost effective intervention.

      Although improved outcomes have been obtained by therapies, CBTp has only small to moderate
      effects on paranoid beliefs. Further, training therapists to competently deliver CBTp is
      intensive, expensive and takes up to a year. CBTp is therefore not widely available to
      service users, resulting in inequalities in access to care.

      The investigators are seeking to improve outcomes and accessibility of CBTp for people with
      distressing, paranoid beliefs. The proposed research programme aims to conduct a feasibility
      study of two brief therapeutic interventions, aimed at targeting and improving two key
      processes which are causally implicated in paranoia: a) reasoning styles and b) anxiety
      processes.

      The investigators have preliminary evidence indicating that these pilot interventions, with
      interactive multimedia content, reduced distressing beliefs and improved coping.
      Participants also reported they found the interventions acceptable, enjoyable and useful to
      participants. Based on these results, the investigators have further modified the
      interventions, and want to determine their feasibility and efficacy in a larger sample with
      a control group.
