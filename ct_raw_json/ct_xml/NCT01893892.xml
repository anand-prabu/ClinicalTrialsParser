    <textblock>
      This randomized clinical trial studies levocarnitine in treating patients with
      vismodegib-associated muscle spasms. Levocarnitine may decrease muscle spasms caused by
      vismodegib.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine mean number of muscle spasms per week after levocarnitine arm compared to
      placebo arm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess intensity of muscle spasms per week after levocarnitine arm compared to placebo
      arm.

      II. To assess responses related to activities of daily living or psychosocial function after
      4 weeks of placebo or 4 weeks of levocarnitine.

      III. To assess the frequency of all adverse effects on levocarnitine versus placebo.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients receive levocarnitine orally (PO) every 6 hours twice daily (BID) during
      weeks 1-4. Patients then cross-over to Arm II for weeks 8-12.

      ARM II: Patients receive placebo PO every 6 hours BID during weeks 1-4. Patients then
      cross-over to Arm I for weeks 8-12.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4 weeks.

    <description>Each item will be analyzed separately from each other. Subjective responses to questionnaire items such as location on the body of muscle spasms or character of the muscle spasms will be reported in descriptive terms in the final report. Effect of muscle spasms on activities of daily living and psychosocial impact will be recorded and checked by the subject will be compared between the levocarnitine and placebo arms by Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistic to adjust for covariate effects of age, gender, and duration on vismodegib.</description>
