  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive impairment is a widely reported side effect of many commonly used drugs. Even a
      mild, untoward effect on an essential function such a linguistic behavior, a directly
      observable product of complex cognitive processes, is disruptive to daily life.
      Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying a drug's impact on cognition are poorly understood.
      This lack of understanding impedes the ability to predict both the effects of drugs in
      development and the degree to which an individual is vulnerable to the cognitive impact of a
      particular agent. Topiramate (TPM, an antiepileptic drug) is, with increasing frequency,
      being prescribed for a range of conditions including migraine prophylaxis, obesity and pain.
      It is a prime example of a drug that causes speech and language problems severe enough in
      some patients to result in discontinuation of therapy. For reasons not well understood, TPM
      has a poorer cognitive profile than many of the older antiepileptic drugs. The
      investigators' rational for this study is that it will offer insight into the mechanisms
      underlying drug-induced cognitive deficits.

    <textblock>
      The investigators' long-term goal is to enhance clinical strategies and inform drug
      development in order to maximize the benefits of individual drug therapy while minimizing
      adverse cognitive/language-related side effects. The investigators' objective in this
      application is to elucidate the relationship among drug exposure as measured by plasma drug
      levels, its neurophysiological effects, and consequent effects on the cognitive processes
      observable in everyday language use. Using topiramate (TPM) as a prototype, the
      investigators will apply the tools of clinical pharmacology, computational linguistics,
      neuroscience, and engineering to the design and execution of randomized, double blind,
      crossover studies using three (3) doses of  TPM, one (1) dose of a comparator drug
      (lorazepam-LZP) and a placebo. In order to isolate the cognitive effects of TPM from those
      possibly arising from an underlying medical condition, subjects will be healthy adults. The
      investigators will capitalize on an innovative system for automated language and speech
      analysis (SALSA) developed in our laboratory, to quantify the effects of TPM administration
      on effective language use, a crucial component of normal day-to-day functioning.
