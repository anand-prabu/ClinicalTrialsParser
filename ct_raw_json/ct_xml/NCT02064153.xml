  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis (HD) is widely used treatment for ESRD patients. The chief aims of HD are
      solute and fluid removal. Decades of practice have improved HD care, but more can be done to
      improve morbidity and mortality. Enhancing toxin removal is an important consideration for
      improved patient outcomes. Also, decreasing the incidence of intra-dialytic hypotensive
      (IDH) episodes (dominant in Singapore patient cohort) can significantly reduce associated
      morbidities and mortality. A simple maneuver for clinicians is the dialysate temperature.
      Literature suggests that a lower dialysate temperature (35ºC) results in reduced hypotensive
      episodes by vasoconstriction. Conversely, higher dialysate temperature resulting in higher
      blood temperature decreases the peripheral resistance, leading to increased toxin removal,
      but may cause IDH episodes partly due to vasodilation. Optimal manipulation of the dialysate
      temperature is therefore primary handles to obtain the improved patient outcomes. In this
      study, first the effect of dialysate temperature (cool vs warm dialysate) on toxin removal
      will be studied. In both the interventions, outcome measure will be patient hemodynamic
      response and amount of toxins removed. The spent dialysate will be collected to study the
      quantum of toxin removed.
