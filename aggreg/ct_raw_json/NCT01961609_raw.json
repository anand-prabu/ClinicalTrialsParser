None of these specifically studies patients who have failed to\n      respond to anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy as defined by NICE guidelines.\n\n      Therefore, this study utilises a pragmatic, open-label, non-comparator design, which has\n      been shown to be appropriate in similar studies looking at anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy in patients\n      failing on other therapies (Papp et al. 2012; Strober et al. 2011), to answer the question\n      of whether secukinumab is an appropriate choice in patients who have failed to respond to\n      anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy (TNF-IR) per NICE definitions, whether a single anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy failure\n      or multiple anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy failures."

Forms of psoriasis other than chronic plaque-type (e.g., pustular, erythrodermic and\n             guttate psoriasis)\n\n          2. Drug-induced psoriasis (i.e., new onset or current exacerbation from beta-blockers,\n             calcium channel inhibitors or lithium)\n\n          3. Ongoing use of prohibited psoriasis treatments (e.g., topical or systemic\n             corticosteroids (CS), UV therapy). Washout periods detailed in the protocol must be\n             adhered to.\n\n          4. Ongoing use of other non-psoriasis prohibited treatments. Washout periods detailed in\n             the protocol have to be adhered to. All other prior non-psoriasis concomitant\n             treatments must be on a stable dose for at least four weeks before initiation of\n             study drug.\n\n          5. Previous exposure to secukinumab or any other biologic drug directly targeting IL-17\n             or the IL-17 receptor\n\n          6. Previous exposure to ustekinumab or any other biologic drug for the treatment of\n             psoriasis that is not anti-TNF\u03b1 therapy\n\n          7. Pregnant or nursing (lactating) women, where pregnancy is defined as the state of a\n             female after conception and until the termination of gestation, confirmed by a\n             positive hCG laboratory test (> 5 mIU/mL)\n\n          8. Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of\n             becoming pregnant unless they use 2 (two) effective forms of contraception during the\n             study and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment.\n\n          9. Men with a female partner of child bearing potential defined as all women\n             physiologically capable of becoming pregnant unless they use 1 (one) effective form\n             of contraception during the study and for 16 weeks after stopping treatment.\n\n         10. Active systemic infections during the last two weeks (exception: common cold) prior\n             to initiation of study drug and any infections that reoccur on a regular basis;\n             investigator discretion should be used regarding patients who have travelled or\n             recently resided in areas of endemic mycoses, such as histoplasmosis,\n             coccidioidomycosis or blastomycosis and for patients with underlying conditions that\n             may predispose them to infection, such as advanced or poorly controlled diabetes\n\n         11. History of an ongoing, chronic or recurrent infectious disease, or evidence of\n             tuberculosis infection as defined by a positive QuantiFERON TB-Gold test (QFT) at\n             screening. Patients with a positive QFT test may participate in the study if further\n             work up establishes conclusively that the patient has no evidence of active\n             tuberculosis. If presence of latent tuberculosis is established, then treatment must\n             have been initiated and maintained according to UK guidelines.\n\n         12.
