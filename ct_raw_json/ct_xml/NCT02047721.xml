    <textblock>
      In this study The Investigators are examining the effects of a 12-week exercise intervention
      on measures of appetite and food intake regulation in overweight to mildly obese healthy
      adults. The Investigators hypothesize that individuals who lose a significant amount of
      weight in response to the intervention will show a reduction in the brain response to food
      cues as measured by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as compared to those who do
      not lose food. These changes in neuronal activity will be associated to physiologic and
      behavioral measures.

    <description>The neuronal response will be assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in response to visual food cues
Blood oxygen dependent signal (BOLD) response in exposure to visual food cues will be measured during a fMRI scan and the difference between responses in those who lose weight vs. those who do not lose weight will be compared.</description>
