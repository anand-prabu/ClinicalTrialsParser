            "textblock": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric condition, mostly treated with\n      antidepressant drugs, which are limited for issues such as refractoriness and adverse\n      effects. In this context, the researchers investigate a non-pharmacological treatment known\n      as transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). In a prior clinical trial with 120\n      patients with MDD, the investigators demonstrated that the combination of tDCS with\n      sertraline 50mg/day had increased, faster effects on depressive symptoms (Brunoni et al.,\n      JAMA Psychiatry, 2013). However, although the investigators suggested that tDCS vs.\n      sertraline had similar efficacy, such comparison was compromised due to the low sertraline\n      dose and also because the comparison of sertraline vs. placebo was not significant. To prove\n      that tDCS is similarly effective than antidepressants would have a tremendous impact in\n      clinical psychiatry, since tDCS is virtually absent of adverse effects. Its ease of use,\n      portability and low price are also interesting characteristics for using in primary and\n      secondary health care. Thus, our aim is to compare tDCS against a fully dosed, effective\n      antidepressant. The study will be a non-inferiority, randomized, double-blinded,\n      placebo-controlled, three-arm trial comparing active tDCS/placebo pill, sham\n      tDCS/escitalopram 20mg/day and sham tDCS/placebo pill for ten weeks, randomizing 240\n      patients with MDD in a 3:3:2 ratio (less to placebo). Our primary aim is to show that tDCS\n      is not inferior to escitalopram 20mg/day with a noninferiority margin of at least 50% of the\n      escitalopram-placebo effect. As secondary aims, the researchers will investigate putative\n      biomarkers for tDCS response. This is important considering the large sample size of this\n      study and also the paucity of tDCS studies - therefore, the identification of such\n      biomarkers could generate new hypothesis for future studies and for tDCS' mechanisms of\n      action. The biomarkers will be: genetic polymorphisms (BDNF, SLC6A4, THP1, 5HT2A); serum\n      markers (BDNF); motor cortical excitability (cortical silent period, intracortical\n      inhibition, intracortical facilitation); heart rate variability; and neuroimaging\n      (structural volume of the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex, white\n      matter tracts of the prefrontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex connectivity). This\n      project represents a novel research line in our Institution, and the investigators thereby\n      propose the onset of a new center denominated C.I.N.A. (Interdisciplinary Center for Applied\n      Neuromodulation) that will foment the use and development of projects using neuromodulation\n      techniques. This new center will also interact with other centers on the fields of clinical\n      research, neurosciences and neuropsychiatry."
