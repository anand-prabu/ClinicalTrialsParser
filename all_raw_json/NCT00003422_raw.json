Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy before surgery is more effective\n      than giving chemotherapy plus radiation therapy after surgery in treating patients with\n      rectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying radiation therapy given before surgery\n      to see how well it works compared to chemotherapy and radiation therapy given after surgery\n      in treating patients with rectal cancer that can be surgically removed."

Patients are stratified by a number of\n      factors including surgeon.\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive preoperative radiotherapy (arm I) or postoperative\n      chemoradiotherapy (arm II).\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive radiotherapy in 5 fractions over 1 week prior to surgery.\n           Patients undergo surgery within 7 days of the last fraction of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive chemoradiotherapy 4-12 weeks after surgery (if circumferential\n           resection margins are histologically involved by tumor). Radiotherapy is administered\n           in 25 fractions over 5 weeks (5 days per week). During radiotherapy, patients either\n           receive fluorouracil (5-FU) continuous infusion, 5-FU bolus IV and leucovorin calcium\n           IV weekly, or a 5-day bolus schedule of 5-FU and leucovorin calcium.\n\n      Patients may then receive adjuvant chemotherapy as per local policy.\n\n      Quality of life assessments are made every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for\n      the next 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 1800 patients will be accrued into this study."
