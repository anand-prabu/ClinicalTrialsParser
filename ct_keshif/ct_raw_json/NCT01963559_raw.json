Our team is behind the discovery of the Pressure-Induced\n      Vasodilation (PIV) first observed in healthy subjects after local application of a gradual\n      pressure on the skin leading to cutaneous vasodilation at the application of pressure. This\n      gain in blood flow delays the onset of ischemia. However the involvement of PIV in the DF,\n      which is also a pressure-induced skin lesion, remains to be demonstrated in diabetic\n      subjects. The main objective of this study is to show that PIV, a functional examination of\n      the cutaneous microcirculation we developed, is altered in the presence of DF, taking into\n      account the influence of age and neuropathy."
