      The current study will evaluate the safety and performance of the BlueWind Medical Reprieve
      System for the treatment of  Chronic Painful Peripheral Neuropathy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The BlueWind Reprieve system is a neurostimulator consisting of an Implant and external
      components.

      The system is intended for home care use. The chronic pain treatment is achieved by an
      electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve fibers. The stimulation is set so that it
      generates paresthesia in the stimulated area (e.g. foot), reducing the pain sensation and
      improving the quality of life for the patient.

          3. Patient agrees to attend all follow-up evaluations and is willing to completely and
             accurately fill out pain questionnaires.

          4. Diagnosis of chronic neuropathic pain due to peripheral neuropathy.

          5. Documented pain attributed to neuropathy for at least 6 months.

          6. Pain intensity with an average daily VAS score of at least 6, demonstrated by 2-3
             ratings per day across 7 days.

          7. Patient refractory to conservative treatments including pain medication, for at least
             6 months.

          8. Stable pain medication for at least 4 weeks prior to study enrollment.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous participation in another study with any investigational drug or device
             within the past 90 days.

          2. Any active implant (cardiac or other).

          3. Any metal implant in the area of BlueWind device implantation site.

          4. Current pregnancy or attempting to get pregnant (female patient).

          5. Any clinically significant neurologic disorders (except PNP).

          6. Any clinically significant or unstable medical or psychiatric condition that would
             affect the patient's ability to participate in the study.

          7. Patients with severe or unstable cardiovascular, pulmonary, gastrointestinal,
             hematological, hepatic, renal or endocrine diseases.

          8. Severe peripheral vascular disease that may cause intermittent claudication or
             ischemic ulcers.
