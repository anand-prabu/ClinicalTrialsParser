  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that primary prevention patients with one or
      more additional risk factors (1.5 prevention criteria: syncope/pre-syncope, non-sustained
      ventricular tachycardia (NSVT), frequent pre-ventricular contractions (PVCs), and low left
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF)) are at a similar risk of life-threatening ventricular
      arrhythmias (LTVA) when compared to secondary prevention patients, and would receive similar
      benefit from an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), or cardiac resynchronization
      therapy- defibrillator (CRT-D) implant.

      Devices allowed in the study include any Medtronic single, dual, or triple chamber
      defibrillator that has received appropriate license or regulatory approval and is
      commercially available by Medtronic in the geography in which the implant will take place.
      Any market-released, commercially available lead(s) can be used in the study.
