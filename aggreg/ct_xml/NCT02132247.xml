          -  Injury must be considered by the Investigator to be clinically significant

          -  Negative urine pregnancy test at screening for female subjects of childbearing
             potential (12-16 years)

          -  Able to read and speak English

             ligament/muscle/ tendon, or common nerve injury)

          -  Open skin lesion or any dermatological condition (e.g. skin infection, eczema) within
             the injured area

          -  Coagulation defects

          -  Prior use of over-the-counter (OTC) analgesics or short-acting non-steroidal
             anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs [ibuprofen, ketoprofen]) within 6 hours of study
             entry (acetaminophen permitted up until the time of study entry)

          -  Prior use of narcotic analgesics within 7 days of study entry

             autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, Heller's syndrome, severe attention deficit
             hyperactivity disorders (ADHD), other severe mental retardation of traumatic,
             congenital or other origin)
