All patients undergoing a\n      procedure requiring an arteriotomy in the range of 18 to 24 F, via the common femoral artery\n      will be screened against the inclusion/exclusion criteria. If the patient meets the\n      requirements of the clinical investigation, they shall be invited to participate, provide\n      informed consent and shall subsequently be assigned a subject number.\n\n      Patient safety will be monitored closely by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee (DSMC).\n      Safety data will be reported to the DSMC for every patient with a reported complication. The\n      DSMC will adjudicate on the safety data to determine whether it is safe to continue\n      enrolment.\n\n      Subjects shall have a 1, 3 and 12 month follow-up assessment. Safety data from the\n      follow-ups will be assessed by the Data Safety Monitoring Committee.\n\n      This protocol will adopt the VARC-2 definitions for major vascular complication associated\n      with closure of the access site.\n\n      This pilot study will enrol approximately 10 subjects. The study is designed to support a\n      larger CE Mark study. As such, a study safety assessment will be complete when all patients\n      have completed their 1 month follow-up assessment. The Data Safety Monitoring Committee\n      (DSMC) will review all complications and recommend whether it is safe to proceed to the CE\n      Mark study. All patients will continue to be followed at 1, 3 and 12 month follow-ups."
