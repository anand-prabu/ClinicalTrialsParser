Patients who have bariatric surgery have\n      improvements in their eating patterns, including binge eating. However there is variability\n      in the degree of weight loss and post-operative complications following bariatric surgery,\n      associated with disordered eating.\n\n      Guided self help for BED (GSH) is a treatment which, like bariatric surgery, is effective in\n      reducing the number of binge episodes in people who binge eat. It is not known whether GSH\n      prior to surgery, in patients undergoing bariatric surgery has any additional benefit for\n      reducing bingeing, or improving weight loss in these patients."
