The outcome of the procedure is commonly satisfactory\n      and most patients will not need any revision surgery. However, the procedure has its\n      complications, including (1) periprosthetic infection, (2) mechanical loosening caused by\n      wear particles and (3) allergic reaction caused by metal ions released from metal-on-metal\n      bearing surfaces. The unsolved clinical problem is related to the differential diagnosis of\n      these conditions. The purpose of this prospective clinical study is to compare the efficacy\n      of two techniques of PET/CT imaging in the differential diagnosis of these complications.\n      The PET imaging, performed during a single day, will include the head-to-head comparison of\n      18FDG PET/CT and 68Ga-citrate PET/CT imaging."
