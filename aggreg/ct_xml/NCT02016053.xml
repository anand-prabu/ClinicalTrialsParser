  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      500 patients with normal renal function will be prospectively studied and incidence,
      spectrum and natural history of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) will be observed in them and in
      200 patients with abnormal renal function fulfilling AKI (Acute Kidney Injury) criteria will
      be prospectively studied for 1 year. Also biomarkers will be studied and validated as early
      predictors of AKI (Acute Kidney Injury).
