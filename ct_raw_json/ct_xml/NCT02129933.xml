  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve detection of esophageal (pre)malignant lesions during surveillance endoscopy of
      patients at risk of developing malignancies, for example in Barrett's Esophagus (BE), there
      is a need for better endoscopic visualization and the ability for targeted biopsies. Optical
      molecular imaging of neoplasia associated biomarkers could form a promising technique to
      accommodate this need. It is known that the biomarker Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor
      (VEGF) is overexpressed in dysplastic and neoplastic areas in BE segments versus normal
      tissue and has proven to be a valid target for molecular imaging. The University Medical
      Center Groningen (UMCG) developed a fluorescent tracer by labeling the VEGF-targeting
      humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab, currently used in anti-cancer therapy, with the
      fluorescent dye IRDye800CW. We hypothesize that when bevacizumab-IRDye800CW is administered,
      it accumulates in VEGF expressing high grade dysplasia (HGD) and esophageal adenocarcinoma
      (EAC), enabling early cancer visualization using a newly developed fluorescent NIR
      fiber-bundle. This hypothesis will be tested in this pilot intervention study.
