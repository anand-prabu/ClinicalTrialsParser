            "textblock": "The hope to treat more patients with hepatocellular carcinoma successfully is however\n      tempered by the shortage of donors leading to an increasing waiting time for liver\n      transplantation (LT). Intention-to-treat analysis have showed that the reported excellent\n      long-term outcome is curtailed and significantly hampered by the growing incidence of\n      patients who must be removed from the waiting list because of tumor progression. A way to\n      face with this issue is to treat hepatocellular carcinoma prior to LT. Among therapeutic\n      options to impede tumor progression, Transarterial Chemoembolization (TACE) is the most\n      common modality used. While there are many studies concerning TACE in this setting, none are\n      controlled studies and thus there is no firm evidence concerning its efficacy in reducing\n      drop-out or increasing survival. Moreover TACE may induce risks (liver failure, arterial\n      complications\u2026) while waiting for LT. Most of the available data have been based upon\n      analysis of patients who received a transplant and have not included patients who were\n      eligible for LT but died, or showed progression, before it could be performed. Therefore,\n      studies conducted on an intention-to-treat basis are needed to clarify the benefit and the\n      risks of TACE prior to LT in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma."

HCCs will be classified according to UCSF\n           criteria (size, number of nodules). Clinical and biological status will be updated\n           every 3 month.\n\n        -  Pre-transplant treatment:\n\n      TACE group: An emulsion of Lipiodol and a cytotoxic drug (50mg/m2 of doxorubicin) will be\n      injected as selectively as possible. Then, an embolic agent will be used to assure stop of\n      flow. The first injection will be performed within 10 days following enlisting and repeated\n      every 8 weeks until LT (only if hypervascularized vital tumor tissue is again visible on CT\n      Scan and if liver function remains within Child A stage) or until complete response.\n      Clinical/biological follow-up will be done once a month.\n\n      Control group (no treatment until LT): clinical/biological follow-up and CT-scan every 3\n      month.\n\n      This prospective, multicentric, and randomized study may allow investigators to show that\n      TACE with DC-BeadsR can significantly increase intention to treat survival of patients\n      transplanted for HCC. We also expect that this result will be associated with less\n      recurrence of the cancer after transplantation.\n\n      Obviously, we expect that the beneficial effect of TACE will be associated with a acceptable\n      rate of complication related to the procedure.\n\n        -  Pathologic examination: In all patients in whom LT will be performed, the diagnosis of\n           hepatocellular carcinoma will be confirmed by a histological examination of the\n           explanted liver.\n\n        -  Dropout criteria: Patients with progression but still meeting the transplant criteria\n           will be maintained in their respective group.
