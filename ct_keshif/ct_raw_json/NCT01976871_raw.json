Cross-titration will allow determination of the lowest effective dose of rotigotine.  We will use as initial guidance the equivalence determined from the Parkinson's Disease trials, in which 1 mg rotigotine was shown to be approximately equivalent to 1-1.5 mg ropinirole or 0.25 -0.375 mg pramipexole. Tolerability, adverse events, and RLS symptom control will be evaluated.  These data will provide clinicians with practical guidance to optimize RLS treatment while minimizing adverse events."

The first visit will be the screening visit during which\n      eligibility will be confirmed and informed consent obtained.  After the first visit,\n      subjects will continue their current oral dopamine agonist for a one-week baseline period\n      during which they will record RLS symptoms daily.\n\n      The second visit will be the baseline visit.  The IRLS scale, a commonly used measure of RLS\n      symptoms, will be obtained. An individualized schedule for down-titration of oral dopamine\n      agonist and concomitant up-titration of rotigotine will be provided. After the second visit,\n      subjects will begin this cross-titration.  This will entail a pre-determined incremental\n      taper of the oral medication and flexible up-titration of rotigotine according to symptoms.\n      During this time, subjects will keep diaries of RLS symptoms and will speak with the\n      investigator over the phone a total of 3 times (visits 2a-2c) to discuss dosing of\n      rotigotine.\n\n      After the titration is complete, subjects will enter the maintenance period, which will last\n      28 days. There will be another phone contact (2d) one week after the titration is complete\n      to adjust the dose of rotigotine as needed. The subject will then continue the chosen dose\n      for the next 3 weeks of the maintenance period.  There will be one final phone contact (2e)\n      1 week prior to the end of the maintenance period to remind subjects to resume RLS symptom\n      diaries during the final week of the maintenance period.\n\n      The third and final visit will take place at the end of the maintenance period. RLS symptoms\n      will be discussed and the IRLS scale, Clinician Global Impression of Change (CGIC), Patient\n      Global Impression of Change (PGIC), and Preference of Medication Scale (POMS) will be\n      administered."
