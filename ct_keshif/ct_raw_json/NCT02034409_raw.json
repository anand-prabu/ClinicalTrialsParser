            "textblock": "Osteoarthritis (OA), the most common form of arthritis, is a prevalent and debilitating\n      disease without therapies that alter disease progress and is currently managed with\n      symptom-modifying therapies that are only modestly effective. In spite of substantial\n      progress in understanding the pathogenesis of OA, no effective disease modifying\n      interventions have been established. Degenerative joint cartilage is a central feature of\n      OA, yet joint cartilage has a limited capacity for repair. Results from animal research\n      demonstrate that pulsed low intensity ultrasound (PLIUS) mechanically stimulates, and may\n      promote, cartilage repair. This exploratory trial will investigate whether PLIUS is\n      potentially effective as a disease and symptom modifying intervention in patients with early\n      knee OA."
