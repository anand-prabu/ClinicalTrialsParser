      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of TAK-875 (fasiglifam) in combination
      with sitagliptin on glycemic control in adults with type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-875 (fasiglifam). Fasiglifam is being
      tested to treat people who have type 2 diabetes mellitus and are currently taking
      sitagliptin (with or without metformin). This study will evaluate glycemic control in people
      who take fasiglifam plus sitagliptin compared with placebo plus sitagliptin.

      The study will enroll approximately 390 patients. Participants will be randomly assigned (by
      chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the three treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need; all participants will be on 100 mg sitagliptin and may or may not be on
      metformin background treatment):

        -  fasiglifam 25 mg

        -  fasiglifam 50 mg

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time
           each day throughout the study.

      This multi-centre trial will be conducted in North America and Latin America. The overall
      time to participate in this study is approximately 38 weeks. Participants will make 15
      visits to the clinic.

      Due to potential concerns about liver safety, on balance, the benefits of treating patients
      with fasiglifam (TAK-875) do not outweigh the potential risks.

      For this reason, Takeda has decided voluntarily to terminate the development activities for
      fasiglifam.

             after the last dose of study drug.

          9. The participant is able and willing to monitor glucose with a home glucose monitor
             and consistently record his or her own blood glucose concentrations and complete
             participant diaries.
