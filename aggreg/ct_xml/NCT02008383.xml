    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this open-label phase Ib trial is to determine the maximum
      tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose for the combination of cabozantinib and
      panitumumab in patients with KRAS wild-type metastatic colorectal cancer. The secondary
      objectives are to describe any non-dose limiting toxicities, and to describe the clinical
      activity of cabozantinib and panitumumab in terms of response rate, progression free
      survival, and overall survival.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histologically and/or cytologically confirmed and radiographically measurable KRAS
             wild-type adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum that is metastatic and/ or
             unresectable. Subjects must have been treated with a fluoropyrimidine (e.g.,
             5-fluorouracil or capecitabine), oxaliplatin, irinotecan and bevacizumab or have
             contraindication to such treatment.

          2. Radiographic assessment of all known disease sites eg, by computerized tomography
             (CT) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 28 days before the first dose of
             cabozantinib.

          3. At least one site of disease that is measurable by RECIST (version 1.1) criteria that
             has not been previously irradiated; if the patient has had previous radiation to the
             target lesion(s), there must be evidence of progression since the radiation.

          4. Age ≥ 18 years.

          5. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1.

          6. Life expectancy greater than 3 months.

          7. Sexually active subjects (men and women) must agree to use medically accepted barrier
             methods of contraception (eg, male or female condom) during the course of the study
             and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s), even if oral contraceptives
             are also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a
             barrier method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study
             and for 4 months after the last dose of study drug(s).

          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at screening.
             Women of childbearing potential include women who have experienced menarche and who
             have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (hysterectomy, bilateral tubal
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are not postmenopausal. Postmenopause is
             defined as amenorrhea ≥ 12 consecutive months.  Note: women who have been amenorrheic
             for 12 or more months are still considered to be of childbearing potential if the
             amenorrhea is possibly due to prior chemotherapy, antiestrogens, ovarian suppression
             or any other reversible treatment.

          9. Capable of understanding and complying with the protocol requirements and has signed
             the informed consent document.

         10. Adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:

        normal (ULN) and no radiologic or clinical evidence of pancreatitis

        Creatinine clearance (CrCl) ≥ 50 mL/min. For creatinine clearance estimation, the
        Cockcroft and Gault equation should be used:

        above result by 0.85 Urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPCR) ≤ 1 Serum phosphorus, calcium,
        magnesium and potassium ≥ lower limit of normal (LLN)
