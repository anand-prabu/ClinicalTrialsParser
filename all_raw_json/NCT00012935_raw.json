Previous studies have cited patient preference and physician recommendation\n      for treatment as major roles in treatment decisions.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      This grant will be used to develop and evaluate a decision analysis based intervention to\n      improve decision-making among veterans with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer.\n      While the ultimate goal of this study is to improve decision-making among these patients,\n      factors influencing physician recommendations for treatment will be sought. The former will\n      be achieved by evaluating the efficacy of providing physicians with information\n      incorporating patient preference for alternative health states with probabilities of\n      treatment outcomes. Factors influencing physician recommendations for treatment will be\n      determined through qualitative interviews with physicians.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Patients were accrued at the VA Chicago Health Care System Lakeside Urology Clinic. Upon\n      consent for participation in the study, comorbidities, histologic grade of the biopsy, and\n      age were obtained for 13 patients with newly diagnosed localized prostate cancer. Using a\n      standard gamble technique, interviewers obtained patient utilities for 5 distinct health\n      states related to prostate cancer treatment. Clinical and pathologic characteristics were\n      incorporated into the decision analytic model, and the derived quality-adjusted life\n      expectancies (QALEs) were shared with the treating urologist before patient-physician\n      discussion of treatment options. The feasibility of the decision analytic intervention and\n      unbiased estimates of the impact of the intervention was evaluated.  The long-range\n      objective of this proposal is to design an intervention for veterans that increases\n      physician understanding of patient treatment preferences and patient understanding of\n      choices in prostate cancer treatment.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Completed"
