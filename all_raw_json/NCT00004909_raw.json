Determine the impact of disease symptoms, treatment\n      side effects, performance status, and CA-125 levels on QOL assessment in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive a baseline quality of life (QOL) assessment, an\n      attitudes/preference survey, and a performance status assessment at the time of diagnosis of\n      recurrent disease. Patients are nonrandomly assigned to treatment with either IV or oral\n      chemotherapy using drugs based on National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines, prior\n      treatment history, and patient preference. QOL and performance status assessments are\n      obtained again at 3 and 6 months during treatment. Attitudes/preferences are assessed at 6\n      months. Patients are withdrawn from study if treatment regimen is changed from oral to IV,\n      or from IV to oral during this 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 74 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months."
