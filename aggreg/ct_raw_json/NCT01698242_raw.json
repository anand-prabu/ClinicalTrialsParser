The investigators refer to their novel intervention strategy as 'Enhanced\n      Training' and their education-only strategy the investigators refer to as 'Enhanced\n      Education'.  These two strategies of participant follow-up will be assessed and compared by\n      analyzing patient's all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year follow-up period (the\n      investigators note that, for patients with heart failure, the average number of such\n      all-cause hospital days over a 2.5-year period has tripled over the past 25 years).  The\n      Enhanced Training strategy aims to improve patient receipt of evidence-based therapy by:  1)\n      activating patients using a culturally sensitive approach that might better resonate with\n      the investigators predominantly urban, African-American and Hispanic, target population; 2)\n      providing timely and useful information to the primary care provider; and 3) promoting\n      effective communication between patients and their primary care provider.  The Enhanced\n      Education strategy is less intrusive and aims to provide patients and primary care providers\n      with appropriate educational materials via mail. The primary aims of this research study are\n      to determine if Enhanced Training and/or Enhanced Education will improve:  patient adherence\n      to drug therapy and salt restriction, health care provider adherence to evidence-based\n      guidelines, and patient functional capacity and quality of life.  Secondary aims will\n      include assessing impact of the interventions on CRP and BNP, which are two key biomarkers\n      of heart failure progression."

It contains 2 items from each of 3 subscales that correlated most highly with the overall subscale score.  The 3 subscales are:  Re-Experiencing, Avoidance, and Hyper-Arousal. Respondents rate items on a 5-point scale (ranging from 1 = \"Not at all\" to 5 = \"Extremely\"). The short scale has been found to have good reliability and validity and is used as an indication of symptoms of PTSD.",
