A common problem with conventional MDI devices is\n      inefficient inhaler technique (i.e., inability to properly coordinate actuation with\n      inspiration). Inefficient inhaler technique can compromise delivery of the active drug to\n      the airways and potentially result in suboptimal clinical benefits. Breath actuation has\n      been found to reduce administration errors in comparison with conventional MDIs."

Significant is defined for this protocol as any\n             condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the\n             subject at risk through participation, or which could affect the safety analyses.\n\n          -  Any medical or psychological condition that in the investigator's opinion should\n             preclude enrollment."
