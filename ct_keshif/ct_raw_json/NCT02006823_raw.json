            "textblock": "This study will explore ways to improve the effectiveness of patient Self Management at a\n      time when genetic test results guide new treatments that will dramatically increase the\n      possibility of cure of the hepatitis C virus.The study will also focus on the interactions\n      between provider and patients and the ways that technical work, adaptive work and adaptive\n      leadership foster patient self-management.This proposed 2 year exploratory mixed-methods 12\n      longitudinal case study will explore patients' and providers' explanations for how and why\n      they engage in technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership and the ways in which\n      these strategies promote or pose barriers to patients' self-management of Chronic Hepatitis\n      C in the context of the new genetic test results and treatments.  Specific aims are to:\n\n      1: Examine how technical work, adaptive work and adaptive leadership influence patients'\n      perceptions of their likelihood of cure and how this work relates to self-management during\n      12 to 24 weeks of treatment for Chronic Hepatitis C.  Research questions are: 1.1) How do\n      patients describe their interactions with the providers? 1.2) How do these interactions\n      shape patients' perceptions of the likelihood of cure? 1.3) How do patients' understanding\n      of their interactions with the provider promote the use of or pose barriers to\n      self-management during treatment?\n\n      AIM 2: Describe providers' use of technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches during\n      clinical encounters,to include  nurse education visits. Research questions are:\n\n      2.1) What technical work, and adaptive leadership approaches do providers use when sharing\n      treatment information with patients during the clinical encounters. 2.2) What explanations\n      do providers give for how and why they use technical work and adaptive leadership\n      approaches? AIM 3: Describe the trajectories of illness perceptions(Control/Cure sub-scale -\n      Illness Perception Scale), symptoms (M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory) , viral load, and\n      self-management (Patient Activation Measure) in relation to patient and provider reports of\n      technical work, adaptive work, and adaptive leadership from the index clinical encounter to\n      the follow-up treatment response encounter (ranging from 12 to 24 weeks)."
