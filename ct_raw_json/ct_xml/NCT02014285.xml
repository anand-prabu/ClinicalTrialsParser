  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Examination of serial muscle ultrasounds within the population of ICU patients who require
      mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory failure, will lead to the ability of
      investigators to link specific baseline comorbidities, drugs, or fluid administrations, to
      the onset and duration of architectural changes within muscle and correlate ultimately with
      muscle function. With this study, we will be better able to understand the relationships
      between the pattern of resolution of the muscle architectural abnormalities within the
      context of multiple other clinical abnormalities and therapies present and rendered to ICU
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is an extremely variable and heterogeneous syndrome that can
      be defined as an acute cardiopulmonary dysfunction requiring emergent artificial ventilation
      support. For patients with ARF, the mortality rate is higher than the general ICU mortality,
      with estimates ranging from 15-40% depending on the subgroups evaluated. In the largest,
      most recent report on ARF, the in-ICU mortality was 31% and the overall in-hospital
      mortality rate was 37%. Muscle weakness is an independent risk factor for mortality from ARF
      and contributes to long-term reductions in physical function in survivors. Muscle
      ultrasounds are non-invasive, quick and reproducible. They provide the opportunity of ICU
      staff to create a patient-specific exercise prescription based on both functional
      assessments and importantly the degree of muscle architecture abnormality detected by
      ultrasound. Serial examination of muscle ultrasound images obtained in mechanically
      ventilated acute respiratory failure patients will allow for better understanding of the
      time course of specific muscles' architectural abnormalities and the resolution of such
      abnormalities within hospital survivors. With this study, we will be better able to
      understand the relationships between the pattern of resolution of the muscle architectural
      abnormalities within the context of multiple other clinical abnormalities and therapies
      present and rendered to ICU patients. Study participants will consist of 100 patients with
      ARF admitted to the Intensive Care Units of Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center.
      Muscle ultrasounds will occur at study enrollment and weekly thereafter, and will also
      include one imaging session as close to at hospital discharge as possible. Handgrip strength
      and physical performance tests will also be administered at hospital discharge and at 2 and
      4 weeks post hospital discharge. The primary outcome will be to investigate the possibility
      of a relationship between the ultrasound data and functional measurements (length of stay,
      grip strength, SPPB, simultaneously accounting for severity of illness [APACHE III]).
