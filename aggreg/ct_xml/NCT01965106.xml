  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess any side effects that may occur when QPI-1007 is injected into the
      eye in subjects with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma, as well as how long it takes for
      the body to clear the drug. This study will also test whether QPI-1007, injected into the
      eye, helps prevent both structural damage of the nerve tissue in the eye and the loss of
      visual function in subjects with acute primary angle-closure glaucoma.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IIa double-masked, single dose, randomized, sham-controlled study evaluating
      the safety and tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of QPI-1007 versus Control (sham
      procedure) in subjects with an acute attack of primary angle-closure glaucoma.

      Subjects will be randomized at a ratio of 1:1 into one of two study arms: 1.5 QPI-1007 arm
      or Control arm (sham procedure).  The study will enroll approximately 30 subjects into each
      arm. Randomization will be stratified by time from symptom onset to the study drug
      administration or sham procedure (â‰¤72 hours and &gt;72 hours).
