Clinical new onset or established diagnosis of diabetes with diabetes ketoacidosis as\n             defined by the Pediatric Endocrine Society Consensus Statement guidelines\n\n          3. Age 10 years to less than 17 years\n\n          4. Parent/guardian understand the study protocol and agrees to comply with it.\n\n          5. Primary care giver (i.e parent/guardian) comprehends written English. This is due to\n             the fact that questionnaires and neurocognitive testing tools used as outcome\n             measures do not have validated versions in Spanish or other language.

History of head trauma with any loss of consciousness\n\n          2. History of premature birth (less than 30 weeks of gestation)\n\n          3. History of significant developmental delay (lack of single word speech or ability to\n             walk independently by 18 months of age\n\n          4. History of neurologic disease independent of diabetes (seizure disorder)"
