  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is conducted globally. The aim of this observational study is to investigate the
      incidence of specific adverse drug reactions associated with the use of recombinant factor
      XIII (NovoThirteen®) in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency (congenital
      FXIII deficiency), comprising FXIII antibodies, allergic reactions, embolic and thrombotic
      events and lack of therapeutic effect.

      The study will aim at observing all patients exposed to NovoThirteen® in the EU, and
      additional patients from selected non-EU countries. Recombinant FXIII (rFXIII) is registered
      in EU and Switzerland as NovoThirteen® and in Canada as Tretten®.
