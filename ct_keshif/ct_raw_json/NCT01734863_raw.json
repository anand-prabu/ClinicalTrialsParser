Central site of disease may be a second independent\n      predictive factor (Lin et al. 2007). Patients with more than 10% viable tumour cells at\n      surgery following neo-adjuvant chemotherapy had a less favourable outcome with an Event-free\n      Survival  [EFS] of 47% after 10 years. Patients with good histological response (< 10%\n      viable tumour cells) after chemotherapy alone had a prognosis of about 70%  after 10 years.\n\n      However, further studies are necessary to determine the merit of adjuvant radiation for\n      high-risk patients (poor responders). Taking into consideration that the toxicity and\n      morbidity of combined surgery and radiation is greater than either alone and must be closely\n      monitored."
