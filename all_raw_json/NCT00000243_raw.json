            "textblock": "Buprenorphine is a mixed agonist-antagonist opioid that is being developed as a treatment\n      for opioid dependence.  Because buprenorphine is a partial mu agonist opioid, under certain\n      conditions it is possible for buprenorphine to precipitate opioid withdrawal in opioid\n      dependent individuals.  A person with a high level of physical dependence could experience\n      buprenorphine-related precipitated withdrawal.  The purpose of this study is to test the\n      acute effects of different doses of buprenorphine/naloxone in opioid dependent individuals\n      maintained on methadone.  The study is designed to provide dosing schedules similar to those\n      that might be initially used in a physician's office."
