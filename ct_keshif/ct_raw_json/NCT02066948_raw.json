            "textblock": "About two-thirds of adults in the United States are overweight or obese. Obesity is\n      associated with an increased risk of chronic disease and metabolic syndrome and a reduced\n      physical functioning capacity, all of which contribute to disproportionately high healthcare\n      expenditures and premature mortality. A moderate dietary energy restriction with a higher\n      protein diet has been recommended for weight loss to prevent or improve medical\n      complications associated with obesity as well as improve body composition, including\n      preserving lean body mass. Emerging research indicates that the consumption of multiple high\n      protein meals daily may be superior than only consuming one high-protein meal (typically\n      dinner) to stimulate muscle protein synthesis throughout the day. This concept is based on\n      research showing that the patterning of energy and protein intake influences muscle protein\n      synthesis and whole body composition and protein retention. Very limited research exists\n      regarding the effects of protein intake on skeletal muscle size after weight loss, and\n      currently, no longitudinal studies have evaluated the effectiveness of consuming an even vs.\n      skewed distribution of protein intake across meals on phenotypic changes in skeletal muscle\n      size over the longer-term. Recent studies have also suggested that evenly distributed\n      protein patterning may promote satiety and improve blood glucose response in healthy adult\n      men and women. However, there is a need for controlled, longer-duration trials to\n      investigate the effects of daily protein distribution on appetite, glucose response and\n      metabolic syndrome after weight loss in overweight or obese adults. The goal of the proposed\n      research is to evaluate the effects of within-day patterning of dietary protein intake (even\n      vs. skewed) on energy-restriction and resistance training-induced changes in body\n      composition, skeletal muscle size, appetite, glucose response, and metabolic syndrome\n      parameters."
