The\n      identification of biological markers specific to an etiology would therefore allow a faster\n      diagnosis and improve care for patients. We thus took an interest in the three groups of\n      diseases most frequently responsible for an inflammatory syndrome, infections, cancers and\n      auto-immune diseases. To achieve this, various methods will be used."
