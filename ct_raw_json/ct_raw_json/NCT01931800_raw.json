Samples will no longer be taken once the patient has left the CHU,\n           even if all of the samples have not been taken.\n\n        -  For children less than 6 years old, only 2 tubes (1 x 7 ml dry tube with yellow gelose,\n           and 1x5 ml tube with blue CTAD) will be taken following the same timetable.\n\n        -  For hospitalised patients, a leeway of 48 hours is authorized for the sampling\n           procedure. Samples will be taken at the same time samples are taken for the usual care\n           of the patient.\n\n        -  The tubes will be taken to the Bacteriology Laboratory using the usual collection\n           circuit of the CHU. These tubes will then be redirected to the Infectious Diseases\n           Laboratory to be centrifuged and then stored at -80\u00b0C. The strain of Streptococcus\n           pneumoniae isolated in the patient will be preserved at -80\u00b0C. If strains other than\n           Streptococcus pneumoniae are isolated, these different strains will all be preserved at\n            -80\u00b0C under the same identification number."
