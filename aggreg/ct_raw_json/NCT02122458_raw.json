The characteristics and\n      nature of their auditory and auditory-related skills will be examined with a battery of\n      behavioral and physiologic measures.  The potential contributions of co-occurring PTSD also\n      will be evaluated.  In a preliminary treatment study, a sub-sample of the targeted veterans\n      will be fitted with mild-gain hearing aids to determine if they benefit from low-level\n      amplification of high-frequency sounds.\n\n      This study consists of two parts.  In Part 1, four groups of veterans, aged 20 - 50 years,\n      will complete a battery of auditory and auditory-related assessments to better understand\n      the deficit sources and patterns.  The assessment measures will consist of questionnaires,\n      behavioral tests, and auditory physiologic measures.  One group will consist of\n      blast-exposed veterans with auditory problems but no PTSD.  The second group will consist of\n      blast-exposed veterans with auditory problems plus PTSD.  The third group will consist of\n      veterans with PTSD but no reported auditory problems, and the fourth groups will be a\n      normal control group.\n\n      In Part 2 of the study, 25 participants from group 1, and 25 participants from group 2 will\n      be fitted with mild-gain open-fit hearing aids.  Changes in hearing handicap, hearing aid\n      benefit, hearing aid use time, intent to continue use, and speech perception will be\n      measured over a 6-month period.   A delayed treatment group populated from group 1 will be\n      followed over a 12-month period with hearing aids fitted at 6 months.   The participants\n      will be assigned randomly from Part 1, but can decline participation.\n\n      The information obtained from this study will help us understand the auditory problems\n      experienced by blast-exposed veterans and eventually contribute to the development of an\n      efficient and effective assessment battery and intervention approaches."
