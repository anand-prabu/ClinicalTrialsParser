The\n      incidence of seizures in this population is unknown but correlated with patient's underlying\n      condition and missed doses of anti-convulsant.  Previous work has determined this is not a\n      unique problem.\n\n      The investigators initially found compliance extremely poor at 60%.  The investigators have\n      made improvement to about 80% compliance through various interventions: education of\n      nursing, availability of anticonvulsant intravenous dosing alternatives, and re-wording the\n      hospital NPO policy.  The investigators feel that a new, more focused, survey will help\n      identify, perioperative reasons for non-compliance on part of the parents.  This information\n      will be utilized to guide further interventions aimed at improving compliance."
