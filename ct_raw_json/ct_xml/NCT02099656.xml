  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study will evaluate the effects
      of lebrikizumab on airway eosinophilic inflammation in patients with uncontrolled asthma who
      are using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and a second controller medication.
      Enrolled patients will undergo a 3-week screening period during which assessments, including
      a bronchoscopy procedure, will be made. Patients will subsequently be randomized to receive
      lebrikizumab or placebo by subcutaneous injection (SC) on Day 1, Day 8, Week 4, and Week 8.
      Patients will continue their standard of care therapy throughout the study. End of treatment
      assessments will be taken at Week 12. Total study period, including screening and follow-up,
      is expected to last 23 weeks.
