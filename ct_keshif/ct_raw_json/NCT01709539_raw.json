The overall purpose of the study\n      is to evaluate whether the DC meets its target time for diagnosing cancer. In addition, we\n      will evaluate secondary issues, such as survival, to determine whether this pilot project\n      merits extension to other parts of southern Sweden."

If it\n      is successful, the DC model could be rolled out to other areas of Sweden. This study by the\n      Center for Primary Health Care Research in Malm\u00f6, Sweden and Regionalt cancercentrum syd\n      will investigate whether the DC process reduces the time from (1) the point when the patient\n      first contacts his/her primary care center with symptoms to (2) the point when he/she is\n      informed about his/her diagnosis (of cancer or another disease). This will be achieved by\n      comparison with matched control patients with suspected cancer who will be referred to\n      Helsingborg General Hospital for further investigation according to existing diagnostic\n      procedures. Various outcome measures will be investigated, and patients' experiences of the\n      DC process will be assessed using a tailored questionnaire. In addition, the DC model will\n      be subjected to health economics analysis."
