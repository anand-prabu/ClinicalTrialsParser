First we will do a baseline tape-stripping procedure to measure the\n      amount of LL-37 on subjects' forearms.  Tape stripping involves applying small, round tapes\n      (CuDerm, Dallas, TX) to the skin, massaging them for about 10 second, and then removing\n      them.  This process is repeated 9 times for each tape.  After doing baseline tape stripping\n      samples, each participant's forearms will be washed with a different soap.  The soap will be\n      rinsed off, and the skin allowed to dry.  After the forearms are dry (about 5 minutes\n      later), repeat tape-stripping will be performed.  This tape-stripping process will then be\n      repeated 4 hours later, and then 24 hours later as well.  Results of the LL-37 expression at\n      each time point will then be compared between soaps."
