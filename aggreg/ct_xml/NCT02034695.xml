  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) is one of the major cause of morbidity and among the top 10 causes of
      deaths in Hong Kong in 2008 (Department of Health 2009). The Hospital Authority (HA) has
      initiated service improvement through introducing the risk assessment and management
      programme (RAMP) to improve the quality of care (QOC) for DM patients in general outpatient
      clinics (GOPC). The evaluation on the QOC is an essential part of the programme in order to
      inform future policy. The Department of Family Medicine and Primary Care (FMPC) of the
      University of Hong Kong (HKU) has been appointed by the HA to carry out the evaluation of
      the QOC of the programme.

      The Action Learning and Audit Spiral methodologies to measure whether the target standard of
      care intended by the RAMP programme is achieved. Each RAMP participating clinic and hospital
      will be invited to complete a structured evaluation questionnaire. The data of all patients
      who have enrolled into the RAMP for more than one year will be included in the evaluation on
      the process and outcomes of care.

      One thousand two hundred and forty-eight age and disease matched control patients who have
      not been enrolled into the RAMP programme will be selected for the comparison in the
      outcomes of care. A hundred and thirty participants will be followed up by telephone to
      evaluate the effect of the programme in quality of life (QOL), patient enablement, and
      global rating of change in health condition at baseline and 6 months after enrolment. Data
      on the process of care will be retrieved from the HA medical records.

      Main Outcome Measures: The primary outcomes are the proportion of participants who have
      received the criterion process of care, and achieved the target HbA1c and blood pressure
      levels.

      Data Analysis: Descriptive statistics on proportions of centers or subjects meeting the QOC
      criteria will be calculated. The changes in the clinical and patient reported outcomes of
      RAMP subjects will be compared at 12, 24, 36 and 48 months will be compared by paired sample
      t-test. The clinical outcomes between RAMP subjects and control group will be compared by
      independent sample t-test or Chi-square test.

      Results: The QOC of the RAMP programme will be determined. Areas of deficiency and possible
      areas for quality enhancement will be identified.

      Conclusion: The results of this study will provide empirical evidence on whether the HA's
      RAMP programme can achieve improvement in QOC for DM patients. The information will be used
      to guide service planning and policy decision making.

        Patients with DM who are mostly independent in their activities of daily living and being
        followed up at GOPC regularly will be recruited. All enrolled patients will undergo a
        comprehensive risk assessment and screening for complications, who will then be assigned
        to receive appropriate interventions and education from multi-disciplinary healthcare
        professionals according to their risk level. Low risk patients will continue with the
        usual GOPC follow up, medium risk patients will be given additional intervention by an
        advanced practice nurse (APN), and high risk patients will be given additional
        intervention by an APN and an associate consultant (AC) in family medicine (FM).
