The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, and 3 months post injection. Patients may participate in a\n      separate long term (up to 1 year) follow-up study for continued assessment and monitoring.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 27 patients will be accrued for this study."
