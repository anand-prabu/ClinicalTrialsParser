    <textblock>
      Preview research reports evidence of cognitive plasticity among individuals with amnestic
      Mild cognitive Impairment, and small-size studies have suggest that this population can
      benefit from memory training. This project intends to assess the efficacy of cognitive
      training in persons with MCI with a randomized controlled design.

      The hypothesis is that cognitive training can improve memory performance for persons with
      amnestic mild cognitive impairment and this improvement can be maintained over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) often represents a transitional state between healthy aging
      and dementia, being considered a public health problem especially due to the increase of
      elder population in Brazil and in the World in general. Yet the conclusions of studies on
      pharmacological treatments for this population are still controversial, making imperative to
      invest on new efficient therapies such as non pharmacological interventions aimed at memory
      improvement.

      One training mode that has benefited elders is the association between names and faces,
      which has a compelling clinical relevance considering that one of the main complains among
      elders is the difficulty in remembering names. However, the exact effects of this kind of
      training in elders (i.e. the eventual changes in cognition and in brain activation on
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging) are still unclear.

      Therefore, this study aims to verify the effects of memory training (name-face association)
      compared with control intervention - psychoeducation, in 30 elders with amnestic MCI. We
      will request the participants with amnestic MCI to submit to a Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF) in
      order to improve the accuracy of the diagnosis. Training and psychoeducation will be
      conducted in 4 sessions (two per week). To assess the effects, we will use cognitive
      instruments and MRI exams before and after the intervention. Also, one and three months
      after the conclusion of the training patients will again be submitted to cognitive tests.
