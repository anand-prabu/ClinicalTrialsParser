It is\n      important to continue these advances and discover new ones. To do that, researchers need\n      tissue samples from solid tumors. This study will collect such samples from people already\n      scheduled to have a procedure at the National Institutes of Health Clinical Center (NIHCC).\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To collect tissue samples for use in studying new ways to treat tumors.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults 18 years and older, with a precancerous or cancerous solid tumor who are scheduled\n      to have surgery or a biopsy at the NIHCC.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Before their procedure, participants will have a small blood sample taken.\n\n        -  Some participants will undergo leukapheresis. In this procedure, blood is removed\n           through a tube in one arm and circulated through a machine that removes white blood\n           cells. The blood, minus the white blood cells, is returned through a tube in the other\n           arm. The procedure takes 3   4 hours.\n\n        -  For all participants, during the surgery or biopsy, pieces of the tumor and pieces of\n           normal tissue near it will be removed for this study. The rest of the tumor or\n           precancerous growth will be sent to a lab for analysis.\n\n        -  Participants will return to the clinic about 6 weeks after the operation for a routine\n           checkup. Some may have to return for additional follow-up."

A critical challenge in extending these studies involves the\n           identification and validation of new therapeutic targets for future cancer therapies.\n\n        -  As Surgical Oncologists at the NCI, we have an interest in identifying novel molecular\n           and biologic targets to facilitate the development of future cancer therapies. In\n           addition, we have the primary responsibility for providing surgical consultative\n           services to the NIH. As such, we are uniquely positioned to acquire and perform\n           important studies on solid tumor tissue to help identify therapeutic targets that may\n           have significant clinical ramifications.\n\n      OBJECTIVES:\n\n        -  Primary Objective: To collect biologic samples from patients undergoing diagnostic or\n           therapeutic interventions for premalignant, primary or metastatic solid tumors for the\n           purpose of identifying novel molecular and biologic therapeutic targets\n\n        -  Secondary Objectives: To collect detailed history, demographic, treatment data, and\n           perioperative findings in order to categorize and track the specific procedures and\n           outcomes.\n\n      ELIGIBILITY:\n\n        -  Patients greater than or equal to 18 years of age with radiographic evidence of,\n           biochemical evidence of, or histologically/cytologically proven solid neoplasms who\n           require diagnostic or therapeutic intervention as a part of the diagnosis and /or\n           standard of care treatment and/or follow up for their neoplasm\n\n        -  Patients must have laboratory and physical examination parameters within acceptable\n           limits by standard of practice guidelines prior to planned intervention\n\n      DESIGN:\n\n        -  A tissue acquisition trial in which tissues will be obtained at the time of\n           intervention\n\n        -  Tissue and blood will be processed at the time of collection, stored and then\n           transferred to Dr. Rudloff   s laboratory for further processing.\n\n        -  No investigational therapy will be given.\n\n        -  It is anticipated that 1000 patients will be enrolled over a period of 10 years"
