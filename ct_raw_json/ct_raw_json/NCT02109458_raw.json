            "textblock": "Accessing peripheral pulmonary nodules is problematic because they are often not visible\n      endobronchially, not large enough to be visualized by x-ray fluoroscopy for transbronchial\n      biopsy (TBBx), and/or do not lie within an accessible airway. In this study, investigators\n      hope to evaluate new technologies to aid in PPN biopsy using navigation bronchoscopy (NB)\n      combined with navigation transthoracic needle aspiration (N-TTNA) sampling of a PPN.\n\n      Patients meeting inclusion criteria who consent will undergo a convex EBUS bronchoscopy for\n      evaluation and sampling of the mediastinum and hilum.  Following this, NB will be performed\n      with an ultrathin bronchoscope (4mm outer diameter with a 2 mm working channel) with R-EBUS\n      and fluoroscopy.  If the lesion is localized by NB and/or radial EBUS in conjunction with\n      NB, TBBX  will be taken.  At the conclusion of TBBX sampling, a fluoroscopic evaluation to\n      assess for the presence of pneumothorax will be performed and if one is present, appropriate\n      clinical measures will be taken at the discretion of the treating team (tube thoracostomy,\n      observation, etc.) and no further sampling techniques will be utilized.  If the lesion was\n      not able to be localized via NB and/or the physician feels insufficient sample was acquired\n      for diagnosis and there is no evidence of pneumothorax, the patient will undergo N-TTNA at\n      the same PPN during the same procedure time.  It is envisioned that between 8-12 patients\n      will require a N-TTNA to complete diagnosis."
