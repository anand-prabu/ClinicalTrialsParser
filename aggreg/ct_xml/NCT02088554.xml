      To  evaluate  the  safety  and  effectiveness  of  the  Model  400  aortic  valve
      bioprosthesis.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, non-randomized, worldwide, multi-center trial, with
      each site following a common protocol.   A maximum of 650 subjects will be implanted at a
      maximum of 40 sites in the US, Europe and Canada.  The trial will include male and female
      patients of legal age to provide informed consent in the country where they enroll in the
      trial, requiring replacement for a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic
      aortic valve.  Patients will be followed and assessed after implant for up to 5 years.

    <description>Safety of the valve will be evaluated by the time-related incidence of valve-related adverse events and death. The following valve-related adverse events will be evaluated in this study: Thromboembolism, Thrombosis,  Hemorrhage,  Paravalvular  leak  (PVL),  Endocarditis,  Hemolysis,  Structural  valve deterioration, Non-structural dysfunction, Reintervention, Explant, and Death.</description>

    <description>The effectiveness endpoints are:
New York Heart Association Functional Classification (at discharge (or 30 days), 3-6 months, 1 year and annually thereafter through 5 years) as compared to Baseline.
Clinically acceptable Hemodynamic  Performance  (at  discharge  (or  30  days),  3-6  months,  1  year  and  annually thereafter through 5 years) confirmed by core lab evaluation of echocardiography.</description>

    <description>The Model 400 valve consists of a polyester covered base frame and tri-leaflet support frame, which are injection molded using Polyetheretherketone (PEEK) material.  The base frame PEEK material is impregnated with barium sulphate to allow for radiographic visualization.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient requires aortic valve replacement of their native or prosthetic aortic valve,
             with or without concomitant procedures such as coronary artery bypass

          2. Patient is geographically stable and willing to return to the implanting site for all
             follow-up visits

          3. Patient is of legal age to provide informed consent in the country where they enroll
             in the trial

          4. Patient has been adequately informed of risks and requirements of the trial and is
             willing and able to provide informed consent for participation in the clinical trial

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient has a pre-existing prosthetic valve in another position or requires
             replacement of the mitral, pulmonary or tricuspid valve

          2. Patient has had previous implant and then explant of the Model 400 aortic valve
             bioprosthesis

          3. Patient presents with active endocarditis or other systemic infection

          4. Patient has a non-cardiac major or progressive disease, which in the investigator's
             experience produces an unacceptable risk to the patient

          5. Patient has a life expectancy of less than 2 years

          6. Patient is participating in another investigational device or drug trial or
             observational competitive study

          7. Patient  is  pregnant  or  planning  to  become  pregnant  during  the  trial period
