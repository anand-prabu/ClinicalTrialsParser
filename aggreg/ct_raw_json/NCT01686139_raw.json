Diabetic foot complications are the most common cause of lower extremity amputations\n      in the industrialized world. The lifetime occurence of Diabetic Foot Ulcers (DFU) is 20% in\n      diabetic patients.\n\n      Between 15% - 25% of the foot ulcers will lead to lower limb amputations.\n\n      It has been shown that Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) could be an effective therapy for many\n      diseases including acute respiratory distress syndrome, spinal cord injury, liver injury and\n      critical limb ischemia.\n\n      Stem cells can be obtained from either the patient (autologous) or non-related healthy\n      donors (allogeneic).\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and efficacy of cultured Bone Marrow\n      Mesenchymal Stromal Cells (BM-MSCs) from allogeneic donors for treatment of chronic leg\n      wounds of diabetic patients."
