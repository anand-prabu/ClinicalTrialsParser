  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have designed a randomized controlled trial to test whether increased
      water intake slows renal decline in patients with Stage-III Chronic Kidney Disease.
      Participants randomized to the hydration-intervention group will be asked to drink 1.0 to
      1.5 L of water per day (depending on sex and weight), in addition to usual fluid intake, for
      one year. The investigators will calculate the change in kidney function (estimated
      glomerular filtration rate, measured every three months for 12 months), and compare renal
      decline between the intervention and control groups. The investigators hypothesize that
      increased water intake will slow renal decline.
