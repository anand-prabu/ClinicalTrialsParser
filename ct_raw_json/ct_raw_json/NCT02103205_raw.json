The general hypothesis is that bovine lactoferrin reduces some of the previously\n      observed differences between formula-fed and breast-fed infants with regard to health and\n      development. The main outcome studied is the effect on immune function. The second aim is to\n      study the effects of lower iron concentration in infant formula and to test the hypothesis\n      that iron can be lowered without negative effects on health and development. The main\n      outcome studied here is iron status. Other outcomes in this trial are microbiota\n      composition, metabolomics, growth, body composition and cognitive development.\n\n      To test the lactoferrin hypothesis, formula-fed infants will be recruited and fed a low iron\n      (2 mg/L) control formula, or the same formula supplemented with bovine lactoferrin. To test\n      the iron hypothesis, a third group will be fed the same formula (no lactoferrin) with higher\n      iron concentration (8 mg/L). Group allocation for all formula-fed infants will be\n      double-blind randomized. Additionally, breast-fed infants will be recruited and used as a\n      reference group (gold standard)."
