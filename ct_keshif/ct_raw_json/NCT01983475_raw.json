After depletion of bone mass and the loss of architectural integrity, it may be\n      difficult, if even possible, to restore skeletal mass and strength.  Denosumab is a relative\n      new, highly potent anti-resorptive agent that has proven efficacy in postmenopausal\n      osteoporosis to improve bone mass and in solid tumor patients to prevent a skeletal-related\n      event to a greater extent than that with bisphosphonate administration. In persons with\n      complete motor lesions, bisphosphonates have not been effective at reducing bone loss at the\n      knee, the site of greatest relevance because of its increased risk of fracture. Anti-RANKL\n      therapy appears to be more potent than bisphosphonates in animal models of bone loss due to\n      immobilization, suggesting that treatment with denosumab may prove to be an efficacious\n      therapy for persons with acute SCI to preserve bone mass and strength."
