The Calypso beacons\n      are small devices that are implanted in the lungs, near the tumor. They are able to send a\n      signal to a tracking system to show where they are, and where the tumor is, as the patient\n      holds their breath for the radiation treatment. The investigators want to find out what\n      effects, good and/or bad, that this has on the patient and the way they treat the cancer in\n      your lungs."
