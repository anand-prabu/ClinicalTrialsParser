Informed consent will\n      be obtained. The clinician version of the structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID) is\n      a brief structured interview for major Axis I disorders in DSM-IV including major depressive\n      disorder, dysthymic disorder, bipolar disorders, psychotic disorders, anxiety disorders,\n      eating disorders, and alcohol and substance abuse/dependence. This will be given at baseline\n      to confirm bipolar disorder diagnosis. Blood draws and a physical examination by a physician\n      will be performed at baseline to general physical health. Participants will return to\n      receive icariin (100 mg/day)once their general health and diagnosis are confirmed.\n\n      Participants will be assessed at baseline and weekly with the HAMD and a urine drug screen,\n      for 8 consecutive weeks after initiating intervention (icariin). A dose titration from 100\n      mg/day to 200 mg/day will be allowed at week 3 for participants with less than a 30%\n      reduction in HAMD and/or still using cocaine or alcohol or have a positive urine drug\n      screen. An additional dose titration to 300 mg/day will be allowed at week 6 for\n      participants with less than a 50% reduction in HAMD scores and/or still using cocaine or\n      alcohol or have a positive urine drug screen.\n\n      Pill counts will be conducted, and a list of current medications and doses will be obtained\n      at each visit. Participants will be compensated and receive bus passes at each appointment.\n      Participants will be evaluated by both the research assistant (RA) and principal\n      investigator (PI) at each follow-up appointment.\n\n      The HAM-D will be the primary outcome measure. Other cognitive assessments will be performed\n      at these same visits as well."
