            "textblock": "Beta-blockers are no longer recommended as first line treatment in essential hypertension.\n      Evidence mainly based on clinical trails with the non-vasodilating beta-blockers atenolol\n      and propanolol points towards that beta-blockers have an increased risk of stroke compared\n      to ACE-inhibitors, calcium channel blockers and thiazides. However, this Nebivolol is a\n      third generation beta-blocker with vasodilating properties. Nebivolol decreases peripheral\n      blood pressure to the same extend as other beta-blockers but in contrast to atenolol\n      nebivolol also reduces central blood pressure. Furthermore nebivolol increases nitric oxide\n      (NO) availability in forearm vessels, maybe through activation of beta-3 receptors. The\n      nitric oxide system plays a central role in both renal sodium and water handling and\n      regulation of vascular tone and blood pressure. It has not been investigated if nebivolol\n      changes NO availability in the kidney.\n\n      Investigators want investigate the following hypothesis:\n\n        1. Nebivolol increases nitric oxide activity in the systemic circulation and the kidney\n\n        2. The increased activity of nitric oxide during nebivolol treatment can be demonstrated\n           by inhibition of NO synthesis with L-NMMA. Investigators expect increased responses in\n           blood pressure and sodium excretion is expected during nebivolol treatment compared to\n           placebo.\n\n      Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of nebivolol on renal\n      handling of sodium and water (Glomerular filtration rate, urine production, free water\n      clearance, excretion of proteins from epithelial sodium channels (u-ENaC\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3) and aquaporin\n      channels (u-AQP2) and sodium and potassium excretion), plasma concentrations of vasoactive\n      hormones (renin, angiotensin II, aldosterone, vasopressin, atrial natriuretic peptide, brain\n      natriuretic peptide and endothelin), central blood pressure, pulse wave velocity (PWV) and\n      augmentation index, under basal conditions and during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis\n      in patients with essential hypertension.\n\n      Design 25 patients with essential hypertension are recruited in this randomised, cross over,\n      placebo-controlled, double blinded study with two treatment periods (nebivolol/placebo).\n      Each subject will attend to two examination days. Four days prior to each examination days\n      and on the morning of each examination day subjects are given either nebivolol 5 mg pr. day\n      or placebo. During treatment periods subject are given a standardized diet. On the\n      examination days subject are given L-NMMA, a nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, and renal\n      function, central hemodynamic and vasoactive hormones are evaluated during basal conditions\n      and during inhibition of nitric oxide synthesis.\n\n      Perspectives This study is expected to contribute to increasing the knowledge about the\n      mechanisms involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular disease.\n      Beta-blockers are not recommended as first line treatment in essential hypertension but the\n      results from this study may influence clinical treatment of essential hypertension in the\n      future."
