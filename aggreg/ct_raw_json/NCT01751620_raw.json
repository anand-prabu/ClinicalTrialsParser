Both arms consist of two individual sessions followed by six group sessions and a\n      final individual session which is expected to take approximately nine weeks after which\n      youth will have four follow-up visits at the following time points:\n\n        -  post intervention (immediately after the last session);\n\n        -  3 months post the last session;\n\n        -  6 months post the last session; and\n\n        -  12 months post the last session.
