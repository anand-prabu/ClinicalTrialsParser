The study is organized on an outpatient basis in subjects undergoing\n      assisted reproductive technologies (ART). The subjects are randomized into 2 groups. One\n      group receive DA-3803(r-hCG) 250mcg and the other group receive Ovidrel\u00ae(r-hCG)250mcg. Each\n      subject in both groups receives a single injection of hCG when the follicular development\n      was judged to be adequate. Oocytes are retrieved 34-38 hours after r-hCG injection and\n      fertilized in vitro. Not more than 4 embryos  are to be replaced. Progesterone is\n      administered daily according to center's normal practice, starting after the oocyte pick up\n      and continuing until appropriate time. The subject is followed up and the treatment outcome\n      (negative pregnancy test or pregnancy) is recorded."
