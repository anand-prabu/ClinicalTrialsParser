    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies high-dose trivalent influenza vaccine in inducing immune
      response patients with central nervous system tumors. Studying samples of blood in the
      laboratory from patients receiving trivalent influenza vaccine may help doctors learn more
      about the effects of trivalent influenza vaccine on cells. It may also help doctors
      understand how well patients respond to treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the immunogenicity of high-dose influenza vaccination in patients with
      central nervous system tumors.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the geometric mean titer (GMT) in patients after administration of high-dose
      influenza vaccination compared to previously determined geometric mean titer (GMT) among 38
      patients receiving the standard yearly influenza vaccination.

      II. To assess the seroconversion rates (i.e. four-fold rise in titer) compared to previously
      determined seroconversion following administration of the standard yearly influenza
      vaccination.

      III. To assess the seroprotection rates (i.e. post-vaccination titer &gt;= 1:40) compared to
      previously determined seroconversion and seroprotection following administration of the
      standard yearly influenza vaccination.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between serologic markers of immune function and response to
      high-dose vaccination.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive trivalent influenza vaccine on day 1.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 28 days and/or 3 months.
