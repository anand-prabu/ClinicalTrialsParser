      SPECIFIC AIMS

        -  Assess risk factors for nausea and vomiting in c-section patients undergoing regional
           anesthesia

        -  Quantify the incidence of nausea and vomiting intraoperatively and postoperatively in
           the ginger and placebo groups.

        -  Quantify post-operative analgesia and pruritus in the ginger and placebo groups

        -  Quantify patient satisfaction of the ginger and placebo groups

        -  Assess patient expectation of ginger on post-op day three

    <textblock>
      Two hundred and forty-two ASA class I and II patients, scheduled for elective c-section will
      be assigned randomly to receive either 1g ginger tablet PO (Group 1) or 1 g placebo PO
      (Group 2) preoperatively, immediately before surgery.  The usual preoperative anti-emetic
      and antacid regimen will be continued for both groups.  Initial blood pressure, pulse and
      hemoglobin and hematocrit will be documented by the researcher prior to the arrival of the
      patient into the operating room.   A baseline questionnaire will be given to the patients to
      assess risk factors for nausea and vomiting.  Questions will include: age, BMI, parity,
      weeks gestation, h/o seasickness, h/o of hyperemesis gravidrum in this or prior pregnancies,
      h/o PONV, medical problems, any medication used within past 24 hrs, education and
      occupation.

      Intraoperatively, both groups will receive combined spinal-epidural anesthesia in the usual
      manner.  All standard monitoring will be applied and vital signs recorded for the entirety
      of the procedure.  The number and dose of ephedrine or phenylephrine boluses and the number
      and severity of nausea episodes (using a Visual Analog Scale (VANS)) and number of vomiting
      episodes will be noted.  In addition the following will be recorded: if uterus was
      exteriorized, any medications used by the anesthesiologist (other than ephedrine and
      phenylephrine), and estimated blood loss.

      Postoperatively, patients will receive either a one time dose of the 1g ginger PO (Group 1)
      or 1 g placebo PO (Group 2) 2 hours after entering the postanesthesia care unit (PACU).
      Thirty minutes after the medication is given, patients will be asked to rate their nausea,
      level of analgesia, and level of pruritus on a VANS, and vomiting episodes will be recorded.
       Medications given for nausea will be continued in the post-operative period for both
      groups.  The doses of Zofran will be counted in the 24 hr postoperative period.  Twenty-four
      hours after surgery, blood will be drawn to assess hemoglobin and hematocrit as well as to
      assess platelet function.
