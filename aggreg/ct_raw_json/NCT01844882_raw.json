            "textblock": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a debilitating condition in which there is a gradual decline\n      of renal function associated with increased overall mortality. Most dietary guidelines for\n      CKD focus on limiting protein intake (nitrogen) and high phosphorus-containing foods.\n      However, increasing dietary fiber has been proposed to increase fecal nitrogen excretion\n      which may ameliorate the progress of CKD. We therefore plan to conduct a systematic review\n      and meta-analysis on clinical trials to assess the effect of fiber on urea and creatinine as\n      classical markers of a state of uremia in individuals with CKD. We hypothesize that\n      increasing fiber intakes will improve urea and creatinine levels in individuals with CKD."
