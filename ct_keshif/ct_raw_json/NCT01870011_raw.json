Protecting the kidney against I/R\n      injury and maintaining renal function  during renal transplant surgery is therefore very\n      important in order to improve post-operative outcome. This purpose of this study is to\n      investigate whether propofol anesthesia done in both kidney donors and recipients during\n      deceased brain dead donor kidney transplantation is effective in reducing renal I/R injury\n      via its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties and improve post-transplant outcome\n      compared to desflurane anesthesia."
