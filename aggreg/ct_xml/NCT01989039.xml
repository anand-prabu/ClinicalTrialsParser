  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      FPCOS is associated with an adverse cardiometabolic profile, consisting of increased total
      or central adiposity, increased insulin resistance and abnormal glucose metabolism.
      Low-grade chronic inflammation predicts cardiovascular outcomes and is observed in women
      with PCOS. However, obesity is also associated with increased inflammatory markers. Obesity
      is per se associated with increased adipose expression and plasma levels of leptin, lower
      expression of adiponectin, and elevated inflammatory markers. To study the insulin
      resistance、inflammatory markers and cardiovascular risk in women with PCOS, body weight
      status should be considered. Investigator therefore conduct this retrospective study to
      evaluate the insulin resistance、inflammatory and cardiovascular markers between PCOS and
      non-PCOS among obese and non-obese women.
