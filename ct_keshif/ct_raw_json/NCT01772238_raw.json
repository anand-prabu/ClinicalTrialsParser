The single dosage was 10 ml of suspension.\n\n      The study was prospective, open-label, randomized, crossover, single dose, with 02\n      treatments, 02 sequences and 02 periods, under fasting conditions.\n\n      The population was composed of 35 healthy volunteers, both genders, adults between 18-50\n      years.\n\n      The comparative bioavailability of the two formulations was evaluated based in statistical\n      comparisons of relevant pharmacokinetic parameters, obtained from data of drug\n      concentrations in blood."
