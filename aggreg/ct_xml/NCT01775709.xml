  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Otitis media is the most common illness in children and 5% to 10% of their symptom cause by
      fluids in their middle ear . The OME can cause hearing loss included poor development of
      speech and poor communication.

      The surgical procedure is considered simple and relatively safe, but several complications
      may occur after Pressure Equalizing tube insertion. The most prevalent complications are
      otorrhea, biofilm and formation of retraction pockets. Otorrhea occurs in 30% to 83% of
      children with tube and is mainly due bacterial contamination of the middle ear either from
      external ear canal or impaired Eustachian tube. Swimming can facilitate the entry of
      bacteria into the middle ear from the ear canal through the PE tubes, and this assumption is
      reinforced by the statistically significant association between the rate of otorrhea and the
      non-utilization of ear plugs in children who swim (from 47% in children who used ear plugs
      to 56% in those who did not).

      The researcher at Beckman Laser Institute, University of California, Irvine, develops new
      medical tool device call biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube which can stop air passage
      and pressure equalization instantly, and can prevents  water into the middle ear cavity.
      evaluate and compare the efficacy of a biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube that enables
      air passage and pressure equalization almost instantly, while prevents the entrance of
      fluids, specially water, into the middle ear cavity.

      The biocompatible Pressure Equalizing tube can reduce the rate of postoperative otorrhea,air
      passage between outside and middle ear cavity,prevents formation of retraction pockets in TM
      and swimming with lower risk of  otorrhea.
