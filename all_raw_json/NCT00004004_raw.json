Patients are stratified according\n      to concurrent use of anticonvulsant drugs that induce cytochrome P450 (yes vs no drugs or\n      modest-induction drugs).\n\n        -  Phase I: Patients receive oral procarbazine once daily for 5 days. Treatment repeats\n           every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 6 patients receive escalating doses of oral procarbazine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.\n\n        -  Phase II: Once the MTD is determined, patients receive procarbazine as in Phase I.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24-35 patients will be accrued for this study."
