The PLATIN trial investigates an intensity-modulated radiotherapy\n      of the pelvic lymphatic drainage that spares small bowel, bladder and rectum. A higher dose\n      is given during each session to the prostate or the prostate bed and to confirmed lymph node\n      metastases. Prior to radiotherapy, two months of neoadjuvant antihormonal treatment are\n      required, and continuation during radiotherapy and for a further two years are strongly\n      recommended."
