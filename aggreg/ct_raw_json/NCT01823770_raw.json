Sympathetic overactivity is associated with PLMS with increased pulse rate and blood\n      pressure coincident with PLMS. PLMS-related repetitive nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations\n      could contribute to the risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke in patients\n      with RLS, especially in the elderly. Several studies already reported that dopaminergic\n      agonists reduce the severity of RLS and the PLMS index.\n\n      Do dopaminergic agonists reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases and associated autonomic\n      dysfunctions in patients with RLS? Nocturnal BP (blood pressure) decline has major clinical\n      implications, and the loss of normal reduction in BP during sleep is associated with high\n      risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.\n\n      The main aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of rotigotine patch treatment on\n      validated cardiovascular risk factors ambulatory BP during night, day and night-to-day\n      ratio, and endothelial function in patients with idiopathic RLS compared to placebo."
