We have also demonstrated that DAC mediated target gene expression and\n      apoptosis can be significantly enhanced in cancer cells by subsequent exposure to the\n      histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor Depsipeptide FK228 (DP). Furthermore, we have\n      demonstrated that following DAC, or DAC/DP exposure, cancer cells can be recognized by\n      cytolytic T cells specific for the cancer testis antigen, NY-FSO-1.\n\n      This Phase I study will evaluate gene induction in thoracic oncology patients mediated by\n      sequential DAC/DP treatment with or without the selective COX-2 inhibitor, celecoxib.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Evaluation of the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of continuous 72-hour intravenous Decitabine\n      (DAC) infusion followed by 4-hour intravenous infusion of Depsipeptide FK228 (DP) with or\n      without oral celecoxib in patients with unresectable cancers involving the lungs or pleura.\n\n      Analysis of NY-ESO-1, p16 and p21 expression in cancer specimens before and after sequential\n      Decitabine/Depsipeptide treatment.\n\n      Analysis of serologic response to NY-ESO-1 before and after sequential drug treatment.\n\n      Analysis of apoptosis in tumor biopsies before and after sequential Decitabine/Depsipeptide\n      treatment.\n\n      Refinement of laser capture microdissection and micro-array techniques for analysis of gene\n      expression profiles in tumor tissues.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Patients with histologically or cytologically proven primary small cell or non-small cell\n      lung cancers, advanced esophageal cancers, pleural mesotheliomas, or non-thoracic cancers\n      with metastases to the lungs or pleura.\n\n      Patients must be 18 years or older with an ECOG performance status of 0-2 and have adequate\n      pulmonary reserve evidenced by FEV1 and DLCO greater than the 30% predicted, and less than\n      50 mm Hg and p02 greater than 60 mm Hg on room air ABG.\n\n      Patients must have a platelet count greater than 100.000. an ANC equal to or greater than\n      1500 without transfusion or cytokine support, a normal PT, and adequate hepatic function as\n      evidenced by a total bilirubin of  less than 1.5 x upper limits of normal. Serum creatinine\n      less than or equal to 1.6 mg/ml or the creatinine clearance must be greater than 70\n      ml/min/1.73m(2).\n\n      Design:\n\n      Patients with inoperable malignancies involving lungs or pleura will receive two cycles of\n      72-hour intravenous infusion of Decitabine followed by 4-hour Depsipeptide infusion using a\n      Phase I study design.\n\n      Decitabine will be administered by continuous infusion on days 1-4, and patient cohorts will\n      receive escalating doses of Depsipeptide administered on day 4 and day 10 of a 34 day cycle.\n\n      Once the MTD and toxicities for sequential DAC/DP have been identified, additional cohorts\n      of 6 lung cancer patients and 6 mesothelioma patients will receive sequential DAC/DP\n      administered at the MTD as outlined above with celecoxib (400mg bid) administered on days\n      4-34 of each treatment cycle, as a means to enhance target cell apoptosis and facilitate\n      anti-tumor immune recognition/response.\n\n      Pharmacokinetics, systemic toxicity, and response to therapy will be recorded. Tumor\n      biopsies will be obtained prior to, and after therapy to evaluate expression of NY-ESO-1\n      tumor antigen, as well as p16 and p21 tumor suppressor genes, which are known to be\n      modulated by chromatin structure. Additional analysis will be undertaken to evaluate the\n      extent of apoptosis in tumor tissues, and to determine if immune recognition of NY-ESO-1 can\n      be demonstrated following sequential DAC?DP +/- celecoxib treatment.\n\n      As the exact set of comparisons and analyses to be performed will be determined following\n      completion of the trial and will be based on limited numbers of patients, the analyses will\n      be considered exploratory and hypothesis generating rather than definitive.\n\n      A total of 40 patients will be enrolled."
