            "textblock": "The proposed trial will address two clinically important questions for younger patients with\n      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML): the optimal dose of daunorubicin in induction\n      therapy and the necessity of a second induction cycle in patients with a good response after\n      the first induction. In the first part of the trial, patients will be randomly assigned to\n      receive either 90 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin in the first induction cycle in addition to\n      standard dosed cytarabine. The primary endpoint is the rate of good responders. Assuming a\n      superiority of 90 mg/m2, 436 patients will be recruited. In the second part of the trial,\n      good responders will be randomized to receive either a second or no further induction cycle.\n      Assuming a non-inferiority of the single induction regarding the rate of complete\n      remissions, a number of 360 patients will be included in the second part. Secondary outcomes\n      will be relapse-free survival, overall survival and minimal residual disease kinetics.\n      Patients will be recruited in about 40 treatment centers of the Study Alliance Leukemia\n      study group over a period of 40 months. The results will be of great clinical relevance:\n      First, the study could facilitate the establishment or confirmation of the optimal\n      daunorubicin dose. Furthermore, in case of a non-inferiority of single versus double\n      induction in good responders, about half of all younger AML patients could be spared a\n      second induction cycle, leading to a reduction in treatment-related mortality, fewer days\n      spent in hospital and improved quality of life."
