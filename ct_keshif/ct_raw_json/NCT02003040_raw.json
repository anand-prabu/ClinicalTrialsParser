            "textblock": "Rehospitalizations for heart failure have been linked to poor clinical outcomes, rates\n      remain high despite different attempts to decrease them . Clinical indicators of volume\n      congestion at time of discharge are associated with increased rates of readmission .\n      Clinical evaluation of volume status remains the gold standard in determination of readiness\n      and timing of hospital discharge, however identification of persistent congestion might\n      prove difficult   .\n\n      Assessment of the right atrial pressure can be done non-invasively at the bedside; however,\n      precision and accuracy of this method are variable . Echocardiography is a valuable tool in\n      the estimation of elevated central pressure , this, however is time consuming and requires\n      trained personnel. While invasive measurements provide accurate estimation of central venous\n      pressure, it is an impractical approach in most patients, notwithstanding the risks\n      associated with the insertion of a catheter into the central circulation .\n\n      Since a significant proportion of readmitted patients return to hospital with congestive\n      symptoms, attempts have been made to improve our ability to assess volume status   . Current\n      clinical evidence suggests that BNP-guided management of patients with congestive heart\n      failure can decrease all-cause mortality and heart failure rehospitalization.  However,\n      biological variation for natriuretic peptides is high , and optimal targets are difficult to\n      determine in individual patients.\n\n      The Mespere Venus 1000 system is a non-invasive tool that has previously shown reliable\n      correlation and accuracy with central venous pressure obtained invasively in the\n      catheterization laboratory  and good correlation with jugular venous pressure at the\n      bedside."
