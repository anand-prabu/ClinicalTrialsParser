            "textblock": "Prasugrel and ticagrelor were both associated with a significant reduction in the risk of\n      MACE in patients undergoing PCI for an ACS, mostly through a reduced stent thrombosis. The\n      1-year relative risk reduction (RRR) of definite of probable stent thrombosis in patients\n      receiving a DES were fairly different in TRITON-TIMI 38 and PLATO trials. The incidence of\n      DES thrombosis is largely variable according to different lesion settings. We aim to verify\n      the translation of the postulated different reduction in thrombosis rate among various P2Y12\n      inhibitors (clopidogrel, prasugrel and ticagrelor) in a high-risk setting such as the\n      presence of \u22652 overlapping DES in CTO and bifurcation lesions."

Death from any cause.\n\n        2.

Levels of total creatine kinase and the creatine\n           kinase MB fraction will be measured in all patients between 12 and 24 hours after PCI.\n\n        3. Stent thrombosis, defined as definite, probable or possible3 following the Academic\n           Research Consortium.\n\n      Assuming a 1-year rate of death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis of 12% among\n      patients with \"overlapping DES\" taking ticagrelor, an overall sample size of 578 patients in\n      each group would allow to detect a reduction of 40% in the occurrence of the combined\n      primary end-point among prasugrel as compared to ticagrelor patients. By estimating a 5%\n      drop-off rate during the 1-year follow-up, 603 patients will have to be enrolled in each arm\n      and therefore a total of 1810 patients will be screened in the study."
