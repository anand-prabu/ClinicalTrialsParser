            "textblock": "Narrative: Tobacco smoking remains the single biggest cause of premature death in the United\n      States and the leading cause of cancer and death from cancer. There is therefore an urgent\n      need to find effective but practical ways of helping smokers to quit and stay quit. This\n      randomized trial aims to evaluate two promising methods of helping smokers to quit and to\n      stay quit.\n\n      Design: This is a randomized controlled smoking cessation trial with two stages.\n\n      In Stage 1, 225 smokers will be recruited and at assessment they will be randomly allocated\n      to receiving feedback on their \"Lung Age\" as estimated by their Forced Expiratory volume of\n      air from lungs in one second (FEV1), and exhaled carbon-monoxide (CO) (Intervention group 1)\n      or to have these measured but not fed back in a manner designed to enhance motivation to\n      quit (Control group 1). All participants will be provided with group counseling (6 weekly\n      sessions, with the target Quit Date on the day of the second group meeting), and transdermal\n      nicotine patches.\n\n      Main outcome measure: Stage 1, Past week tobacco abstinence biochemically validated by\n      exhaled CO < 10 ppm at visit 7 (4 weeks after Target Quit Date).\n\n      In Stage 2 (starting visit 7), all participants attending visit 7 (28 days after their\n      Target Quit Date), will be randomly allocated to receiving either the Forever Free relapse\n      prevention materials (Intervention 2) http://www.smokefree.gov/pdf.html or the Surgeon\n      General's Guide \"How Tobacco Smoke Causes Disease\" (Control 2)\n      http://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/sgr/2010/consumer_booklet/index.htm.\n\n      All randomized participants will receive a follow-up phone call a week later to remind them\n      to read and use the materials they have been given, and will attend a follow up visit (8), 6\n      months after their initial Target Quit Date.\n\n      Main outcome measure: Stage 2.  Among those who have not smoked in the previous week at\n      visit 7, sustained tobacco abstinence (including no tobacco use in prior 7 days), validated\n      by exhaled CO < 10 ppm at the 6 month visit(8) AND not smoking for any 7 consecutive days\n      during the prior 5 months (definition of a relapse in this study).\n\n      Hypothesis: Smokers who are provided with lung age feedback at assessment will have higher\n      quit rates 28 days after the target quit date."

Participants must report smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day for the previous 6\n             months AND sometimes smoke at least 10 cigarettes in one day.\n\n          2. Participants must want to quit smoking and be ready to make a quit attempt within the\n             next 30 days.\n\n          3. Participants must plan to remain in the intervention catchment area for at least 8\n             months.\n\n          4. Age >18 years.  Nicotine patches are not currently approved by FDA for those under\n             age 18.\n\n          5. Participants must be willing to attend and provide data at the 8 study visits,\n             including an assessment visit at which a blood sample will be drawn, 6 group\n             treatment sessions, respond to follow-up telephone calls, and  a 6-month follow-up\n             visit.\n\n          6. Participants must be able to read and write in English.\n\n          7. Nicotine is known to be harmful to the developing human fetus at the recommended\n             therapeutic dose.  For this reason women of child-bearing potential must agree to use\n             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)\n             prior to study entry and for the standard duration of transdermal nicotine therapy\n             (10 weeks).  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or\n             her partner is participating in this study, the patient should inform the treating\n             clinician immediately.\n\n          8. Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\n             -\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. A history of severe allergic reaction while using a nicotine patch.\n\n          2. Currently using a drug/medicine as an aid to smoking cessation (e.g. Zyban, Chantix,\n             nicotine replacement).\n\n          3. Currently pregnant, trying to get pregnant, or nursing, because nicotine is known to\n             be harmful to the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose.\n\n          4. Had a heart attack, stroke, continuing arrhythmias or angina (chest pains) or\n             abnormal electrocardiogram within the past 4 weeks.\n\n          5. Uncontrolled serious mental illness or substance abuse.\n\n          6. Uses non-cigarette tobacco products and does not plan to quit all tobacco.\n\n             -"

Non-smokers typically have an exhaled carbon-monoxide level of 0-4 parts per million, whereas smokers typically have a CO level of 8-50 ppm.
