Those who enter the Study Phase are then assigned by chance to one of\n      two groups. One group will continue on the SRI medication and the other group will\n      discontinue the SRI gradually over 4-6 weeks as it is replaced with a placebo (sugar pill).\n      Neither patients nor study staff will know which group a participant is in.
