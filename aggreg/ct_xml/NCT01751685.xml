  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to conduct a randomized, controlled trial among 100 men and women aged 60 or
      older with hyperkyphosis to an exercise intervention that includes kyphosis-specific spinal
      muscle strengthening exercises compared to a usual care control group. The study will be
      conducted in five waves,with 10 participants in the exercise intervention and 10
      participants in the control group in each wave.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experimental interventions will be provided in small groups meeting three sessions per
      week for 6 months. At baseline and 6 months after the intervention, we will measure
      kyphosis, physical function, spine muscle strength and density, and quality of life. We will
      assess the effect of the intervention on the co-primary outcomes of kyphosis, modified
      Physical Performance Test (PPT) and gait speed measured as change over 6 months. We will
      also assess the effect of the intervention on secondary outcomes of physical function and
      health-related quality of life, measured as change in Timed Up and Go, Timed Loaded
      Standing, Six-Minute Timed Walk, the Scoliosis Research Society SRS-30, PROMISe Global
      Health and physical function and PACE questionnaires.  Furthermore, we will investigate
      whether changes in kyphosis, spinal muscle strength and/or density mediate the effect of the
      intervention on change in physical function. After the 6-month intervention, both groups
      will continue their usual activity and we will assess the durability of the effects of the
      intervention at 1-year follow-up.

    <description>Investigator developed the intervention protocol (Kyphosis-specific spinal exercises) of targeted spine exercises during our pilot study based upon the literature and clinical experience.We standardized the protocol with a written script and a video. Each exercise session will be preceded by light aerobic activity, ended with cool-down and stretching the neck, chest and all extremities. All participants will be carefully monitored to ensure that all exercises will be performed slowly, with correct body alignment and technique to minimize risk of injury.</description>
