  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated macrophages, present in excess during natural inflammatory responses, bear the
      potential to kill and eradicate cancer cells. Macrophage activation has been demonstrated to
      require the serum-borne vitamin D binding protein (known as Gc protein), as well as B and T
      lymphocytes. However, in various cancer patients the Gc protein is deglycosylated by serum
      Î±-N-acetyl galactosaminidase (Nagalase) secreted from cancer cells. This deglycosylated Gc
      protein, lacking the N-acetylgalactosamine monosaccharide, cannot be converted to its form
      of Macrophage Activating Factor, leading to immunosuppression rather than Macrophage
      activation against cancer cells.

      Efranat has developed cancer immunotherapy based on Macrophage Activating Factor produced
      from natural Gc protein extracted from FDA approved healthy human plasma.

      In this phase I study, the treatment is given as Intramuscular, once-weekly injection of
      GcMAF, for two courses, while each course is comprised of 4 injections.

      The investigational treatment is expected to enhance immune response, thereby, improve
      patient's well being, quality of life and disease control.

      Primary objectives:

        1. To determine the safety and tolerability of GcMAF and to define the Maximal Tolerated
           Dose (MTD)

        2. To identify the Dose Limiting Toxicity (DLT) of GcMAF

      Secondary objectives:

        1. To determine the 'Recommended Phase 2 Dose' (RP2D) based on MTD data, immunological and
           pharmacodynamic markers.

        2. To explore the preliminary efficacy of GcMAF in advanced solid tumors, considering the
           'Immune-related Response Criteria' (irRC), the 'Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid
           Tumors' (RECIST) and blood levels of tumor-related markers known to reflect tumor
           burden.

      Exploratory objectives:

        1. To assess levels of immune-related factors in peripheral blood, reflecting induced
           immunological activities.

        2. To immunohistochemically assess and compare tumor derived tissue samples Pre and post
           treatment. To analyze the infiltration of different population of cells into the tumor
           bed.

      Part 1:

      Eligible subjects will be assigned, successively in order of accrual, to one of the three
      cohorts, to receive intramuscular (IM) injections of GcMAF, once weekly for two courses of
      treatment. Each course will consist of 4 injections with one week intervals (total: 8 weeks
      of treatment).

      Dose escalation will only proceed in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) during
      course 1. For this purpose, each cohort will only begin its first course of GcMAF when the
      cohort preceding it has successfully completed its first 4-week treatment course without any
      signs of DLT. During this first course, should 1/3 patients experience DLT, dose escalation
      for the next cohort will not be authorized; the next cohort will receive the same dose as
      the one preceding it. If 2 patients or more of all patients treated with a given dose
      develop DLT, dose escalation will be halted and no more patients will be treated at the DLT
      dose. The value of MTD will be defined as the GcMAF dose below the dose at which DLT was
      seen for  at least 2 subjects. Upon determination of the MTD, an additional cohort will be
      opened (confirmatory cohort) and treated with two courses of that dose.

      Part 2:

      Once MTD is established, or, when the last cohort completes its first course of treatment
      without an established MTD, an additional cohort will be opened in order to treat up to
      additional subjects with a selected dose of GcMAF already confirmed to be safe in part 1 of
      the study.

      Continued treatment after completion of course 2 will be as per the investigator's
      discretion. Patient follow-up will continue for 12 months after start of treatment (Day 1).
      Patients for whom progressive disease (PD) is observed prior to completion of those two
      courses will be followed up only until PD.
