Clinical outcome of right ventricular pacing can be influenced by multiple factors.\n       An important factor seems to be optimal lead positioning. Data regarding left ventricular\n      function impaired by lead positioning is insufficient. The aim of the present study\n      therefore is to compare right ventricular apical pacing (RVAP) with right ventricular septal\n      pacing (RVSP). Outcome measurements are echocardiographic features, magnetic resonance\n      imaging and clinical outcome."
