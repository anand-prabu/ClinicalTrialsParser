Treatment repeats every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete\n      response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 5-9\n      months."
