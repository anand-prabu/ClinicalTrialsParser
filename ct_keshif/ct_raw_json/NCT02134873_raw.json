            "textblock": "Recent studies show that babies in hospital undergo an average of 4 to 5 painful procedures,\n      such as heel lances, every day. Sucrose (sugar water) has been shown to be effective for\n      reducing babies' pain during painful procedures. Unfortunately, sucrose is not used as often\n      as it could be to reduce babies' pain. This may be due to lack of certainty about the least\n      effective amount of sucrose to use and concerns about the long-term effects of repeated use\n      of sucrose on infant development. Factors within the hospital units where babies receive\n      care may also influence caregivers' decisions to use sucrose. In this research the\n      investigators will conduct two main studies. In the first study the investigators will\n      determine the lowest amount of sucrose needed to manage babies."

Infants will be eligible for Trial 1, the non-opioid trial, if they have not\n             received any opioids within 24 hours prior to the heel lance. Infants will be\n             eligible for Trial 2, the opioid trial, if they are currently receiving an opioid\n             infusion. Furthermore, observation of the procedures will be timed to ensure that no\n             additional sucrose doses are provided within the previous 4 hours.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Infants will be excluded if they have a contraindication for sucrose administration\n             (e.g., unable to swallow, pharmacologically muscle relaxed, or heavily sedated) due\n             to safety concerns and/or inability to assess pain accurately (e.g., unable to\n             clearly view the infant's face)."
