Research has demonstrated that\n      behavioral interventions, such as Pivotal Response Training (PRT), lead to improvements in\n      the core symptoms of autism. Researchers have begun to develop strategies to investigate the\n      effectiveness of combining a parent training program teaching parents how to implement PRT\n      with in-home, therapist-implemented treatment. To determine the effectiveness of a PRT-P, it\n      will be compared to a delayed treatment group (DTG) by conducting a randomized controlled\n      24-week trial. This research will allow us to help in the development of therapeutic\n      approaches that can meet the increasing service demands for families. We hope that\n      investigating interventions that aim to improve core deficits will aid clinicians in\n      providing better care for children with autism."
