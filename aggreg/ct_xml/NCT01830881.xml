  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the level of pain, anxiety and side effects that
      women experience with a surgical abortion and the effect that the anti-anxiety medication,
      midazolam, might have when used along with ibuprofen and a paracervical block (PCB) instead
      of the standard pain treatment of only ibuprofen and a PCB.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women in the study will be randomized to receive either midazolam or placebo. Every
      participant will still receive the standard oral medications for pain (ibuprofen) as well as
      an injection of numbing medicine (lidocaine) near the cervix (PCB). The co-primary outcomes
      are patient perception of anxiety and pain with uterine aspiration reported on a 100 mm
      visual analogue scale (VAS). Secondary outcomes include reported anxiety and pain at time
      points before, during, and after the procedure, as well as subject satisfaction with anxiety
      and pain control and overall abortion experience. Due to the dose-dependent anterograde
      amnesic effect of midazolam, we will also investigate the effects on memory and recall,
      which has not previously been studied. In addition, we will also collect data on side
      effects frequently associated with oral midazolam such as nausea and sleepiness. Women will
      also be responsible for completing a one-page survey 1-3 days after the procedure visit and
      return it by mail using a pre-addressed and stamped envelope.
