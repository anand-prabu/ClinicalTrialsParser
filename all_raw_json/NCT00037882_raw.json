            "textblock": "It has been shown that patients who experience complete hematologic or at least a partial\n      cytogenetic response to interferon will have improved survival times.  In addition, evidence\n      exists that even patients who do not demonstrate a cytogenetic response to interferon\n      treatment can still benefit from treatment, in terms of survival, compared to patients not\n      treated with interferon.  This indicates that if a patient is better able to tolerate\n      interferon, he or she may have improved survival even without cytogenetic response.\n      Preliminary studies suggest that PEG-Intron is more convenient for patients (administered\n      once weekly rather than daily), is better tolerated than interferon, and can produce\n      hematologic remission in interferon-a resistant patients.  Phase II studies are needed to\n      ascertain the overall hematologic and cytogenetic response rates to PEG-Intron in such\n      patients."
