In\n      particular, DSMB will check the periodic safety reports of serious adverse events, the\n      primary or secondary graft failure and treated related mortality (TRM) data generated by the\n      Data Management Center. A safety report will be generated every 30 enrolled patients\n      completed 100 days of follow-up.\n\n      The population for analysis in the trial will be the Intention to Treat (ITT) population.\n      All patients enrolled in the study will be included in the ITT analysis.\n\n      This study will explore the feasibility, safety and efficacy of allogeneic stem cell\n      transplantation from unrelated, cord-blood and haploidentical donor in patients with an\n      active leukemia. Due to the lack of detailed information from literature and the absence of\n      alternative curative options in this patient population, criteria for sample size assessment\n      do not refer to a formal statistical power calculation. Therefore, GITMO will promote\n      enrollment of all patients with active leukemia eligible to allogeneic SCT in all Italian\n      centres with the aim to collect outcome variables in ITT in the widest and most\n      representative cohort of this specific patient population.\n\n      The choice of 80 patients transplanted is based on feasibility reasons and the expected\n      patient population with these characteristics referred to the main Italian Transplant\n      Centres in two year. GITMO survey data on transplant activity points to an estimated accrual\n      of 40 patients per year over a 24 months enrolment period. Criteria for defining sample size\n      do not follow statistical power estimates in order to demonstrate difference between the\n      alternative donor options."

In studying relapse, sometimes the interest is not only in the estimation of the cumulative incidence curve, but also in the estimation of the hazard ratios for comparing groups of patients. It is therefore common to apply also a survival (Cox or parametric) model considering relapse as an event and death without relapse as a censoring (the response time is given by the minimum between time to relapse and time to death without relapse; as usual, a patient who is alive and free of relapse is also censored).",

By definition, patients alive (relapse/progression-free) at day 100 without having experienced aGvHD are censored. If the dates of onset are missing for the majority of patients, the analysis can focus only on the occurrence of aGvHD, which is analyzed by a logistic regression model.

Since cGvHD is defined only for patients surviving at least 100 days, the survival model should consider a left truncation at 100 days; alternatively, the time of occurrence of cGvHD must be computed from 100 days. If information on the timing of cGvHD is not available, the outcome considered is the occurrence, and the statistical model to be used is the logistic regression. Only patients surviving at least 100 days are considered to be at risk of developing cGvHD, therefore the analysis must be restricted to these patients.
