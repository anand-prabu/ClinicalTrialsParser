Currently, free testing for sexually transmitted diseases is only being performed\n      in urine samples. Investigators hypothesize that the rates of both gonorrhea and chlamydia\n      will be higher when testing includes more than one anatomical site (rectum and oropharynx).\n\n      The aim of the study is to estimate the rates of asymptomatic Chlamydia and/or Gonorrhea in\n      the oropharynx, rectum and urethra (urine) of HIV infected men who have sex with men at the\n      specialty care center of the University of Nebraska Medical Center and compare to the rates\n      in Douglas County, using nucleic acid amplification tests."
