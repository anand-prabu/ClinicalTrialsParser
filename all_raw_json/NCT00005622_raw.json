It also helps stop the patient's immune\n      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the stem cells from a related or\n      unrelated donor, that closely matches the patient's blood, are infused into the patient they\n      may help the patient's bone marrow to make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells,\n      and platelets.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor bone marrow transplant works in\n      treating patients with leukemia, lymphoma, or nonmalignant hematologic disorders."

If CNS involvement is documented, patients receive a second dose of\n      methotrexate 48 hours later followed by oral leucovorin calcium every 6 hours for 4 doses.\n      Patients with ALL and/or CNS involvement receive intrathecal methotrexate every other week\n      for 12 weeks after transplant.\n\n      Patients with prior CNS involvement receive radiotherapy for 2.5 weeks prior to transplant.\n      Patients with ALL receive total body radiotherapy for 5 consecutive days prior to\n      transplant.\n\n      Patients are followed once a week for 3 months, and then monthly for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study over 6 years."
