            "textblock": "The HELP- MOM study is an observational study that seeks to identify the major determinants\n      of morbidity induced by postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) in the short and medium term. Even if\n      PPH remains the leading cause of death in the world and in France , its main impact in\n      so-called developed countries is not so much maternal mortality ( which is very small ) but\n      induced morbidity.Data from the literature suggest that in a number of cases, PPH is\n      associated with cardiac abnormalities. The nature of the abnormalities, their potential\n      impact on the functioning of the cardiovascular system of women and their evolution over\n      time (possibility of persistent sequelae) are not known. Similarly, it is known that the\n      postpartum period of normal pregnancy followed by a normal delivery is at risk of\n      psychological disorders in the mother. The PPH is a very serious situation where sometimes\n      the vital prognosis of the mother was committed. Again, determining the exact nature and\n      consequences of psychological harm secondary PPH are not known. Finally, fertility and the\n      risk of recurrence after an episode PPH are also poorly understood. Outside hysterectomy\n      hemostasis which permanently affects the fertility of the patient, the severity and type of\n      management of PPH most likely affect fertility. Only a long-term monitoring could help\n      address this issue. Thus, HELP MOM - study aims to address these issues. To do this, HELP\n      MOM, was divided into two sub- studies : 1) HELP-MOM 1 \"multidisciplinaire\" which\n      corresponds to the cohort of patients in whom psychological state will be studied in the\n      immediate waning PPH then during a 6 months through appropriate questionnaires , 2 )\n      HELP-MOM 2 \"cardio\" that corresponds to the cohort of patients who experienced a cardiac\n      abnormality in the initial management and will therefore be included in a cardiac\n      monitoring."
