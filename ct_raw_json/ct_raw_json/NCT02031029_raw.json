We will investigate whether those who are diagnosed with\n      prostate cancer already in beforehand have an increased degree of masculine stress (\n      experience of not living up to their own perception of the ideal man ) and neuroticism in\n      the typology. We will examine different personality and QoL questionnaires for patients with\n      elevated PSA, and compare those whose clinical assessment later reveals prostate cancer,\n      with three control groups: 1) men with elevated PSA who are not diagnosed with prostate\n      cancer, 2) men with normal PSA treated for benign prostate enlargement and 3) patient with\n      substantial risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) who undergo colonoscopy, with regard to\n      increased level of masculine stress and the personality trait neuroticism."
