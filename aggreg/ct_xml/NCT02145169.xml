  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To describe the safety and efficacy of nitrous oxide during ketamine administration for the
      prevention of emergence reaction during Emergency Department procedural sedation and
      analgesia in adults. Drugs such as fentanyl, midazolam, and propofol are widely used in
      emergency departments for procedural sedation and analgesia because they have a rapid onset
      and short duration of action. Unfortunately, all of these agents may cause respiratory
      depression, particularly when combined with other sedative agents, administered in large
      doses, or given to patients with underlying respiratory diseases. Nitrous oxide use during
      ketamine administration may be an ideal combination for the prevention of emergence reaction
      in adults sedated in the ED.  Like ketamine, nitrous oxide has an excellent
      cardio-respiratory profile as well as some analgesic and anxiolytic qualities. The anxiety
      and pain surrounding procedural sedation is not limited to the procedure itself, but the
      elapsed time from the time the patient enters the ED to the time spent in preparation for
      the procedure can be significant and lead to increased anxiety, which may exacerbate
      emergence reactions in adults. Using nitrous oxide before ketamine administration may
      mitigate this. While midazolam has shown efficacy in reducing emergence reactions in adults
      sedated with ketamine, the investigators believe that inhaled nitrous oxide may be
      equivalent to midazolam, with a better cardio-respiratory profile.
