    <description>The Urgent PC Neuromodulation System (Uroplasty, Inc., Minnetonka, MN, USA), device, is an easily administered neuromodulation system designed to deliver retrograde access to the sacral nerve through percutaneous electrical stimulation of the tibial nerve. This method of treatment is referred to as percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS).</description>
