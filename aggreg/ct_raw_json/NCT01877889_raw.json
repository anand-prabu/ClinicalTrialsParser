Part 2\n      will be a double-blind (neither the investigator nor volunteers know the identity of the\n      assigned treatment), randomized (the treatment is assigned by chance), 2-period crossover\n      study (all volunteers will receive each of the 2 treatments but in a different order) with a\n      two-stage sequential group design.\n\n      Approximately 34 healthy volunteers will be participating in the first stage. After all the\n      participants of the first stage will complete Part 2, and the results are analyzed, based on\n      the first stage outcomes the study will be either terminated or will proceed to the second\n      stage, which will be conducted using the same study method as in the first stage.\n\n      Potentially, up to 30 volunteers will participate in the second stage. A total number of\n      participants in Part 2 will be up to 64.\n\n      Volunteers assigned to Treatment Sequence 1 will receive 10 mg of dapagliflozin once daily\n      for 4 consecutive days (Period 1), and after a 12- to 14-day washout period (with no\n      medication), 300 mg of canagliflozin once daily for 4 days (Period 2). Volunteers assigned\n      to Treatment Sequence 2 will receive 300 mg of canagliflozin once daily for 4 days (Period\n      1), and after a 12- to 14-day washout period, 10 mg of dapagliflozin once daily for 4\n      consecutive days (Period 2). The total study duration for each volunteer in Part 2 will be\n      up to approximately 65 days (including a screening phase, a baseline phase, a double-blind\n      treatment phase, a washout period, and a follow-up phase).\n\n      Volunteers can participate in Part 1 or Part 2 of the study, but not in both parts.\n      Canagliflozin and dapagliflozin are used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus."
