  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of the current study is to examine whether a high intake of regular-fat
      cheeses (Danbo and Cheddar) affect blood lipids differently than an isocaloric intake of
      either other fatty animal food products or of starchy carbohydrates. Furthermore, effects on
      fat digestibility, blood pressure, anthropometry, bile acid metabolism and insulin
      sensitivity is investigated.

      To do this, a randomized crossover intervention study with 3x14 days full diet periods
      (cheese diet, meat diet or carb diet)will be conducted  in 16 postmenopausal women. Between
      the diet periods there will be at least 14 days of wash-out where the subjects eat their
      habitual diets. Fasting blood samples will be drawn before and after the diet periods, and
      also a non-fasting blood sample will be drawn after the diet periods. Furthermore, total
      feces is collected the last 5 days of each diet period.

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The CARB diet will be a low-fat diet where cheese is replaced by starchy carbohydrates and lean meat. The CARB diet will have the same protein content (15 E%) and quality as the CHEESE and MEAT diet but a lower fat content (approx. 25 E%) and a correspondingly higher carbohydrate content (approx. 60 E%).</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>CHEESE diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The CHEESE diet will contain cheese in amounts corresponding to 120 g/day on a 10 MJ diet (approx. 1.8 MJ from cheese). A high dose of cheese is chosen to provoke effects within this short time frame. The cheese types used in this study will be Danbo (45+) and Cheddar (50+) which will be supplied in equal amounts. The CHEESE diet will have the same macronutrient composition as that of the average Danish diet (15 E% from protein, max 35 E% from fat, and max 15 E% from saturated fat).</description>

    <arm_group_label>MEAT diet</arm_group_label>

    <description>The MEAT diet will be a diet without dairy products. In this diet cheese is mainly replaced by high-fat mixed meat products to achieve saturated fat content and protein quality similar to that of the CHEESE diet. The MEAT diet will have the same macronutrient composition as that of the average Danish diet (15 E% from protein, max 35 E% from fat, and max 15 E% from saturated fat).</description>
