        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosing
             regimens and procedures, report for regularly scheduled study visits, and reliably
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications

          -  Subjects chronically infected with HCV genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6, as documented by
             positive HCV RNA at screening

          -  HCV-Treatment-naive subjects

          -  HCV treatment-experienced subjects are eligible. All permitted prior anti-HCV
             therapies must be discontinued or completed at least 12 weeks prior to screening

          -  Subjects must have an HCV RNA ≥ 10,000 IU/mL at Screening

          -  Subjects must have HIV-1 infection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-defining opportunistic
             infections within 12 weeks prior to study entry (AIDS-defining opportunistic
             infections as defined by the CDC)

          -  Subjects infected with HIV-2

          -  Liver or any other organ transplant (including hematopoietic stem cell transplants)
             other than cornea and hair

          -  Current or known history of cancer (except in situ carcinoma of the cervix or
             adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin) within 5 years prior
             to screening

          -  Documented or suspected hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), as evidenced by previously
             obtained imaging studies or liver biopsy (or on a screening imaging study/liver
             biopsy if this was performed)

          -  Evidence of decompensated liver disease including, but not limited to, radiologic
             criteria,a history or presence of ascites, bleeding varices, or hepatic
             encephalopathy
