  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 study. The goal of this study is to test the safety of combining the drugs
      erlotinib and ruxolitinib at different dose levels. The investigators want to find out what
      effects, good and/or bad, taking erlotinib and ruxolitinib has on the patients and on lung
      cancer. Erlotinib and ruxolitinib are FDA approved for other indications, but the use of
      erlotinib and ruxolitinib together has not been studied before and is not FDA-approved.

    <description>Phase I The study will follow a standard 3+3 dose escalation trial design. Three to six patients will need to be enrolled at each dose level and assessed for DLT for 1 full cycle (21 days) before a dose escalation decision is made.
Phase II Once the MTD has been determined, patients will be enrolled in the phase 2 portion of the single-arm, two-stage, open-label study to determine efficacy of erlotinib and ruxolitinib. Patients will receive erlotinib and ruxolitinib at the MTD established in the phase I portion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pathologic evidence of advanced (non-operable or metastatic) biopsy-proven stage IV
             or recurrent lung cancer reviewed at MSKCC.

          -  a documented somatic activating mutation in EGFR (including but not limited to Exon
             19 deletion or L858R)

          -  Radiographic progression by RECIST 1.1 during treatment with erlotinib. Prior
             chemotherapy regimens are permitted.

          -  Received erlotinib treatment for at least 1 month prior to enrollment

          -  Measurable (RECIST 1.1) indicator lesion not previously irradiated

          -  Must have undergone biopsy after development of acquired resistance to erlotinib
             (which is performed as standard of care) with adequate tissue to determine EGFR T790M
             and tumor histology. Slides from an outside institution may be used.

          -  KPS ≥ 70%

          -  Age&gt;18 years old

          -  Patients must have adequate organ function:

               -  AST, ALT, Alk phos ≤ 3.0 x ULN

          -  Patients with symptomatic brain metastasis requiring escalating doses of steroids.

             requiring therapy,

          -  Chronic or current active infections requiring systemic antibiotics, antifungals or
             antiviral therapy.

          -  Known human immunodeficiency virus infection, or hepatitis B virus (HBV) viremia or
             hepatitis C virus (HCV) viremia. Screening for the study does not require assessment
             for these infections if not already known.
