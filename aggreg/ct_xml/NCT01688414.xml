      This pilot clinical trial studies imaging during surgery in diagnosing patients with
      prostate, bladder, or kidney cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, may find prostate,
      bladder, or kidney cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. The primary objective of this pilot study is to assess the ability of fluorescent imaging
      and photoacoustic imaging (PAI) in a clinical setting to distinguish benign from malignant
      tissue.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To qualitatively determine the possible benefit of PAI and fluorescent imaging over
      traditional white light imaging.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fluorescence imaging and PAI during robot assisted laparoscopic surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have a pathologic confirmation of prostate cancer, bladder cancer, or
             kidney cancer based on previous biopsies or procedures OR a strong concern for a
             kidney malignancy based on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI) imaging

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a surgical history or anatomic variant that would preclude robot
             assisted laparoscopic approaches to their surgery (i.e. history of ventral hernia
             repair with mesh)

          -  Patients with medical co-morbidities who cannot tolerate laparoscopic surgery
             secondary to intra-abdominal carbon dioxide insufflation

          -  Patients with documented allergy or adverse drug reaction to indocyanine green or
             baseline serum creatinine greater than 1.5 mg/dL
