            "textblock": "Pectus excavatum (PE) is a common chest wall deformity where the sternum is displaced\n      posteriorly.  In severe cases, surgery is performed to correct the defect (1).  In recent\n      years, minimally invasive surgery with the placement of stainless steel support bars has\n      been increasingly performed in patients over the age of 17 years (1-9).  Because of the\n      decreased malleability and tremendous pressure required to hold the chest wall in the\n      corrected position, post-operative pain control has been a significant problem in this\n      patient population (2,6,9-12).  Thoracic epidurals are commonly employed however mean\n      hospitalizations of up to 7 days have been required before adequate pain control on oral\n      analgesics is obtained (3-5, 13) and patients are suitable for discharge.\n\n      It is hypothesized that using the ONQ system (I-Flow Corporation, Lake Forest CA) with\n      bilateral intercostal catheter infusion would provide adequate post operative pain control\n      with a significantly shorter hospital length-of-stay than thoracic epidural. Total use of\n      narcotics for 1 week following surgery would also be less with the ONQ system versus\n      epidural."
