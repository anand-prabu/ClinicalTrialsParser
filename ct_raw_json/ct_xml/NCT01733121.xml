  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NBI-98854
      (titrated to a subject's optimal dose in the range of 25 to 75 mg) administered once daily
      for the treatment of Tardive Dyskinesia (TD) symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-titration study to
      evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of NBI-98854 (titrated to subject's optimal
      dose in the range of 25 to 75 mg) compared to placebo, administered once daily (q.d.) for a
      total of 6 weeks of treatment.  Approximately 90 medically stable male and female subjects
      with one of the following clinical diagnoses will be enrolled: schizophrenia or
      schizoaffective disorder with neuroleptic-induced TD; mood disorder with neuroleptic-induced
      TD; or gastrointestinal disorder with metoclopramide-induced TD.

      For subjects randomized to active treatment, the starting dose will be 25 mg NBI 98854,
      which may be escalated in increments of 25 mg every 2 weeks to a maximum of 75 mg to achieve
      an optimal dose of NBI-98854 for each subject
