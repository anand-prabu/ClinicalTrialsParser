            "textblock": "Injury to the knee during sports participation often involves partial of full detachment of\n      the ACL.  ACL tears cause pain, swelling and inflammation.  While the swelling and\n      inflammation usually goes away in time, individuals with ACL injuries may experience pain\n      and notice knee instability (knee slipping, etc.).  Often surgery can repair or replace the\n      ACL within the joint, allowing individuals the ability to walk or run again pain free or\n      participate in sports.  Unfortunately, osteoarthritis of the knee, which also causes pain\n      and swelling, can occur in that same knee 10-20 years later for reasons which are not well\n      understood.\n\n      In this research study, we hope to prevent and reduce the initial post-operative pain. The\n      reduction of pain will allow for earlier movement of the knee joint and preparation for\n      surgery. It may also reduce the risk to develop  osteoarthritis in individuals with ACL\n      injuries by treating them within 1-2 days after their injury."
