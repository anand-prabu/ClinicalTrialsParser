Followed by a\n      health education regarding the healthy practices will be given to them. Practice of\n      household water chlorination will be promoted. The healthy behavior will be reinforced\n      through reminders and community activities of self help groups for one year.\n\n      The study participants will be benefited from survey in terms of\n\n        1. Improved knowledge and practices of drinking water handling\n\n        2. Risk reduction of water borne illness to family members"
