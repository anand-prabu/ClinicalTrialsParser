      The purpose of this study is to determine whether choline supplementation can improve
      cognitive functioning of children with prenatal alcohol exposure.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite the known damaging effects of alcohol on the developing fetus and the presence of
      warning labels on alcoholic beverages, many pregnant women continue to drink alcohol.  The
      consequences include a range of physical, neurological, and behavioral effects referred to
      as fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD). Unfortunately, there are currently no
      comprehensive treatments for individuals with FASD. This pilot study will examine whether a
      nutritional intervention could reduce the severity of cognitive deficits associated with
      prenatal alcohol exposure. Choline is an essential nutrient, necessary for brain and
      behavioral development. Animal studies have shown that prenatal or early postnatal choline
      supplementation can lead to long-lasting cognitive enhancement. Similarly, choline
      supplementation improves cognitive outcomes among rats exposed to alcohol during
      development, even when administered postnatally and after alcohol exposure has occurred. The
      present experiment translates these findings to a clinical population of individuals exposed
      to heavy prenatal alcohol exposure.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive daily
      choline supplementation or placebo control for a period of 6 weeks (approximately 20
      subjects per group).  Performance on neuropsychological tasks that measure cognitive
      functioning will be measured prior to treatment and at 6 weeks. These data will provide
      important information regarding a potential nutritional intervention for fetal alcohol
      spectrum disorders.
