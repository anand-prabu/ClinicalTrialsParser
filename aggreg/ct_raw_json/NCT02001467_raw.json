This study focused on the effects of training midwives in performing cervical\n      ultrasound scans on continuity of care when managing pregnant women with symptoms of\n      premature onset of labor. Our hypothesis is that simulation-based training can be used to\n      decrease the number of shifts in primary responsible health care practitioner as midwives\n      that are trained in cervical ultrasound scans may manage the patient encounter without\n      engaging a second practitioner (i.e. an obstetrician)."

            "textblock": "Pregnant women with symptoms of premature onset of labor are typically managed by midwives\n      and obstetricians but shifts in responsibility in patient care may result in lack of\n      continuity of care. This may, in turn, result in threats to patient safety and delays in\n      initiation of treatment due to long wait times.\n\n      This study examined the effects of simulation-based ultrasound training on the management of\n      women with symptoms of pre-mature onset of labor. 12 midwives were randomized to\n      simulation-based ultrasound training focusing on cervical assessment or no training\n      (controls). The midwives in the intervention group were trained to an expert criterion on a\n      high-fidelity transvaginal ultrasound simulator. Once this level was attained, they\n      continued clinical training until proficiency in performing cervical scans independently.\n      Proficiency was determined using a previously validated assessment instrument (the Objective\n      Structured Assessment of Ultrasound Skills) and by sending in pictures for the Fetal\n      Medicine Foundation certification programme.\n\n      The number of responsible health care practitioners providing care for pregnant women with\n      acute onset of symptoms of premature onset of labor is registered along with time from\n      arrival at the hospital to medical assessment and treatment  is commenced. Differences\n      between patients treated by the two groups of midwives are compared over a period of 6\n      months. During this period all patients with symptoms of premature onset of labor are\n      included, of which only a small proportion are admitted for further examinations and\n      treatment. The vast majority are expected to be scheduled for ambulatory follow-up."
