  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SDB has been identified as an important risk factor for insulin resistance and the metabolic
      syndrome.

      In a recent study in patients with SDB and T2DM it was shown that CPAP therapy can lead to
      improvements in postprandial glucose levels and in glycosylated hemoglobin levels (HbA1c).

      In children, there are only 3 studies that have examined the relations between SDB, obesity
      and the metabolic syndrome.

      In order to further understand the relative contribution of SDB to the development of
      impaired glucose homeostasis and metabolic abnormalities we aim to investigate the
      prevalence and severity of SDB in children with T2DM compared to obese children without
      T2DM. The investigators hypothesize that SDB will be more prevalent and more severe among
      obese children with T2DM compared with the general obese pediatric population.
