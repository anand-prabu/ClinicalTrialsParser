An informed consent will be obtained during the\n      clinic visit with the thoracic surgeon.\n\n      At the beginning of the surgical procedure, under general anesthesia in the operating room,\n      patients will undergo flexible bronchoscopy through the endotracheal tube and obtain 10\n      standard transbronchial biopsies (S-TBBx) and 5 Cryoprobe biopsies (C-TBBx) with\n      fluoroscopic guidance.  S-TBBx will be performed using standard biopsy forceps (Boston\n      Scientific, Natick, MA) - 2.0mm diameter.  C-TBBx will be performed using the cryoprobe\n      (ERBE, Tubingen, Germany) -1.9 mm diameter, 78cm in length.  This cryoprobe is routinely\n      used in the bronchoscopy suite for other applications such as foreign body removal and local\n      treatment of carcinoma; therefore it is a technique already employed by the interventional\n      pulmonologists who are familiar with its use. Once the biopsies are obtained by the\n      interventional pulmonologist, the thoracic surgeon will perform video-assisted thoracoscopic\n      biopsy (VATS) biopsy.  Following their procedure, subjects will be monitored in the\n      post-anesthesia care unit as per standard of care. As part of their ongoing follow-up care,\n      all subjects will be monitored for any adverse events that may have resulted from either the\n      surgical or bronchoscopic procedure, specifically bleeding or pneumothorax.\n\n      All biopsy samples will be analyzed by a specialist in pulmonary pathology.\n\n      The number and size of all biopsies, architectural preservation of the airways/alveoli, and\n      pathological diagnosis will be reported by the pathologist.  Diagnostic yield will be\n      calculated for each biopsy technique and compared."
