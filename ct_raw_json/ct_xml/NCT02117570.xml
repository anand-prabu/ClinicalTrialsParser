    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a Clostridium difficile vaccine in healthy adults aged 65 to 85
      years, who will each receive 3 doses of vaccine.  The study will assess the safety and
      tolerability of the vaccine, and also look at the subjects' immune response to the vaccine.
