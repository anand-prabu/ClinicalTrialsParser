Eligibility\n      criteria were: 1) only demonstration of LNH; 2) no concomitant disease; 3) no treatment\n      assumed since the clinical onset. Patients were allocated 1:1:1 to dietetic (Group A) vs\n      mesalamine (Group B) vs no treatment (Group C) for a 8-weeks period. Skin prick tests and\n      patch test for common foods, and symptoms scoring at baseline and follow up have been\n      performed by blinded clinicians. Chi-square test for trend was used to compare the frequency\n      of symptoms score improvement (>1 point) among groups.
