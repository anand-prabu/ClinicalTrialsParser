      The purpose of this study is to investigate in acromegalic patients the effect of different
      doses of ITF2984 on GH and IGF-1 concentrations and to investigate safety and tolerability
      of three different doses of ITF2984.

      The study will enroll patients with active acromegaly, de novo or partial responder to
      previous treatment with somatostatin analogues. For patients who had previously received
      medical therapy for acromegaly a washout periods before study entry of 3 months for
      long-acting formulation of somatostatin analogs, 2 weeks for octreotide sc, 2 months for
      pegvisomant and/or cabergoline must be foreseen.

      Each patient will be randomized and wll remain in the study for about 6 months, and they
      will attend a visit every two weeks.

      The patients will be treated for 4 months in a total, in particular every month of treatment
      will be followed by a washout period of 2 weeks.

      At each month of treatment the patients will receive one of the four treatment as reported
      below:

      Octreotide 100 mcg sc three times daily (t.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 500 mcg sc twice a day
      (b.i.d) for 4 weeks, ITF2984 1000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4 weeks, ITF2984 2000 mcg sc b.i.d for 4
      weeks. Patients will be randomized using a 4 way crossover design to receive ITF2984 or
      octreotide at each treatment month. Each patient will receive all of the four treatments
      overseen in this study.

          -  Patients with active acromegaly due to a pituitary adenoma. Active acromegaly should
             be confirmed by 2h five point mean GH level higher than 5 mcg/liter, lack of
             suppression of GH nadir to less than 1 mcg/liter after oral glucose tolerance test,
             and elevated IGF-1 for age and sex-matched controls.

          -  Patients treated with previous surgery and/or medical therapy or previously untreated
             (de novo). For patients who had previously received medical therapy for acromegaly a
             washout periods before study entry of 3 months for long-acting formulation of
             somatostatin analogs and 2 weeks for octreotide sc must be foreseen. Partial
             responder means a significant decrease (&gt;50%), without achievement of control of GH
             and/or IGF-1 levels and/or &gt;20 % tumor shrinkage after at least 6 months of SRL
             therapy.

          -  Patients with GH level and IGF-1 level for age and sex-matched controls out of range
             at baseline.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients undergone pituitary surgery within the prior 6 months.

          -  Patients who have received pituitary radiotherapy (within last 10  years).

          -  Patients with compression of the optic chiasm causing any visual field defect.

          -  Patients who require a surgical intervention for relief of any sign or symptom
             associated with tumor compression.

          -  Patients with uncontrolled diabetes defined as having a fasting glucose &gt; 150 mg/dL
             (8.3 mmol/L) or HbA1c ≥ 8% (Patients can be rescreened after diabetes is brought
             under adequate control).

          -  Patients with significant cardiovascular morbidity within the three months preceding
             enrollment.

          -  Symptomatic cholelithiasis, gallstone or chronic liver disease.

          -  Clinically significant GI, renal or hepatic disease (in the opinion of
             investigator).

          -  AST and/or ALT&gt;2ULN.

          -  Active HBV and/or active HCV infection.

          -  Patients who have a history of alcohol or drug abuse in the six-month period prior to
             the enrollment visit.

          -  Known hypothyroidism or hypocortisolism not adequately treated with a stable dose of
             thyroid or steroid hormone replacement therapy for at least the previous 3 months.

          -  Known hypersensitivity to any of the study medications, or components thereof or a
             history of drug or other allergy that in the opinion of the Investigator
             contraindicates their participation.

          -  Female patients who are pregnant or lactating, and female patient who are of
             childbearing potential or male patient with female partners of childbearing potential
             who do not accept the contraception requirements reported in the protocol

          -  Patients who have participated in any clinical investigation with an Investigational
             drug within 3 months before study entry.

          -  Current or recent (&lt; 2 months) therapy with pegvisomant or  cabergoline.
