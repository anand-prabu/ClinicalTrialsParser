            "textblock": "Infections due to post transplant immune deficiency are a major problem following allogeneic\n      stem cell transplantation (Allo-SCT), particularly in patients receiving cord blood\n      transplant (CB). Duration of neutropenia is one of the most important risk factor for\n      invasive fungal infection (IFI). In this setting, Micafungin has been approved for\n      antifungal prophylaxis for patients undergoing Allo-SCT. In a randomized, double-blind,\n      comparative, phase III trial, the overall efficacy of micafungin was superior to that of\n      fluconazole as antifungal prophylaxis during the neutropenic phase after Allo-SCT. However,\n      very few patients in this study received a CB transplant.\n\n      This is phase IIb, prospective, open-label, non-comparative study to assess the safety of\n      micafungin when use in prevention of IFI in neutropenic patients receiving allo-SCT using CB\n      as source of stem cells."
