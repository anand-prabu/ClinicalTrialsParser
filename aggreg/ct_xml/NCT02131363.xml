    <textblock>
      This purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and performance of a treatment kit for
      ingrowing toenail, primarily by determining the number of subjects who show a reduction in
      the severity of their ingrowing toenail.

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with one great ingrowing toenail that is rated as either &quot;slightly
             ingrowing&quot;, &quot;somewhat ingrowing&quot; or &quot;very ingrowing&quot; on the Investigators Ingrowing
             Toenail Severity Scale.

          -  Subjects whose worst pain experienced in the week preceding inclusion, is rated at
             least 3 on the 10 point Subject Pain Intensity Scale.

          -  Subjects whose affected toenail has a minimum of 2mm distal edge and a minimum nail
             width of at least 16mm.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects with any other toenail pathology (including pincer and spicule toenail) that
             would compromise the fitting of the toenail clip, or its use.

          -  Subjects suspected to be immunocompromised.

          -  Subjects who suffer from impaired feeling in the feet due to diabetes, peripheral
             vascular disease or neuropathy.

          -  Subjects with any cutaneous pathology or cuts/abrasions which, in the opinion of the
             investigator, could compromise safety or affect the outcome of the clinical
             investigation (for example, interfere with assessments).

          -  Subjects with known sensitivity/allergies to any component of the investigational
             device.

          -  Significant current or past medical history of hepatic, renal, cardiac, pulmonary,
             digestive, haematological, neurological, locomotor or psychiatric disease, which, in
             the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise the safety of the subject or affect
             the outcome of the clinical investigation (as determined from self-reported medical
             history questionnaire).

          -  Use of concomitant medication likely to affect the response to the investigational
             device or confuse the results of the clinical investigation. Regular pain relief is
             not permitted and subjects must not take any analgesics in the 24 hours preceding any
             clinic visit.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential who, for the duration of the study, are
             either unwilling or unable to take adequate contraceptive precautions or are
             unwilling to be sexually abstinent.

          -  Pregnancy or lactating mother.
