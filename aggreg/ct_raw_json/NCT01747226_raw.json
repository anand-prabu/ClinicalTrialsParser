The aim of this study is to\n      evaluate the immediate (masking) and long term (therapeutic) effect of commercially\n      available mouth rinses in the treatment of oral malodor. For this volunteers with oral\n      malodor detected by organoleptic evaluation and confirmed by the increase level of sulphur\n      compounds in their breath (VSC) will be asked to use a designated mouthwash. The breath\n      parameters will be assessed at baseline and 15' after the first rinse (15 ml, during 1\n      minute) and over night at the end of a period of 3 weeks during which the volunteers rinsed\n      twice a day (15 ml, 1 minute) with the assigned mouthwash. The short and long term effect of\n      a stannous fluoride/amine fluoride/zinc rinse; a chlorhexidine/cetylpyridinium chloride/zinc\n      product and a negative control(fluoride rinse and/or water) will be compared."
