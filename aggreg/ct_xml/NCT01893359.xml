    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and efficacy, with regards to
      regression of refractive outcome, as measured by manifest refraction spherical equivalent
      (MRSE), of two treatment regimens for hyperopic and hyperopic astigmatic subjects: LASIK
      followed by cross-linking performed with the KXL System and Photrexa ZD™ (Riboflavin
      Ophthalmic Solution), as compared to LASIK alone.

             astigmatism;

          -  5. Intended treatment &gt; +2.0 diopters (D) to &lt; +6.0 D of MRSE hyperopia or hyperopia
             with astigmatism, with up to +6.0 D of spherical component and up to 5.0 D of
             astigmatic component (all refractions measured at the spectacle plane);

          -  6. Bilateral physiologic hyperopia;

          -  7. For females capable of becoming pregnant, agree to have urine pregnancy testing
             performed at visit 2 prior to treatment; must not be lactating, and must agree to use
             a medically acceptable form of birth control for at least one week prior to the visit
             2 and continue to use the method for one month following the treatment. Acceptable
             forms for birth control are spermicide with barrier, oral contraceptive, injectable
             or implantable method of contraception, transdermal contraceptive, intrauterine
             device, or surgical sterilization of partner. For non-sexually active females,
             abstinence will be considered an acceptable form of birth control. Women considered
             capable of becoming pregnant include all females who have experienced menarche and
             have not experienced menopause (as defined by amenorrhea for greater than 12
             consecutive months) or have not undergone successful surgical sterilization (e.g.
             hysterectomy, bilateral tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy);

          -  8. Best spectacle corrected visual acuity (BSCVA) of 70 letters or more on ETDRS

             months, objectively documented (by previous clinical records, prescriptions, etc.),
             exclusive of changes determined by the investigator to be due to unmasking latent
             hyperopia;

          -  12. Normal corneal topography, as judged by the investigator;

          -  13. Removal of contact lenses for the required period of time prior to the screening

          -  5. Acute or chronic disease or illness that would increase the operative risk or
             confound the outcomes of the study (e.g., dry eyes, immuno- compromised, connective
             tissue disease, clinically significant atopic disease, diabetes, etc.);

          -  11. Taking supplements containing Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) within 1 week of the
             cross-linking treatment;

             reason;

          -  14. The subject should not have participated in any investigational drug or device
             study within 30 days of screening or be concurrently enrolled in another
             investigational drug or device study.
