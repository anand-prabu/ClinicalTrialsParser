            "textblock": "The attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) usually occurs in preschool and may\n      cause disabilities through whole life. The treatment of this disease is expensive and\n      difficult. Moreover, physical exercise and omegas consumption may improve the cognitive\n      functions and behavior, so it could be an interesting strategy to improve this disorder. The\n      aim of the present study is to verify the effects of multiple components physical training\n      and the consumption of omega 3 on behavior, cognitive functions and the serum levels of BDNF\n      and IGF-1 in ADHD children. Thus, 68 ADHD children, between seven and fourteen years old\n      will be selected. The volunteers will be randomly divided into four groups: Physical\n      Training Group (PTG), Omega Group (OG), Omega and Physical Training Group (OPTG) and Control\n      Group (CG).  The protocol of the experiment will last three months in which the OPTG will\n      make physical training and receive fish oil capsules, and the PTG will make only the\n      physical training and receive a placebo of fish oil. The others groups will be oriented not\n      to make any type of physical training, but the OG will receive fish oil capsule, and the CG\n      will receive a placebo of fish oil. Behavioral and cognitive functions evaluations and blood\n      analysis will be made at the beginning and at the end of the protocol."
