            "textblock": "1. Stress Urinary Incontinence (SUI) is a disease in which urine outflows involuntarily\n           because of slack and weak urethral sphincter when patient's intra-abdominal pressure\n           increases or patient stands upright or walks. 90% of SUI are caused by urethral\n           hypermobility.\n\n        2. So far, however, there is no urinary incontinence vaginal tape developed independently\n           by Chinese. By mid-2012, there are more than 10 kinds of vaginal tapes for SUI approved\n           by China Food and Drug Administration(CFDA) and all of them are imported and expensive\n           (price for hospital: 5500-18000 Yuan). By October 18, 2013, all products for SUI\n           treatment approved by CFDA are made in weaving techniques. The main product material is\n           polypropylene, a non-absorbable synthetic mesh. Polypropylene vaginal tapes have good\n           biocompatibility, but Polypropylene vaginal tapes also have many problems. Eckhard\n           Petri's study on the complications of female patients with SUI treated by polypropylene\n           vaginal tape showed that postoperative complications often occur in the 5th year after\n           the surgery. The most common complications include mesh exposure, pain, infection and\n           sexual dysfunction. The causes of these complications are mainly related to the\n           material's biocompatibility and rejection reaction etc in addition to surgical factors.\n\n        3. The Regen Sling developed by Medprin Regenerative Medical Technologies Co., Ltd. adopts\n           the high-biocompatibility Polyvinylidene Fluoride (PVDF) as the material and\n           electro-spinning technique is adopted for its production. It is highly flexible,\n           non-erosive, permanent and non-degradable.In addition, it can induce rapid ingrowth of\n           fibroblasts and new blood capillary formation, thus achieving perfect remediation\n           effect and long-term safety. The Regen Sling can effectively prevent the various\n           problems of the existing products occurred in clinical use and overcome the\n           deficiencies of existing polypropylene weaving products such as poor comfortable\n           sensation, easy to induce erosion and exposure etc.\n\n        4. Given the technical advantages and development potentials of Regen Sling and the market\n           demands, Sponsor plan to apply for the registration of the product in the United States\n           (FDA) in addition to domestic application for registration; besides, Sponsor plan to\n           conduct European unification(CE) certification for the product in the European Economic\n           Area and apply for registration in other potential countries or regions.\n\n        5. Product Mechanism and Trial Range 5.1 Product Mechanism Pathogenesis of SUI include\n           urethral hypermobility and internal sphincter disorder, 90% of SUI are caused by\n           urethral hypermobility. Delancey created the Hammock Theory in 1994 and pointed out\n           that the key of SUI treatment is to restore the supporting tissue around urethra\n           instead of changing the positions and included angle of bladder and urethra. Mid\n           urethral sling is the generic term of the surgical methods for female SUI treatment\n           derived from the theory. It is effective and minimally invasive and becomes the\n           internationally recognized first line treatment of SUI. In Regen Sling treatment,\n           vaginal tape is placed at the middle section of urethra without tension through\n           puncture method, so the dynamic urethral resistance is obtained in abdominal pressure\n           increasing state, thus achieving urinary control effect.\n\n           5.2 Trial Range Female patients with moderate or severe SUI\n\n        6. Product Indications and Function 1) This product is applicable for female patients with\n           moderate or severe SUI; 2) Moderate to severe SUI caused by internal sphincter\n           disorder; 3) Mixed urinary incontinence.\n\n        7. Research Method The study is a multi-center, randomized, single-blind, positive\n           parallel  controlled, non-inferiority validation clinical trial.\n\n      7.1. Investigators shall observe and determine whether the hospitalized patients planning to\n      undergo female stress urinary incontinence surgery meet the inclusion criteria or not. If\n      the patients meet the inclusion criteria, the investigators shall explain Informed Consent\n      Form to the patients. If the patients agree to participate in the clinical trial, they can\n      become the subjects of the trial only when the Informed Consent Form is signed by the\n      patients and/or patients family member.\n\n      7.2. The investigators shall screen out and register the subjects, complete relevant\n      examinations in baseline period; for the patients meeting inclusion criteria without\n      rejecting the Informed Consent Form, investigators shall allocate random number to the\n      patients in chronological order (random number allocation method: Small to large).\n\n      7.3. All subjects shall undergo routine preoperative examinations including Blood Routine,\n      Urine Routine, Blood Type and Rh antibody , Liver and Kidney Function, Blood Coagulation\n      Function, Hepatitis B Five Items, Hepatitis C Virus(HCV) Antibodies, Treponema Pallidum\n      Antibodies, Preliminary HIV Screening, Electrocardiogram, Chest Radiography, Pelvic Cavity B\n      Ultrasound etc and preoperative pelvic floor function assessment and preoperative\n      questionnaire.\n\n      7.4. During the operation of vaginal tape, investigators shall place the control samples and\n      test samples in accordance with standard operations and complete relevant surgical records.\n\n      7.5. Follow-up Observation: outpatient follow-up shall be conducted in the 3rd month, 6th\n      month and 12th month after the surgery. According to the clinical requirements, in the 3rd\n      month after the surgery, investigators  shall examine surgery's anti-urinary incontinence\n      effect and encourage the patients to recover sexual life; in the 6th month after the\n      surgery, investigators shall conduct follow-up visits on sexual life situation and vaginal\n      tape erosion situation;  in the 12th month after the  surgery,investigators shall know about\n      the improvement of patients' symptoms ."
