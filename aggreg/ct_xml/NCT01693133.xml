        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female age 18 or older

          -  Informed consent must be obtained

          -  Patient's ulcer must be diabetic in origin with a size ranging from 1 to 25 cm2.

        Debridement will be done prior to randomization.

          -  Wounds should be diabetic foot ulcers located on the plantar surface of the foot.

          -  Subject's informed consent for participating in this study, must be obtained prior to
             proceeding with sharp debridement.

          -  Patients with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes (criteria for the diagnosis of diabetes
             mellitus per ADA).

          -  Ulcer must be present for a minimum of four weeks, with documented failure of prior
             treatment to heal the wound (&lt; 20% wound area reduction for two consecutive weeks
             immediately prior to enrollment when treated with standard protocol of care).

          -  Patient's ulcer must exhibit no clinical signs of infection.

          -  Patient is of legal consenting age.

          -  Patient is willing to provide informed consent and is willing to participate in all
             procedures and follow up evaluations necessary to complete the study.

          -  Serum Creatine less then 3.0mg/dl

          -  HbA1c less than 12%

          -  Patient has adequate circulation to the affected extremity, as demonstrated by one of
             the following within the past 60 days:

               -  Dorsum transcutaneous oxygen test (TcPO2) with results ≥ 30mmHg, OR

               -  ABIs with results of ≥0.7 and ≤1.2, OR

               -  Doppler arterial waveforms, which are triphasic or biphasic at the ankle of
                  affected leg

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients presenting with an ulcer probing to bone (UT Grade IIIA-D). A positive
             probe-to-bone will be confirmed when bone or joint can be felt with a sterile,
             ophthalmological probe.

          -  Patients whose index diabetic foot ulcer is smaller than 1 cm2 or greater than 25cm2.
             Or multiple wounds on the same foot where other wounds are within 5 cm of the wound
             under care.

          -  Patients considered not in reasonable metabolic control, confirmed by an HbA1c
             greater  than 12% within previous 90 days,

          -  Patients whose serum creatinine levels are 3.0mg/dl or greater.

          -  Patients with a known history of poor compliance with medical treatments.

          -  Patients who have been previously randomized into this study, or are presently
             participating in another clinical trial

          -  Patients who are currently receiving radiation therapy or chemotherapy.

          -  Patients with known or suspected local skin malignancy to the index diabetic ulcer.

          -  Patients diagnosed with autoimmune connective tissues diseases.

          -  Nonrevascularizable surgical sites

          -  Active infection at site

          -  Any pathology that would limit the blood supply and compromise healing;

          -  Patients that have received a biomedical or topical growth factor for their wound
             within the previous 30 days

          -  Patient who are pregnant or breast feeding

          -  Patient who are taking medications that are considered immune system modulator which
             could affect graft incorporation.

          -  Allergy to Gentamycin or Streptomycin

          -  Active Charcot deformity or major structural abnormalities of the foot.

          -  Wounds that are not on the plantar surface of the foot.

          -  Wounds that are greater than one year in duration without intermittent closure.
