A written informed consent is obtained\n      from eligible women before induction or at early stage of labour.\n\n      Women with singleton pregnancies of more than 28 weeks' gestation who are admitted to\n      hospital and candidates for vaginal delivery are eligible for the study .Gestational age\n      more than 28 weeks the gestational age is determined based upon the date of the first day of\n      last normal menstrual period and confirmed by ultrasound scan during the 1st trimester.\n\n      The patients (320) are divided into two groups, Group A (160) receive bilateral uterine\n      compression immediately after delivery of the placenta for 5 minutes while Group B (160)\n      receive no intervention.\n\n      The third stage of labour was managed as usual by clamping and cutting of umbilical cord,\n      waiting for signs of placental separation and delivering the placenta by controlled cord\n      traction.\n\n      Duration of the 3rd stage of labour is calculated. Patients are kept in labor room under\n      observation for a period of 1 h.\n\n      Measurement of blood loss by a clean plastic lined absorbent drape placed under the woman's\n      buttocks to collect all the blood lost after delivery of the baby and drainage of the\n      amniotic fluid. The drape is changed as many times as needed. The woman stays on the drape\n      or asked to wear a pad over the next 60 minutes. In the case of severe haemorrhage, the\n      investigators follow the usual guidelines for management of postpartum haemorrhage, and the\n      supplemental treatment registered. All drapes and pads are weighed on an electronic scale\n      and the known dry weight of the linen is subtracted. As 1 ml of blood weighs close to 1 g,\n      the balance in grams is assumed to be the total blood loss in ml."
