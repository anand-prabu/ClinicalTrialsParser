  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate QOL (quality of life) and depression in peritoneal
      dialysis patients compare to hemodialysis patients and assess hydration effect on QOL and
      depression over time.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In dialysis patients, low QOL and depression affects clinical outcomes such as morbidity and
      mortality.

      Therefore at the point of treating dialysis patients, It is important to provide not only
      physical health but also psychosocial health.

      QOL could be decided by physical health (i.e. sign and symptom, laboratory results, death)
      and psychological health (i.e. fatigue, pain, consciousness of health and satisfaction).

      And also generally it is well known that physical and psychological functions in dialysis
      patients are decreased.

      And especially depression is common disease in dialysis patients. It is also well known that
      about from 25 to 50 percent of dialysis patients have depression which could result in low
      QOL moreover hospitalization, complication, and mortality.

      But there is no QOL and depression study with hydration status. Therefore the investigators
      would like to explore it.

      The objective of the study is to evaluate QOL(quality of life) and depression in peritoneal
      dialysis patients compare to hemodialysis patients and assess hydration effect on QOL and
      depression over time
