    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of ramucirumab in combination with
      docetaxel in participants with Stage IV non-small cell lung cancer who have had disease
      progression during or after one prior first-line platinum-based chemotherapy with or without
      maintenance therapy for advanced/metastatic disease.
