Multiple risk factors have been\n      proposed, some of which overlap with items of the pneumonia severity index (PSI). The aim of\n      this study was to investigate the relationship between PSI and presence of MDR pathogens.\n\n      Methods Patients who were admitted to a tertiary-care hospital from January 2005 to December\n      2010 were screened by a discharge diagnosis of pneumonia. Patients were enrolled if they\n      fulfilled the definition of HCAP by 2005 ATS/IDSA guideline."
