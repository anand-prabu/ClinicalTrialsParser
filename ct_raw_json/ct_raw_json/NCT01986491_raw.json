Part 1 is\n      a four-way cross-over (method used to switch participants from one treatment arm to another\n      in a clinical study) study to compare the pharmacokinetics, dose-proportionality, safety and\n      tolerability of JNJ 39393406 following single dose oral administration of two solid oral\n      formulations (X and Y). Approximately 12 participants will be enrolled in Part 1. Part 2 is\n      two-way cross-over study in a separate group of participants to assess pharmacokinetics in\n      fasting condition and the relative bioavailability (the extent to which a medication or\n      other substance becomes available to the body) of the selected solid formulation from Part 1\n      compared with a solution formulation. Approximately 8 participants will be enrolled in Part\n      2. In Part 3, the single and repeated dose pharmacokinetics after administration of the\n      selected formulation from Part 1 will be assessed for 7 consecutive days. The same\n      participants will participate in Parts 2 and 3 of the study. Safety will be evaluated by the\n      assessment of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital signs,\n      physical examination, and neurological examination. The duration of participation in the\n      study for an individual participant will be approximately 8 weeks (including screening and\n      follow up visit)."
