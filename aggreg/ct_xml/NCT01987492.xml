  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study will
      evaluate the efficacy of lebrikizumab compared with placebo as measured by the ability of
      patients to achieve lower daily doses of oral corticosteroids in patients with severe
      corticosteroid-dependent asthma. Patients will be randomized to receive lebrikizumab or
      matching placebo for 44 weeks. All patients who complete the 44 weeks period may continue
      into a 32-week open-label treatment extension period during which all patients will receive
      lebrikizumab treatment.
