Specific Aim\n      2: Among employees participating in the program, to test whether weight loss maintenance\n      program in DVD format is as effective as the weight loss maintenance program in a group face\n      to face format in maintaining weight loss for employees who complete weight loss program.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the PILI @ Work interventions can be effectively adapted\n      and implemented in a worksite settings with active participation by employees and employers.\n      The investigators also hypothesize that overweight (BMI \u2265 25) and obese (BMI \u2265 30) employees\n      who complete weight loss portion of the intervention, and are randomized to received the\n      weight loss maintenance intervention via DVD will have similar success at maintaining weight\n      loss compared to those randomized to PILI Maintenance in group meetings or settings.

            "textblock": "Effective and culturally relevant interventions are needed to curb the rising tide of\n      overweight and obesity. This study adapts an evidence-based weight loss intervention for use\n      in Native Hawaiian-serving organizations in Hawai'i, using a community-based participatory\n      research (CBPR) approach. Findings from our two previous NIH-funded projects help to inform\n      this proposed research: 1) The Designing Healthy Worksites (DHW) Project and 2) the PILI\n      Lifestyle Intervention (PILI), developed by the PILI 'Ohana (family) Project: Partnerships\n      to Overcome Obesity Disparities in Hawai'i.\n\n      The DHW Project engaged with eight Native Hawaiian-serving organizations to obtain data on\n      1) existing worksite policies that support and/or promote health and well-being of employees\n      and 2) the perspectives and ideas of employees and employers around creating a healthy\n      workplace. DHW participants expressed enthusiasm for health promotion programs at the\n      worksite, especially weight-loss programs.\n\n      The PILI 'Ohana Project adapted an evidence-based lifestyle intervention for use with Native\n      Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders who sought care at community health clinics and/or were\n      members of civic groups. The PILI Lifestyle Intervention (PILI) has two phases\u2014PILI Weight\n      Loss and PILI Maintenance. Both PILI Wt Loss and PILI Maintenance were designed for deliver\n      to community-based groups. In pilot testing, all participants participating in PILI Wt Loss\n      and realized significant weight loss after 3 months. Participants then were randomized into\n      PILI Maintenance or standard behavioral treatment (SBT); those in PILI Maintenance performed\n      better than those in SBT. PILI Wt Loss and PILI Maintenance were improved based on feedback\n      from the pilot. Because of reported time constraints by pilot participants, a DVD version of\n      PILI Maintenance was developed that people could use instead of attending group sessions. In\n      a subsequent community-based study of PILI (funded by NIH-NCMHD and now underway),\n      non-worksite participants are being randomized into a face-to-face or DVD delivery of PILI\n      Maintenance after completion of PILI Wt Loss.\n\n      Our specific aims and hypotheses for its application in worksites are as follows:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: To adapt and implement PILI Wt Loss and PILI Maintenance in Native\n      Hawaiian-serving organizations, working with employee representatives to determine how the\n      intervention can be best implemented with employees in worksites (PILI Wt Loss and PILI\n      Maintenance together will be called PILI@Work).\n\n      Primary hypothesis: A community-tested, evidence-based intervention for obesity reduction\n      and weight-loss maintenance can be effectively adapted and implemented in worksite settings\n      with active participation by employees and employers.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Among employees participating in PILI@Work, to test whether PILI Maintenance\n      in DVD format is as effective as PILI Maintenance in Group in maintaining weight loss for\n      employees who complete PILI Wt Loss.\n\n      Primary hypothesis: Overweight (BMI \u2265 25) and obese (BMI \u2265 30) employees who complete PILI\n      Wt Loss will have successful weight loss outcomes, and those randomized to PILI Maintenance\n      in DVD will have similar success at maintaining weight loss compared to those randomized to\n      PILI Maintenance in group meetings or settings. Successful weight loss maintenance will be\n      measured as a \u2265 3% mean weight change.\n\n      Secondary hypothesis: Employees participating in PILI Maintenance in DVD and those in PILI\n      Maintenance in Group will show similar maintenance of, or improvements in, physical\n      functioning, blood pressure, daily self-weighing, low to moderate fat and low calorie diets,\n      and daily physical activity."
