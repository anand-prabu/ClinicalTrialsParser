A digital algometer (FDX 25, Wagner Instruments, CT, USA) consisting of a rubber head (1 cm2) attached to a pressure gauge was used to measure PPTs. Force was measured in kilograms (kg); therefore, thresholds were expressed in kg/cm2. The protocol will use a sequence of three measurements, with an interval of 30 seconds between them. PPT will assess over bilateral masseter points 1 and 2, the temporalis muscles, the suboccipital muscle, the upper trapezius muscle (midway between C7 and the acromion), and the tibialis anterior muscle (upper third of the muscle belly) by an assessor blinded to the subject's condition.",
