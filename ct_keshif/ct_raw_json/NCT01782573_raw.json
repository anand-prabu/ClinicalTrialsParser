            "textblock": "Surgical site infections (SSIs) following elective surgical procedures occur most commonly\n      as a result of colonization by the patient's native skin flora . The most common pathogens\n      causing SSIs are Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococci , components of\n      normal skin flora . Therefore, preoperative disinfection of the surgical site with an\n      antiseptic skin preparation is standard practice before any surgical intervention to\n      decrease skin microbial counts before incision . It is considered an important step in\n      limiting surgical wound contamination and preventing infection.\n\n      A variety of skin-preparation agents and methods are available for preventing surgical site\n      infections and the techniques for preoperative cleansing of the skin vary among hospitals\n      and surgeons. There is a pressing need to elucidate the effect of cutaneous disinfection\n      with chlorhexidine gluconate ( CHG ) in prevention of surgical site infections.\n\n      Many studies demonstrated that comparisons with cutaneous disinfection with povidone-iodine,\n      disinfection with CHG before insertion of an intravascular device and for post-infection\n      site care can substantially reduce the incidence of device-related infection .\n\n      Hence, this study aimed to test whether an additional chlorhexidine gluconate scrub followed\n      by a routine disinfection would lower the incidence of surgical site culture and subsequent\n      infection after hepatic resection. This data will show the originality and clinical\n      importance of a cutaneous pre-disinfection scrubbing solution for such risk patients with\n      hepatectomy."
