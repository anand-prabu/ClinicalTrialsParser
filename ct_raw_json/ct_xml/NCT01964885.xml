  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      IQP-AS-105, is a food supplement derived from garlic (Allium sativum). The objective of this
      study is to evaluate the possibilities of clinical use of IQP-AS-105 as a preventive
      medicine, based on its ability to enhance the immune system responses
