This study aims to investigate hemodynamic response and\n      incidence of hypotensive episodes by comparing some of the most commonly used high- and\n      low-flux dialyzers.\n\n      Methodology:\n\n      The study was designed as an open label, randomized, cross-over investigation, including 25\n      patients undergoing chronic hemodialysis. Four polysulfone dialyzers of 1.8 m2, A\n      (Revaclear, Gambro), B (Helixone high flux, Fresenius), C (Xevonta, BBraun) and D (Helixone\n      low flux, Fresenius), were compared with each other. The hemodynamic profile was assessed\n      with a non-invasive technique and patients were asked to provide tolerance feedback through\n      a questionnaire."
