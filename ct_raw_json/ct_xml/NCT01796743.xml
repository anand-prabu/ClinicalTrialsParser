  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A novel Cardiac MRI sequence, developed by Dr. Maria Altbach (Double Inversion radial fast
      Spin Echo T2 mapping), has been tested clinically.  It demonstrated a high sensitivity to
      the heart muscle swelling (&quot;edema&quot;) in different types of heart injury, including heart
      attacks.

      The investigators propose to use T2-Map methodology in patients with acute heart attacks and
      to compare value of this method with other clinical and imaging parameters in predicting
      short-term (30 day) clinical outcomes of these patients.

      If successful, the project will provide an effective risk-stratification tool to identify
      patients with heart attack as a result of atherosclerotic disease, who require more
      aggressive therapeutic approach and closer follow-up after initial hospitalization.

      In our initial feasibility project, a novel Cardiac MRI sequence (Double Inversion radial
      fast Spin Echo T2 mapping)developed by Dr. Maria Altbach at the University of Arizona, has
      been tested clinically. It demonstrated a high sensitivity to the heart muscle swelling
      (&quot;edema&quot;) in different types of heart injury, including heart attacks. The investigators
      have successfully tested the reproducibility of the new method in a series of healthy
      volunteers.  Our Phase I study revealed a robust clinical performance of the T2-Map sequence
      in multiple cardiac disorders.

      Based on these promising results, presented on several international Cardiac Imaging
      meetings, the investigators propose to use T2-Map methodology in patients with acute heart
      attacks and to compare value of this method with other clinical and imaging parameters in
      predicting short-term (30 day) clinical outcomes of these patients.

      If successful, the project will provide an effective risk-stratification tool to identify
      patients with heart attack as a result of atherosclerotic disease, who require more
      aggressive therapeutic approach and closer follow-up after initial hospitalization.
