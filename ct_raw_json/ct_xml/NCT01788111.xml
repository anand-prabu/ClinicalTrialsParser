  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this project is to investigate the occurrence of neck and back pain in a
      population of commercial helicopter pilots, and investigate factors related to the
      profession that can cause these problems. The project has a biological approach assessing
      the supporting and stabilizing muscles (multifidus) in pilots with chronic back and neck
      ailments. Pilots with low back problems are invited to a controlled intervention trial to
      investigate whether one can achieve improved spinal health with a rigid training r√©gime.
      Primary trial outcome is improved neck and back multifidus muscles pathology and function as
      assessed by the extent of fat infiltration -as visualized on MRI - and the volume and
      ability of the lumbar multifidus muscles to contract as shown with ultrasound.  The
      perceived effect on spinal health with sick leave frequency is also evaluated.
