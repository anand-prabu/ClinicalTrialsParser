After informed\n      consent is obtained, the patients will be randomized into one of two study groups: the\n      intervention group or the control group. Women in the intervention group will receive a test\n      text-message reminder at the time of enrollment. They will then receive a text-reminder to\n      schedule their oral glucose tolerance test at 6 weeks postpartum, with further reminders at\n      3 months and 6 months if they have not completed their testing. Women in the control group\n      will only receive the test text-message reminder. The PI or member of the study team\n      obtaining the informed consent will verify the participant has received the text-message\n      prior to completing enrollment. A computer-generated randomization list will be generated\n      according to intervention vs. control group. Simple randomization will be used for the\n      purposes of this study. 316 participants will be recruited based on the sample size\n      calculations already performed. One group of 316 randomized opaque envelopes will be\n      prepared. These sealed envelopes will be stored in a secured designated area at Tampa\n      General Hospital. Once a patient has agreed to participate and is consented an envelope will\n      be selected from the next sequentially numbered envelope and the number on the envelope will\n      be recorded on their study sheet. Enrollment will continue until 316 participants have been\n      recruited."
