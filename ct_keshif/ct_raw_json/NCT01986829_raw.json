                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed high-grade metastatic sarcoma that has been\n             stable on 6-12 cycles of one chemotherapeutic regimen (cytotoxic or biologic)\n             although a change in chemotherapy is allowed if it is a result of\n             toxicity/tolerability rather than progression.  A patient must not have evidence of\n             progression at any time while on chemotherapy in order to be eligible for this trial.\n\n          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one\n             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \u226510 mm with CT scan, PET CT, or MRI\n             exam.\n\n          -  At least 18 years of age.\n\n          -  ECOG performance status \u2264 2 (Karnofsky \u226560%)\n\n          -  Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:\n\n          -  Leukocytes \u2265 3,000/mcL\n\n          -  Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mcl\n\n          -  Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcl\n\n          -  Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5 x IULN or 3x IULN with normal ALT and AST in patients with\n             Gilbert's disease\n\n          -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 3.0 x IULN\n\n          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Creatinine clearance \u2265 50\n             mL/min/1.73 m2 for patients with creatinine levels above institutional normal\n\n          -  INR<1.5 or patient off Coumadin at the time of ablation\n\n          -  No more than 10 treatable lesions as evaluated by an experienced interventional\n             oncologic radiologist for eligibility and lesion accessibility as the ablation of\n             more than 10 lesions becomes technically infeasible.  These lesions must be treated\n             in a two- to three-week time period from initial interventional radiology evaluation.\n              Lung and liver lesions can range from 1 cm to 7 cm for a single lesion and no\n             greater than 5 cm for multiple lesions. There are no size criteria for the osseous\n             lesions.\n\n          -  The lesions will be amenable to a safe, ultrasound/computed tomographic/fluoroscopic\n             guided percutaneous approach. The targeted metastases must be sufficiently\n             separateable from the central nervous system, major peripheral motor nerves, bowel,\n             and bladder.  All lesions must be amenable to treatment.\n\n          -  If patients have received radiation therapy, there must be a one-month washout\n             period.\n\n          -  Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception\n             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and\n             for the duration of ablation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is\n             pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating physician\n             immediately.\n\n          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative if applicable) must be able to\n             understand and willing to sign an IRB approved written informed consent document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          -  History of other malignancy \u2264 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or\n             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or\n             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n\n          -  Receiving any other investigational agents simultaneously or within 3 weeks following\n             ablation procedure.\n\n          -  Known brain metastases.  Patients with known brain metastases must be excluded from\n             this clinical trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop\n             progressive neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic\n             and other adverse events.\n\n          -  Intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection,\n             symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia,\n             or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study\n             requirements.\n\n          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.\n\n          -  Patients that wish to continue chemotherapy after ablation, as ablation therapy is\n             meant to serve as maintenance therapy in lieu of chemotherapy.\n\n          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities\n\n        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial."
