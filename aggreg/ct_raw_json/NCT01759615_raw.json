            "textblock": "This research is being conducted in preterm newborns with 'in utero' growth restriction due\n      to inadequate blood flow from the mother to the baby. These deprived babies adapt to the not\n      so conducive uterine environment by certain adjustments in blood supply to internal organs\n      thereby permitting as best as possible blood flow to brain heart etc., which are the vital\n      organs and whose adequate functioning is required for survival. In this bargain the gut\n      (intestines) gets poor blood supply and hence its appropriate functioning is jeopardized. In\n      the past such babies (after birth) were not fed for days together which compromised their\n      growth even further. Premature growth restricted' babies are at increased risk of further\n      growth faltering if not fed in time as also to a condition called 'Necrotising\n      enterocolitis' if fed liberally like other healthy neonates, characterized by abdominal\n      distension, blood in stools and inability to feed for much longer duration thereby further\n      affecting growth. This study is evaluating a feeding schedule of early versus late\n      initiation of feeding to arrive at the best time to feed such doubly jeopardized premature\n      growth restricted babies to avert the above mentioned consequences.\n\n      No study has been conducted in India to confirm the aforementioned fact and hence this study\n      has been planned. The information learned from this study will help us to feed these small\n      premature as well as growth restricted babies with AREDF better which will go a long way in\n      the care of such preterm growth restricted newborns."

            "textblock": "Absence or reversal of end diastolic flow (AREDF) in the umbilical artery is associated with\n      poor outcome. This is further exaggerated by the presence of intrauterine growth retardation\n      and oligohydramnios. Elective premature delivery of such fetuses is common. AREDF leads to\n      circulatory redistribution with decreased blood flow to the lung, intestines, kidneys, skin,\n      and muscle, and blood diverted to the brain, myocardium and adrenals. This reduction in\n      visceral perfusion has been associated with an increased risk of necrotising enterocolitis,\n      cerebral haemorrhage, and neonatal morbidity. Because of concern that feedings may increase\n      the risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, some high-risk infants (most studies on preterm AGA)\n      have received prolonged periods of parenteral nutrition without enteral feedings. Providing\n      trophic feedings (small volume feedings given at the same rate for at least 5 days) during\n      this period of parenteral nutrition was developed as a strategy to enhance feeding tolerance\n      and decrease time to reach full feedings. Whether trophic feedings result in better outcomes\n      than initially withholding feedings or providing progressively increasing feedings can be\n      established only in proper clinical trials.\n\n      There are no standard guidelines to feed these preterm SGA infants born to mothers with\n      abnormal antenatal Doppler studies. Furthermore, there are no randomized trials on feeding\n      strategies in this group of neonates and hence we planned to carry out this study on\n      comparison of early versus delayed initiation of feeding in preterm SGA infants with AREDF.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare the time to reach full enteral feeds, time to regain\n      birth weight etc. in babies who are fed carefully versus those who are not fed for the\n      initial days. It is postulated that early gut priming may stimulate the gut to secrete\n      certain trophic and growth factors which may make it better able to tolerate enteral feeds\n      improving the overall growth and also reducing chances of infection."
