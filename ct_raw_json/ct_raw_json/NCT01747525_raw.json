Patients must meet all inclusion and exclusion criteria prior to consent. All\n      information requested as part of this study will be obtained from clinical data as part of\n      each subject's standard medical care. Cardiac catheterization and percutaneous coronary\n      intervention will be performed according to standard guidelines and clinical practice. All\n      aspects of clinical care of the patient will follow routine standards as determined by\n      institutional policies, published clinical practice guidelines, and the treating physician.\n\n      After completion of routine invasive coronary angiography and upon determining that the\n      patient has either (1) an epicardial de novo coronary artery lesion of indeterminate\n      severity (>50% to <70% stenosis) that requires IVUS analysis for further delineation of\n      stenosis (blockage) severity; or (2) a severe epicardial de novo coronary artery lesion that\n      requires PCI for definitive treatment, combined NIR-IVUS imaging will be carried out in the\n      target-vessel. Upon completion of NIRS-IVUS imaging of the target-vessel, percutaneous\n      intervention will be performed in the standard fashion if deemed clinically appropriate.\n      Upon completion of target-vessel intervention, NIRS-IVUS imaging will then be repeated in\n      the target-vessel.\n\n      Upon completion of the treatment of the target-vessel, NIRS-IVUS will be performed in any\n      other major epicardial vessel containing a stenosis \u226530% if deemed appropriate by the\n      treating cardiologist.\n\n      Patients will be carefully monitored throughout their hospital stay and will be followed\n      either by office visit or by telephone at 6 months (\u00b1 7 days); 12 months (\u00b1 14 days); 24\n      months (\u00b1 30 days); 36 months (\u00b1 30 days); 48 months (\u00b1 30 days); and 60 months (\u00b1 30 days).\n\n      The patient's medical records will be accessed to collect data about medical history and\n      activities during the course of the study. All data will be collected by using standard case\n      report forms. Follow up data after discharge will be collected using a phone script\n      questionnaire . All data forms will include  unique study identifiers to protect the\n      participants personal identity. All data will be recorded in an Excel spreadsheet and kept\n      on a secure computer requiring password entry.\n\n      There are no additional required medical procedures as part of this protocol beyond the use\n      of the NIRS-IVUS catheter during the index procedure."
