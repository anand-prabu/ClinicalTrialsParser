The battery of tests is repeated after the first and second treatment period. In\n      addition, a second test-battery will be performed at these follow-up intervals, to assess\n      neuropsychological parameters of information processing. To evaluate the extend of the\n      treatment effects, the patients will be matched (age, gender, parental socioeconomic status)\n      to 24 healthy controls."
