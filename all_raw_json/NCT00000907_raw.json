It is recommended that people who are likely to get DMAC be placed\n      on preventive medications which help reduce the risk of infection. New anti-HIV combination\n      drug therapies can increase CD4 cell counts and can reduce the level of HIV in the blood.\n      When CD4 counts are increased, risk of DMAC infection is less. This study examines whether\n      it is possible to stop preventive therapy for DMAC when CD4 counts are high without placing\n      individuals at risk for getting DMAC again."

HAART (highly active\n      antiretroviral therapy) seems to significantly reduce the incidence of MAC.  This study\n      tests the validity of those observations.\n\n      Peripheral blood cultures and bone marrow (aspirate) samples from 50 eligible patients\n      previously diagnosed with disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (DMAC) are assessed for\n      microbiologic sterilization of MAC at the time of study entry. If either bone marrow or\n      blood cultures test positive for MAC, patients are discontinued from study. If cultures\n      prove sterile, patients receive 6 weeks of treatment and then discontinue MAC therapy at\n      Week 6 (entry into Step 2 of study). They are then monitored for clinical signs and symptoms\n      of MAC recurrence and for the presence of mycobacteria in blood cultures. In cases of\n      increased viral load during study, modification of antiretroviral therapy is allowed at the\n      discretion of the patient's provider."
