Antiviral therapy may kill viruses such as HTLV-1 that can\n      cause cancer. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining\n      chemotherapy with antiviral drugs and interferon alfa may be effective in treating adult\n      T-cell leukemia/lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed\n      by antiviral therapy and interferon alfa in treating patients who have adult T-cell\n      leukemia/lymphoma caused by HTLV-1."

Patients also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on\n      day 7 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21-28 days for at\n      least 2 courses beyond best response or for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity, disease progression, or stable disease.\n\n      Beginning 1 month after completion of EPOCH, patients receive oral lamivudine and zidovudine\n      twice daily and interferon alfa SC daily continuously for 1 year.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months\n      for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
