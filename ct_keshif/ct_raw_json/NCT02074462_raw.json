            "textblock": "Voriconazole is a broad-spectrum antifungal agent. There is evidence for a relation between\n      the efficacy and safety of voriconazole and voriconazole trough concentrations. There are\n      several factors that could influence voriconazole concentrations. Inflammation could be one\n      of these factors. In a retrospective study was observed  that reduced metabolism of\n      voriconazole was related to inflammation in patients with severe infections. Reduced\n      metabolism of voriconazole resulted in high voriconazole levels and low N-oxide metabolite\n      (inactive metabolite of voriconazole) levels. The purpose of this study is to determine an\n      algorithm to guide dosing of voriconazole during severe inflammation and to develop a\n      multiple linear regression model to describe the contribution of CRP concentrations to the\n      variability in voriconazole levels and metabolic ratio."
