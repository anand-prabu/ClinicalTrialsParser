      With this study, in which the incidence of pregnancy in classic galactosemia patients is
      studied, we aim to provide new insights to improve counselling. Our hypothesis is that the
      chance that a galactosemic woman with POI becomes pregnant is higher than the 5-10% that has
      been reported for women with POI due to other causes. Chance of spontaneous pregnancy will
      be evaluated through semi standardized interview in women with classic galactosemia aged 18
      years or older. During the interview, questions will be asked regarding fertility and
      pregnancy.
