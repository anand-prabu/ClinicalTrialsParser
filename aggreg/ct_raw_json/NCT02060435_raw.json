This lymphoma is defined as EBV+ clonal B-cell\n      proliferation in immunocompetent adults older than 50 years. To denote patient age in\n      definition of this disease, age cutoff was defined as older than 50 years. However, this\n      cutoff is clearly arbitrary without any scientific background. the knowledge on EBV+DLBCL in\n      young adult is very scanty. This EBV+DLBCL in young adult can be the same disease entity or\n      it can be a distinct disease form EBV+DLBCL of elderly."
