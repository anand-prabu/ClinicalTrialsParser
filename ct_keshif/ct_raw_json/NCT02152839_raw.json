In order to slow this loss we need to\n      understand fully the mechanisms regulating muscle mass with ageing. In this project we aim\n      to determine these mechanisms using a new novel technique of 'heavy' water ingestion, which\n      will allow us to measure multiple aspects of skeletal muscle mass control during normal\n      everyday activities in young and old individuals over a period of 6 weeks.  We will also\n      determine the influence of resistance exercise training during this period in offsetting\n      declines in muscle with ageing using this method"
