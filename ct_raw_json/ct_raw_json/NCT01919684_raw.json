Subjects who qualify for Group G (T2DM)\n      will discontinue any anti-diabetic medication on Day -9 (1 week prior to confinement) for\n      that group.  Subjects in Groups A, B, C, D, E and F will be admitted to the study site on\n      Day -1 , and Group G will be admitted to the study site on Day -2.  Groups of 8 subjects\n      will be randomized in a double-blind manner to receive either LGD-6972 or placebo (6\n      active:2 placebo) as a single dose.  Group D will receive treatment under fasted and fed\n      conditions separated by a washout period of at least 14 days and up to 21 days. Each subject\n      will be administered a specified dose of LGD-6972 or placebo under fasting conditions (and\n      fed conditions for Group D to evaluate the effects of food on the LGD-6972 PK profile) and\n      will be observed through the morning of Day 3 (48 hour post dose assessment).  Safety\n      assessments, LGD-6972 PK sample collection, and PD assessments will occur during this time.\n      Subjects will be discharged from the study site after the 48 hour assessments and return to\n      the study site on Day 7 for a follow up evaluation.  After the follow up evaluation for each\n      subject and evaluation of all safety and tolerability data, and any available PK data, the\n      dose for the next group of subjects will be determined by the Safety Monitoring Panel (SMP)."
