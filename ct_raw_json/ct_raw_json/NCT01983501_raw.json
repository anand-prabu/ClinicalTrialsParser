T-DM1 will be administered intravenously on day 1 of each cycle\n      (except cycle 1, when it will be administered on day 2 to allow for PK assessments of\n      ONT-380 alone). ONT-380 will be administered orally, twice per day on days 1-21 of each\n      cycle.\n\n      There will be 3-6 evaluable patients enrolled in each cohort in the dose escalation phase,\n      unless that dose is found to be intolerable prior to completion of enrollment.  At least 6\n      evaluable patients are to be treated at a dose level in order for an MTD/RD to be declared.\n      Once an MTD/RD is declared, an additional 9 evaluable patients will be in enrolled in a\n      MTD/RD expansion cohort for a total of 15 evaluable patients to be treated at the MTD/RD.\n\n      In addition to the MTD/RD expansion cohort, an optional additional cohort of up to 15\n      evaluable patients with either untreated, asymptomatic CNS metastases not needing immediate\n      local therapy or progressive CNS metastasis following local therapy may also be enrolled and\n      treated at the MTD/RD. Up to 48 evaluable patients may be treated in this study."
