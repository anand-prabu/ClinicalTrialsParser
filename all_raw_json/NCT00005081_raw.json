II. Determine the toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by\n      carmustine IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18-32 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-18\n      months."
