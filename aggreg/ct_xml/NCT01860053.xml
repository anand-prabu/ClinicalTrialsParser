    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to reduce problematic vomiting and associated gastrointestinal
      symptoms in post-operative LAGB patients. We hypothesize that our behavioral intervention
      will yield greater reductions in vomiting and associated symptoms compared to our control
      condition.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age between 18 and 70 years.

          2. Received LAGB surgery with either a standard Lap-Band or a standard Realize Band.
