This research study developed and tested a \"Beverage\n      Choice and Lifestyle Modification\" (BCLM) intervention for 4 to 8 year old children who are\n      at-risk for being overweight or are overweight and who consume large amounts of sugar\n      sweetened beverages and juice.  The overall study objectives were to test the acceptability\n      and effectiveness of the BCLM intervention for improving the weight status, energy (kcal)\n      intake, beverage selections and beverage preferences of children in targeted age and BMI\n      group. The investigators hypothesized that those children randomized to the BCLM group will\n      show greater improvements in weight and Body Mass Index (BMI) status, beverage choices,and\n      energy intake than those assigned to our Nutrition Education (NE) group."
