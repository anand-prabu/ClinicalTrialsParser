Subjects will be randomly assigned to dosing with CyclASol\u00ae eye drops or Placebo\n      (vehicle) in the first part (first period) of the study, and switched to the alternative\n      dosing in the second part (second period) of the study. An ophthalmological assessment of\n      the eyes will be performed, and a questionnaire will be issued in the beginning and after\n      each dosing. Additionally physical examinations, safety laboratory and ECGs will be\n      performed, and blood samples will be analyzed for Cyclosporine A and Placebo (vehicle)."
