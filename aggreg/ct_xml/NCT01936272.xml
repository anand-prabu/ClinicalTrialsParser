  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      World over, infants with hydrocephalus are mainly treated using a shunt, which is a device
      made of soft plastic tubing that moves extra fluid from the brain to the abdomen. Surgery is
      required to insert a shunt into the brain and the abdomen. In recent years, we have
      developed another treatment called Endoscopic Third Ventriculostomy (ETV) with Choroid
      Plexus Cauterization (ETV/CPC). This research study is being done to measure the results of
      these procedures in children less than six months of age who have hydrocephalus as the
      result of a brain infection, called post-infectious hydrocephalus, or PIH. This is the most
      common cause of hydrocephalus in Ugandan babies. This study will evaluate patients in more
      detail to measure brain growth and development. Children in the study will have special
      testing to measure developmental progress as well as special imaging to evaluate the
      progress of their brain growth.

             ventriculoscopy as an adjunct to shunt placement

          -  Any patient with absence of any visible cortical mantle on the CT

          -  Patients must be appropriate candidates for either surgical procedure - shunt
             placement alone or ETV/CPC
