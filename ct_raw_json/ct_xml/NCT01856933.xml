      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of Prostate Specific Membrane
      Antigen (PSMA ADC), as well as its safety and side effects for patients with advanced brain
      tumors. This study will also study how your body metabolizes (breaks down) PSMA ADC.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PSMA expression has been demonstrated in the tumor neovasculature of Glioblastoma Multiforme
      (GBM) by immunohistochemical staining.  Strong reactivity to the antibody component of PSMA
      ADC was observed in the endothelial cells of new tumor blood vessels in GBM. Since the
      endothelial cells are located on the luminal surface of blood vessels, PSMA ADC does not
      need to cross the blood brain barrier to reach its target.  Following binding and
      internalization of PSMA ADC, the cytotoxic component of PSMA ADC will be released and
      destroy the neovasculature that supports tumor growth.  Therefore, PSMA ADC may be an active
      treatment for GBM.

      Bevacizumab, an inhibitor of angiogenesis, has been shown to be effective in improving
      progression-free survival as a single agent.  Thus PSMA ADC, which targets tumor
      angiogenesis by a mechanism different from that of bevacizumab, may be a novel therapeutic
      modality for GBM.

      A phase 2 study of PSMA ADC is proposed for patients with GBM that have progressed after
      standard treatment that includes radiation, temozolomide and bevacizumab. A phase 1 study of
      PSMA ADC in prostate cancer is ongoing and a phase 2 dose level of 2.5 mg/kg IV every 3
      weeks has been defined. Treatment after bevacizumab failure for patients with GBM is a major
      unmet medical need. If activity were demonstrated in this trial, a definitive randomized
      study would be proposed.
