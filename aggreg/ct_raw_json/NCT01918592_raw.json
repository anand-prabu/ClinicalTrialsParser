Currently the investigators lack\n      accurate imaging technologies in clinical staging and estimation of response to neoadjuvant\n      chemotherapy as well as prognostic biomarkers.\n\n      In the current study novel imaging modality (MRI/PET) is utilized to stage bladder cancer\n      prior to transurethral resection of bladder-tumor and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Also\n      prognostic biomarkers are studied from TUR-BT tissues, blood and urine to estimate response\n      to neoadjuvant chemotherapy."
