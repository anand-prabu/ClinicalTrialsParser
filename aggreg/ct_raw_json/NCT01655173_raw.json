The recreational activity intervention served as a low-impact option,\n      easily organised within the community. It is not a placebo; rather it controls for the\n      positive effects that come out of a structured social environment and group setting. The\n      investigators hypothesized that both interventions would lead to improvement in quality of\n      life, well-being and relief in psychiatric symptoms, with a greater effect in the Cognitive\n      Behavioural Therapy intervention compared to recreational activity. A cumulative follow-up\n      was made, within  5 1/2 years after the start of the treatments. Additional questions\n      adapted to the patient group were added at this 5 1/2 year time point."
