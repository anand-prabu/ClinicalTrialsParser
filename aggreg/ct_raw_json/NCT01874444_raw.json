We aimed to investigate whether rTMS of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and\n      primary auditory cortex are capable of reducing tinnitus loudness. Linked to a\n      neuronavigation system that is guided by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the frontal and\n      temporal, rTMS can suppress areas of cortical plasticity. This cortical reorganization can\n      be demonstrated by magnetoencephalography (MEG)"
