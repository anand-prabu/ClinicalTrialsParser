Electrode leads are inserted into a receiver/stimulator implanted in a\n      subcutaneous pocket in the abdomen.  Following implantation, patients undergo training in\n      standing, transfers, and other advanced mobility skills using the functional neuromuscular\n      stimulation system.  Restricted activity continues for 2 weeks after surgery, followed by 8\n      weeks of exercise.  Standing training then begins, and continues for up to 6 weeks.\n      Home-based training follows prior to discharge with the system for spontaneous use.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months, then annually thereafter."
