  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigator plans to examine the gastrointestinal (GI) physiologic profile of Teduglutide,
      a Glucagon-like Peptide 2 Analog as a possible intestinotrophic growth factor capable of
      inducing small bowel adaptation and regeneration in patients with short bowel syndrome
      (SBS), with the potential to decrease parenteral nutrition dependence.

    <description>Qualifying participants will be assigned to 2 different  treatment arms consisting of placebo or Teduglutide 0.05 mg/kg/d administered subcutaneously for 7 days.  Subsequently, participants will switch over to alternate treatment arm.  In both arms participant will undergo a series of measurements, including 8 hour GI transit, permeability measurements by using mannitol and lactulose, and 8 hour urine and stool collections.</description>
