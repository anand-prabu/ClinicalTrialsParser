    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe change of HbA1c over time from baseline to month 12.
       The ultimate goal of this study is to provide a local reference value to the physicians &amp;
      patients in the future when they consider initiating Vildagliptin and taking balance between
      efficacy, compliance, risk factors, convenience and medication cost.
