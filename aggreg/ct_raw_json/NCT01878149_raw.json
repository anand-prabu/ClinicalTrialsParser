Given that fusion generally takes at least 6\n      months to determine, the aim of this study is not to determine fusion but to consider the\n      short-term (out to 6 months) reported adverse events between the two cohorts.\n\n      Devices used in both systems are cleared for use and conform to US regulatory requirements.\n      The study employs these procedures and devices for uses that are consistent with their\n      510(k), legally cleared, labeling."
