  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are doing this research study to find out if people who get better while taking a
      specific kind of antidepressant medication (a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, or
      SSRI) and people who get better while taking placebo (an inactive substance) have similar
      chemicals in their brains.  Some participants may complete a procedure called Acute
      Tryptophan Depletion (ATD), which is a way to study the role of serotonin in depression.
      Some participants may also undergo a magnetic resonance-positron emission tomography
      (MR-PET) scan.

    <description>We will examine differences in scores on the the HAMD-28 before and after acute tryptophan depletion. Changes in these parameters will be compared between placebo responders and drug responders using unpaired two-tailed t-tests.
The HAMD-28 measures depression severity, and has a minimum value of 0 and a maximum value of 81 units on a scale, where higher scores indicate more severe depression.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Meets diagnostic criteria for Major Depressive Disorder

          -  Written informed consent

          -  Men or women aged 18-60 years old

          -  A score of 18 or greater on the HAMD-28

          -  Patient must continue to meet criteria for current MDD at baseline. Patients must
             have Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI) scores â‰¥ 3 (i.e. minimally improved
             or less) from the screen to the baseline visit

          -  Agreeing to, and eligible for all procedures (only patients 18-45 will be eligible
             for MR-PET study)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pregnant women or women of child bearing potential not using a medically accepted
             means of contraception

          -  Patients who are a serious suicide or homicide risk

          -  Unstable medical illness including cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, respiratory,
             endocrine, neurological, or hematological disease, uncontrolled seizure disorder

          -  The following DSM-IV diagnoses: a) organic mental disorders b) substance use
             disorders, including alcohol, active within the last year; c) schizophrenia; d)
             delusional disorder; e) psychotic disorders not elsewhere classified; f) bipolar
             disorder; g) acute bereavement; h) borderline or antisocial personality disorder i)
             current primary diagnoses of panic disorder, social phobia, GAD, or OCD (disorders
             that present as chief complaint and/or have their onset preceding the onset of MDD),
             l) Patients with mood congruent or mood incongruent psychotic features

          -  Currently taking any of the following exclusionary medications: antipsychotics,
             anticonvulsants, mood stabilizers, stimulants, antidepressants, potential
             antidepressant augmenting agents (e.g., T3, SAMe, St. John's Wort, lithium,

             medication, the patient will be required to wait a period equivalent to at least 5
             half lives of the drug before the screening

          -  Patients who have taken an investigational psychotropic drug within the last year

          -  Patients who have not responded to one or more antidepressant trials of adequate
             doses (e.g., fluoxetine 40 mg/day or higher) and duration (e.g., for six weeks or
             more) over the past five years, as defined by the MGH-ATRQ

             rTMS, or other somatic antidepressant treatments
