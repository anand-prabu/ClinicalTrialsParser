Plasma\n      samples for the analysis of finasteride/tamsulosin were collected up to 48 h after drug\n      administration. Participants received either reference (in combination of of 0.2mg\n      tamsulosin and 5mg finasteride) or test drug formulation (single pill combination of 0.2mg\n      tamsulosin and 5mg finasteride) in the first period and the alternative formulation in the\n      second period. Plasma concentrations of both tamsulosin and finasteride were determined by\n      validated high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry\n      detection. Pharmacokinetic parameters, including Cmax and AUC, were determined by\n      noncompartmental analysis. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using\n      log-transformed Cmax and AUC, and the mean ratios and their 90% confidence intervals (CI)\n      were calculated. According to regulatory requirements set forth by Korea and the US Food and\n      Drug Administration, products meet the criteria for bioequivalence if the 90% CIs of the\n      mean ratios for Cmax and AUC are within the range of 0.80 to 1.25."
