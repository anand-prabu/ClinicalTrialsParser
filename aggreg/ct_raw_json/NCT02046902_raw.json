Several sets of focus groups will be convened, with particular attention to\n      recruitment of a diverse population, including women and underserved minority groups.\n\n      Study Procedure: We will gather input to create a clinically useful format for presenting\n      the risk estimates for desired outcomes and support clinical decision-making.\n\n      Subjects:  We anticipate 2 or 3 patient focus groups of 6-8 individuals and 2 clinician\n      focus groups of 3-5 individuals will be scheduled.  Fliers will be posted to enlist\n      potential patients.  If necessary, patients will also be contacted by a Cardiovascular\n      Research Coordinator and invited to attend a scheduled focus group.   After receiving\n      patient/family/caregiver input, selected clinicians from the Saint Lukes Hospital Staff,\n      including cardiologists, cardiac nurses and other cardiology staff, will be invited to\n      attend a scheduled focus group. The invitation will be sent via email and followed up with a\n      phone call, if necessary. If a clinician focus group is unable to be scheduled, then\n      individual interviews will be conducted.\n\n      Setting: Patient and Clinician focus group sessions will be held at Saint Luke's Hospital."

The transcripts come from audiotaping each Focus Group where a trained facilitator will lead a discussion of: participant experiences of PCI procedures or other medical/surgical procedure preparation; elicitation of key outcomes (avoiding repeat procedures, costs, bleeding, etc.). In addition, examples of potential visual displays of risk and benefit presentations will be shown; and consensus will be achieved for each Focus Group on the clearest, most optimal mode of presentation.",
