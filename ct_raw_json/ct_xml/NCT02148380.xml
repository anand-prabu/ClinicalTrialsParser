  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The results of fastact2 show that chemotherapy plus erlotinib significantly prolonged PFS
      and OS of patients with NSCLC. However, outcome of the combination therapy are similar to
      those reported in several trials of single-agent EGFR TKIs. So which is the optimal
      first-line treatment for patients who harbored a sensitive EGFR mutation? The investigators
      need a head-to-head study to reply.
