            "textblock": "Congenital cytomegalovirus (cCMV) is the most frequent congenital infection in France.\n      Around 90% of cCMV infected infants are asymptomatic at birth, of whom 7 to 20% develop\n      sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL). cCMV explains at least 10% of all hearing loss cases in\n      young children. Early antiviral treatment (implemented before 1 month of age) with\n      ganciclovir or valganciclovir improved hearing outcome. In the absence of universal\n      screening, cCMV remains largely undetected because most infected neonates are asymptomatic\n      or have non-specific symptoms. When symptoms become apparent or develop, it may be too late\n      for confirmation that the infection is of congenital origin; diagnosis of congenital\n      infection is based on the detection of CMV in samples collected within 2 to 3 weeks after\n      birth. The presence of CMV in samples collected after this time may represent postnatal\n      infection which does not carry the risk of hearing loss or neurodevelopmental sequelae.\n      Universal hearing screening at birth by use of otoacoustic emission (OAE) is now offered in\n      most maternities in France to detect symptomatic hearing impairment at birth but screening\n      of cCMV infection is not coupled with this screening.
