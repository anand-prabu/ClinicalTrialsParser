Determine the biodistribution and biokinetics of iodine I 131-labeled\n      monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 in patients with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma. II.\n      Determine the human anti-human monoclonal antibody response in patients treated with this\n      drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive iodine I 131-labeled monoclonal antibody CC49-delta CH2 (131I MOAB\n      CC49-delta CH2) IV over 5-10 minutes on day 0. Patients also receive unlabeled monoclonal\n      antibody CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5 minutes followed by 131I MOAB CC49-delta CH2 IV over 5-10\n      minutes on day 28. Patients are followed weekly for 4 months and then every 3 months for 1\n      year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
