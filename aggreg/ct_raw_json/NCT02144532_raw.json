            "textblock": "The Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a rare genetic disease caused by an anomaly of the\n      connective tissue. This syndrome has different forms. Hypermobility type is the most common.\n      It is characterized by generalized joint hypermobility, associated with a chronic pain\n      syndrome. Pains appear as the most frequent demonstration of this syndrome, the worst lived\n      and the most crippling.\n\n      Faced with insufficient effect of drug treatment, other alternatives have been proposed to\n      relieve these patients. Compression garments have been developed.  They appear as medical\n      devices targeted specifically for patients with hypermobility EDS type: in the symptomatic\n      treatment of joint pain, in stabilizing joints by proprioceptive effect and of muscle\n      globulization, and in the functional improvement.\n\n      The VETCOSED study is a quasi-experimental study of type \"Before / After\", monocentric,\n      open. The study is realized in the Centre M\u00e9dico-Chirurgical et de R\u00e9adaptation des Massues\n      - Croix Rouge Fran\u00e7aise de Lyon, in association with the P\u00f4le Information M\u00e9dicale\n      Evaluation Recherche des Hospices Civils de Lyon. This study concerns about 40 patients with\n      EDS hypermobility type, which will be followed for 8 weeks:   4 weeks during which they will\n      wear a compression custom-made garment (short-sleeved vest CICATREX SED\u00ae), and 4 weeks\n      during which they do not carry this garment.\n\n      The main objective is to demonstrate the effectiveness of compression garments in the EDS\n      hypermobility type, especially in terms of symptomatic improvement joint pain.\n\n      The main outcomes expected of this study are:\n\n        -  an improvement of the power and the peaks of couple of muscles rotators of shoulders.\n\n        -  a decrease of the pains and the defects of articular stability of the shoulder\n\n        -  an improvement of the quality of life and the functional independence of these patients"
