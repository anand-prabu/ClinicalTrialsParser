  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is associated with a heightened risk for developing type 2 diabetes,
      hypertension, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. Vitamin D is made in the skin when it is exposed
      to sunlight and it is also obtained from the diet and dietary supplements. Older people,
      individuals with high skin pigmentation, obese and sedentary individuals have low levels of
      Vitamin D because pigmentation blocks Vitamin D production in the skin, aging and physical
      inactivity are associated with reduced exposure to sunlight, and obesity is associated with
      the storage of Vitamin D in fat preventing its utilization by muscle, bone and other tissues
      that require its metabolic action. These conditions are also associated with heightened risk
      for developing type 2 diabetes, glucose intolerance, hypertension, and
      osteopenia/osteoporosis in older and obese individuals. This is particularly heightened in
      older women who tend to have increased body fat, are more physically inactive and are at
      high risk for central obesity and its metabolic consequences of diabetes, hypertension and
      osteoporosis.

      The heightened prevalence of obesity in aging especially in postmenopausal women suggests
      that interventions to raise Vitamin D levels might be preventive of these diseases.
      Investigators have completed studies of the effects of weight loss and exercise
      interventions in approximately 400 older women and men over the last 15 years, many of whom
      are obese. Investigators have data on glucose tolerance, blood pressure and bone density in
      these studies and stored plasma in which investigators can analyze Vitamin D levels. Vitamin
      D may be an important risk factor for these metabolic diseases and the availability of these
      samples for Vitamin D analysis will allow investigators to perform a cross-sectional study
      to address relationships of Vitamin D levels to glucose intolerance and diabetes,
      hypertension/blood pressure status, bone mineral density, the degree of obesity, and
      physical activity status measured as maximal aerobic capacity and accelerometry in these
      older men and women.

      The results of this study have the potential to impact clinical practice in the prevention
      and treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and osteopenia/osteoporosis. This would circumvent
      the current dilemma for prevention of these chronic diseases through treatment of obesity,
      as these data would provide immediate prospects for changing the recommended doses of
      Vitamin D beneficial for reducing risk for these diseases.

      The purpose of this study is to 1) determine the prevalence of Vitamin D deficiency in
      obese, older men and postmenopausal women and 2) the association of Vitamin D levels to
      glucose tolerance, blood pressure, bone mineral density, and hyperlipidemia, as well as
      association with Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms affecting metabolic responses to
      Vitamin D.

      Vitamin D, IGF-1, and PTH levels will be measured in coded plasma samples belonging to the
      PI and collaborating Investigators within the GRECC that are stored in our freezers (from
      previously approved studies: HP-00040261,HP-00040975, HP-00041166 and HP-00041199) . The
      Nutrition Obesity research center genetics core will determine Vitamin D receptor
      polymorphisms on de-identified samples. No clinical information will accompany the samples.
