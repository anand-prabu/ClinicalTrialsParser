    <textblock>
      Non-adherence to self-management behaviors is prevalent and accounts for hospital
      readmissions in heart failure (HF) patients 65 years of age and older. The mechanism to
      activate and engage HF patients in managing their own care is uncertain. Yet post-acute care
      service that is vital to improve HF patients' self-management adherence and HF outcomes is
      suboptimal in rural hospitals (primarily critical access hospitals). The investigators
      central hypothesis is that patients with higher activation level will have significantly
      better self-management adherence. This study will test whether Patient AcTivated Care at
      Home (PATCH) will improve self-management adherence and health outcome (reduced hospital
      readmissions), as well as the feasibility to translate the research findings to a home based
      post-acute care service in rural communities.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is among the most prevalent chronic conditions and leading cause of
      hospital readmission in adults 65 years of age and older. HF patients discharged from rural
      critical access hospitals (CAHs) had higher 30-day readmission rates compared to patients
      discharged from urban hospitals. Adhering to recommended self-management behaviors improves
      HF patients' health outcomes and reduces readmissions; however, the prevalence of adherence
      is low in HF patients. In rural communities, low adherence can be attributed to the fact
      that rural HF patients received less information about managing their chronic condition
      based on the investigators preliminary study. Previous studies reported inconsistent
      findings regarding the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve self-management
      adherence. The feasibility of these interventions in rural settings is unknown. Therefore,
      innovative programs are needed to identify the intervention to enhance self-management
      adherence in HF patients living in rural communities. The purpose of this prospective,
      two-group, repeated measures, randomized control trial is to test  the efficacy and
      feasibility of a 12-week activation-enhancing intervention (Patient AcTivated Care at Home
      [PATCH]) on self-management adherence and health outcome (readmission rates) in HF patients
      discharged from rural hospitals (critical access hospitals). A sample size of 96 subjects
      with heart failure will be recruited over 14 month period. Both intervention and control
      groups will receive usual care. The intervention group will additionally receive 2-phase
      PATCH intervention: the in-hospital discharge education session (Phase I) and 12-week
      post-discharge education sessions delivered by telephone (Phase II). The tailored strategies
      are developed to activate patients engaging in self-management behaviors based on their
      baseline activation level. The investigators central hypothesis, based upon their
      preliminary data, is that patients with higher activation level will have significantly
      better self-management adherence. The investigators will test their hypothesis with the
      following Specific Aims: To evaluate the effects of the patient activation intervention on
      self-management adherence (Aim 1) and hospital readmissions (Aim 2) over time. To evaluate
      the mechanism of the patient activation intervention (Aim 3).  To evaluate the feasibility
      of the PATCH intervention (Aim 4). The PATCH intervention is innovative because: 1) it
      translates patient activation theory into intervention strategies to improve self-management
      in a vulnerable population (rural heart failure patients living in rural community), 2) it
      tests the mechanism of patient activation on self-management adherence; 3) it uses the rural
      nursing theory to guide developing a sustainable intervention program in rural communities;
      and 4) it evaluates a biomarker collected by a single urine test as the indicator of
      self-management adherence in HF patients. This study will impact the management of heart
      failure by adding knowledge about the mechanism to improve self-management adherence in
      heart failure patient living in rural communities. Long term adherence to the recommended
      self-management behaviors is the foundation to realize health benefit and reduce burden on
      patients, their family and the healthcare system.
