Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying two different regimens of combination\n      chemotherapy and comparing them to see how well they work in treating patients with\n      high-risk primary stage II or stage III breast cancer."

(Arm I closed to accural as of 4/6/2006.)\n\n        -  Compare the efficacies of these regimens followed by peripheral blood stem cell rescue\n           in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the efficacy of a bisphosphonate to prevent relapse/metastasis after\n           high-dose chemotherapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by stage of disease.\n\n      Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected after mobilization with filgrastim (G-CSF),\n      administered subcutaneously or IV, twice daily beginning 3 days before collection and\n      continuing until collection is complete.\n\n      All patients receive conventional-dose adjuvant chemotherapy, probably comprising\n      doxorubicin IV, cyclophosphamide IV, and fluorouracil IV over 1 hour on days 1, 22, 43, and\n      64. Patients are then randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatment arms of high-dose chemotherapy.\n      (Arm I closed to accrual as of 4/6/2006.)\n\n        -  Arm I (ACT) (closed to accrual as of 4/6/2006): Patients receive doxorubicin IV over 24\n           hours on days -9 to -6, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on day -5, and paclitaxel IV\n           over 24 hours on day -2. PBSC are reinfused on days -2 and 0. G-CSF is administered\n           beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  Arm II (STAMP V): Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV, carboplatin IV, and thiotepa IV\n           over 24 hours on days -7 to -4. PBSC are reinfused and G-CSF is administered as in arm\n           I.\n\n      Within 4-6 weeks of day 0 of high-dose chemotherapy, patients with estrogen and/or\n      progesterone receptor positive tumors receive oral tamoxifen twice daily for 5 years.\n      Patients are also randomized to receive a bisphosphonate comprising pamidronate IV every 4\n      weeks for 2 years.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before therapy, at 30 days after high-dose chemotherapy, and at\n      6 and 12 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for at least 10\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
