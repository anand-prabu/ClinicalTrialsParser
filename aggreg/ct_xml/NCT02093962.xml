  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether TH-302 in combination with pemetrexed is
      safe and effective in the treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TH-302 is designed to target the hypoxic regions of tumors which are generally located
      distant from tumor vessels. Pemetrexed has poor tissue penetration and targets the regions
      of tumors that are located in proximity to the tumor vessels. The presence of hypoxia in
      solid tumors is associated with a more malignant phenotype and resistance to chemotherapy.
      The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to selectively target the hypoxic
      microenvironment. There is evidence supporting the presence of hypoxia in NSCLC lesions
      based on a hypoxia PET study. Combining pemetrexed with TH-302 may enable the targeting of
      both the normoxic and hypoxic regions of NSCLC lesions.
