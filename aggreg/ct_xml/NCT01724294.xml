      This multicenter, observational study will evaluate the correlation between clinical and
      biological factors and International Prognostic Index (IPI) as prognostic factors in
      patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma receiving first-line treatment with
      MabThera/Rituxan (rituximab) in combination with CHOP chemotherapy. Eligible patients
      receiving treatment according to standard of care and local guidelines will be followed for
      the duration of treatment (approximately 8 months) and during 1 year of follow-up.
