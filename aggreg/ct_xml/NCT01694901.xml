  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates whether general anesthesia using a Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic
      (PK/PD) -model-based index indicating the compound effect of different anesthetics leads to
      optimized outcome compared to manually controlled clinical anesthesia and computerized
      Electroencephalogram (EEG).
