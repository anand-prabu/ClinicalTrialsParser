Approximately 100 subjects will be enrolled and treated with study drug for\n      12 weeks.\n\n      Safety will be assessed, at specified time points during the study, through adverse events,\n      local skin responses, serum chemistry and hematology laboratory testing, physical\n      examination and vital signs.\n\n      Preliminary efficacy will be assessed through lesion counts (e.g., inflammatory,\n      noninflammatory) and the Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) for acne."
