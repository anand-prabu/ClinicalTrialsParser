  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the absorption, metabolism, and excretion (AME)
      kinetics of YH4808 and to determine and characterize metabolites present in plasma, urine,
      and feces in man following a single dose of [14C] YH4808 200 mg (~100 µCi ±20 µCi)
      administered as a single oral dose.
