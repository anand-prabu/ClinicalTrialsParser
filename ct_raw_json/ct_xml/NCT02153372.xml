  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the present phase-I clinical trial we investigate safety and feasibility of an
      augmentation with preoperatively isolated autologous BMC cells seeded onto ß-TCP in
      combination with an angle stable fixation (Philos plate®) for the therapy of proximal
      humeral fractures.
