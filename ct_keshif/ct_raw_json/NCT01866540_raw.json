            "textblock": "This research during the last decade has focused on the kinetics of the systemic and local\n      immune response to parenteral influenza vaccine in humans. The investigators have shown that\n      normally high numbers of influenza specific antibody secreting cells (ASC) are present in\n      the nasal mucosa of healthy adults but upon parenteral vaccination the numbers remain\n      stable. However, a rapid transient increase in specific ASC is observed in the tonsils and\n      peripheral blood after parenteral vaccination. In the tonsils, this is associated with a\n      significant decrease in both na\u00efve/effector (CD45RA+) and memory (CD45RO+) CD4+ cells upon\n      vaccination.  In this study the investigators will extend our work to investigate the\n      characteristics of influenza-specific T- and B-cells induced locally and systemically after\n      intranasal vaccination in man."

The\n      primary endpoints of the trial are the evaluation of the systemic and local immune response\n      after live attenuated influenza vaccine. The vaccine specific immune response will be\n      assessed through the induction of specific local and systemic antibody and cellular immune\n      responses, and analyses of the epitopes to which the response is directed. Furthermore the\n      capacity of the vaccine to elicit cross reactive and long lasting immunity will be\n      evaluated."
