Whether switching to rilpivirine (RPV) containing regimen is\n      beneficial among patients who experience mild or asymptomatic\n      neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric adverse events during EFV has not been explored yet.\n\n      The proposed pilot study will examine whether switching from EFV-based regimen to single\n      tablet regimen TDF/FTC/RPV is associated with neurocognitive/neuropsychiatric improvement\n      among HIV-infected patients with mild/asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment or\n      neuropsychiatric symptoms during EFV-containing antiretroviral treatment.\n\n      Patients under stable treatment with EFV, confirmed HIV-1 RNA viral load < 50 copies/mL and\n      altered scores in depression, quality of sleep or anxiety tests and/or alteration in 1 or\n      more domains as assessed by neuropsychological assessment, will be randomized to immediate\n      or deferred (12 weeks) switch to TDF/FTC/RPV. Neurocognitive and neuropsychiatric tests will\n      be repeated after 12 and 24 weeks of follow-up and variations will be compared between\n      groups."
