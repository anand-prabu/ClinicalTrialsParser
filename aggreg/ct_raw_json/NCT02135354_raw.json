Although long-term use of azithromycin is proven effective to prevent\n      exacerbations, inherent risks outweigh the benefits. By reducing the dose and duration of\n      the azithromycin treatment and by restricting the treatment to acute periods with highest\n      risk for treatment failure, benefits may counterbalance potential side effects, which may\n      result in a new treatment strategy for these acute events.\n\n      The present study is designed by the services of respiratory medicine of the Leuven and\n      Ghent University hospitals but will run in total in 17 different large hospitals in Belgium,\n      of which 12 are located in Flanders."
