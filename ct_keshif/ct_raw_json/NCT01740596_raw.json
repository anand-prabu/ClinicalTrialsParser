The C-Pulse\u00ae System is intended\n      to relieve the symptoms of heart failure, improve quality of life and cardiac function, and\n      reduce the need for heart failure hospitalization. It is intended for use in hospital and at\n      home. It is not intended as a replacement for heart function; it is not life sustaining or\n      life-supporting therapy. It does not preclude the use of other heart failure therapies, such\n      as valve surgery, heart transplantation or LVAD.\n\n      The Sunshine Heart C-Pulse System is an implantable, non-blood contacting, non-obligatory,\n      heart assist device. The system provides cardiac assistance through an extra-aortic balloon\n      Cuff and ECG sense lead connected by means of a Percutaneous Interface Lead (PIL) to an\n      external pneumatic Driver. The PIL is held secure externally, at the exit site, with a\n      simple adhesive clip (C-Patch or similar) for immobilization of the external part of the\n      PIL. The Driver is adjusted using a dedicated notebook computer (Programmer) with\n      specialized software.\n\n      The non-blood contacting feature of the C-Pulse\u00ae System also allows the device to be\n      intermittently turned off as tolerated. This allows the patient freedom for personal\n      hygiene."

Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) \u2264 35% (by transthoracic ECHO within 90 days\n             prior to randomization)\n\n          2. ACC/AHA Stage C and NYHA III to ambulatory Class IV\n\n          3. Age \u2265 18 years\n\n          4. Must have cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) when clinically indicated,\n             implanted \u226590 days prior to randomization.\n\n          5. Must have an implanted cardio-defibrillator (ICD) when clinically indicated,\n             implanted at least 30 days prior to randomization.\n\n             Note: If a subject is clinically indicated for an ICD but refuses the ICD, he/she may\n             be enrolled. Please document the refusal of the ICD in the medical record and the\n             eCRFs.\n\n          6. Patient must be on stable, up-titrated medical therapy as recommended according to\n             current guidelines (Circulation. 2009; 119 (12): 1977-2016) which minimally includes:\n\n               -  ACE-inhibitor (ACE-I) at stable doses for 1 month prior to enrollment, if\n                  tolerated, AND\n\n               -  a beta blocker (carvedilol, sustained release metoprolol succinate, or\n                  bisoprolol) for 3 months prior to enrollment, if tolerated, with a stable\n                  up-titrated dose for 1 month prior to enrollment.\n\n               -  This also includes an Angiotensin II Receptor Blocker (ARB) at stable doses for\n                  1 month prior to enrollment, if tolerated, when ACE-I is not tolerated.\n\n               -  Stable is defined as no more than a 100% increase or a 50% decrease in dose. If\n                  the patient is intolerant to ACE-I, ARB, or beta blockers, documented evidence\n                  must be available.\n\n               -  In those intolerant to both ACE-I and ARB, combination therapy with hydralazine\n                  and oral nitrate should be considered. Therapeutic equivalence for ACE-I\n                  substitutions is allowed within the enrollment stability timelines.\n\n               -  Aldosterone inhibitor therapy should be added. Eplerenone requires dosage\n                  stability for 1 month prior to enrollment.\n\n               -  Diuretics may be used as necessary to keep the patient euvolemic.\n\n          7.

Patient understands the nature of the procedure and on-going device therapy, is\n             willing to comply with associated follow-up evaluations, and provide written informed\n             consent prior to the procedure.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1.
