            "textblock": "Osteoporosis is a disease characterized by reduced bone mass and increased skeletal\n      fragility, predisposing to an increased fracture risk. The presence of a low trauma fracture\n      is a powerfull predictor of future fractures and about 50% of patients with a fragility\n      fracture will suffer a subsequent fracture in the next 10 years (Center JR, 2007).\n      Osteoporotic fractures are associated with an increased morbidity and mortality but also\n      high financial costs. However, less than 20% of patients presenting a low trauma fracture\n      receive an appropriate post-fracture osteoporosis management (Little and Eccles, 2010). The\n      hypothesis of a lack of information and an under assessment of consequences by both patients\n      and physicians has been raised to explain this gap between recommanded care and usual\n      practices.\n\n      The aim of the PREVOST program is to assess the efficiency of patient-centered osteoporosis\n      prevention program, after a fragility fracture of the upper limb, to improve post-fracture\n      management of osteoporosis (ie BMD test and / or osteoporosis treatment) in women over 50\n      years old.\n\n      This open randomized controlled trial aims to compare the BMD or osteoporosis treatment\n      prescription rate at 6 months after inclusion between two groups: \"intervention\" receiving\n      information on fracture and osteoporosis (oral and written), phone call reminders and\n      written information to give to their family physician, and \"control\" receiving usual care\n      without information."
