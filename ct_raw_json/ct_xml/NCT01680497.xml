          -  Male or female 18 years of age or older

          -  Have 2 fully visible, approximately symmetrical nasolabial folds and has severity
             scores of 2 or 3 on the 5-point photographic nasolabial fold severity scale (range
             0-4) for both nasolabial folds, as judged by the Investigator

          -  Have a reasonable expectation for correction by injection via deep dermis, as
             described in the protocol

          -  Agree to refrain from undergoing other anti-wrinkle/volumizing treatments in the
             lower two-thirds of the face (below the orbital rim) for the duration of the study

          -  Understand and be willing to follow all aspects of the study protocol and have signed
             and dated the Informed Consent prior to any study-related procedures being performed

          -  Be in good health as in the opinion of the Investigator

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Has undergone cosmetic facial procedures (e.g., face lift or other surgeries) which
             may alter the appearance of the nasolabial fold area

          -  Cosmetic injections in the lower two-thirds of the face (below the orbital rim),
             within 6 months prior to entry in the study, or be planning to undergo any of these
             procedures at any time during the study.  NOTE:  Prior treatment with HA fillers
             and/or collagen is allowed, provided the treatment was administered more than 6
             months prior to study entry

          -  Has undergone volumizing of the mid/lower face within 9 months prior to study entry

          -  Has ever received semi-permanent fillers or permanent facial implants (e.g., calcium
             hydroxylapatite, poly-L-lactic acid, polymethylmethacrylate, silicone, expanded
             poly-tetrafluoroethylene) anywhere in the lower face (below the orbital rim), or be
             planning to be implanted with any of these products at any time during the study

          -  Have a history of anaphylaxis, multiple severe allergies, atopy, allergy to lidocaine
             (an any amide-based anesthetics), HA products, or Streptococcal protein, or be
             planning to undergo a desensitization therapy during the term of the study

          -  Be a pregnant female, lactating, or planning to become pregnant at any time during
             the study

          -  Be a female of childbearing potential not using a reliable means of contraception

          -  Have received any investigational product within 30 days prior to study enrollment or
             be planning to participate in another investigation during the course of this study

          -  Suffer from an uncontrolled personality disorder (e.g., body dysmorphia, depression)

          -  Have a history of  or currently suffer from autoimmune disease (e.g., rheumatoid
             arthritis, Crohn's disease)

          -  Have a history of streptococcal disease (e.g., strep throat or rheumatic fever with
             or without heart complications)

          -  Have a history of skin cancer

          -  Suffer from porphyria

          -  Have epilepsy, which is not controlled by anti-epilepsy therapy

          -  Have a history of treatment with interferon

          -  Be on an ongoing regimen of anti-coagulation therapy (e.g., warfarin) or have taken
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., aspirin, ibuprofen) or other
             substances known to increase coagulation time (e.g., herbal supplements with garlic
             or ginkgo biloba) within 10 days of undergoing study device injection.  NOTE: Study
             device injection may be delayed as necessary to accommodate this 10-day period

          -  Be on a concurrent regimen of high doses of lidocaine (more than 400 mg) which may
             cause acute toxic reactions

          -  Be on a concurrent regimen of other local anesthetics structurally related to
             amide-type local anesthetics

          -  Have impaired cardiac conduction, severely impaired hepatic function, or severe renal
             dysfunction

          -  Have a condition or be in a situation that, in the Investigator's opinion, may put
             the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
             significantly with the subject's participation in the study
