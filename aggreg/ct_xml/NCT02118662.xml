  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed to measure the energy expenditure associated with a common office task
      (i.e., typing) while 1.) seated in an office chair, 2.) pedaling using a prototype pedal
      desk, and 3.) walking on a treadmill.

  <detailed_description>

      The anthropometrics will be measured first. The height and body weight will be collected by
      clinic staff in the clinic.

      The metabolic testing of all conditions will take place in a real office setting. The
      participant will be fitted with a heart rate monitor fastened around their chest using an
      elastic strap. They will also be fitted with a portable metabolic system (COSMED). This unit
      fits around their waist and back, much like a backpack. The unit is attached to a face mask
      that fits over their mouth and nose and is secured by elastic straps which wrap around their
      head.

      The participants will first rest motionless in a chair for 20 minutes. Following this, they
      will complete three different simulated working conditions by typing at a computer while 1)
      seated in an office chair, 2) seated pedaling while using a prototype pedal desk, and 3)
      walking on a treadmill. The order of testing for the seated pedaling and treadmill walking
      working conditions will be counterbalanced with participants randomly assigned to the two
      possible order permutations. They will complete the 3 working conditions for 15 minutes each
      at their own self-selected level of effort. A rest period of 5 minutes will be given between
      each condition. During the working conditions, they will be asked to retype a displayed
      standard set of text.

    <description>Energy expenditure will be measured using a portable metabolic system while performing common office tasks or desk work while sitting, standing, and walking. The portable metabolic system consists of a small gas analysis unit and a battery positioned on the abdomen and mid-back, respectively.  Respiratory gases are collected by mask that fits over the mouth and nose and analyzed by the unit.  The mask does not restrict a participant's breathing, vision or line of sight.</description>
