Secondary: To learn more\n      about the safety of the combination use of the two HIV envelope vaccines in the study\n      (VaxSyn and HIVAC-1e).\n\n      Recent Phase I trials conducted at the AIDS Vaccine Units have shown that antibodies have\n      persisted in most recipients for 6 months after boosting, and responses seem significantly\n      higher and more persistent than responses achieved by just two doses of soluble protein\n      vaccine alone or two doses of HIVAC-1e alone. This study tests in a previously recruited\n      cohort of volunteers whether additional boosting with soluble recombinant gp160 results in\n      increased immunogenicity of longer duration."
