            "textblock": "During the birth process certain conditions can cause oxygen delivery and/or blood flow to\n      the baby's brain to become interrupted. This can cause permanent brain damage. Brain damage\n      occurs in two phases. The first occurs at the time of injury when brain cells in the\n      affected area 'die'. There is nothing that can be done about this. The second phase of\n      injury occurs over the next few days. This second phase is caused by inflammation and\n      release of toxic chemicals from the injured site. Cooling the baby to a temperature of 92.5\u00b0\n      F, for 3 days has been shown to reduce the second phase of injury and bran death. All babies\n      will receive the benefit of cooling. Although cooling helps it does not completely stop the\n      second phase of injury.\n\n      Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that is produced by the brain, and helps regulate\n      the sleep-wake cycle. It has the potential to stop the second phase of brain injury by\n      inhibiting inflammation and release of toxic chemicals. The reason for this research is to\n      find out if melatonin can or cannot improve the outcome of babies with this kind of brain\n      damage. Every baby enrolled in the study has a 50:50 chance of getting melatonin. A total of\n      six doses of medicine will be given. The baby's brain function will be assessed by an EEG,\n      brain oxygen monitoring, and a neurologic examination at 18 months of life. All of these are\n      routinely used as part of standard care for patients with this kind of problem. The only\n      difference is that half the babies enrolled in the study will get the drug called melatonin\n      and the other half will receive placebo. The dose of melatonin being used in the study is\n      higher than the amount normally produced by the body. No side-effects of this dose have been\n      reported in other research studies using melatonin in newborn and premature babies."
