Although fibromyalgia\n      can bring out the disability in daily life, the majority of previous reports only\n      ascertained no significant association between the presence of fibromyalgia and the severity\n      of SLE.\n\n      It is necessary to make unremitting effort to reduce the mortality and life-threatening\n      disease flare-up due to SLE disease itself. Additionally, we think that physicians need to\n      pay more attention to improve health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in the patients with\n      SLE. HRQoL could be influenced by various factors such as depression, fibromyalgia, disease\n      duration, disease activity and etc. To improve the HRQoL in SLE patients, it might be the\n      clinically important and constructive theme to investigate that which is the most important\n      factor among the fibromyalgia, depression, sleep quality, SLE activity and SLE duration.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the degree of contribution of fibromyalgia for\n      reduced HRQoL and to identify the status of managing fibromyalgia in Korean patients with\n      SLE."
