  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exertional dyspnea is a major source of crippling distress and is the hallmark symptom of
      fibrotic interstitial lung disease (ILD). Due to the scientific community's poor
      understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of dyspnea there are no therapeutic
      interventions that consistently reduce dyspnea in this population. The investigators aim to
      determine the physiological mechanisms of exertional dyspnea in patients with fibrotic ILD,
      and the mechanism by which hyperoxia improves exertional dyspnea and exercise endurance.
      This study will likely identify an important physiological mechanism of dyspnea in fibrotic
      ILD and may contribute to the development of effective therapies to reduce dyspnea in this
      population.

      The central hypothesis is that dyspnea in fibrotic ILD is primarily a result of an imbalance
      between the drive to breathe and the tidal volume response of the respiratory system (i.e.,
      neuromechanical uncoupling). The secondary hypothesis is that experimental reduction of
      neuromechanical uncoupling via hyperoxic breathing will reduce exertional dyspnea and
      improve exercise endurance. The tertiary hypothesis is that healthy controls, compared to
      ILD participants, will have significantly less dyspnea and neuromechanical uncoupling with a
      lower work of breathing and a less pronounced physiological and sensory response to
      hyperoxia.

      The purpose of this study is to determine the physiological mechanisms of shortness of
      breath (dyspnea) in patients with fibrotic Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) and to determine
      how breathing supplemental oxygen can manipulate these mechanisms to improve dyspnea and
      exercise capacity.

      The research question is threefold: (1) To determine the physiological mechanisms of
      exertional dyspnea in patients with fibrotic ILD; (2) To determine the mechanism by which
      hyperoxia improves exertional dyspnea and exercise endurance in patients with fibrotic ILD;
      (3) To determine any physiological mechanistic differences of exertional dyspnea between
      participants with fibrotic ILD and healthy control participants.

      Experimental Overview: Participants with fibrotic ILD and control participants will report
      to the exercise laboratory on four separate occasions separated by a minimum of 48 hours
      between visits.  On visit 1, participants and control participants will complete medical
      history screening, chronic activity-related dyspnea questionnaires, anthropometric
      measurements, pulmonary function assessment, and a symptom limited incremental cycle
      exercise test for familiarization purposes. On visit 2, participants and control
      participants will perform pulmonary function testing followed by another incremental cycle
      exercise test.  Detailed physiological and sensory measurements will be obtained on both
      visits but the primary analysis will be based on visit 2 results. Data from visit 2 will
      address the central and tertiary hypotheses. Visits 3 and 4 will include pulmonary function
      testing followed by a constant-load cycle exercise test at 75% of peak incremental work rate
      while breathing, in randomized order, either room air or hyperoxia (60% oxygen).
      Participants and control participants breathing hyperoxia on visit 3 will breathe room air
      on visit 4 and vice versa while being blinded to the gas concentration.  A multi-pair
      electrode catheter that combines two balloons will be inserted into the esophagus and near
      infrared spectroscopy will be used to measure tissue oxygenation on visits 2, 3 and 4. Data
      from visits 3 and 4 will address the secondary and tertiary hypothesis.

      Measurements:

        -  Pulmonary Function: simple spirometry, plethysmography, diffusing capacity, maximum
           respiratory pressures, static compliance and recoil pressure will be performed on visit
           1. Pulmonary function testing on visits 2-4 will only include spirometry and
           plethysmography so that total lung capacity and vital capacity can be obtained for the
           determination of operating lung volumes.

        -  Dyspnea Evaluation: Dyspnea intensity and perceived leg discomfort will be evaluated at
           rest, every minute during exercise, and at peak exercise using the modified 10-point
           Borg scale on all testing visits. Upon exercise cessation, subjects will be asked to
           verbalize their main reason(s) for stopping exercise (i.e., breathing discomfort, leg
           discomfort, combination of breathing and legs, or some other reason) and to select
           qualitative descriptors of breathlessness using an established questionnaire.

        -  Cardio-respiratory Responses to Exercise: Standard cardio-respiratory measures,
           including minute ventilation, oxygen consumption (VO2), carbon dioxide production,
           partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide, tidal volume (VT), and breathing
           frequency. Operating volumes will be derived from dynamic inspiratory capacity (IC)
           manoeuvres. Arterial oxygen saturation will be measured using pulse oximetry.
           Electrocardiography and blood pressure will be monitored for safety purposes.

        -  Respiratory Mechanics: Diaphragmatic electromyography (EMGdi) will be measured using a
           multi-pair electrode catheter that combines two balloons for measuring esophageal and
           gastric pressures. The ratio of EMGdi to EMGdimax will be used as an index of neural
           respiratory drive. The ratio between VT and vital capacity (VC) will be used to
           represent the mechanical response of the respiratory system. Normalizing for EMGdimax
           and VC allows the stimulus intensity to be standardized and compared across
           individuals. Thus neuromechanical uncoupling of the respiratory system will be
           determined as the ratio (or interaction) between neural drive and the mechanical
           response of the respiratory system (EMGdi/EMGdimax : VT/VC).

        -  The mechanical work of breathing (WOB) will be determined using modified Campbell
           diagrams.

        -  Muscle oxygenation and hemodynamics: Muscle oxygenation will be noninvasively monitored
           using near infrared spectroscopy.

      Statistical Analysis:

      Exercise-response slopes (e.g., Borg/VO2) will be determined. Briefly, the investigators
      will obtain the slope from a plot of Borg vs. VO2 for each participant's and control
      participant's incremental exercise test performed on visit 2. For the central and tertiary
      hypotheses, the investigators will determine the bivariate association of Borg/VO2 slope
      with VO2 slopes of neuromechanical uncoupling, drive to breathe, and VT response using
      Spearman correlation coefficients. The investigators will then force all three predictor
      variables into a multivariate linear regression model with Borg/VO2 slope as the outcome
      variable in order to identify the independent association of neuromechanical uncoupling with
      exertional dyspnea. Variables will be transformed to approximate a normal distribution if
      necessary and predictor variables reaching statistical significance will be assessed for a
      linear relationship with the outcome variable.

      For the secondary and tertiary hypotheses, the investigators will first use a paired t-test
      to identify changes in dyspnea and exercise time comparing room air breathing to hyperoxia
      during constant-load exercise tests on visits 3 and 4. Multivariate models will then be
      developed for each outcome in the secondary and tertiary hypotheses, using the between-test
      difference in Borg dyspnea scale and exercise time for each individual as the outcome
      variables. Predictor variables will include the between-test difference in neuromechanical
      uncoupling and its individual components. Outcome and predictor variables for the dyspnea
      outcome will be based on the between-test difference of these variables at iso-time (i.e.,
      the maximum time for which the patient exercised for both the room air and hyperoxia tests).
      Predictor variables for exercise time will be measured at the end of the test.

      As exploratory analyses, the investigators will repeat the above multivariate linear
      regression analyses in the IPF subgroup, and the investigators will add a categorical ILD
      subgroup variable to these analyses in order to identify other inter-group differences.
      Additional adjustment for potential confounders (e.g., sex, body mass index, high resolution
      computed tomography fibrosis score) will be used in these exploratory analyses if the
      subgroup sample size is sufficient. A p value &lt; 0.05 will be considered significant for all
      analyses. Data analysis will be performed using Stata v11.2 (StataCorp, Texas, USA).
