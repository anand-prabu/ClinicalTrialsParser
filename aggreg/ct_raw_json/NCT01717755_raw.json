            "textblock": "Rationale: Recently our study group reported the results of the Basilar Artery International\n      Cooperation Study (BASICS), a prospective registry of patients with an acute symptomatic\n      basilar artery occlusion (BAO). Our observations in the BASICS registry underscore that we\n      continue to lack a proven treatment modality for patients with an acute BAO and that current\n      clinical practice varies widely. Furthermore, the often-held assumption that intra-arterial\n      treatment (IAT) is superior to intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) in patients with an acute\n      symptomatic BAO is challenged by our data. The BASICS registry was observational and has all\n      the limitations of a non-randomised study. Interpretation of results is hampered by the lack\n      of a standard treatment protocol for all patients who entered the study.\n\n      Objective: Evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional IAT after IVT in patients with\n      basilar artery occlusion.\n\n      Study design: Randomised, multi-centre, open label, controlled phase III, treatment trial\n\n      Study population: Patients, aged 18 through 85 years, with CTA or MRA confirmed basilar\n      occlusion treated with IVT.\n\n      Target number of participants: 750.\n\n      Intervention: Patients will be randomised between additional IAT followed by maximum\n      supportive care versus maximum supportive care alone. IVT has to be initiated within 4.5\n      hours from estimated time of basilar artery occlusion and IAT within 6 hours.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: Favourable outcome at day 90 defined as a modified Rankin\n      Score (mRS - functional scale) of 0-3."
