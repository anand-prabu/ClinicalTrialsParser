Systolic blood pressure\n             <=160 mm Hg and >= 90 mm Hg on 2 readings. Diastolic blood pressure <= 100 mm Hg and\n             >= 40 mm Hg on 2 readings during at least one of the screening visits.\n\n             5. Subject is willing to practice birth control. 6. Subject is willing and able to\n             comply with all protocol requirements. 7. Subject has a measureable level of\n             galectin-3 concentration in plasma at any time prior to entry.\n\n             8. Subject has a glomerular filtration rate between 15-45 mL/min/1.73 m2 determined\n             using the CKD-EPI equation (see section 3.6.1) 9.

Subject is expected to start renal replacement therapy of any kind within 6 months\n             after enrollment\n\n          4. Subjects with previous solid organ transplant\n\n          5. Subject is undergoing treatment with immunosuppression agents except for topical\n             agents or inhaled steroids when conditions are chronic and stable.\n\n          6.

Subject has a clinically relevant active infection and/or a serious co-morbid medical\n             condition such as recent myocardial infarction (within the last 6 months), unstable\n             angina, difficult-to-control congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension,\n             difficult-to-control cardiac arrhythmias, chronic obstructive or chronic restrictive\n             pulmonary disease, and/or cirrhosis.\n\n          9.
