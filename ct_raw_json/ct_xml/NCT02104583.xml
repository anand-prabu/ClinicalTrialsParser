    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the effect of GS-6615 compared to placebo on the overall
      occurrence of appropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD)  interventions
      (antitachycardia pacing [ATP] or shock) in adults with ICD or cardiac resynchronization
      therapy-defibrillator (CRT-D).

             ICD intervention for ventricular tachycardia/ventricular fibrillation (VT/VF) [shock
             or ATP] within 60 days prior to screening or a documented VT/VF episode (prior to
             implantation) within 60 days prior to screening

          -  Use of highly effective contraception methods if female of childbearing potential or
             sexually active male

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class IV heart failure

          -  Myocardial infarction, unstable angina, coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery
             or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) within 4 weeks prior to screening or

          -  Hemodynamically significant primary obstructive valvular disease

          -  History of congenital heart disease

          -  Inherited arrhythmia such as Brugada syndrome. Individuals with long QT syndrome Type

          -  Severe renal impairment

          -  Abnormal liver function tests

          -  Currently taking Class I and Class III antiarrhythmic drugs; such medications should
             be discontinued 5 half-lives (or 28 days for chronic use of amiodarone) prior to
             randomization

          -  Currently taking drugs or products that are strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A;
             such medications should be discontinued 5 half-lives prior to randomization
