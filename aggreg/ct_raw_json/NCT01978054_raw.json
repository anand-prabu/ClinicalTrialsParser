Yet barriers to\n      implement prevention approaches persist as a result of multiple factors including lack of\n      organizational support, limited resources, competing priorities, and limited skill among the\n      public health workforce. The purpose of this study is to learn how best to promote the\n      adoption of evidence based public health practice related to chronic disease prevention.\n      This cluster randomized trial aims to evaluate the dissemination of public health knowledge\n      about evidence-based prevention of cancer and other chronic diseases and will test\n      receptivity and usefulness of dissemination strategies directed toward state health\n      department chronic disease practitioners to enhance capacity and organizational support for\n      evidence-based chronic disease prevention. Twelve state health department chronic disease\n      units will be randomly selected and assigned to intervention or control. State health\n      department staff and the university-based study team will jointly identify, refine and\n      select dissemination strategies. Intervention strategies may include multi-day in-person\n      training workshops, electronic information exchange modalities, and remote technical\n      assistance. Evaluation methods include pre-post surveys, structured qualitative phone\n      interviews, and abstraction of state-level chronic disease prevention program plans and\n      progress reports."
