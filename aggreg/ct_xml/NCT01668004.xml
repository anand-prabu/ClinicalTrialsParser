  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the difference in the annual incidence rate of
      uveitis attacks in participants with ankylosing spondylitis (AS) before treatment and after
      the start of treatment with golimumab.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, history-controlled, multi-site study of golimumab in participants
      with AS. For evaluation of the primary study outcome measure, participants will serve as
      their own control. The period before start of treatment with an anti-tumor necrosis factor
      (TNF) agent will serve as historical control for the incidence of extra-articular
      manifestations, with a review of the medical records done for the previous 1-year period.

      Each participant will participate in the study for approximately 12 months from the time the
      participant signs the Informed Consent Form through the final contact. Two to four weeks
      before study start, each participant will be receiving study treatment for approximately 12
      months, depending on the response to golimumab after 3 months. All participants will be
      followed for a minimum of 12 months, irrespective of the duration of golimumab treatment.
