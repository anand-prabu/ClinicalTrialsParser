    <textblock>
      Historically, ultrasound has been unable to provide interpretable data from the lung
      parenchyma, mainly because of the high total ultrasound energy attenuation and scattering by
      the air in the lungs. Recently it has been shown that clear reproducible Doppler signals can
      be recorded from the lung parenchyma by means of a pulsed Doppler ultrasound system
      incorporating a special signal processing package (transthoracic parametric Doppler, TPD,
      EchoSense Ltd., Haifa, Israel). These lung Doppler signals (LDS) are in full synchrony with
      the cardiac cycle and can be obtained from the lungs, including areas remote from the heart
      and main pulmonary vessels. The LDS waves typically have peak velocities of up to 30 cm/s
      and are of relatively high power, making it possible to detect them despite the
      aforementioned attenuation by the air in the lungs. The LDS are thought to represent the
      radial wall movement of small pulmonary blood vessels, caused by pressure pulse waves of
      cardiac origin which propagate throughout the lung vasculature. The LDS may contain
      information of significant diagnostic and physiological value regarding the pulmonary
      parenchyma and vasculature, as well as the cardio-vascular system in general.

      Preliminary data from ongoing studies employing the TPD in chronic diseases such as CHF,
      COPD and pulmonary hypertension, show promise regarding the diagnostic potential of the lung
      Doppler signals (unpublished data). However, lung Doppler signals in acute disease states
      were not investigated so far. It is reasonable to speculate that the pathological processes
      underlying acute cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases will affect the LDS. Therefore, the
      TPD may have diagnostic potential in these conditions. For example, during acute pulmonary
      embolism a portion of the pulmonary vascular system is occluded; therefore it's reasonable
      to assume that the LDS will disappear in the affected area, enabling to confirm the
      diagnosis without using ionizing radiation (as in CT or lung scan). Another example is COPD
      exacerbation, during which there is usually air trapping in the lungs; thus, the LDS may be
      attenuated by the increase of air volume in the lungs.

      A. Study Purpose and Rationale To evaluate the LDS in patients with various acute
      cardiovascular and/or pulmonary disease states, in order to characterize these signals and
      assess their diagnostic utility in those acute conditions.

      B. Study Design

      The study design is an open, prospective, non-interventional study. 100 patients will be
      recruited at the Rambam Emergency Medicine Department (EMD) during an 18 month period.

      Study population will consist of patients presenting to the EMD with acute cardiovascular
      and/or pulmonary conditions, including- but not restricted to- pneumonia, pulmonary
      embolism, CHF exacerbation, COPD exacerbation, shock, etc. Following informed consent and
      applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, the eligible patients will undergo routine
      physical examination including vital signs measurement (blood pressure, heart rate,
      respiratory rate, O2 saturation by pulse oximetry), and auscultation to lungs. The patient
      would also undergo ECG and chest X-ray as part of the routine evaluation. Blood tests and
      additional imaging procedures will be done according to clinical indication. Lung Doppler
      signals will be recorded from selected locations over the right chest wall, preferably in
      sitting or semi-reclining position (if patient's condition permits). The recordings will be
      repeated several times in the EMD to monitor the changes following treatment. In some cases,
      LDS recordings may also be repeated later in the EMD or other hospital wards when the
      patient recovers from the acute condition (usually towards the end of the hospital stay).
      The acquired Doppler data will be saved by PC for off-line processing and analysis using the
      special algorithms that have been developed for this purpose.

      The medical charts of enrolled subjects will also be accessed to obtain study specific
      information.  The information that will be collected includes (but is not limited to): date
      of birth, gender, height, weight, past medical history, medications, physical examination,
      ECG, blood tests, pulmonary function tests (including spirometry and lung volumes), chest
      X-ray/CT and Echocardiography results. The results of study tests and procedures will be
      disclosed to EchoSense Ltd.

      Since the study is non-interventional, the TPD recordings will not be used to guide medical
      treatment decisions. TPD recordings will not interfere with administering optimal treatment
      to the patient, which is of first priority in all recruited subjects.

      C. Study Device The lung Doppler signals will be acquired by the Sonara/tek Transcranial
      Doppler (TCD) system. This commercially available TCD system was approved by the Federal
      Drug Administration on November 3rd, 2006 as a 510k class II device. This device was
      approved as a means of measuring blood flow velocities within the brain as well as
      peripheral blood vessels.  We will utilize this non-invasive Doppler system in an
      investigational manner to record the lung Doppler signals. The recorded signals will later
      be analyzed by the EchoSense signal processing package.
