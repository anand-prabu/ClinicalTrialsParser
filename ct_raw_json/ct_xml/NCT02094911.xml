          -  Impaired fasting glucose (IFG; i.e. venous plasma glucose concentration ≥6.1 and

             ≤6.9 mmol/l) during the past 5 years, according to the GP registration database OR

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known diabetes mellitus

          -  Any chronic illness that makes 1.5-years survival improbable, interferes with glucose
             tolerance, or makes participation in a lifestyle intervention impossible

          -  Patients with any severe cardiovascular disease (this also includes history of
             cardiac dysrhythmia), unless GP gives agreement

          -  Medication known to interfere with glucose tolerance

          -  Any mental or physical disability that will hinder participation in the lifestyle
             intervention

          -  Severe psychiatric disease

          -  Patients who showed bad compliance in the past

          -  Participation in another regular vigorous exercise and/or diet programme, i.e.:

               -  Intensive exercise programme: any exercise programme offered by a
                  physiotherapist and/or patients sporting at least 3 times a week at their own
                  initiative.

               -  Intensive diet programme: patients who visited a dietician at least 3 times
