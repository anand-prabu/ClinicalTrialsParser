      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ibrutinib versus
      rituximab in adult Chinese patients with relapsed or refractory chronic lymphocytic leukemia
      (CLL) or small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an randomized (individuals assigned to study treatment by chance), open-label
      (identity of assigned study drug will be known) study designed to evaluate the efficacy and
      safety of ibrutinib versus rituximab in adult Chinese patients with relapsed/refractory CLL
      or SLL with active disease requiring treatment who have failed at least 1 prior line of
      therapy and are not considered appropriate candidates for treatment or retreatment with
      purine analog-based therapy or combination chemoimmunotherapy. Approximately 150 patients
      will be randomly assigned in a 1:2 ratio into 2 treatment arms to receive either intravenous
      rituximab (Treatment Arm A) for 6 cycles or oral ibrutinib (Treatment Arm B) until disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity, whichever occurs first. The study will include
      screening, treatment, and follow-up phases. Treatment will extend from randomization until
      study drug discontinuation. Follow-up will consist of 2 phases: post-treatment (from the
      discontinuation of treatment for reasons other than disease progression until the patient
      has progressive disease) and post-disease progression (subsequent anticancer therapy and
      survival status will be recorded until death, lost to follow-up, consent withdrawal, or
      study closure). Study end is defined by when 90 progression-free survival (PFS) events
      (progressive disease or deaths) have been observed, or earlier at the interim analysis
      (approximately 45 PFS events) if PFS analysis is statistically significant in favor of
      ibrutinib, whichever happens first. Efficacy evaluations will assess for disease response
      and progression in accordance with International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia
      2008 criteria for patients with CLL or SLL. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what a drug
      does to the body) blood samples will be collected in the ibrutinib treatment group. Safety
      will be assessed throughout the study.
