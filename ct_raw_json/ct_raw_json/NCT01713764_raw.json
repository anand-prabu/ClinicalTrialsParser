Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables.  Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.\nParticipants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices.  The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety.  The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness."
