This study aims to collect specimens for a project that will systematically explore a spectrum of genomic changes involved in human cancer.  Specifically the project will analyze DNA copy number changes, including large (on the order of chromosomal segments) and small (1,000 to 100,000 KB) scale rearrangements, transcription profiles, epigenetic modifications, sequence variation, and sequence in both tumor tissue and case-matched germline DNA.  The suite of analysis platforms for collaborating laboratories will be applied to a common set of molecular analytes obtained from clinically annotated high-quality tumor specimens and case matched normal control specimens obtained form this specimen collection study. Initial measures critical to ensure specimen quality and qualification for subsequent analysis include confirmed histopathology and RNA integrity.",
