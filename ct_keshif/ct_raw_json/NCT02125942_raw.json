            "textblock": "Borderline personality disorder is a severe psychiatric disorder marked by emotional\n      instability, difficulty with interpersonal relationships, and self-harming behaviors.\n      Despite receiving psychotherapy for borderline personality disorder, studies show that\n      patient recovery is slow, and there is a high rate of self injury and suicide attempts early\n      in treatment. There is thus a clear need to provide therapies to augment psychotherapy. We\n      will conduct a pilot trial to determine whether a 6-week Central Meditation and Imagery\n      Therapy (CMIT) is feasible for subjects with borderline personality disorder to undergo when\n      added on to psychotherapy treatment. CMIT is a non-validated therapy that combines\n      principles of mindfulness with meditation techniques and guided imagery. Sessions led by a\n      trained clinician in a group setting once a week, and participants are asked to complete\n      daily home practice.\n\n      The trial will involve 16 participants, all currently undergoing psychotherapy for\n      borderline personality disorder. Participants will be randomly assigned to either a CMIT\n      group that lasts 6 weeks, or a wait list group. Those in the wait list group will be able to\n      receive CMIT after 6 weeks. All participants will continue to receive psychotherapy\n      throughout the trial.\n\n      During the trial, we will also obtain preliminary data to help understand whether CMIT may\n      result in psychological benefits for participants. This will include measuring the pulse in\n      order to determine variation in beat to beat intervals of the heart during psychological\n      tests, and filling out questionnaires before and after participation in CMIT."
