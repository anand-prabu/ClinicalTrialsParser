Subjects will not be paid for their participation and will be assured of\n      treatment for their hyperglycemia regardless of study participation."

The\n      dosing formula is per Emory University Outpatient Surgical Center protocol for treating\n      hyperglycemia and is the same for both groups. All patients with diabetes will undergo a\n      blood sugar measurement upon arrival to the ASC using the Accuchek blood glucose meter. An\n      admission blood sugar of >180 in a patient with diabetes qualifies the patient for study\n      screening.  Subjects will be approached after confirmation of eligibility for the study.\n      Randomization, then treatment, will occur immediately following written informed consent.\n      Demographic data will be recorded.A medical history with detailed history of diabetes will\n      be obtained and surgical and anesthesia details and length of stay recorded. Blood sugar\n      levels will be checked hourly until the patient is ready for discharge. Subsequent treatment\n      will follow the hyperglycemia protocol. All blood sugar results and doses of insulin will be\n      recorded. The subject's participation will end at the time of discharge from the Ambulatory\n      Surgical Center."
