            "textblock": "Background\n\n      Within the last 20 years, evidence supporting harmlessness and benefits of hydrotherapy\n      during pregnancy accumulated. Water gymnastics were observed to have pain-relieving effects,\n      as was birth in water.\n\n      WATSU is an acronym, based on the terms Water and Shiatsu. It is a relaxing form of\n      hydrotherapy which is performed in 35\u00b0 C (95\u00b0 F). Practitioners claim WATSU to lower\n      muscular tonus as well as stress and to relief pain. Clinically relevant regulation of\n      muscular tonus in spastic hemiparetic patients due to WATSU was observed by Chon;\n      significant reduction of pain in patients suffering fibromyalgia by Faull.\n\n      In respect of pregnancy, WATSU is narrated - yet not scientifically evaluated - to reduce\n      pregnancy-related low back pain, to relax hypertonic muscles including those of the uterus,\n      to improve the overall sense of wellbeing and deepen the relationship of the mother to her\n      unborn child. In addition, spontaneous cephalic versions of children in breech presentations\n      within 1 to 4 days and nights following WATSU-treatments are being claimed.\n\n      According to Pennick & Young, two of three pregnant women are suffering pregnancy-related\n      low back pain. Since this population is recommended to refrain from analgesic medications,\n      potentially helpful interventions ought to be identified.\n\n      The described effects of WATSU on muscle tone might be of interest in case of breech\n      presentations. Tension of the uterus has major influence on the success of attempts of\n      external cephalic version. Although breech presentation occurs in 3-4% of pregnancies only,\n      this complication is a threat to the mothers as well as the infants life. External cephalic\n      version to correct the child's position is being suggested although associated with risks\n      for mother and child. Breech presentations are the most frequent medical indication for\n      cesarean sections.\n\n      The impacts of stress on unborn children are being investigated, long-term effects are being\n      speculated.\n\n      Objective\n\n      In contrast to active hydrotherapy, passive hydrotherapy was not yet subject of\n      investigation concerning its effects during pregnancy. The goals of this pilot-study are:\n\n        -  To evaluate the effects of passive hydrotherapy WATSU in the third trimester of\n           pregnancy by the means of a scientific prospective approach and to ascertain, whether\n           the reported effects can be observed under such conditions\n\n        -  To evaluate the therapeutic potential of WATSU\n\n        -  To evaluate the usefulness, feasibility and framework requirements of further RCT\n           addressing this issue\n\n        -  To evaluate, whether or not - which of, respectively - the chosen parameter are\n           suitable for further investigations (RCT)\n\n        -  To evaluate potential for improvement in study design and management.\n\n      Methods\n\n      Design: pilot-study, explorative comparison of two cohorts. Criterion for\n      pseudorandomisation: immersion contraindicated (e.g. due to perforation of the eardrum).\n      Recruitment from July to December 2012; expected participants: 45.\n\n      Parameter: ultrasound examination of position of the fetus and amount of amniotic fluid;\n      qualitative and quantitative questionnaires, birth outcome (vaginal, cesarean,\n      complications, breech presentation).\n\n      Statistics: SPSS; significance at p<.05, Intention to Treat."

The mother's abdomen is not being touched during the treatment.\nThe treatment takes place in a one-to-one hands-on-setting in the warm- water-therapy-pool (35\u00b0C, 95\u00b0F) of the University Hospital in Bern and consists of acupressure massage according to the Japanese massage-technique Shiatsu, in an attempt to harmonize the mother's \"energy-flow\" in the so called \"meridians\" (energy-channels) of Traditional Chinese Medicine. These \"meridians\" are also sought to be influenced by slow passive stretches of the mother's extremities. In addition, mobilization of her spine is being enhanced by gravity-free movements.\nDuring the study, each participant in the intervention group will be treated twice with WATSU (60min treatment at day 1 and 4).",
