In\n      this pilot study, through an endocrine consult team, a weight-based, steroid dose-based\n      insulin protocol will be implemented for the management of hyperglycemia in lymphoma\n      patients requiring high dose steroid therapy, with the goal of reducing hyperglycemia\n      incidence."
