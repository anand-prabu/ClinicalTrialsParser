Blood samples usually will be collected during routine patient\n           monitoring procedures and will not require an additional needle stick.\n\n        -  A total of 300 patients will be studied at the NCI in Bethesda, MD, Johns Hopkins\n           University in Baltimore and the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia."
