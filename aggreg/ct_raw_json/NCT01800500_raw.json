Examine the impact of smokeless tobacco (ST) substitution on biomarkers of exposure\n      (carbon monoxide [CO], cotinine).\n\n      III. Explore relationships between ST substitution and measures of mood and health related\n      quality of life.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Participants purchase ST products using a fixed rate of product prices once weekly\n      and record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks.\n\n      ARM II: Participants purchase ST products using escalating product prices once weekly and\n      record their consumption of ST products and cigarettes smoked daily for 3 weeks.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 6 months."
