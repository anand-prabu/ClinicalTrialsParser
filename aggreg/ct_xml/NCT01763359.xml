    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study is to compare hip adductor strength and obturator
      nerve palsy between acetabular fracture patients whose fracture was reduced and fixated
      using the modified Stoppa approach (subjects) and pelvic fracture patients (controls) using
      physical strength testing, radiographs, clinical assessment, and a validated functional
      outcome questionnaire. The investigators' research hypothesis is that there will be less
      strength and higher incidence of obturator nerve palsy in patients treated with the modified
      Stoppa approach (intervention) than in patients treated without the modified Stoppa approach
      (controls).

        Pelvic fracture patients and patients treated for acetabular fractures with the modified
        Stoppa approach will be asked to consent to a voluntary study investigating physical
        function at their 2 week follow-up appointment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria for the subject patient population under study consists of male
             and female adults, at least 18 years old, who had an acetabular fracture that was
             treated with the modified Stoppa approach.

          -  Inclusion criteria for the control patient population under study consists of male
             and female adults, at least 18 years old, who had acetabular fractures with similar
             fracture patterns as the study group that were treated with any other approach than
             the Stoppa approach.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria for the subject and control patient population consist of:

          -  Patients who are non-ambulatory.

          -  Patients less than 18 years of age.

          -  Patients who do not speak English.

          -  Patients who are unable to complete their follow-up in Utah.
