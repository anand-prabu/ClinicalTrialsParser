  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By combining a variety of agents that potentiate Zidovudine (ZDV), the investigators hope to
      induce remission in this generally fatal disease.  Most therapies for aggressive B cell
      lymphomas are based upon intensive chemotherapeutic regimens, expensive modalities (bone
      marrow transplant, Rituximab), or experimental approaches (gene therapy, cytotoxic T cell
      infusion) that are difficult to implement in heavily pre-treated patients. Therapy for
      relapsed aggressive B cell lymphomas is very poor.  Even curable lymphomas such as Burkitt
      Lymphoma (BL) and Hodgkin lymphoma are extremely difficult to treat in relapse and/or after
      stem cell transplant failure.  The investigators propose a novel therapeutic approach that
      exploits the presence of EBV in lymphomas; antiviral mediated suppression of NF-kB and
      disruption of viral latency.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Any stage, histologically or cytologically documented intermediate to high grade
             relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's or Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Patients with
             relapsed/refractory monomorphic (monoclonal) post-transplant lymphoproliferative
             disease (PTLD) are also eligible.

          -  Tumors must be positive for EBV by EBER.  This may be done either on the original
             tumor or the biopsy of relapsed disease (if performed).  Biopsy of relapsed disease
             is desirable but not mandatory. If stains for LMP-1  done outside are positive, EBER
             does not need to be done.

          -  All patients must have relapsed or progressed from at least one previous standard
             chemotherapy based regimen.

          -  Measurable or non-measurable tumor parameter(s).  Non-measurable tumor parameter(s)
             is defined as not having bi-dimensional measurements (e.g., gastric or marrow
             involvement), but can be followed for response by other diagnostic tests such as
             gallium scan, PET imaging and/or bone marrow biopsy.

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years.

          -  Karnofsky performance status (KPS) &gt;= 50%/Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)
             Performance Score 0, 1, 2.

          -  Patients must have adequate end organ and bone marrow function as defined below:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt;= 1,500 cells/mm3 and platelets &gt;= 50,000 cells/dL
                  unless cytopenias are secondary to lymphomatous involvement of bone marrow or
                  due to HIV-related thrombocytopenia.  All patients must be off colony
                  stimulating factor therapy at least 24 hours prior to institution of Cycle 1
                  chemotherapy.

               -  Adequate hepatic function:  Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT) &lt;= 5
                  times the upper limit of normal.  Total bilirubin &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL (unless elevated
                  secondary to lymphomatous involvement of liver or biliary system or due to other
                  HIV medications [e.g., indinavir, tenofovir or atazanavir]).  For bilirubin &gt;=
                  3.0 mg/dL due to hepatic involvement, the initial dose of doxorubicin will be
                  decreased by 50%.

               -  Creatinine &lt;= 2.0 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;= 60 mL/min unless due to renal
                  involvement by lymphoma.

          -  Concurrent radiation, with or without steroids, for emergency conditions secondary to
             lymphoma (CNS tumor, cord compression, etc.) will be permitted.

          -  Patients who are HIV+ are eligible.

          -  Females with childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within
             72 hours of entering into the study.  Men and women must agree to use adequate birth
             control if conception is possible during the study.  Women must avoid pregnancy and
             men avoid fathering children while in the study and for 6 months following the last
             study drug treatment.

          -  Able to give consent.

          -  Patients already receiving erythropoietin or G-CSF are eligible, although GF therapy
             must be discontinued at least 24 hours prior to receiving chemotherapy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent active malignancies, with the exception of in situ carcinoma of the
             cervix, non-metastatic, non-melanomatous skin cancer, or Kaposi's sarcoma not
             requiring systemic chemotherapy.

          -  Patients who have previously received a cumulative dose of Doxorubicin of 350 mg/m2
             or greater.

          -  Myocardial infarction (MI) within 6 months prior to study entry, New York Heart
             Association (NYHA) Class II or greater heart failure, uncontrolled angina, severe,
             uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmias, clinically significant pericardial disease, or
             electrocardiograph evidence of acute ischemic or active conduction system
             abnormalities.

          -  Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) that is less than the lower institutional
             limits of normal as assessed by Multiple Gated Acquisition (MUGA) scan or
             echocardiogram within 6 weeks prior to registration.

          -  Primary CNS lymphoma.

          -  Psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions that do not permit
             treatment and/or medical follow-up required to comply with the study protocol.

          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents.

          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements.  Patients with mycobacterium avium will not be excluded.

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding women.
