  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dipyridamole, a medication extensively used in combination with aspirin for stroke
      prevention, is a promising new treatment for lupus. Dipyridamole has been shown to inhibit
      certain lymphocyte populations that are over-reactive in lupus and to delay the emergence of
      lupus-related pathology in mice with lupus. The investigators are interested in
      investigating the efficacy of dipyridamole in preventing flares in patients with lupus and
      its impact on biomarkers of disease activity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      T cells in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) express an abnormal phenotype characterized by
      increased effector functions and deficient regulatory responses. Dipyridamole, a
      phosphodiesterase inhibitor extensively used in combination with low dose aspirin in
      secondary stroke prevention, has been proposed as a specific T cell directed treatment for
      SLE. Dipyridamole inhibits the calcium/calcineurin/NF-AT pathway in SLE T cells in vitro and
      abrogates expression of cytokines and costimulatory molecules, eventually also affecting B
      cell responses. Dipyridamole delays the emergence of lupus related pathology in lupus prone
      mice, but has not yet been studied in humans with SLE. The investigators aim to investigate
      the efficacy of dipyridamole in the prevention of flares in SLE patients after withdrawal of
      background immunosuppressive medications. The investigators will additionally evaluate the
      safety and tolerability of dipyridamole and its impact on quality of life measures in this
      population. Furthermore, the effect of dipyridamole on T and B cell biomarkers will be
      examined.
