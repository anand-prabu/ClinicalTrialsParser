    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand if small proteins found on the surface of tumor
      cells (called CXCR4, CD47,CD27) or inside the tumor cells (Pim kinases, sphingolipids, and
      pS6) can predict how patients will respond to chemotherapy-treatment and if a small molecule
      inside the tumor cells (called Pim kinase) can be used as a treatment target patients with
      selected refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies or solid tumors. A sample from the
      bone marrow biopsy (a small amount of tissue removed from the body for laboratory testing),
      biopsy of the tumor  and aspirate (a small amount of fluid is removed from the body for
      laboratory testing) that had been done before the subject entered this study will be
      provided for research purposes. Based on preliminary data, it is hypothesized that
      CD27,CXCR4, CD47, sphingolipids, and Pim kinases could be used as prognostic/predictive
      markers and that Pim kinase inhibitors provide a new agent for the treatment in patients
      with selected refractory or relapsed hematologic malignancies or solid tumors

      Primary Outcome Measures:

        -  Measure the expression levels of CXCR4, CD47,CD27 and pS6 by flow cytometry with
           hematologic cancers (certain leukemias and lymphomas), as well as patients with select
           types of solid tumors via patient's marrow aspirate

        -  [ Time Frame: 3 years ]

        -  [ Designated as safety issue: No ] The investigators Aim 1 is to perform a corrective
           study to measure the expression levels of CXCR4, CD47,CD27, pS6 by flow cytometry in
           patient's marrow aspirate and correlate their expression level with patients' treatment
           responses

      Secondary Outcome Measures:

      • Determine if Pim kinase inhibitors or sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitors will inhibit
      patients' tumor cells [ Time Frame: 3 years ] [ Designated as safety issue: No ] The
      investigators aim 2 involves only in vitro cell culture system and in vivo animal models.
      The investigators will measure the efficacy of Pim kinase inhibitors in inhibiting patients'
      tumor cell growth in vitro using cell culture system. The investigators will also determine
      the efficacy of Pim kinase inhibitors and sphingosine kinase 2 inhibitors in inhibiting
      tumor growth of patients  in animal models. The investigators will measure the tumor size in
      animal models. The investigators Aim 2 does not involve any measurement of human with
      hematologic cancers (certain leukemias and lymphomas), as well as patients with select types
      of solid tumors. Therefore, measures of safety, tolerability etc in patients are not
      applicable.

      The patients will not have bone marrow biopsy or aspirate solely for this study. When the
      patients undergo routine bone marrow aspirate and biopsy for the purpose of initial
      diagnosis, followup or restaging, they will be asked and consented for participation in the
      study. The patient will then be treated with standart therapy. The bone marrow aspirate from
      patients who consent to be in the study will be stained for CXCR4, CD47,CD27 pS6, in
      addition to standard study flow cytometry panel tumor typs. The staining and flow cytometry
      analysis will be performed at the Cancer Centre of Monoclonal Therapy
