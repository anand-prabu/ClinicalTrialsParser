  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have been conducted throughout the world to evaluate patients' and parents'
      preferences regarding physicians' attire.  Most studies have shown that the attire
      influences their feelings trust and confidence regarding their care.  In most countries the
      preference is for formal attire.  In other places a more casual attire is generally
      accepted.  Israel is a country where casual dress is acceptable in most settings.  Israeli
      physician's dress code has been discussed in the past, but  has never been systematically
      studied.  The aim of this study is to systematically examine the attitudes of parents of
      children who have been admitted to the pediatric ward towards physicians' attire.
