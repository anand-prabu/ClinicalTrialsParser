It is also unclear what the most appropriate treatment for\n      nocturnal hypoglycemia is: simple carbohydrates, or mini-glucagon.\n\n      In this study, we will use Continuous Glucose Monitors that will send subject data securely\n      to a remote computer located in the medical cottage at camp throughout the night.  Study\n      staff will monitor the computer and will intervene on low blood sugar as it occurs in real\n      time.  On half of the nights, campers will receive mini-glucagon for low blood sugar, and on\n      the rest, they will receive standard carbohydrate treatment."
