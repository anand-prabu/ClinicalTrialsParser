  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical data support the hypothesis that the administration of AHRO-001 reduces LDL
      cholesterol levels, improves HDL function, and finally, decreases atheromatous plaque
      burden.

      4 sequential dosing cohorts, each cohort beginning with single dose (SDD), single day
      exposure, followed by one week of multiple daily dosing (MDD)  with bid exposure, a 4 day
      drug honeymoon, then one week of MDD utilizing tid exposure.  Each subsequent cohort
      utilizes the same SDD/MDD design, starting with SDD higher than prior SDD but a SDD
      significantly lower than prior tid MDD cohort just completed, the overall goal being to
      provide gradually increasing dose exposure contingent on satisfactory safety and
      tolerability of lower doses in the previous groups. Cohort 4 (MDD) utilizes best dose
      determined by Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3 for 21 days. Embedded above and following completion of
      Cohorts 1, 2 &amp; 3 is a drug-drug-interaction substudy measuring impact of orally administered
      AHRO-001 on concomitantly administered oral atorvastatin.

      Estimated Duration of Subject Participation: 8-9 weeks

      SUBJECT POPULATION:

      Healthy volunteers, both males &amp; infertile females, with asymptomatic mild to moderate
      hypercholesterolemia

    <description>To assess the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of AHRO-001 when administered first as a single daily dose x 1 day, then by a graduated increase from daily dosing x 1day  to twice daily dosing x7 days, and ultimately to thrice daily dosing x7. Next dose can be started as soon as 6 volunteers will finish 2 weeks of administration of the previous dose. All dose increases occur only after drug washout and are only undertaken after medical review of the previous dose as determined by symptoms, vital signs, clinical examination, clinical laboratory results, urinalyses, electrocardiograms and adverse event reporting declares that progression of dosing is safe and appropriate</description>
