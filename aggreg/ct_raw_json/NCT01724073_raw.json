Leafy vegetable\n      sauces were formulated to improve their micronutrient contents and bioavailability. This\n      efficacy study was designed to assess the effects of the regular consumption (one meal per\n      day, 6 days per week) of these leafy-vegetable sauces enriched or not with liver on iron,\n      zinc and vitamin A status, growth and morbidity of young children from poor urban districts\n      of Ouagadougou. The study is conducted by IRD and IRSAT-DTA and will last 6 months. 432\n      12-15 month-old children will be recruited and randomly assigned to one of the four\n      following arms: three intervention groups, the two first receiving leafy vegetable sauce,\n      the third one receiving one meal made of the fortified Misola gruel. In these three arms,\n      blood samples will be collected at the beginning and at the end of the study. The fourth arm\n      is an external control group and will not receive any food. In this fourth arm, blood\n      samples will be collected only at the end of the study. Biochemical indicators of\n      micronutrient status will be determined, and anthropometric data will be collected in all\n      children. Morbidity will also be assessed in children of intervention groups."

The study will be conducted by IRD, IRSAT-DTA, with funding of the\n      European Union.\n\n      Subjects of the study, 12-15 month old burkinab\u00e8 children will be divided into 4 arms. 108\n      children per group (432, in all) will be recruited in order to have 90 children in each\n      group after exclusion due severe anemia or hemoglobinopathy. Each enrolled child will be\n      dewormed according to WHO recommendations, and receive a bed-net for malaria prevention.\n\n      Three of these four groups will receive one test meal per day, 6 days per week (except\n      Sunday)in canteens located in study districts. Investigators will record every day the\n      amount of food consumed and morbidity in each child.\n\n        -  one intervention group receiving leafy vegetable-fish sauce + cereal-based paste called\n           t\u00f4,\n\n        -  one intervention group receiving leafy vegetable-fish sauce + cereal-based paste called\n           t\u00f4 5 days/week and leafy vegetable-fish sauce + t\u00f4 1 day/week,\n\n        -  one 'positive control' group receiving a fortified gruel prepared from Misola Flour In\n           these three arms, blood samples will be collected at the beginning and at the end of\n           the study.\n\n      The fourth arm is an external control group and will not receive any food. In this fourth\n      arm, blood samples will be collected only at the end of the study.\n\n      Biochemical indicators of iron, zinc and vitamin A status will be determined, and\n      anthropometric data will be collected in all children.\n\n      The study is submitted to the Ethical committee of the Ministry of Health of Burkina Faso\n      and to the review board of the local drug administration (DGPML) for approval, as well as to\n      the Ethical committee of IRD (France).\n\n      According to the results, recommendations on the young child diet will be formulated for the\n      attention of the staff of health facilities and families."
