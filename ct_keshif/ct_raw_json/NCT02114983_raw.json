To date, in the medical literature there\n      are no studies that demonstrate the diagnostic accuracy of GP in performing CUS for the\n      diagnosis of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). Therefore, we plan to perform a prospective,\n      multicenter, cohort study in which a large number of consecutive outpatients with symptoms\n      or signs of DVT are subject to the CUS by the GP with the aim of evaluating the precision\n      and the diagnostic accuracy compared to specialists in vascular ultrasound, which in this\n      case will be the standard of reference."
