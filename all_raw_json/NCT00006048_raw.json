ZD 1839 may interfere with the growth factor and stop the tumor from growing. Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop\n      growing or die. It is not yet known whether chemotherapy is more effective with or without\n      ZD 1839 for non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without ZD 1839 in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage IV non-small cell\n      lung cancer."

Compare the 1 year survival rate, time to worsening of disease related\n      symptoms, and progression free survival in chemotherapy naive patients with stage IIIB or IV\n      non-small cell lung cancer treated with one of two doses of ZD 1839 or placebo combined with\n      gemcitabine and cisplatin.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Patients receive gemcitabine and cisplatin\n      combined with lower dose oral ZD 1839 (arm I), higher dose oral ZD 1839 (arm II), or placebo\n      (arm III).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,029 patients (343 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
