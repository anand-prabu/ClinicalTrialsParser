The study is a\n      prospective randomized controlled non-inferiority trial where we elucidate the role of\n      postoperative immobilization after arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Our primary goal is to\n      compare clinical and structural results after rotator cuff repair and to compare a\n      restrictive and an active postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Our secondary goal is to\n      establish guidelines for optimized rehabilitation after rotator cuff repair to ensure the\n      best possible outcome for this large group of patients. Our aim is also to establish\n      guidelines for timing of return to work. The major complications following rotator cuff\n      repair and the current rehabilitation regimens are rotator cuff retears and postoperative\n      stiffness. The information obtained in this study may enable development of targeted,\n      cost-effective treatment and rehabilitation with good, lasting long-term results."
