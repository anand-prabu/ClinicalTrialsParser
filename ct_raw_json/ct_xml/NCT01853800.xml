  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rivaroxaban is a substance developed for use in the treatment of blood coagulation
      disorders. Thrombosis (blood clots) can occur as a result of excessive coagulation activity
      in the blood vessels. Excessive coagulation activity can occur in children as well, and
      rivaroxaban is therefore being developed for the treatment of thromboembolic events in
      children and adolescents. As small children are often unable to swallow tablets, an oral
      suspension (mixture of a liquid containing finely distributed solids) has been developed
      which allows dosing according to body weight. The objective of this trial is to compare the
      bioavailability (proportion of a substance that remains available unchanged in the blood
      circulation) of a rivaroxaban oral solution with that of the rivaroxaban tablet approved for
      treatment. In order to evaluate the potential influence of food, the oral suspension
      containing 20 mg rivaroxaban will be taken after consuming food. In addition, the
      pharmacokinetics (concentrations of the drug and breakdown products (metabolites) in blood),
      safety and tolerability will be assessed.
