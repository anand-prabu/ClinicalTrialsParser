    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral cabozantinib at a
      lower daily dose compared with a 140 mg dose in subjects with progressive, metastatic MTC.
      It will test if the lower dose results in similar progression free survival (PFS) and
      overall response rate (ORR) with fewer adverse events compared to the PFS, ORR and adverse
      events found in previous clinical trials of 140 mg.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has a histologically confirmed diagnosis of MTC.

          -  The subject has measurable disease that is metastatic as determined by the
             investigator based upon computerized tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging
             (MRI), bone scan, or X-ray taken within 28 days before randomization.

          -  The subject has disease that is measurable per RECIST 1.1 as determined by the
             investigator based upon CT or MRI images taken within 28 days before randomization.

          -  The subject has documented worsening of disease (progressive disease) at screening as
             compared with a previous CT scan or MRI image done within 14 months of screening.

          -  The subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of ≤
             1.

          -  The subject has recovered from toxicities related to any prior treatments, unless
             AE(s) are clinically non-significant and/or stable on supportive therapy.

          -  The subject has adequate organ and marrow function.

          -  Sexually active fertile subjects (male and female) must agree to use medically
             accepted methods of contraception during the study and for 4 months after the last
             dose of study treatment.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential must not be pregnant at screening.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The subject has previously received cabozantinib or has previously participated in a
             cabozantinib clinical trial.

          -  Receipt of any type of small molecule kinase inhibitor or hormonal therapy within  28
             days or 5 half-lives, whichever is shorter, before randomization.

          -  Receipt of any systemic anti-tumor therapy within 28 days of randomization (42 days
             for nitrosoureas or/ mitomycin C).

          -  Receipt of any other type of investigational agent within 28 days of randomization.

          -  Receipt of radiation therapy within 28 days of randomization or radionuclide
             treatment within 42 days of randomization.

          -  The subject has untreated and/or active (progressing or requiring anticonvulsants or
             corticosteroids for symptomatic control) central nervous system (CNS) metastasis.
             Must have completed radiation therapy ≥ 28 days prior to randomization and be stable
             without corticosteroids or anti-convulsant treatment for ≥ 10 days.

          -  Treatment at therapeutic doses with oral anticoagulants or platelet inhibitors.

          -  The subject has serious illness besides cancer.

          -  Major surgery within 2 months before randomization. Complete healing from major
             surgery must have occured 1 month before randomization and 7 days before
             randomization for minor surgery.

          -  The subject is unable to swallow multiple tablets or capsules.

          -  The subject is pregnant or lactating.

          -  The subject has had a diagnosis of another malignancy within 2 years before
             randomization, except for superficial skin cancers, or localized, low-grade tumors
             deemed cured and not treated with systemic therapy.
