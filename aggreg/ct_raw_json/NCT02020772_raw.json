The investigators expect that\n      treatment and follow-up by an coordinating interdisciplinary team can improve these patients\n      opportunity to function, increase their quality of life, and decrease their pain. The\n      purpose of this study is to investigate if use of a coordinating interdisciplinary team in\n      primary health care will result in reduced sick leave compared with practice as usual, and\n      give fewer referrals to specialized health services and private rehabilitation centers.\n      Research data will be obtained from the patients journals, questionnaires, and clinical\n      examinations.."
