Pomalidomide may stimulate the\n      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as dexamethasone, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer\n      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

To determine the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) of carfilzomib when administered in\n      combination with fixed dosing pomalidomide and dexamethasone in patients with relapsed and\n      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma.\n\n      II. To determine the efficacy of the combination regimen at the MTD as measured by partial\n      response (PR) response rate defined as per International Myeloma Working Group (IMW)\n      criteria.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the best stringent complete response (sCR)/CR/nodular complete response\n      (nCR) and >= very good partial response (VGPR) rates.\n\n      II. To estimate the time on study (TOS), duration of response (DOR), time to progression\n      (TTP), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS) distributions.\n\n      III. To further define the toxicity at the MTD.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To perform an analysis of a subset of patients who are refractory to either pomalidomide\n      or carfilzomib or lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone (RVD) combination.\n\n      II. To evaluate the status of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patient who achieve sCR, CR\n      or nCR.\n\n      III. To evaluate prognostic markers and markers of response to pomalidomide, dexamethasone,\n      and carfilzomib (PdC) in patients refractory to lenalidomide by analyzing pre-treatment\n      clinical covariates and pre-treatment plasma cell profiles by proteomics and gene expression\n      profiling (GEP).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I dose-escalation study of carfilzomib followed by phase II.\n\n      Patients receive carfilzomib intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and\n      16, pomalidomide orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, and dexamethasone PO or IV on\n      days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Treatment repeats every 28 days for at least 8 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable disease may\n      continue to receive treatment in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 3\n      months for up to 2 years."
