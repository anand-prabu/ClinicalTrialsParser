The eradication rate of first line clarithromycin based therapy has fallen to\n      below 80%. Both quadruple and sequential treatment regime has been proposed as the\n      first-line empirical regime. Nevertheless, comparison in terms of efficacy and side effects\n      between the two regime remained unknown.
