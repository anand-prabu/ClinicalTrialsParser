Every patient will be\n      injected by the same Oculoplastic surgeon.\n\n      A Pinprick pain test will be perform 5 minutes after each injection using a sterile \"finger\n      stick\" needle at three sites of each upper eyelid. These sites include medial, central and\n      lateral portion of each eyelid, approximately 4 mm above the lid margin. The subject will be\n      asked to rate the degree of pain experienced at each site on a scale from 0 (none) to 10\n      (severe). An average pain score will be calculated for each eyelid. This will help determine\n      if one of the 2 dilutions have a faster anaesthetic effect.\n\n      Patients will also be instructed to inform the surgeon of precisely when the pain began and\n      subsided to accurately record the duration of the pain experienced."
