  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anastomosis of intestine or other viscera currently requires open or laparoscopic surgery
      and is often the most difficult, time-consuming, and expensive part of many operations. We
      have developed a device (&quot;Magnamosis&quot;) that may create compression anastomoses more easily,
      quickly, and less expensively than sutures or staples. The Magnamosis device consists of two
      23-mm diameter, convex-concave, radially symmetric ring magnets encased in polycarbonate.
      One magnet is placed in the lumen of each viscus to be joined, the magnets self-align, and a
      compression anastomosis is achieved by tissue remodeling. We have completed extensive
      pre-clinical studies in animals and have shown that Magnamosis can be used to accomplish
      gastrojejunostomy, jejunojejunostomy, duodeno-colostomy, and colo-colostomy safely and
      effectively using available endoscopic and minimally invasive surgery techniques. We are now
      conducting a small first-in-human study to obtain clinical data in support of the safety and
      early feasibility of the Magnamosis device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, prospective, single-center pilot study to evaluate the feasibility
      and safety of creating an intestinal anastomosis using the Magnamosis Magnetic Compression
      Anastomosis (Magnamosis) device under FDA IDE G130046. Ten, otherwise healthy, subjects,
      ages 18-60 years, with a disease process necessitating open or laparoscopic surgical
      anastomosis for re-establishment of intestinal continuity that would otherwise be performed
      using sutures or stapling devices will be enrolled. Participation in the study requires a
      time commitment of three months. The total duration of the study is 18 months to ensure
      three-month follow-up on each subject, with long-term follow-up of each subject at one and
      two years postoperation. The primary outcome measure will be the incidence of anastomotic
      leaks related to the use of the Magnamosis device. Anastomotic leakage will be defined as
      clinical symptoms such as fever, sepsis or peritonitis within 30 days postoperatively
      leading to a clinical and/or radiological interventional procedure or reoperation that
      confirms that the leakage is related to the device. Secondary outcome measures will include
      the rate of occurrence of other device-related complications during hospitalization and
      post-procedure, including the rate of bleeding, perforation, retention of foreign body, and
      anastomotic stricture documented by symptoms or imaging within three months of procedure.
      The duration of hospitalization, number of days to passage of Magnamosis device (found in
      stool or absent on x-ray), and number of days to the first postoperative bowel movement will
      also be measured. Post-operative administration of the pain scale will also yield study
      data. Subject follow-up will be conducted after discharge at 2 weeks (in person, in clinic),
      and at 1 month, 3 months, 1 year and 2 years either in person, via email, telephone, Skype,
      or other non in-person method.

    <description>Single-use, sterile device enables creation of a circular compression intestinal anastomosis. Device is comprised of matched pair of self-centering rare earth ring magnets encased in medical grade polycarbonate. Geometry of magnets' mating surfaces applies enough force on inside of mated rings to produce compression necrosis of intervening intestinal walls. Lesser force on outside of mated rings produces inflammatory healing of the two co-apted intestinal walls. Internal lumen permits immediate patency of the anastomosis to prevent intestinal obstruction during compression anastomosis creation. In 5-10 days, mated rings with intervening necrotic tissue falls into intestinal lumen and is naturally expelled with stool, leaving a well-healed anastomosis. Magnamosis device can be delivered by standard open, laparoscopic, or endoscopic techniques, depending on approach required by index procedure.</description>
