  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor administration, whose molecule resembles to adenosine, led to reduction in
      overall mortality and thrombotic cardiovascular (CV) events when directly compared to
      clopidogrel in the PLATO trial, implicating possible pleiotropic actions for the drug. It
      has been shown that ticagrelor increases adenosine concentration, by interfering with its
      red blood cells' uptake and by inducing the release of ATP which is then converted to
      adenosine. Recent studies in healthy volunteers and patients with coronary artery disease
      (CAD) have shown that ticagrelor increases the coronary blood flow in response to
      intravenous adenosine administration. Ticagrelor administration, in comparison with other
      P2Y12 inhibitors, may influence the endothelial function, as assessed by the Peripheral
      Arterial Tonometry method (EndoPAT 2000 system (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel), which is
      a method for evaluating endothelial dysfunction and has been found to positively correlate
      with flow mediated dilatation (FMD).

      This is a prospective, observational study, which will be conducted in patients with
      coronary artery disease subjected to percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) under
      ticagrelor maintenance dose (MD) 90mg x 2, who are about to stop treatment, due to
      completion of 1 year antiplatelet therapy.  Eligible patients will be subjected to
      peripheral arterial tonometry at Day 0 (immediately after receiving the last pill of
      ticagrelor) and at day 2 and day 5 post study drug discontinuation. Peripheral blood sample
      will be taken from the patients at Day 0 for genotype analysis.
