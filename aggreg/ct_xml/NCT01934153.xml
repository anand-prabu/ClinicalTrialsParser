  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety and
      tolerability of topically applied umeclidinium following single dose topical administration.
      The results from this study will be used to 1) improve our understanding of the risk of
      systemic accumulation upon chronic administration, 2) support dosing recommendations in a
      2a/2b study for axillary administration and, potentially, a separate combined 2a/2b study
      for palmar administration, and 3) confirm whether the same formulation can be used for
      axillary and palmar application for the next studies.

          -  Diagnosis of narrow-angle glaucoma, prostatic hypertrophy or bladder neck obstruction
             that in the opinion of the study investigator or GSK medical monitor would prevent
