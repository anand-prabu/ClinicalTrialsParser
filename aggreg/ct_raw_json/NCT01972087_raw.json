Training sessions will expose 9-1-1 telecommunicators to\n      several realistic emergency situations through mock 9-1-1 calls with a trained actor playing\n      the part of a reporting party, followed immediately by feedback on call handling provided by\n      a trained call observer.  Investigators hypothesize that simulation followed by trained\n      observer-directed feedback will increase correct triage of medical emergency and delivery of\n      pre-arrival instructions during simulated calls and in actual 9-1-1 calls."
