    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if the study drug (alirocumab)administered every 4
      weeks, given by injection under the skin is effective and safe compared with placebo in
      lowering cholesterol, if used alone or added to the participants' current
      cholesterol-lowering medication.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Men and women &gt; age 18 or legal age of majority with elevated LDL-C

          2. Patients not having adequate control of their hypercholesterolemia based on their
             individual level of CVD risk

          3. Willing and able to comply with clinic visits and study-related procedures

          4. Provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Recent (within 3 months prior to the screening visit) myocardial infarction, unstable
             angina leading to hospitalization, percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), coronary
             artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, carotid revascularization, endovascular procedure or
             surgical intervention for peripheral vascular disease

          2. Known history of positive test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)

          3. Any clinically significant abnormality identified at the time of screening that in
             the judgment of the investigator or any sub-investigator would preclude safe
             completion of the study or constrain assessment of endpoints, such as major systemic
             diseases or patients with short life expectancy.

          4. Patients considered by the investigator or any sub-investigator to be inappropriate
             for this study (e.g, geographic or social), actual or anticipated, that the
             investigator feels would restrict or limit the patient's participation for the
             duration of the study.

          5. Certain laboratory findings obtained during the screening period

        The information listed above is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial and not all inclusion/ exclusion
        criteria are listed.
