            "textblock": "Our previous study demonstrated almonds (~60 g/d) improved lipid profile, glucoregulation,\n      inflammation, and oxidative stress in 20 Chinese patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus\n      (T2DM). To follow-up and expand this work with a more robust trial, the investigators\n      propose a larger (n = 40), longer-term (90-d) investigation of the effect of almonds (~60\n      g/d) on adipokine regulation, endothelial function, glucoregulation, inflammation, lipid\n      profile, and oxidative stress in Chinese patients with T2DM as compared to a placebo\n      control. The investigators will conduct a 7-mo randomized, cross-over, placebo controlled\n      clinical trial in which all meals will be provided to all subjects (n = 40). During the\n      first 2 weeks (run-in period), all subjects will receive a control diet resembling a typical\n      Taiwan diet, prepared based on the NCEP Step 2 guidelines. During the following 3 mo (Phase\n      I), subjects will be randomized to receive either the control diet or the control diet with\n      whole almonds (~60g/d) incorporated to replace 20% calories. After a 2-wk washout period\n      during which all subjects will once again receive the control diet, subjects will receive\n      the opposite diet to the one assigned during the Phase I for the other 3 months (Phase II).\n      The caloric content of each diet will be adjusted to each subjects' energy needs to prevent\n      any change in body weight. The following biomarkers will be determined at the baseline and\n      end of each dietary intervention: Glucoregulation: fasted serum HbA1c, glucose and insulin,\n      postprandial serum glucose and insulin, and urinary C-peptide; Endothelial Function:\n      brachial artery FMD and serum nitric oxide, e-selectin, endothelial-1 (ET-1), and\n      intracellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1); Adipokine Regulation: serum adiponectin, leptin,\n      and resistin; Inflammation: serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin\n      (IL)-6, IL-10, retinol binding protein-4 (RBP-4), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1;\n      Oxidative Stress: urinary isoprostanes (adjusted for creatinine) and serum protein carbonyls\n      and oxidized LDL; and Lipid Profile: serum cholesterol, triglycerides, and apolipoproteins\n      A1 and B."
