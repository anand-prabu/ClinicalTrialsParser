  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects, good and/or bad, the combination of
      irinotecan and temozolomide has on Ewing sarcoma.

      Irinotecan and temozolomide are chemotherapy drugs that are used very often to treat
      pediatric patients at MSKCC. The investigators have used these two drugs for many years to
      treat patients with Ewing sarcoma whose cancer has relapsed.

      For patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma the current standard of care at MSKCC is a
      five drug chemotherapy regimen in combination with surgery and/or radiation therapy. This
      standard regimen is called the EFT regimen. . Some patients with Ewing sarcoma do not have
      their cancer cured by the chemotherapy and surgery/radiation therapy.

      This study adds the chemotherapy drugs called irinotecan and temozolomide to the standard
      EFT regimen. The investigators are trying to improve the success of standard therapy by
      adding these drugs. The use of irinotecan and temozolomide in this study is experimental
      because they have not been used before in patients with newly diagnosed Ewing sarcoma.
      However the investigators have found these drugs to be effective in patients with relapsed
      Ewing sarcoma. It is not known if adding these two drugs will improve the outcomes of
      patients treated for Ewing sarcoma.
