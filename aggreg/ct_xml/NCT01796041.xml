  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the World Health Organization, breast cancer is the most common cancer in
      women, and is responsible for 686,000 new cases every year. The WHO also posit that nearly
      420,000 women perished from the disease in 2002. Surgery remains the best option for
      patients presenting with operable Stage I, II or III cancers.  Breast conservation surgery
      has been shown to be as efficacious as mastectomy.  About 60-70% of these women with
      operable breast cancer are breast conservation candidates.  However, the need to achieve
      negative tumor margins often requires a second operation (re-excision) in up to 70% of the
      women having lumpectomy surgery. Currently, tumor margins assessment in the operating room
      is often assessed grossly by palpation. The ability to evaluate tumor margin using our
      proposed intraoperative imaging technique may provide the surgeon with an alternative, and
      hopefully, more sensitive method to assess tumor margins which may decrease re-excision and
      the morbidity associated with additional surgery, and, perhaps, lower the risk of local
      regional recurrence.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult patients over 18 years of age

          2. Women with newly diagnosed, operable invasive ductal carcinoma, invasive lobular
             carcinoma or ductal carcinoma who are deemed breast conservation surgery candidates
             (i.e. lumpectomy +/- sentinel node biopsy).

          3. Breast cancer needs to be unifocal as determined by clinical parameters, e.g. by
             palpation or by breast imaging findings including mammogram, US and/or breast MRI.
             Multifocal disease, i.e. cancer confined to one quadrant, is eligible if patients are
             deemed breast conservation candidates.

          4. Subject capable of giving informed consent and participating in the process of
             consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients who are not breast conservation candidates and
             those with multicentric breast cancer (breast cancer documented in multiple quadrants
             by breast imaging or exam)

          2. Pregnant women as determined by urinary or serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin
             (hCG) within 72 hours of surgery

          3. Subjects with a history of iodide allergies

          4. At-risk patient populations

               1. Homeless patients

               2. Patients with drug or alcohol dependence

               3. Patients unable to participate in the consent process
