            "textblock": "Recent advances in animal research have identified pharmacological agents that appear to\n      both accelerate and consolidate extinction learning. One cognitive enhancers is Yohimbine\n      hydrochloride (YOH). A finding in animal literature is that the administration of YOH during\n      extinction trials accelerates fear reduction and may convert ineffective exposures in to\n      successful ones. It is thought that the mechanism of enhanced emotional memory is through\n      elevated norepinephrine. However, recent findings demonstrate mixed results. In a randomized\n      controlled trial claustrophobic participants underwent exposure in combination with YOH or\n      placebo. The YOH group showed significantly better results on anxiety improvement than the\n      placebo group. In a more recent study with participants with fear of flying no additional\n      benefits of YOH were demonstrated. Therefore, we intend to replicate and extend these\n      studies by enhancing the dose of YOH in combination with VRET and by extending our\n      experimental design with another group which receives propranolol in combination with VRET.\n      Propranolol is \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonist, which has proven to disrupt reconsolidation\n      in healthy humans. In this randomized controlled trial a between groups design is chosen to\n      further characterize the differential within and between trial extinction and to enhance\n      possible between groups effects. Sixty participants with fear of flying or fear of heights\n      will be randomly assigned to one of the following three conditions 1) VRET plus YOH, 2) VRET\n      plus Propranolol, or 3) VRET plus placebo. Participants in all conditions will be offered\n      three sessions of VRET over a period of two weeks."
