  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer is a worldwide clinical and economic problem. Conventional approaches to treating
      cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy as single modalities or as
      combined therapies. Recently, targeted therapies including antibodies and small molecule
      inhibitors have also demonstrated clinical benefit. It is now possible to study different
      genetic lesions involved in cancer types due to advances in genomic methodologies. The
      investigational drug in this study, XL999 inhibits multiple receptor tyrosine kinases,
      including VEGF receptor (VEGFR2/KDR), platelet derived growth factor receptors (PDGFRÎ²),
      fms-like tyrosine kinase receptor 3 (FLT3), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR1,
      FGFR3), RET, and KIT, and thus, interferes with multiple cellular processes simultaneously
      and will likely have effects on the integrity of tumor neovasculature and angiogenesis.
      Together with the ability to induce a novel cell cycle arrest, the spectrum of activities
      that XL999 exhibits may reduce both tumor cell proliferation and angiogenesis in the clinic.

      The rationale and purpose of this maintenance study is to allow a subject receiving clinical
      benefit from XL999 to continue treatment.

    <description>The treatment will consist of 4-week cycles in which the subject will receive XL999 administered as a 4-hour IV infusion every other week. The subject will continue to receive 4-week cycles of XL999 in the absence of progressive disease, unacceptable drug-related toxicity, and as long as the drug is available.</description>
