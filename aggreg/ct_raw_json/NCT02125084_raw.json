The screening PSA\n                  measurement (documenting progression) must be greater than or equal to 2 ng/mL.\n\n          7. Adequate hematologic, hepatic and renal function.\n\n          8. Adequate coagulation parameters and serum chemistries.\n\n          9. Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.\n\n         10. Life expectancy of 6 months or greater.\n\n         11. Ability to understand the nature of the study and give written informed consent.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Treatment with more than 2 prior chemotherapy regimens.\n\n          2. Previous treatment with enzalutamide or other investigational androgen receptor\n             inhibitors.\n\n          3. Previous treatment with PI3K/mTOR inhibitors.\n\n          4. Known hypersensitivity to everolimus or other rapamycins (sirolimus, temsirolimus) or\n             its excipients.\n\n          5. Use of an investigational drug within 21 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is shorter)\n             prior to the first dose of study drug.  For investigational drugs for which 5\n             half-lives is less than 21 days, a minimum of 10 days between termination of the\n             investigational drug and administration of study drug is required.\n\n          6. All patients must be more than 21 days after their most recent chemotherapy and have\n             recovered from side effects.\n\n          7. CNS metastases."
