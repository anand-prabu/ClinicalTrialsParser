Therefore, the\n      investigators hypothesize that this would be safe and efficacious in humans as well.\n\n      Methodology: A pilot study to assess a liposome formulation containing latanoprost. The\n      investigators will recruit 6 study subjects with eyes that have raised IOP, for\n      subconjunctival injection of this liposome formulation. The recruited eye will be injected\n      and monitored for inflammation, toxicity and pain as primary end-points. Monitoring of the\n      eye will be for the first 24 hours post-injection, week 2, months 1, 2 and 3 thereafter.\n\n      Importance: If proven safe, this method of drug delivery could potentially be used for\n      treatment of raised intraocular pressures in blinding conditions such as glaucoma."
