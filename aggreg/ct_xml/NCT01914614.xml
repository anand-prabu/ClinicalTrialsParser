  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to better understand the relationship between employment and
      breast cancer. Research is being conducted to understand how workplace factors influence
      breast cancer patients' ability to adhere to recommended cancer treatment and effectively
      recover from cancer. Investigators hope to use the findings from the study to help working
      breast cancer survivors make informed decisions about treatment and employment in
      collaboration with their employers and healthcare providers.

      Patients enrolled will be interviewed three times over a six month period.  They will be
      asked questions about their experiences in managing their cancer while taking care of their
      job responsibilities. Patients will be asked to complete a survey that asks questions about
      their breast cancer treatment, their job, and how they manage their responsibilities while
      undergoing cancer treatment.

      The first initial meeting will be conducted at a time and location that is convenient for
      the patient. This meeting should last about an hour to an hour and a half.

      Three and six months after the initial interview, study participants will be asked to
      complete a follow-up survey by either telephone or Internet/Web, depending on their
      preference. These telephone surveys will last between 15-30 minutes.
