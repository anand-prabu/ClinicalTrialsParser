While this is a common disorder, medical treatments for this\n      condition vary a lot and little is known how and why different treatments work in some\n      individuals and not in others. Some physicians commonly utilize a course of oral steroid\n      therapy similar to treatment of inflammatory conditions including asthma and arthritis.\n      Other physicians feel that oral steroids are not more effective than nasal steroid sprays in\n      reducing inflammation and prefer prescribing nasal steroids. There is no conclusive data as\n      to whether oral or sprayed nasal steroids are more effective in providing long-term benefit\n      to patients. Nasal steroids are FDA approved to treat some types of chronic sinusitis but\n      oral steroids are FDA approved medications that are used to treat inflammatory conditions\n      but is not specifically indicated for chronic sinusitis and thus should be regarded as\n      investigational drug. The purpose of this research study is to better understand whether\n      orally administered steroids results in superior results when compared with nasally sprayed\n      steroids. The investigators will compare patients with chronic sinusitis who are first\n      treated with antibiotics and oral steroids, and compare them to chronic sinusitis patients\n      who receive antibiotics and nasally sprayed steroid therapy."
