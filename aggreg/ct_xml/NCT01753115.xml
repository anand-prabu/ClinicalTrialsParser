    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether there is any effect on the
      antibiotic, ciprofloxacin when taken before and after administration of a 3-dose series of
      BioThrax.

      This study will be conducted in the United States (US) in 154 healthy male and female
      volunteer subjects ages 18 to 45.

      The duration of study participation for each subject will be approximately 76 days
      (approximately 2.5 months)

      BioThraxÂ® (also called Anthrax Vaccine Adsorbed or AVA) is the only FDA-licensed vaccine for
      the prevention of anthrax infection.  This is a randomized, open-label, Phase 2,
      multi-center trial to investigate the potential interactions of ciprofloxacin (Cipro) and
      BioThrax.

             during the study

          -  Have received a live vaccine in the 30 days before study entry

          -  Plan to receive a live vaccine at any time during the study.
