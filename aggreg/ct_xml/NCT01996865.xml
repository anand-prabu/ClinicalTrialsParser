  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase 3B multicenter, randomized (stratified by histology, lines of anti-lymphoma
      therapy and age), open label study will enroll subjects with relapsed/refractory follicular
      lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) or mantle cell lymphoma (MZL). All subjects will
      receive 12 Cycles of lenalidomide plus rituximab induction therapy. The study is designed to
      compare the efficacy and safety of two maintenance regimens following induction therapy.
      Subjects will be randomized at study start to lenalidomide plus rituximab combination
      therapy (for 18 Cycles) followed by lenalidomide single-agent maintenance (to progression;
      Arm A, experimental) versus rituximab single-agent maintenance (for 18 Cycles; Arm B,
      control). The study is divided into a Screening Period, a Treatment Period (induction and
      maintenance), and a Follow up Period. Approximately 500 subjects are planned to be
      randomized.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL) and mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) are
      cancers of  the B lymphocyte, a type of white blood cell. Lenalidomide is an
      immunomodulatory drug (a drug that affects the immune system) which alters the body's immune
      system and it may also interfere with the development of tiny blood vessels involved in
      tumor growth.  Therefore, lenalidomide may reduce or prevent the growth of cancer cells.
      Lenalidomide has also been shown to restore the immune cells' ability to attack and kill
      tumor cells, an ability that may be inhibited by FL and other lymphomas. The combination of
      rituximab and lenalidomide may eliminate the cancer while restoring the immune system's
      ability to attack tumor cells.

      Subjects must have an investigator assessed diagnosis of relapsed/refractory Grade 1, 2, or
      3a follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), or mantle cell lymphoma (MCL),
      Stage I to IV, have been previously treated for their lymphoma with at least one prior line
      of systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or chemoimmunotherapy;  have at least one
      measurable nodal or extranodal lesion by computed axial tomography (CT) or magnetic
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan, and have adequate bone marrow function, liver function, and
      renal function.

      Subjects with either follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), or mantle cell
      lymphoma (MCL) will be randomized to Arm A will receive lenalidomide plus rituximab for up
      to 30 Cycles (12 induction Cycles then 18 maintenance Cycles) followed by lenalidomide
      single-agent maintenance (to disease progression [PD]).

      Subjects with either follicular lymphoma (FL), marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), or mantle cell
      lymphoma (MCL) will be randomized to Arm B will receive lenalidomide plus rituximab for 12
      Cycles (induction) followed by rituximab single-agent for 18 Cycles (maintenance). Cycle
      length in both arms is 28-days.

      Efficacy determination for the primary endpoint will be based upon progression free survival
      (PFS).
