It is being developed for the Department of Health and Human\n      Services. Researchers want to see how easy or difficult the FLASHE survey questions are to\n      understand and answer. They will interview parents and teenagers to test the survey\n      questions.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the FLASHE survey questions on teenagers and their parents.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Adolescents between 11 and 18 years of age.\n\n        -  Parents of the participating adolescents.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will have a one-on-one interview to test the survey questions. The\n           interview will last up to an hour and a half. Participants will be allowed to skip any\n           questions that they do not wish to answer.\n\n        -  Participants will receive financial compensation for their time."

Specifically, NCI proposes conducting\n      cognitive testing with the objective of identifying potential sources of measurement or\n      response errors within the questionnaires. Many of the questions are new questions that have\n      not been previously tested, or previously-used questions that have never been used with a\n      teenage population."
