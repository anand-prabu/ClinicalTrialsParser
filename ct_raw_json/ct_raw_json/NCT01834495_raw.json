Low morbidity and\n      mortality as well as a >90% technical success rate justify the endovascular-first approach.\n      Currently, In an attempt to improve outcomes, stent use has increased, and a number of\n      studies favor iliac stenting over simple PTA. A meta-analysis comparing iliac stenting to\n      PTA found that stenting had higher rates of technical success and was associated with a 39%\n      reduction in the risk of long-term loss of patency.\n\n      However, randomized control trial for comparison of primary patency between balloon\n      expandable stent and self expandable stent has not been done, although there were some\n      trials in that primary patency was compared among balloon expandable stents or among self\n      expandable stents.\n\n      Currently, The choice of balloon versus self expandable stents is determined mainly by\n      operator preference. The main advantages of balloon expandable stents are the higher radial\n      stiffness and the more accurate placement, which is especially important in bifurcation\n      lesions. In the external iliac artery, a primary stenting strategy using self-expandable\n      stents compared with provisional stenting is preferred mainly due to a lower risk of\n      dissection and elastic recoil.\n\n      Thus, the purpose of our study is to examine and compare primary patency between balloon\n      expandable stent and self expandable stent(SCUBA versus COMPLETE SE stent)"
