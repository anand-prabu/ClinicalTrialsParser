A sample size of 616 patients in both arms is required\n      to detect a risk ratio of 1.8 or above at 90% power, 1% alpha and a design effect of 2.\n      Eight clinics will be recruited and equally randomized to tele-medicine or usual care\n      stratified by distance from AEH. Inclusion criteria include a confirmed diagnosis of\n      diabetes, age over 50, no retinal exam in the previous year.  In the tele-medicine arm\n      patients will be offered fundus imaging and patients diagnosed with DR or probable DR will\n      be counselled to visit AEH to confirm DR. In the usual care arm, the eligible patients will\n      be counselled and referred to undergo an eye examination at AEH. In both the arms the\n      counselling and the awareness creation materials will be standardized. Fundus imaging will\n      be offered at the end of the study to those who refuse initially and all those in the usual\n      arm who did not attend AEH."
