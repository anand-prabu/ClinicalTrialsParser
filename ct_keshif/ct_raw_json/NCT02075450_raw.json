We will\n      evaluate the effectiveness of a novel, credit card sized, and highly affordable \"nano-card\"\n      CPR visual feedback device to improve compliance with HSFC CPR guidelines when used during\n      simulated pediatric cardiac arrest; 2. We will also develop and study a novel,\n      \"Just-in-Time\" (JIT) CPR training video, integrating proven educational methods (video-based\n      lecture, expert modeling, practice-while-watching), and use the CPR visual feedback device\n      to provide real-time coaching.\n\n      We hypothesize that:\n\n      H1: The use of a CPR visual feedback device will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR\n      and resuscitation guidelines during a simulated pediatric in-hospital cardiac arrest\n      scenario compared with standard CPR with no visual feedback.\n\n      H2: A JIT CPR Training Video, viewed by healthcare providers 2-4 weeks prior to the\n      resuscitation event, will improve compliance with current HSFC CPR and resuscitation\n      guidelines during simulated pediatric cardiac arrest compared with those healthcare\n      providers with no prior exposure to the JIT CPR Training Video."

Participants recruited to participate in\n      the study will be asked to perform as members of a pediatric resuscitation team.  Each team\n      of healthcare providers will be randomized into one of four study arms.  In study arm 1,\n      resuscitation teams will participate in a simulated pediatric cardiac arrest scenario, and\n      provide standard CPR without prior JIT training and blinded to any feedback from the CPR\n      card during the scenario.  Instead, the CPR card will be placed on the chest during\n      compressions to collect real-time data, but the feedback lights on the card will be covered\n      by black tape and thus, not visible to the members of the resuscitation team.  In study arm\n      2, resuscitation teams will participate in the same scenario without prior JIT training, but\n      provide chest compressions with the CPR card placed on the chest (and providing visual\n      feedback) during compressions.  In study arm 3, participants will be given a CPR card and\n      asked to view the JIT training video.  Then, 2-4 weeks later, they will be asked to\n      participate in the simulated cardiac arrest scenario, and provide standard CPR without\n      feedback from the CPR card.  As in study arm 1, the CPR card will still be placed on the\n      chest, but the feedback lights will be covered and not visible to the resuscitation team\n      members.  Finally, participants in study arm 4 will received JIT training 2-4 weeks prior to\n      the simulated scenario, and have the CPR card in place during chest compressions to provide\n      immediate visual feedback."
