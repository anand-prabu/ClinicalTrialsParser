    <textblock>
      This is an efficacy and safety study of MK-5172  in combination with MK-8742 in
      treatment-naive participants with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype (GT) 1, 4, 5, or
      6 infection. Participants will be randomly assigned (3:1 ratio) to immediate treatment or
      deferred treatment (placebo control). The primary efficacy hypothesis is that the proportion
      of participants receiving combination therapy in the Immediate Treatment Arm who achieve
      sustained viral response at 12 weeks after the end of study treatment (SVR12) will be
      superior to 73%.
