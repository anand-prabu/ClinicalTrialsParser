  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad goal of this study is to obtain pilot data to determine the tolerability and
      preliminary efficacy of the non-hormonal agent gabapentin for insomnia symptoms and
      nighttime Vasomotor Symptoms (VMS) when open-label gabapentin is administered at low dose
      and only at night in peri- and postmenopausal women. We hypothesize that the majority of
      participants will be able to increase and tolerate treatment, and insomnia symptoms and the
      frequency of nighttime VMS will improve on low-dose gabapentin dosed at bedtime.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty-five peri- and postmenopausal women at the Boston sites (MGH and BWH) will be
      enrolled into this open-label pilot study. This will be a 7-week intervention study using
      open-label gabapentin at bedtime with a scheduled dose titration from 100-mg for one week,
      followed by 300-mg for 3 weeks, and then 600-mg for 3 weeks.  The intervention study will
      follow a 3-week screening period to establish a stable baseline for insomnia symptoms and
      VMS and to determine the safety of administering gabapentin in study participants.
      Tolerability and treatment response (insomnia symptoms, nighttime VMS) will be assessed
      systematically at each study visit.  The dose titration schedule will be followed in all
      participants unless there are dose-limiting toxicities.
