  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Conventional approaches to relieve dyspnea (respiratory discomfort) in chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD) have focused on improving respiratory motor drive (e.g., hyperoxia)
      and/or dynamic respiratory mechanics (e.g., bronchodilators).  Although these approaches
      yield meaningful symptom improvements there remains many COPD patients incapacitated by
      dyspnea.  Accumulating evidence suggests that abdominal binding (AB) is a potentially novel
      method of improving respiratory muscle function and, by extension, dyspnea and exercise
      tolerance in COPD.  Thus, the purpose of this randomized, cross-over study is to test the
      hypothesis that AB improves exertional dyspnea and exercise tolerance in symptomatic
      patients with COPD by improving dynamic respiratory muscle function.  To this end, the
      investigators will examine the effects of AB on detailed assessments of baseline pulmonary
      function (spirometry, plethysmography), dyspnea (sensory intensity &amp; affective responses),
      neural respiratory drive (diaphragm EMG), contractile respiratory muscle function
      (esophageal, gastric &amp; transdiaphragmatic pressures), ventilation, breathing pattern and
      cardiometabolic function during symptom-limited constant load cycle exercise (75% Wmax) in
      20 patients with GOLD stage II/III COPD.
