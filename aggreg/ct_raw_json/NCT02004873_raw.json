The primary\n      safety objective of the study is to evaluate major complications related to the Micra system\n      or procedure. The primary safety endpoint will be evaluated at 6-months (183 days)\n      post-implant. The primary efficacy objective, Micra pacing capture thresholds, will also be\n      evaluated six months post-implant. This study also has a separate long term safety objective\n      that will provide additional long-term safety data following potential regulatory\n      submissions.\n\n      All subjects will be followed until official study closure (official study closure is\n      defined as when Medtronic and/or FDA requirements have been satisfied per the Clinical\n      Investigational Plan and/or by a decision by Medtronic or regulatory authority)."
