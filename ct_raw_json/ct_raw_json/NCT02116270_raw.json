It is possible\n      that \"uremic\" factors help explain the phenotypic and functional changes of lymphocytes, as\n      antigenic stimuli associated with repeated bio-compatible materials used in dialysis\n      contact.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to describe the phenotypes of the immune system of renal and\n      analyze the determinants of these changes."
