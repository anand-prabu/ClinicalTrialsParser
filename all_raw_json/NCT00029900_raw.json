Recently it has been shown that human melanomas are auxotrophic for arginine. As\n      arginine is a nonessential amino acid for humans, elimination of it may prove to be an\n      effective method for controlling cancer. Laboratory studies have provided promising results\n      with the arginine-degrading enzyme arginine deiminase (ADI) coupled to polyethylene glycol\n      (PEG) to enhance its circulating half-life.\n\n      In this study, patients each receive 3 intramuscular treatments of ADI-SS PEG over a 4-week\n      period. There are 4 cohorts of patients each receiving a different dose level.\n      Pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, safety and toxicity, and immunogenicity studies will be\n      performed."
