  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately two thirds of stroke survivors have profoundly impaired function of the upper
      limb. Currently the main stay of the treatment for upper limb motor function is
      rehabilitation therapy focusing on repetitive and skillful task practice (task-oriented
      therapy) which has been shown to induce substantial functional reorganization in the
      undamaged motor cortex and functional recovery. In spite of rehabilitation therapy,
      functional recovery of arm and hand function is limited to one third of stroke survivors and
      there is a great need for adjunct treatment to current practice. Repetitive Transcranial
      Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a noninvasive means of stimulating nerve cells in superficial
      areas of the brain and emerging as a novel method of modulating cortical excitability and
      promoting functional recovery after stroke. There have been studies using rTMS to improve
      motor function after stroke. However, whether 1Hz rTMS can enhance the effect of the
      task-oriented therapy on upper limb function after stroke has not been investigated. In this
      pilot proposal, we intend to investigate the feasibility of 1Hz rTMS on unaffected
      hemisphere as an adjunct to task-oriented therapy to improve upper limb motor function among
      stroke patients. The information obtained from this pilot study will provide a platform for
      the future randomized control trials combining the rTMS and task-oriented therapy to enhance
      motor recovery among stroke survivors.
