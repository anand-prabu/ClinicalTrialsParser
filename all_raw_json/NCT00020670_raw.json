After completion of 4\n      vaccinations, patients who have more aliquots of vaccine available from the initial tumor\n      cell collection may receive additional vaccinations every 2 weeks in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Vaccination may be postponed for a maximum of 1 year\n      after tumor cell collection in patients who receive chemotherapy and/or allogeneic stem cell\n      transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed at approximately 2 months after last vaccination.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20 patients will be accrued for this study."
