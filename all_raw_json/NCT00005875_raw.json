Patients\n      receive oral nitrocamptothecin daily on days 1-5. Treatment continues weekly for at least 8\n      weeks (2 courses) in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
