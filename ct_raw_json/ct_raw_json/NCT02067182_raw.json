Recent guidelines recommended con-tinuation of\n      OAC in all patients with CHA2DS2VASc score \u22652 even if there is no evidence of recurrent AF\n      (Camm JA et al., Eur Heart J 2012). The net clinical ben-efit of OAC after successful\n      ablation in these patients remains to some extent un-clear. As OAC bears the risk of\n      bleeding events, the ODIn-AF study aims to evalu-ate the positive effect of OAC on the\n      incidence of silent cerebral embolic events in patients with a high risk for embolic events,\n      free from AF after successful pulmo-nary vein ablation. ODIn-AF aims to determine that\n      continued administration of dabigatran is superior in the preven-tion of silent cerebral\n      embolism to discontinuation of OAC after 3 months in pa-tients free from symptomatic\n      AF-episodes with a CHA2DS2VASc score \u22652 after the first pulmonary vein ablation for\n      paroxysmal AF."
