            "textblock": "The world population has reached an unprecedented seven billion, with global population\n      ageing increasing at a greater rate than total population growth. Between 1998 and 2030, the\n      proportion of persons aged 65 years and over in Singapore will grow by about 3% annually\n      compared to 1.0-1.3% in some developed nations. Specific cognitive deficits like\n      inattention, dysexecutive functioning, and processing speed decline may affect a number of\n      quality of life domains. Concurrent with these statistics, the maintenance of the highest\n      possible level of cognitive functioning for as long as possible has become an important goal\n      of aging successfully.\n\n      To contribute to the realization of this goal we propose to conduct a wait-list control\n      pilot trial to examine the efficacy and safety of BrainpalTM for cognitive enhancement in\n      the normal elderly. BrainpalTM uses a technology which analyzes brain waves captured through\n      an electroencephalogram to determine the participants' state of attention. The training\n      program developed using this patented technology may be useful for individuals who\n      experience difficulty with memory and sustaining their attention.\n\n      BrainpalTM may represent one alternative means to enhance cognitive abilities and to slow\n      down cognitive decline in the normal elderly. If demonstrated to be efficacious, this\n      therapy may even help to delay the onset of dementia.\n\n      In addition, the rate of cognitive decline during the course of AD is possibly influenced by\n      not only environmental but also genetic factors. To date, several genes, such as\n      apolipoprotein E (APOE) and TOMM40 (translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40\n      homologue), have been identified to be probable genetic risk markers for AD. These genes\n      have been shown to play a role in disease onset as well as rates of cognitive decline. For\n      instance, studies have shown APOE\u03b54 allele carriers to be associated with earlier and faster\n      cognitive decline.\n\n      Therefore, we propose to analyse if there is any relationship between the genetic profiles\n      of our participants and their performance in the BrainpalTM training program."
