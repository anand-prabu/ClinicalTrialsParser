Part 1 will consist of confirmation of smoking abstinence, testing for\n      abstinence-induced cognitive deficits and the collection of subjective assessments.  Part 2\n      will begin with a programmed smoking lapse, after which the subjective rewarding value of\n      the programmed lapse cigarette will be assessed.  Before leaving the clinic on Day 6,\n      subjects will receive brief cessation counseling and be instructed to try to remain\n      abstinent from 10pm that evening until after the final Observation Visit on Day 10.\n\n      During the ~4-day monitored abstinence/observation phase, subjects will complete in-clinic\n      observation visits (subjective assessments, medication adherence, etc.) on Days 7, 8, and\n      10.\n\n      After a ~3-week medication washout period and Period 2 Medication Pick-up Visit on ~Day 31,\n      subjects will begin study medication (either ABT-089 or placebo; but will always be the\n      opposite of the assigned study medication in period 1) and participate in period 2 of the\n      study following the same procedures as period 1."

Smokers who wish to quit smoking in the next 2-6 months (treatment-seeking), because\n             our prior work suggests that motivated subjects are more sensitive to medication\n             effects on smoking behavior.  Using a scale from 0 to 100 (100, being extremely\n             interested), subjects must rate their interest in quitting smoking within the next 6\n             months greater than 50.\n\n          4. Able to communicate fluently in English (speaking, writing, and reading).\n\n          5. Plan to live in the area for the next 2 months.\n\n          6. Capable of giving written informed consent, which includes compliance with the\n             requirements and restrictions listed in the combined consent and HIPAA form.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria.\n\n        Subjects who self-report and/or present with the following criteria will not be eligible\n        to participate in the study:\n\n          1.

Provide a CO reading of 10 ppm or greater at either Testing Visit (Days 6 and\n                  37). If the CO reading is greater than or equal to 10 ppm, but there is a 50%\n                  reduction from the CO reading collected at the Baseline/Period 1 Medication\n                  Pick-Up Visit, this will be sufficient and the subject may continue as\n                  scheduled.\n\n               5.
