            "textblock": "Background Arteriovenous (AV) fistula is the most common vascular access for long-term\n      hemodialysis in the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. About 25% of these patients are\n      diabetes mellitus. However, the effects of hyperglycemia on the vascular function of\n      arteriovenous fistula are still remained unclear. Studies have shown that blood flow in the\n      AV fistula is significantly reduced in patients with diabetes mellitus. Diabetic patients\n      also require a longer period of time for the maturation of AV fistula, and have slightly\n      higher complication rate than non-diabetic patients. Statins have been widely shown to\n      mediate several important pleiotropic effects in the improvement of vascular endothelial\n      dysfunction, attenuation of inflammatory responses, stabilization of atherosclerotic\n      plaques, inhibition of vascular smooth muscle proliferation, and modulation of procoagulant\n      activity and platelet function.Our experimental studies in diabetic animals demonstrate that\n      administration of a water-soluble statin rosuvastatin significantly improves the fistula\n      flow, vascular function and luminal dilatation of AV fistula in diabetic rats by suppression\n      of vascular oxidative stress and inflammatory load.\n\n      Study hypothesis The central hypothesis of this research project is rosuvastatin mediates\n      pleiotropic protective effect on vascular endothelial function and suppresses the regional\n      pro-inflammatory reaction in the vasculature, therefore administration of rosuvastatin\n      during the perioperative period of creation of native AV fistulas in diabetic patients with\n      ESRD may potentiate the vascular function and reduce the primary failure rate of AV\n      fistulae."
