      the trauma symptoms among Syrian Refugees.

    <textblock>
      In this project we aim to treat the posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms among
      Syrian refugees through an effective psycho-therapy technique called Eye Movement
      Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR). Randomly selected refugees will be assessed through
      MINI PLUS for the diagnose of PTSD. Eighty refugees with PTSD will be randomly allocated to
      either 7 sessions EMDR or wait-list control group.Symptoms of PTSD (MINI PLUS, HTQ, IES-R)
      and depression and anxiety (BDI, HSCL)will be assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 4
      weeks follow-up.

      However, to our knowledge this is one of the first intervention studies which will be
      conducted in a refugee camp. Therefore we expect to have some practical and logical
      problems. In order to see the feasibility and efficacy of EMDR among Syrian refugees, before
      the main study we aim to run a pilot study with less participants. In the pilot we will
      assess the posttraumatic stress symptoms with Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the
      depressive symptoms through Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II).
