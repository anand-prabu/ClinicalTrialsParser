This procedure will continue until level 3 provided that the MTD has not been reached. If a DLT is observed in one of the first 3 patients in a dose level, then accrual for that level will be expanded to 6 patients. Two or more instances of DLT in a cohort of 6 patients will result in the preceding dose level being defined as the MTD. If dose level 1 is not tolerable then dose level -1 will be investigated.

            "textblock": "More active treatments are desperately needed in pancreatic cancer. The regimen of\n      FOLFIRINOX increases survival as compared to gemcitabine but at a cost of increased\n      toxicity. Irinotecan is responsible for much of the toxicity of FOLFIROX but may not\n      contribute significantly to the regimen's activity. Abraxane is a new agent in pancreatic\n      cancer. This albumin-bound nanoparticle form of paclitaxel increases tumor accumulation of\n      paclitaxel though binding of albumin to SPARC in pancreatic cancer stroma. The investigators\n      therefore propose a pilot study of FOLFOX (fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin)\n      combined with abraxane to establish the safety and preliminary activity of FOLFOX-A.\n      Patients with inoperable (metastatic and locally advanced) pancreatic cancer will be\n      eligible since the primary outcome is to establish the safety of FOLFOX-A."
