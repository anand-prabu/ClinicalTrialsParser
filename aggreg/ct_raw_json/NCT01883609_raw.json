One group of volunteers will receive vaccination with the leading malaria\n      vaccine candidate, RTS,S/AS01. This vaccine schedule will consist of 3 doses of RTS,S/AS01\n      with an interval of 4 weeks between doses (Doses given at 0,4 and 8 week timepoints).\n      Another group will receive a vaccination schedule composed of the same dosage and timing\n      regimen of RTS,S, but they will also receive vaccination with  ChAd63 ME-TRAP, 2 weeks after\n      the first RTS,S followed 8 weeks later by vaccination with MVA ME-TRAP (2 and 10 week\n      timepoints).\n\n      The study will assess the safety of the vaccinations, and the immune responses to\n      vaccination. Immune responses are measured by tests on blood samples. Volunteers will be\n      infected with malaria by mosquito bites, 12 weeks after the first vaccination. In addition,\n      a group of volunteers not receiving vaccines will also be infected with malaria by the same\n      method. These infection experiments will be used to assess vaccine efficacy: how well the\n      vaccines act to prevent malaria disease. A further single volunteer may also be infected\n      with malaria; this volunteer participated in a previous trial where they received vaccines\n      and was completely protected against malaria disease after infection by mosquito bite.\n\n      The RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is a protein (RTS,S) mixed with an adjuvant (AS01). The ChAd63\n      ME-TRAP and MVA ME-TRAP vaccines are called viral vectored vaccines. They are made from\n      viruses which are modified so that they can not multiply. The viruses have extra DNA in them\n      so that after injection, the body makes malaria proteins (but malaria does not develop), so\n      that the immune system builds a response to malaria without having been infected by it.\n\n      Healthy volunteers will be recruited in England at three research sites: in Oxford, London\n      and Southampton."
