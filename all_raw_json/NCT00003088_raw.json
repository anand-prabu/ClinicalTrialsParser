Giving drugs at different times or combining more than one drug\n      may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective\n      for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy consisting\n      of either doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, or paclitaxel given at different times with that of\n      combination chemotherapy consisting of doxorubicin plus cyclophosphamide followed by\n      paclitaxel in treating women with stage II or stage IIIA breast cancer."

Compare the sequential chemotherapy with doxorubicin, paclitaxel and\n      cyclophosphamide to combined doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide followed by paclitaxel for\n      disease free and overall survival in women with node positive stage II or IIIA breast\n      cancer. II. Determine whether increasing the dose density of adjuvant chemotherapy will\n      improve disease free and overall survival. III. Compare the toxicity in patients treated\n      with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are randomized into one of four arms\n      (sequential chemotherapy every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks vs concurrent chemotherapy followed\n      by paclitaxel every 2 weeks vs every 3 weeks). All tumor should be removed by either a\n      modified radical mastectomy or a segmental mastectomy plus axillary node dissection.\n      Adjuvant chemotherapy is started within 84 days following the last surgical procedure. Arm\n      I: Patients receive sequential chemotherapy every 3 weeks. Doxorubicin IV is administered\n      once every 3 weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is then administered over 3 hours once every 3\n      weeks for 4 doses. Cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 3 weeks for 4 doses\n      following paclitaxel. Arm II: Patients receive sequential chemotherapy every 2 weeks.\n      Doxorubicin IV is administered once every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is then\n      administered over 3 hours once every 2 weeks for 4 doses. Cyclophosphamide IV is\n      administered once every 2 weeks for 4 doses following paclitaxel. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is\n      administered by subcutaneous injection on days 3-10 after each dose of doxorubicin,\n      paclitaxel, and cyclophosphamide. Arm III: Patients receive combination chemotherapy every 3\n      weeks. Combination doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 3 weeks\n      for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is administered over 3 hours once every 3 weeks for 4 doses\n      following combination chemotherapy. Arm IV: Patients receive combination chemotherapy every\n      2 weeks. Combination doxorubicin IV and cyclophosphamide IV is administered once every 2\n      weeks for 4 doses. Paclitaxel IV is administered over 3 hours once every 2 weeks for 4 doses\n      following combination chemotherapy. G-CSF is administered by subcutaneous injection on days\n      3-10 after each dose of doxorubicin/cyclophophamide and after each dose of paclitaxel. After\n      completion of all chemotherapy, patients receive tamoxifen orally for 5 years. Patients\n      undergo radiotherapy 4-6 weeks after the completion of chemotherapy. Patients are followed\n      every 6 months for 5 years, then annually until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 22\n      months."
