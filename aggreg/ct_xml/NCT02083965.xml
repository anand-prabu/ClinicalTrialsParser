  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of BIIB031
      administered from vial strengths of 1000 and 3000 IU in participants with severe hemophilia
      A.  The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the safety of BIIB031 beyond the PK
      assessment for up to 6 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, open-label, crossover study during which each participant will
      receive a single injection of BIIB031 from 2 different vial concentrations (pharmacokinetics
      [PK] assessment). After the PK assessment, participants will be provided with BIIB031 for
      either prophylactic or episodic (on-demand) treatment for up to 6 months.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Parental or guardian consent is required for subjects who are less than 18 years of
             age or unable to give consent, or as applicable per local laws. Subjects who are less
             than 18 years of age may provide assent in addition to the parental/guardian consent,
             if appropriate.

          -  Male, age ≥12 years at the time of informed consent, and weighing at least 40 kg.

          -  Have severe hemophilia A

          -  Previously treated subject, defined as having at least 150 documented prior exposure
             days to any recombinant and/or plasma-derived FVIII and/or cryoprecipitate products
             (other than any use of BIIB031 - study drug or commercial product) at Day 1. Fresh
             frozen plasma treatment must not be considered in the count for documented exposure
             days.

          -  No history of a positive inhibitor test or clinical signs of decreased response to
             FVIII administrations. Family history of inhibitors will not exclude subjects.

          -  No measurable inhibitor activity using the Nijmegen-modified Bethesda assay at
             Screening.

          -  Platelet count ≥100,000 platelets/μL at screening

          -  CD4 lymphocytes &gt;200 mm3 if known as HIV antibody positive at screening.

          -  Viral load of &lt;400 copies/mL if known HIV antibody positive at screening

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is at high risk of bleeding during the 5-day period between the first and
             second injections for PK analyses, as per Investigator discretion.

          -  Previous treatment with BIIB031 as study drug or commercial product.

          -  Other coagulation disorder(s) in addition to hemophilia A.

          -  History of hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis associated with any FVIII or IV
             immunoglobulin administration.

          -  Currently taking (or likely to require during the study) acetylsalicylic acid (ASA),
             except for low-dose ASA as prophylaxis (other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
             are permitted).

          -  Concurrent systemic treatment with immunosuppressive drugs within 12 weeks prior to
             Day 1. Exceptions to this include: ribavirin for treatment of hepatitis C virus
             (HCV), and/or systemic steroids (a total of 2 courses of pulse treatments lasting no
             more than 7 days at a dose of ≤1 mg/kg within 12 weeks prior to Day 1) and/or inhaled
             steroids.
