Demographic variables of morbidity and prognosis: clinical, analytical,\n      anthropometrical, adherence to processing and consumption of medicines will be collected.\n\n      Intervention: Initial educational session based on the significant learning and quarterly\n      follow-up in surgery of medicine and nursing for 2 years.\n\n      Analysis: By intention of treating. Descriptive statistics of each variable and statistical\n      analytical univariate and multivariate (multiple linear regression) will be carried out. The\n      explanatory variable in the analysis multivariate will be the intervention group."
