      Investigators presumed that preload consumers will have more weight reduction and lower risk
      of cardiovascular disease

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To our knowledge, all previous studies evaluated the energy intake in a dietary meal after
      consuming a low-energy-dense preload while none assessed the sustainability of lower amount
      of energy intake and body weight changes in a long-term. On the other hand, the
      sustainability of lower energy intake in a long term might be affected by higher dietary
      diversity score due to considering preload in diets. Notably, increased diet variety is
      associated with higher overall dietary energy intake and weight gain.

    <description>All participants were prescribed a calorie-restricted diet (-200 to -500 kcal/d). Calorie requirements of each subject were estimated based on resting energy expenditure (REE) by using Harris- Benedict equation and also considering the physical activity levels. The diets were constructed to provide similar proportions of carbohydrates (55% energy), protein (15% energy) and total fat (30% energy).</description>
