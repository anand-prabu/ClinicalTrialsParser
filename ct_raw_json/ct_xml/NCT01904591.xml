  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll 10 adults with a chronic spinal cord injury.  The investigators will
      image their damaged motor tracts using MRI tractography scanning, and the investigators will
      formally assess their ASIA motor level at the outset of the study.  Then, the investigators
      will treat them with one year of 'over the counter' dosage of selenium and vitamin E.  These
      are two vitamins known to be anti-oxidants.  After one year the investigators will repeat
      the MRI scans and ASIA assessments to determine if their has been any change in the
      appearance of motor tracts on MRI tractography, or in motor level on ASIA exam.  As this is
      a pilot study the investigators are primarily concerned with establishing safety of this
      intervention, with a view to conducting a larger and more rigorous controlled trial in the
      future.  The investigators also have a small hope that in fact some improvement might be
      found with vitamin treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label prospective pilot study.  The results of this study will assist the
      researchers in organizing a larger study. The objective of the study is to determine if
      treatment with over the counter nutrients (Vitamin E and Selenium) may improve recovery in
      patients with remote traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI).  The investigators will enroll 10
      adults with remote traumatic spinal cord injury.  The participant will have experienced
      their injury at least one year prior to enrollment, are currently living in the community.
      Participants may not have any other neurological cause of weakness (i.e. stroke or traumatic
      brain injury), must be able to undergo MRI scanning, and be able to take the oral
      medications as prescribed.  At the beginning of the study, baseline strength will be
      measured by a standardized (American Spinal Injury Association) exam. This exam will be
      repeated one year after taking the treatment.  Furthermore specialized radiological imaging
      (MRI tractography) of the spinal cord will be completed prior to taking the medications, and
      one year subsequently.  MRI tractography is advanced imaging technology that is able to
      generate quantitive images of the nerve  fiber tracts in the spinal cord that control limb
      movement.  We anticipate that treatment with Vitamin E and selenium for a one period year
      will increase the ASIA motor score and/or increase the nerve density of the nerve tracts in
      the spinal cord that control limb movement

    <description>MRI tractography will be performed at baseline and 1 year post treatment.  This imaging modality allows for a detailed picture of the spinal cord motor tracts (the corticospinal tracts).  We will measure these tracts (thickness, density, lengths) according to standard tractography protocol and record any change in said measures after treatment.</description>
