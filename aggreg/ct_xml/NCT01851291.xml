  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a randomised study of deferred stenting in acute STEMI (for
      between 4-16 hours), once normal flow has been established (TIMI 3) with guide-wire,
      aspiration thrombectomy +/- small balloon, to assess whether this strategy might reduce the
      incidence of no-reflow compared to usual care and to make a preliminary assessment of the
      effects, if any, on clinical and surrogate outcomes.
