  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase in socially less
      advantaged populations but is stabilizing even is decreasing in socially more advantaged
      populations. The PRALIMAP trial highlighted the effectiveness of structured screening and
      care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in high school
      adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial aims to investigate whether a strengthened
      care management (CM) for socially less advantaged adolescents in school in the short and
      long term has an equivalent effect as a standard-CM on decreasing the prevalence of
      overweight and obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.

      Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial of 1,250 overweight
      and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who are attending grade 10 in the 21 state-run
      high schools of the Vosges department (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013
      and 2013-2014. Overweight adolescents (including obese) classified as advantaged are
      allocated to the standard-CM and those less advantaged are randomized to standard CM or
      strengthened-CM. The standard-CM consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in
      high school and supervised by a healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity
      care management for adolescents. The strengthened-CM consists of 5 collective sessions with
      the same standard operating procedure as the standard-CM with supplementary interventions
      between each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led
      educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity
      practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings. Data on
      sociodemographics, anthropometrics, physical activity and mental health are collected at 3
      visits: at the entry to grade 10 (before the intervention=T0), at the end of grade 10 (at
      the end of the intervention=T1) and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after the
      intervention=T2). Process evaluation data are also collected during the trial.

      Expected results: To confirm the effectiveness of overweight CM for adolescents in a school
      setting and to highlight or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions
      adapted for socially less advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to
      overweight care.

      Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase in socially less
      advantaged populations but is stabilizing even is decreasing in socially more advantaged
      populations. The PRALIMAP trial confirmed major social inequalities in overweight and
      obesity frequency in adolescents in grade 10. The trial highlighted the effectiveness of
      structured screening and care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and
      obesity in high school adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial  aims to
      investigate whether a strengthened care management strategy for socially less advantaged
      adolescents in school in the short and long term (just after the intervention and 1 year
      later) has an equivalent effect as a standard-care management strategy on decreasing the
      prevalence of overweight and obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.

      Hypothesis: A strengthened overweight and obesity care management strategy for overweight
      and obesity (risk factors of cancer) can improve care access for socially less advantaged
      adolescents and maintain social equality in terms of overweight and obesity prevalence.

      Intervention: PRALIMAP-INÉS is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial (one randomised
      part and one non-randomised part) of 1,250 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18
      years who are attending grade 10 in the 21 state-run high schools of the Vosges department
      (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. After a session to
      detect overweight and obese adolescents, the social status of included adolescents as
      &quot;advantaged&quot; or &quot;less advantaged&quot; is determined. Adolescents classified as advantaged are
      allocated to the standard-care management and those less advantaged are randomized to
      standard-care management or strengthened-care management. The standard-care management
      consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in high school and supervised by a
      healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity care management for
      adolescents. The team consists of physicians, dietitians, psychologists and sports educators
      from the AVRS Association. The content of sessions was validated in the PRALIMAP trial. The
      strengthened-care management consists of 5 collective sessions with the same standard
      operating procedure as the standard-care management with supplementary interventions between
      each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led
      educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity
      practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings (adjusting the care
      management according to the social status). Data on sociodemographics, anthropometrics,
      physical activity and mental health are collected at 3 visits: at the entry to grade 10
      (before the intervention = T0), at the end of grade 10 (at the end of the intervention = T1)
      and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after the intervention = T2). T1 measurement allows for
      evaluating the short-term effect of the intervention and T2, the long-term effect of a
      1-year break from the intervention. Data on participation and from questionnaires, as well
      as focus group and activity reports, necessary for evaluation, are collected during the
      trial.

      Expected results: With this trial, the investigators expect to confirm the effectiveness of
      overweight and obesity care management for adolescents in a school setting and to highlight
      or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions adapted for socially less
      advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to overweight and obesity care.
