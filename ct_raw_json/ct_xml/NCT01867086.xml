    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II study of FANG™ autologous tumor cell vaccine integrated with
      carboplatinum. All patients will have had FANG™ prepared and stored from ovarian tumor cells
      obtained at the time of primary surgical debulking. Patients meeting eligibility criteria
      will receive either carboplatinum alone (AUC 6/30 minute infusion) (or carboplatinum (AUC
      5/30 minute infusion) and taxol (175 mg/m2/3 hour infusion)one day prior to FANG™ 1.0 x 10e7
      cells/intradermal injection, once every 3 weeks.
