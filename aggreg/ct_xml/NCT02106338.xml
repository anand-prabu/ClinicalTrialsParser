    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA
      synthetase inhibitor.  In this study, doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg, or 100mg are planned
      and will be given orally every 12 hours for 10 days. Up to 30 healthy male and female
      subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive. The primary objective: of the study is to determine the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration of
      multiple doses to healthy adults. The study duration is 46 weeks.

      This is a Phase I, single center, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, multiple
      ascending dose study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CRS3123, a methionyl-tRNA
      synthetase inhibitor.  In this study, doses of 200, 400, and 600 mg, or 100mg are planned
      and will be given orally every 12 hours for 10 days.  Therefore, there is a possibility of
      clinically significant absorption of study drug.  If any significant safety signals (See
      Section 8.5.3 Halting Rules) are encountered, the investigators will notify DMID who will
      determine the need for an ad hoc SMC review.  For the purposes of this study, &quot;Ad hoc&quot;
      simply means unscheduled which may be held at any time throughout the study per DMID's
      discretion.  If deemed appropriate by halting rules and/or DMID's discretion enrollment will
      be halted for an ad hoc SMC meeting.  Decision to resume the study after halting will be
      determined by DMID in consideration of the SMC recommendations.   The dose for Cohort B and
      study progression and dose escalation to Cohorts B and C will require a full (planned) SMC
      review of all safety data obtained through Day 18.  Should safety data review of the 200 mg
      dose result in an unfavorable safety profile, the study design allows for reduction in dose
      to 100 mg to be given in Cohort B.  If this is the case, there will be no Cohort C.  Each
      subject will receive oral doses of CRS3123 or placebo. Up to 30 healthy male and female
      subjects 18 to 45 years, inclusive. The primary objective: of the study is to determine the
      safety and tolerability of escalating doses of CRS3123 following oral administration of
      multiple doses to healthy adults. The study duration is 46 weeks.

               -  Current diagnosis of pulmonary disease

               -  Current diagnosis of asthma, which has required use of asthma medications within

                  surgical resection of significant proportions of the stomach or bowel, gastric
                  bypass, gastric banding, irritable bowel syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease)

             Phase 1 Unit personnel after explaining the consent and observing the subject reading
             the consent.

          -  Ingestion of prescription medications, grapefruit juice, or St John's Wort starting
