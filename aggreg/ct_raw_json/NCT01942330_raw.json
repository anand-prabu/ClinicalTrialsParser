Current pregnancy or considering becoming pregnant during the follow-up period or\n             within 6 months of surgery\n\n          2.

Patients with bulky tumors that would require open operations are not\n             candidates for this study.\n\n          3. Body Mass Index (BMI) > 35\n\n          4. Vaginal stenosis\n\n          5. Prior reconstructive surgery of the vagina not including hysterectomy\n\n          6. ASA classes 4 and 5\n\n          7. Advanced renal insufficiency (estimated creatinine clearance \u226430 mL/min/1.73 m2)\n\n          8. Any history of pelvic radiation\n\n          9. Anticipated need for an ostomy at the time of operation\n\n         10. Patients requiring urgent or emergent surgery\n\n         11.
