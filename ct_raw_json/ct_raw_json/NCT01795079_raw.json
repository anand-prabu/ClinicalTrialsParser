This study is part of the\n      Boston-Harvard Burn Model System. The investigators hypothesize that there will be a\n      decrease in pain levels with active stimulation, when compared to sham stimulation, using a\n      3 week stimulation schedule- 2 weeks of stimulation (10 consecutive days) followed by 1 week\n      of stimulation (5 consecutive days) after three follow up visits at 2, 4 and 8 weeks after\n      initial course of stimulation. The subject will also have follow ups at 2, 4 and 8 weeks\n      after the second course of stimulation.\n\n      If a subject receives sham during the experiment, he/she may enroll in an open-label portion\n      of the study and receive 10 days of active stimulation."
