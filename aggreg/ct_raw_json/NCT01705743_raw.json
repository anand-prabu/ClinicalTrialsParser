            "textblock": "Anaesthesia was induced by sevoflurane in oxygen. Cisatracurium 0.15 mg kg-1 was\n      administered after loss of the lash re\ufb02ex, then ventilated manually until the amplitude of\n      T1 decreased to 0. Intubation was performed and switched to mechanical ventilation with a\n      fresh gas flow of 2 L min-1. Anesthesia was maintained by sevoflurane or sevoflurane+60%\n      nitrous oxide respectively. The surgical incision was performed at least 30 min after\n      tracheal intubation, provided that the predetermined end-tidal sevoflurane concentration had\n      been constant for at least 30 min and that the difference between inspired and end-tidal\n      concentrations was less than 10%.\n\n      Brain electrical activity was measured using Narcotrend Monitor and S/5 Compact Anaesthesia\n      Monitor, which displayed unprocessed EEG and burst suppression ratio, respectively. The\n      design of the experiment is referred to the \"Dixon up-and-down\" method. To avid anaesthesia\n      awareness, the first subject was designed to receive end-tidal sevoflurane concentration of\n      2.5 %. The presence or absence of isoelectric EEG (Entropy Module) of the preceding patient\n      determined the end-tidal concentration of sevoflurane given to the next patient (with an\n      increment size of 0.2%). The isoelectric EEG was considered as significant when the\n      isoelectric state last for more than 1 min. The maximal burst suppression rate was recorded\n      if isoelectric EEG was not reached."
