ICA-17043 is a potent and specific inhibitor of a\n      channel in human red blood cells (RBCs) that blocks RBC dehydration.  ICA-17043 is expected\n      to inhibit RBC dehydration and thus should prevent or delay the sickling process.  By\n      reducing sickled cells, an improvement in anemia, a reduction in painful crises, and\n      ultimately, less end-organ disease is anticipated."
