            "textblock": "Headache is a common health problem that affects quality of life in an older population and\n      imposes substantial economic costs. Headache changes with age. Features of headache become\n      less typical and neck pain is more frequently associated with headache in older persons. We\n      recently demonstrated that the presence of cervical musculoskeletal impairment is not\n      specific to cervicogenic headache (headache caused by the neck). Rather it was present in\n      various frequent intermittent headache types in elders when compared to elders without\n      headache. Changes in headache characteristics with age play an important role not only in\n      diagnosis but also in treatment choice. Impairment in cervical musculoskeletal function\n      found in older persons with headache has implications for headache management choices as the\n      evidence indicates that physiotherapy management methods such as manual therapy and\n      therapeutic exercise are an effective management approach for headache associated with the\n      neck. Physiotherapy treatment would be a safe therapeutic option and may have a beneficial\n      effect for elders with headache who have neck pain and concomitant cervical musculoskeletal\n      dysfunction. This is particularly relevant as there are widespread concerns about medication\n      overuse, adverse drug events and drug interactions in older persons. The effective\n      management of older persons with headache in particular of those with atypical features of\n      headache remains a challenge. Physiotherapy is indicated in those older persons diagnosed\n      with cervicogenic headache but could also be adjunct treatment for those with cervical\n      musculoskeletal signs who are suspected of having transitional headache. At present, there\n      has been no trial to date which has investigated the effectiveness of physiotherapy\n      treatment specifically for older persons with various types of headache with associated neck\n      pain and cervical musculoskeletal impairment. A clinical trial of treatment of cervical\n      musculoskeletal impairment in older persons with various headache types may help guide\n      management of headache in attempts to lesson medication use and cost in this population.\n      Physiotherapy management may be a worthy treatment option particularly in older persons with\n      headache who do not respond well to medication."
