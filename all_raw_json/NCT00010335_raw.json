Patients receive\n      anti-thymocyte globulin IV on days -5, -3, -1, 1, 3, and 5 and cyclophosphamide IV on days\n      -3 and -2.  CD34-selected PBSCs are reinfused on day 0.  Patients receive G-CSF IV daily\n      beginning on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients are followed annually for 5 years and then every 5 years thereafter."
