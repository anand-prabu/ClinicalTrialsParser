These medications can cause side effects in some women, and occasionally\n      they can be quite bothersome.  We are doing a study to better understand the side effects of\n      aromatase inhibitors so that we can hopefully treat them better or possibly prevent them.\n      In particular, we are interested in pain and difficulty sleeping.  This study is designed to\n      assess the effect of aromatase inhibitors on pain, sleep quality, and fatigue and the\n      interplay of these side effects and their subsequent impact on daily activity.  Each\n      participant will fill out a series of questionnaires about pain, sleep quality, and fatigue\n      and will also complete a sleep diary and wear an actigraphy watch for 10 days before\n      starting an aromatase inhibitor and after taking it for 3 months.  We hope to learn more\n      about these symptoms so we can better manage medication toxicity in the future."
