  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesis is that using the micropulse laser in patient with Central
      Serous Chorioretinopathy (CSC) will prompt resolution of CSC and will be effective in
      significantly minimizing visual recovery time from this disease as well as potentially
      preventing recurrences.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesize that application of 577nm micropulse laser in patients with
      CSC will prompt resolution of CSC as measured by ocular coherence tomography and best
      corrected visual acuity. This will be a pilot study to establish sound methods and provide
      some insights to the safety and efficacy of CSC treatment.

    <description>Central Serous Choroidopathy is a disease that causes fluid to build up under the retina,the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The objective here is to apply 577nm of micropulse laser to see if CSC resolution occurs and measuring it through ocular coherence tomography (retinal imaging), vision score, and visual field testing for retinal sensitivity.</description>

    <description>Patient's randomized to ML treatment would be treated with the following settings: 200 micron spot size, 0.2 second duration, 15% duty cycle, and 300 milliWatt power. Their eyes would be dilated prior to treatment with standard mydriatic medications, including Tropicamide and Phenylephrine</description>

    <description>Patients randomized to this treatment arm, will not receive treatment for CSC. They will continue to be observed at month 1 and month 3. If any worsening of pathology is found during the follow up visits, the patient will be removed from the study and given appropriate standard of care by the attending</description>
