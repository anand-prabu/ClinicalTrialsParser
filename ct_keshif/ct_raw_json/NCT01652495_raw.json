            "textblock": "Rotator cuff calcific tendonitis is a common disease, mainly affecting women aged 30 to 50\n      years old. It is associated to severe pain and impotence. US-guided percutaneous treatment\n      is considered the gold standard treatment with the aim to destroy and wash out shoulder's\n      calcification, responsible for inflammation, pain and functional limitation. Corticosteroids\n      are injected in the subacromial-subdeltoid bursa at the end of the procedure to facilitate\n      the prompt pain relief and functional recovery. Although corticosteroids represent the most\n      powerful drugs to reduce inflammation and pain, their use is associated to important side\n      effects, mainly the suppression of the hypothalamus-pituitary-axis (HPA). At the same time,\n      no standardized protocols exist regarding the best type and dose of corticosteroid to be\n      injected in association to the above mentioned treatment, nor data evaluating the exact\n      duration of HPA suppression following a single intrabursal injection of corticosteroids.\n\n      40 patients affected by rotator cuff calcific tendonitis will be enrolled in the study and\n      randomly assigned to two groups: one group (20 patients) will be treated with a single\n      intrabursal injection of 40 mg of methylprednisolone; the other group (20 patients) will be\n      treated with a single intrabursal injection of 40 mg of triamcinolone.\n\n      All patients will be tested at time 0 (morning before treatment) and at 1, 7, 15, 30 and 45\n      days after the injection, using clinical, laboratory and US parameters in order to compare\n      the efficacy and safety of the two drugs."
