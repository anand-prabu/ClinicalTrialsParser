  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to see whether PRO053 is safe and effective to use as medication
      for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) patients with a mutation around location 53 in the DNA
      for the dystrophin protein.

      A Phase I/II, open-label study. The study consists of two phases; a single dose escalation
      phase and a 48 week treatment phase. All subjects will have a screening period prior to
      their first dose of PRO053.

      Safety and Tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamic (PD) and efficacy
      assessments will be conducted at regular intervals throughout the study.

    <description>Following completion of the 2nd study period for Cohort 1, the safety data will be reviewed by the DSMB and in the absence of safety concerns the subjects may enter the 48 week treatment phase and receive 6 mg/kg PRO053 once weekly by SC injection. Three new subjects will enter cohort 1 (i.e. 6 subjects in total at this dose level).
Following completion of the 2nd study period for Cohort 2, the safety data will be reviewed by the DSMB and in the absence of safety concerns the subjects may enter the 48 week treatment phase and receive 9 mg/kg PRO053 once weekly by SC injection. Three new subjects will enter cohort 2 (i.e. 6 subjects in total at this dose level).
After the initial 12 subjects have completed 12 weeks of dosing the dose for the Treatment group (30 new subjects) will be selected based on the totality of the 12-week data from those initial 12 subjects. The initial 12 subjects will also be dosed on the selected dose (i.e. continue on their dose or [down-]titrate).</description>

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Duchenne muscular dystrophy resulting from a mutation correctable by treatment with
             PRO053 confirmed by a state-of-the-art DNA diagnostic technique covering all DMD gene
             exons, including but not limited to MLPA (Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe
             Amplification), CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridisation), SCAIP (Single Condition
             Amplification/Internal Primer) or HRMCA (High-Resolution Melting Curve Analysis).

          2. Ambulant boys aged at least 5 years on the day of first dosing able to walk for at
             least 230 metres in the 6 minute walking distance (6MWD) test. In addition, results
             of the 6MWD test must be within Â±30 metres of each other at 2 of 3 pre-treatment
             visits (screen 1, 2 and baseline) prior to first PRO053 administration.

          3. Adequate quality for biopsy (confirmed with MRI) of the lateral head of the
             gastrocnemius muscle. Only under exceptional circumstances will an alternative muscle
             (preferably brachii) be considered for biopsy and only following discussion between
             the Principal Investigator and the Prosensa Medical Monitor.

          4. Life expectancy of at least 3 years after inclusion in the study.

          5. Glucocorticosteroid use which is stable for at least 3 months prior to first PRO053
             administration. Subjects must have been receiving glucocorticosteroids for at least 6
             months prior to the first PRO053 administration.

          6. Willing and able to adhere to the study visit schedule and other protocol
             requirements.

          7. Written informed consent signed (by parent(s)/legal guardian and/or the subject,
             according to the local regulations).

          8. In France, a subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if either
             affiliated to, or a beneficiary of, a social security category.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known presence of â¥5% dystrophin in fibres of a pre-study diagnostic muscle biopsy
             (i.e. historic muscle biopsy taken prior to written informed consent for this study).

          2. Current or history of liver disease or impairment.

          3. Current or history of renal disease or impairment.

          4. At least two aPTT above upper limit of normal (ULN) within the last month prior to
             first dose of PRO053.

          5. Screening platelet count below the lower limit of normal (LLN).

          6. Acute illness within 4 weeks prior to first dose of PRO053 which may interfere with
             the study assessments.

          7. Severe mental retardation and/or behavioural problems which, in the opinion of the
             Investigator, prohibit participation in this study.

          8. Severe cardiomyopathy which, in the opinion of the Investigator prohibits
             participation in this study. If a subject has a left ventricular ejection fraction
             &lt;45% at screening, the Investigator should discuss inclusion of the subject with the
             Medical Monitor.

          9. Expected need for daytime mechanical ventilation within the next year.

         10. Use of anticoagulants, antithrombotics or antiplatelet agents.

         11. Use of idebenone or other forms of coenzyme Q10 within 1 month prior to the start of
             the screening for the study.

         12. Use of nutritional or herbal supplements which, in the opinion of the Investigator,
             may influence muscle performance within 1 month prior to first dose of PRO053.

         13. Use of any other investigational product or participation in another trial with an
             investigational product, within 6 months prior to the start of the screening for the
             study.
