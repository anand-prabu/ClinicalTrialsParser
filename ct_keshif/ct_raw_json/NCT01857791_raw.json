            "textblock": "Childhood obesity has more than tripled in the past 30 years. From 1980 to 2008, the\n      prevalence of obesity among adolescents aged 12 to 18 years, increased from 5.0% to 18.1%.1\n      Although several pediatric weight management programs are available, access to these\n      programs may not always be possible.\n\n      The proposed study will be an ongoing research program with approximately 40 children ages\n      12-18 years enrolled into the study over a year.  All study participants will participate in\n      a baseline evaluation which will include body composition measures, aerobic testing, as well\n      as nutrition and physical activity questionnaires. Study participants will be assigned to\n      the clinic-based group.  The clinic- based group will participate in a 12-week\n      multi-disciplinary weight management program.  All study participants will then participate\n      in a 12-week follow-up evaluation similar to the baseline visit. New participants will be\n      enrolled every 12 weeks. Every 12 weeks, active participants (those that have completed a\n      minimum of 12 weeks) will have the option to continue in the program or, discontinue their\n      active participation in the program and enroll into the maintenance phase which will consist\n      of measures only every 12 weeks.\n\n      The objective of the proposed study includes examining the efficacy of the clinic-based,\n      multi-disciplinary, pediatric weight management program."
