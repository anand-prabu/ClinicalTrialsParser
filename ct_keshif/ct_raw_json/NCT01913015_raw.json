To potentially guide decisions in the future to use low dose abiraterone in a fed state\n      and decrease overall cost.\n\n      II. To evaluate the potential relationship between esterase activity and abiraterone\n      metabolism in an exploratory analysis.\n\n      III. To determine the feasibility of using patient-collected dried blood spot (DBS) samples\n      for pharmacokinetic monitoring.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive standard dose abiraterone acetate orally (PO) once daily (QD) (held\n      on days 2, 3, 9, and 10), and low-dose abiraterone acetate PO QD on days 3 and 10. Patients\n      eat a low fat breakfast on day 3 and a high fat breakfast on day 10.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive abiraterone acetate as in Arm I.
