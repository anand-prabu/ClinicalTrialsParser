    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to learn different proteins that may appear on the &quot;injured&quot; end
      of the sciatic nerve and compare it to the other end of the cut nerve, which is &quot;uninjured&quot;.
      By comparing the &quot;normal&quot; versus &quot;traumatized&quot; ends of the cut sciatic nerve, the
      investigators hope to identify proteins that may be specifically related to pain. For
      instance, if the non-traumatized end of the nerve has none of Protein X but the traumatized
      end of the nerve has a lot of Protein X, then Protein X would be a protein that the
      investigators will want to study further and see if it plays any role in the sensation of
      pain.

      Other studies have shown that there are specific pain-related proteins and they may be
      increased or decreased after traumatic injury. If the investigators are able to identify
      specific proteins that are related to pain, then that may eventually lead to the development
      of medications that will block those proteins and decrease the sensation of pain.
