  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The National Mammography Database (NMD) leverages data that radiology practices are already
      collecting under federal mandate by providing them with comparative information for national
      and regional benchmarking. Participants receive semi-annual feedback reports that include
      important benchmark data such as cancer detection rates, positive predictive value rates and
      recall rates. Participation in the NMD is free to Breast Imaging Center of Excellence
      (BICOE) facilities.

    <description>This outcome measure is measured using one year of follow-up after a mammogram is performed on a woman, and is aggregated by interpreting physician. Because the NMD is a registry and screening mammograms are annual exams for most patients, this measure is calculated each year using one year of follow-up.</description>
