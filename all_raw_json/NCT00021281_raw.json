SU5416 may stop the growth of tumor cells by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor. It is not yet known whether combination chemotherapy will be more\n      effective with or without SU5416 in treating metastatic colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without SU5416 in treating patients who have metastatic colorectal cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare the survival of patients with previously untreated metastatic\n      colorectal cancer treated with fluorouracil, leucovorin calcium, and irinotecan with or\n      without SU5416. II. Compare the antitumor efficacy of these regimens in these patients. III.\n      Evaluate the additional measures of clinical benefit in patients treated with these\n      regimens. IV. Determine the relative safety profile of these regimens in these patients. V.\n      Assess quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to ECOG performance status (0 vs 1), baseline lactate dehydrogenase (normal vs\n      elevated), and treatment regimen. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms by 2\n      different regimens (Saltz vs de Gramont). Regimen I (Saltz): Arm IA: Patients receive SU5416\n      IV over 1 hour on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, 25, 29, 32, 36, and 39. Patients also\n      receive irinotecan IV over 30-90 minutes, leucovorin calcium IV over 5-10 minutes, and\n      fluorouracil IV over 5-10 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Arm IIA: Patients receive\n      irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm I. Treatment in both arms repeats\n      every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Regimen II (de\n      Gramont): Arm IB: Patients receive SU5416 as in arm IA. Patients also receive irinotecan IV\n      over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 15, and 29 and leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours and\n      fluorouracil IV over 2 hours on days 1, 2, 15, 16, 29, and 30. Arm IIB: Patients receive\n      irinotecan, leucovorin calcium, and fluorouracil as in arm IB. Treatment in both arms\n      repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at the beginning of each course, and then at the\n      end of treatment. Patients are followed at 1 month and then every 2 months for 4 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,270 patients (635 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study within 2 years."
