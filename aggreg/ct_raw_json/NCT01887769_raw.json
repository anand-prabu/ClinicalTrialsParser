            "textblock": "Rationale: With 1.6 million new cases diagnosed each year and 1.3 million deaths, lung\n      cancer is the leading cancer-related death worldwide and it represents a pressing health\n      issue. Patients with lung cancer are more likely to experience cachexia, a severe\n      debilitating disorder causing fatigue, weight loss, muscle wasting and associated with\n      reduced physical function, increased chemotherapy toxicity and reduced survival. This\n      syndrome occurring in about 80% of advanced cancer patients is the direct cause of death in\n      about 20% of cases. However, despite the importance of cachexia in lung cancer, it has been\n      mainly studied from several assessment methods which do not usually differentiate muscle\n      from other tissues.\n\n      Aim: To analyze body composition of patients with lung cancer at diagnosis using computed\n      tomography (CT-Scan) image analysis.\n\n      Methods: This is a retrospective study extending over a period of 3 years conducted at the\n      Institut universitaire de cardiologie et de pneumologie de Qu\u00e9bec (2009-2012).    We listed\n      patients newly diagnosed with lung cancer who had a thoraco-abdominal CT-scan performed in\n      our institution. Following the collection of clinical data from patient records, we used\n      SliceOmatic software to quantify muscle area, visceral fat area and subcutaneous fat area\n      from a single abdominal cross-sectional image at the level of the third lumbar vertebra."
