            "textblock": "In the 20 years since the Gulf War (1990-1991) began, there have been reports of Gulf War\n      veterans' illnesses (GWVI). These illnesses are characterized by persistent symptoms such as\n      chronic headache, chronic widespread pain, cognitive difficulties, unexplained debilitating\n      fatigue, gastrointestinal problems, respiratory symptoms, subtle neuropsychological\n      symptoms, and other abnormalities that are not explained by familiar medical or psychiatric\n      diagnoses. To date, the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), the Department of Defense\n      (DoD), and the Department of Health and Human Services have funded over 360 research\n      projects pertaining to the health consequences of military service in the 1990-1991 Gulf\n      War. This past research represents a tremendous investment into understanding the medical\n      conditions of these veterans. However, many important questions remain to be answered as to\n      why Gulf War veterans are ill and suffer adverse effects on their daily lives. In addition,\n      the Gulf War veteran population is entering the age range at which the incidence of chronic\n      diseases increases rapidly, and other questions regarding the health and medical care of\n      this important cohort will be raised in the next few years. For these reasons, we plan to\n      create a cohort of Gulf War era veterans and a biorepository to be made available for future\n      research studies.\n\n      The large-scale longitudinal research database will integrate epidemiological, survey,\n      clinical, and environmental exposure data of the Gulf War era cohort.  Blood specimens will\n      be used to establish the biorepository. Our goal is to enable the availability of blood\n      specimens and the research database for a wide range of future genomic and genetic studies,\n      biologic and immunologic research, and epidemiological, clinical, and health services\n      research. This pilot project represents the initial implementation of the cohort and\n      biorepository. During the pilot, the recruitment response rate and other operational and\n      logistical aspects will be assessed to provide support for the full-scale project.  In our\n      pilot project, we will contact 10,000 Veterans for enrollment. These will include those who\n      receive health care in the VA and those who receive their health care outside of the VA\n      system.\n\n      Veterans of the Gulf War era will be identified largely through existing VA and Department\n      of Defense registries and databases. A veteran will be eligible if s/he served in the\n      military in 1990-91 without regard to actual deployment.  Initially, the Gulf War Era\n      Research Database will be populated with data collected from the Gulf War Era Veterans'\n      Survey.  This survey is specific to those who served during the Gulf War Era. The survey\n      will be supplemented by data collected from national VA and non-VA resources and from other\n      studies of Gulf War era veterans.\n\n      The longitudinal cohort database and biorepository will be used to enhance ongoing research,\n      facilitate new research on GWVI, and study other chronic diseases that now or will affect\n      veterans of the Gulf War Era. This combined resource will provide valuable tools to examine\n      the prevalence and correlates of GWVI and other chronic diseases, and to target programs to\n      meet the health care needs of Gulf War era veterans.\n\n      Specific Aims - This is a minimal risk observational pilot project to test the processes\n      needed to establish a research cohort and biorepository of Gulf War era veterans to be used\n      for future research studies.  There are no research questions or hypotheses.  The pilot\n      project has two specific aims:\n\n        1. assess the feasibility and efficacy of the planned recruitment, consenting, and blood\n           drawing and shipping processes, and of modifications to the processes (if necessary);\n           and\n\n        2. develop, test, and implement the database structures required for subject enrollment\n           tracking, blood sample tracking, and data storage.\n\n      Importance -There has been substantial research into the health care needs of Gulf War era\n      veterans, but the incidence of chronic diseases that should be expected as this population\n      ages is uncertain. The etiology and treatment of Gulf War Veterans' illnesses, affecting\n      approximately one-fourth of those deployed to the Gulf War, remains unknown. Furthermore,\n      the relationships between exposures, genetic susceptibility, and these illnesses have not\n      been explored comprehensively in a large cohort. Data from the cohort described in this\n      protocol includes both survey and blood-based biomarkers, such as genetic markers,  which\n      will provide valuable resources for identifying risk factors and potential treatment\n      pathways for Gulf War related illnesses as well as other chronic and aging related diseases.\n      These data can then be used to identify the current and future health care needs of Gulf War\n      era veterans to more effectively target programs towards them.\n\n      The intended users of the Gulf War Era Research Database and blood specimens are researchers\n      who are specifically interested in illnesses affecting Gulf War era veterans, and\n      researchers interested in the physical and mental health concerns that affect a population\n      of this age group. The availability of a research cohort with the particular demographics\n      and the documented experiences of Gulf War era service will enable more detailed analyses\n      regarding diagnosis and treatment of conditions affecting an aging population than is\n      possible with administrative databases alone. With insights that analyses of data and blood\n      specimens will provide, the VA will be better able to focus interventions that will improve\n      diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes of care."
