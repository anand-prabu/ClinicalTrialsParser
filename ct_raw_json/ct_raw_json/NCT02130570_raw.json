Second, this study aims to look at how the intervention affects problems that are\n      known to occur after discharge, including medication issues, worsening medical problems, or\n      readmission to the hospital.  The investigators will study how well patients recover the\n      ability to do the things they could before they were admitted to the hospital and their\n      opinions of the discharge process.  Lastly, this study will look to understand the best way\n      to implement the intervention into different hospitals and practices, and which types of\n      patients benefit from it most."

To evaluate the effects of this intervention on post-discharge adverse events,\n           functional status, patient engagement, and emergency department and hospital\n           utilization within 30 days of discharge.\n\n           Hypothesis: compared with usual care, a collaborative transitions intervention will\n           decrease post discharge adverse events, improve post-discharge functional status,\n           increase patient engagement, and reduce emergency department and hospital utilization\n           in the post-discharge period.\n\n        3. To understand barriers to and facilitators of successful implementation of this\n           intervention across practices.\n\n      Hypothesis: several barriers to and facilitators of implementation can be identified and\n      used to create lessons learned for other health systems to successfully implement this type\n      of intervention."

(PCHI) primary care practices that has met\n        \"Primed\" criteria for being a PCMH, admits at least 2 patients to BWH or MGH, and has\n        agreed to participate. Primed criteria are a standard set of requirements that cover 6\n        essential building blocks of PCMH practices: electronic health record, patient portal,\n        team-based care, practice redesign, care management, and identification of high-risk\n        patients. We estimate that of the approximately 300 PCHI adult primary care practices, 150\n        of them will meet PCMH criteria during the study and that 50 of them will qualify and be\n        willing to participate in the study. We estimate that 12,000 such patients will be\n        admitted to BWH and MGH over the 18-month study period. These patients are broadly\n        representative of hospitalized patients and include several vulnerable populations,\n        including the elderly (33% 65 or older), patients with multiple chronic conditions (47%\n        with Elixhauser comorbidity score 5 or more), and racial and ethnic minorities (14%\n        African American, 13% Latino).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Likely discharge to a location other than home (or to a caregiver's home)\n\n          2. Police custody\n\n          3. No telephone or homeless\n\n          4.
