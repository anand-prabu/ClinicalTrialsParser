  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will obtain device-human interaction evaluations for the HWD1000 within the
      controlled environment of the hospital as well as establish that the safety profile is
      similar to outpatient wearable cardioverter-defibrillators use.

    <textblock>
      A multi-center prospective study of hospitalized patients whom a physician deems at risk of
      sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period, wearing the HWD1000 hospital
      wearable defibrillator in order to evaluate caregiver and patient interactions with the
      device. In addition, ECG signal quality will be reviewed to confirm the HWD1000 safety
      profile.

    <description>The amount of time that the HWD1000 is unable to effectively monitor the subject's rhythm status is the primary safety measure. The specific goals are that monitoring will be inhibited by noise no greater than 2% of the time worn and monitoring using single lead analysis will be no greater than 5% of the time worn.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        Patients whom a physician deems at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the
        hospitalization period (patients will be monitored using the hospital's telemetry system).
        Specific inclusion criteria are:

          -  Hospitalized patients having continuous independent ECG monitoring.

          -  Patients at risk of sudden cardiac arrest during the hospitalization period as
             determined by the investigating physician.

          -  Patient â‰¥18 years of age (over the legal age of providing consent).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with an active implantable cardioverter-defibrillator.

          -  Patients with an active unipolar pacemaker.

          -  Patients with physical or mental conditions preventing them from interacting with or
             wearing the device as determined by the investigating physician.

          -  Patients having an advanced directive prohibiting resuscitation.

          -  Patients having bandages or other clinical condition preventing the HWD use.

          -  Patients unable to consent.

          -  Patients having recently experienced an arrhythmic storm.

          -  Patients prone to paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia.
