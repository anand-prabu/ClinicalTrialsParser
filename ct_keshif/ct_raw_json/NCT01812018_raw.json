Docetaxel\n      (75 mg/m2) will be administered on Day 2 of each cycle. An individual cycle of therapy will\n      be defined as a 3-week (21-day) period. Cycles will be repeated every 3 weeks. Multiple\n      cycles may be administered until the subject is PD or until a maximum of 6 cycles.\n      Time-to-progression (TTP) will be assessed using the Kaplan Meier method. Overall response\n      rate (ORR) as well as individual categories of response (CR, PR, SD, and PD) will be\n      determined using RECIST (v1.1). Evaluation of 1- and 2-year overall survival will also be\n      performed. Safety measures will be recorded using the NCI-CTCAE (v4.0)."
