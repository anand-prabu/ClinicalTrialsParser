These patients, therefore,\n      are unlikely to benefit from further surgery that results in a longer period of\n      hospitalization, higher costs and higher postoperative morbidity. This result has been\n      written in the 2012 National Comprehensive Cancer Network Clinical Practice Guidelines.\n\n      However, Limitations of Z0011, such as failure to achieve target accrual and possible\n      randomization imbalance favoring the SLNB-alone group, must be considered. In the other\n      hand, further testing in different country are needed.\n\n      The investigators design and begin a prospective randomized multicenter phase III study of\n      ALND vs. no ALND in breast Cancer with positive SLN--the validation of Z0011 in China."

All the patients were to\n      receive whole-breast opposing tangential-field radiation therapy.
