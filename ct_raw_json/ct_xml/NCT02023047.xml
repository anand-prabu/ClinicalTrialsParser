      This is an open label study. The study will consist of 2 treatment group: coated Nifedipine
      suppository containing 12 mg of Nifedipine applied twice daily (group 1) and coated
      Nifedipine suppository containing 12 mg of Nifedipine applied once daily (group 2).
      Approximately 30 subjects will participate into this 8-week study. A screening visit will be
      used to determine subject suitability for inclusion in the trial. Within one week of the
      screening visit, subjects who meet all inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria
      will receive Coated Nifedipine 12 mg Suppository X2 a day (BID) (24 mg/day total) OR  Coated
      Nifedipine 12 mg Suppository X1 a day (OD) (12 mg/day total) for a period of 8 weeks.
      During this period, 4 study visits (at 0, 2, 5,  and 8 weeks) will take place. Study
      medication will be administered BID (in the morning and in the evening) or OD (only in the
      morning). In addition to receiving study medication, subjects will be maintained on a
      standard treatment for Anal Fissure: sitz baths, high fiber diet.
