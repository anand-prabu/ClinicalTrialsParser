Patients were stratified\n      according to age: 20-30, 31-40, 41-50, 51-60, 61-70, and 71-80 years. The spinal component\n      of the anesthetic was established by bolus administration of various up-and-down doses of\n      0.75% ropivacaine, determined by Dixon's method, with the first patient receiving 15 mg, and\n      with testing intervals of 1.5 mg according to failure or success of the preceding patient's\n      motor block. The degree of motor block after intrathecal administration of each dose was\n      evaluated by the modified Bromage and Hip motor function score. The primary outcome was\n      obtained by administration of the mean dosage that was determined from the midpoints of all\n      independent pairs of patients involving a crossover from failure to success during 5 minutes\n      after the spinal injection. The ED50 were estimated from the up-and-down sequences using the\n      method of Dixon and Massey and logistic regression. Other endpoints were included on the\n      basis of sensory block level, duration of motor blockade, hypotension, and vasopressor\n      requirements."
