Compare the effect of single dose filgrastim-SD/01 vs daily filgrastim\n      (G-CSF) on the duration of neutropenia in course 1 after combination chemotherapy in\n      patients with recurrent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Compare the effect of these regimens on\n      duration of neutropenia in courses 2-4, absolute neutrophil counts (ANC) in courses 1-4,\n      time to ANC recovery in courses 1-4, and safety in these patients. III. Determine the\n      pharmacokinetic profile of these drugs in course 1 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms. All patients receive etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-4, cisplatin\n      IV continuously on days 1-4, methylprednisolone IV over 15 minutes on days 1-5, and\n      cytarabine IV over 2 hours on day 5. Treatment is repeated every 21 days for up to 4\n      courses. Arm I: Patients receive filgrastim-SD/01 subcutaneously (SQ) on day 6. Arm II:\n      Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) SQ daily beginning on day 6 and continuing for 12 days\n      or until blood counts recover.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      at least 6 months."
