Reduction of elevated\n      plasma homocysteine may prevent up to 25% of cardiovascular events. One of modifiable cause\n      of hyperhomocysteinemia is prevention of vitamin deficiency, especially folate deficiency.\n\n      Obese Thai children are probable risk for folate deficiency due to low dietary folate intake\n      and low serum folate level from unbalanced diet (low vegetables intake & high fat diet) and\n      high prevalence of thalassemia. Moreover obese children are also at risk of atherosclerosis.\n      However, no data have been reported about effect of folic acid supplementation on\n      homocysteine level in these patients."
