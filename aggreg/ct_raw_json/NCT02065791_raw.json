During the pretreatment phase all participants will also receive\n      diet/exercise counseling for lipid and blood pressure management as well as counseling on\n      renal and cardiovascular (CV) risk factor medication. A post-treatment follow-up contact or\n      visit will take place approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the\n      completion of the study. The total duration of the study is estimated to be about 5.5 years.\n       Approximately 3,700 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or\n      matching placebo. Participants randomized to canagliflozin will receive a dose of 100 mg\n      once daily. The overall safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will be evaluated by\n      collecting information on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs (pulse, blood\n      pressure), physical examination, and body weight."
