  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized trial with patients, through one-on-one interviews, to evaluate
      their understanding of and willingness to use a decision support tool and to determine if
      receiving and discussing the decision support tool improves the likelihood that a patient is
      adherent to a new antihypertensive medication.

    <description>The proportion of patients in each group who picked up a prescription for an antihypertensive medication in any class during the follow-up period. We will calculate cumulative incidences among all patients, whether or not they successfully completed the interview or returned the paper-based survey (Intention to Treat) and among only those patients who did complete the interview or returned the paper-based survey (As Treated).</description>
