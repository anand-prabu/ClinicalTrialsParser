  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated trial is designed to measure the accuracy of diagnosis of
      Parkinson disease through the use of DaTscan. Currently, DaTscan is FDA approved to measure
      dopamine transporter densities in human tissue. This measurement can assist in
      distinguishing between Essential Tremor and Parkinsonian Syndromes (idiopathic Parkinson
      disease, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, Multi Systems Atrophy, etc). This study will
      compare both clinical diagnosis of symptoms and the results of the scan to the pathological
      diagnosis received at time of death. Patients will be registered in the Parkinson Research
      Institute's brain donation program, receive a clinical diagnosis of Parkinson disease, have
      their brain scanned using DaTscan, and donate their tissue for research and autopsy
      purposes. The hypothesis of the study is that DaTscan will diagnosis Idiopathic Parkinson
      Disease as accurately as a clinician.
