The treatment, delivered by a medical professional (i.e., nurse or physician), monitors medication side effects, provides strategies to increase medication adherence and supports abstinence through psychoeducation and referral to groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous. The visits allow for assessments of drinking, overall functioning, medication adherence, and side effects.  Also at one of these weekly visits, a blood sample will be taken for liver function tests (GGT, ALT, AST).  Samples will be further analyzed for two measures of heavy drinking: carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT) and phosphatidylethanol (PEth).",
