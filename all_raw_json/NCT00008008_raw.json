Giving chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell or bone\n      marrow transplant may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well thiotepa followed by peripheral stem cell\n      or bone marrow transplant works in treating patients with malignant glioma."

PBSCs are collected over 3-5 days. Patients who do not mobilize\n      sufficient cells undergo bone marrow harvest.\n\n      Patients receive high-dose thiotepa IV over 5 hours on day -2. PBSCs or bone marrow are\n      reinfused on day 0. Patients receive sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously daily beginning on\n      day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 2-3 weeks for a\n      total of 1-4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at every course, then monthly for 6 months, and\n      then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 6 months and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 5-40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
