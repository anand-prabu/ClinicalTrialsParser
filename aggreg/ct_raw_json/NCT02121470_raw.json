Renal expression of NGAL is\n      dramatically increased in kidney injury from a variety of causes, and NGAL is released into\n      both urine and plasma.  NGAL levels rise within two hours of the insult, making NGAL an\n      early and sensitive biomarker of kidney injury, with the potential to assist clinicians in\n      managing patients at risk of kidney injury.\n\n      This study is designed to validate the assigned NGAL cutoff value by comparing to clinical\n      diagnosis of AKI as determined by current clinical practice in the US.\n\n      The study sites will enroll consecutive ICU patients. Patients are given standard clinical\n      care and lab-work.  Each day, one additional urine and two additional plasma samples will be\n      drawn and frozen.

The clinical diagnosis will be assigned by a three-person\n      adjudication panel based on the entries in the eCRF by the investigators.

In the\n      future, biomarkers of renal cell injury may identify additional patients with AKI and may\n      identify the majority of patients at an earlier stage.\n\n      NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin, lipocalin-2, siderocalin) is such a\n      biomarker. It is a small protein expressed in neutrophils and certain epithelia, including\n      the renal tubules.  Renal expression of NGAL is dramatically increased in kidney injury from\n      a variety of causes, and NGAL is released into both urine and plasma.  NGAL levels rise\n      within two hours of the insult, making NGAL an early and sensitive biomarker of kidney\n      injury.\n\n      Due to the heterogeneous implementation of AKI definitions and classifications, a uniform\n      definition will be applied to this investigation, to ensure comparative results between the\n      enrollment sites.\n\n      The aim of the study is to validate the assigned NGAL cutoff value by comparing to clinical\n      diagnosis of AKI as determined by current clinical practice in the US.\n\n      The study sites will enroll consecutive patients meeting the criteria below in an ICU or\n      critical care setting.
