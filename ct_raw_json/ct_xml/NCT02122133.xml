      The primary objective of this study is to gather data on the radiation exposure in patients
      treated with the Penumbra Coil 400â„¢ System (PC 400) or conventional coils per their
      respective indications for use.This is a multicenter case review study of patients
      presenting with intracranial aneurysms who are treated with coil embolization therapy using
      the PC 400 or conventional coils.  Data for each patient are collected acutely.Up to 90
      patients treated with the PC 400 or conventional coils (2:1) at up to 15 centers in the USA
      will be enrolled.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients enrolled in the PC 400 arm must be those treated according to the cleared
             indication for the PC 400 System, which includes endovascular embolization of
             intracranial aneurysms.

          -  Patients treated with conventional coils should be treated per their IFU.

          -  Adjunctive use of stents, balloons or liquid embolics, if considered appropriate by
             investigators, is allowed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Pre-planned use of multiple coil systems and/or flow diverters.
