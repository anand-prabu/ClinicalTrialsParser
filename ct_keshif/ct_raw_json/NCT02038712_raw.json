Differences in the mechanisms regulating food\n      intake may go some way to reveal potential mechanisms for BED.The purpose of this study is\n      to investigate the responses of key gut-derived hormones that are associated with the\n      regulation of food intake and functional brain activity to food cues using fMRI in BED\n      patients and weight matched controls."
