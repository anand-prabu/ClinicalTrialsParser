Maintaining the Gains: muscle growth,\n      improvement of bone density and multi-sensory exercises.\n\n      First, a pilot study was conducted with untrained elderly (\"Effects of stochastic resonance\n      therapy on postural control in the elderly population\" (KEK Bern: No.228/09, Clinical Trial\n      Registry: NCT01045746). Following, a second pilot study was conducted with frail elderly\n      (Application of Whole-body Vibration With Stochastic Resonance in Frail Elderly: The Effects\n      on Postural Control Clinical Trial Registry: NCT01543243).\n\n      It was found that the selected chosen form of recruitment (presentation and advertisement)\n      and the measurements methods are suitable for untrained elderly. But for frail elderly the\n      chosen form of recruitment and the measurement methods are not sufficient.\n\n      For this study, adapted measurement parameters for balance, strength and cognition will be\n      used.\n\n      The goals of this study:\n\n      Evaluate the effects of\n\n        -  functional lower extremity\n\n        -  dynamic balance\n\n        -  reaction time\n\n        -  mobility\n\n        -  muscle strength and cognition.\n\n      This is a one-group pre-post design study and the participants will be recruited in Canton\n      Bern - Switzerland."
