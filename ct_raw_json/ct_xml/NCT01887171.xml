    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Tacrolimus added to
      histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate (HTK) solution given through intraportal and
      intraarterial infusion during back-table procedure is capable of reducing the degree of
      early allograft liver dysfunction, as assessed by postoperative levels of aspartate
      aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), during first 7 postoperative days
      and by serum and histochemical markers of liver injury and inflammation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early allograft liver dysfunction remains a significant complication of cadaveric liver
      transplantation with resource consuming and costly treatment, increased risk of multiorgan
      failure and 6-months mortality.

      Ischemic reperfusion injury (IRI) is a main reason for early allograft liver dysfunction.
      Inflammatory response to brain death in donor can precipitate the extent of dysfunction
      after reperfusion in recipient (1). Clear inflammatory pathways in response to IRI have been
      reported to be associated with early allograft liver dysfunction (2,3).  It was shown that
      ex vivo intraportal tacrolimus perfusion suppressed inflammation and immune response in the
      transplanted liver on a genome-wide basis (4).

      We hypothesize that Tacrolimus added to HTK solution given through intraportal and
      intraarterial back-table infusion is capable of reducing the degree of early allograft liver
      dysfunction, as assessed by incidence of postreperfusion  hyperfibrinolysis, postoperative
      levels of AST,ALT, during 1-7 postoperative days as well as serum and histochemical markers
      of liver injury and inflammation compared to no intraportal and intraarterial back-table
      infusion.

A wedge resection of small (5x5mm) part of liver segment-III will be sampled at 2 hours after venous reperfusion. Rate of necrosis, inflammation, vascular thrombosis, cluster of differentiation (CD) 68 and High mobility group box 1 protein (HMGB1) staining will be assessed thereafter.</description>

    <description>Protocol is restricted to liver transplants performed with classic technique with sequential portal-arterial reperfusion.
After unclamping portal vein but before unclamping the inferior vena cava and after venting of first 100 ml of blood a 5 ml sample of blood (code is &quot;HV&quot;) from a tube inserted into caval suture line will be taken. Another 5 ml sample of blood (code is &quot;C&quot;) will be taken by puncture of one of hepatic veins 20 min later. Samples (5 ml each) of peripheral blood will be taken on 1st and 3d postoperative day (POD).  P-selectin, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, tumor necrosis factor alfa (TNF-a) and macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1a)  will be determined in samples &quot;HV&quot; and &quot;C&quot;. Interleukin-8, elastase, TNF-a and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) will be determined in samples of 1st and 3d POD.</description>

LI30&lt;85% or ML&gt;15% or LI60&lt;85% or A10 in Extem is by 15% is less then A10 in Aptem.</description>
