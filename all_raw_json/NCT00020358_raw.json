Patients are stratified according to HLA type (A0201 vs\n      A1 vs A3 vs A24 vs A31). (HLA-A24 and HLA-A31 closed to accrual 11/05/01). Patients are\n      randomized to 1 of 3 treatment arms and are given an assigned vaccine, which is emulsified\n      in Montanide ISA-51.\n\n        -  HLA typing:\n\n             -  HLA-A2: gp100:209-217 (210M) and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D)\n\n             -  HLA-A1: tyrosinase:240-251 (244S)\n\n             -  HLA-A3: gp100:17-25\n\n             -  HLA-A24: tyrosinase:206-214 (closed to accrual 11/05/01)\n\n             -  HLA-A31: tyrosinase-related protein-1 (ORF3):1-9 (closed to accrual 11/05/01)\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive assigned vaccine subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 10 weeks\n           followed by 3 weeks of no treatment.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive assigned vaccine SC on days 1, 22, 43, and 64.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive assigned vaccine SC on days 1-4, 22-25, 43-46, and 64-67.\n\n      Treatment in all arms repeats every 13 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After the completion of the randomized arms of HLA-A2 patients, additional HLA-A2 patients\n      receive immunization with gp100:209-217 (210M) and tyrosinase:368-376 (370D) emulsified in\n      Montanide ISA-51 SC once every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n      Patients with progressive disease may receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8 hours\n      for up to 4 days. Treatment repeats every 10-14 days for at least 4 courses in the absence\n      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or mixed or\n      partial response to treatment may receive additional courses every 2 months.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 324 patients (19-33 per arm for the HLA-A0201 stratum, 13-16\n      per arm for the other 4 strata, and 33 per the additional HLA-A2 cohort) will be accrued for\n      this study within 2 years. (HLA-A24 and HLA-A31 closed to accrual 11/05/01)."
