The training composition is very relevant clinically but the underlying factors\n      have not been studied yet. Until now, no research shows the possible relation between the\n      body composition such as the mutual length and width of femur and tibia and the development\n      of overuse injuries.\n\n      Therefore, the aim of this study is to achieve evidence-based knowledge about these factors\n      in order to advice runners about the precautions and to avoid that people get a sedentary\n      lifestyle."
