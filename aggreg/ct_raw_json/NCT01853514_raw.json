            "textblock": "This is a cross-sectional study that will evaluate consumer behavior related to the\n      purchasing of fresh produce in the low-income population through a self-report survey\n      questionnaire.\n\n      A sample size of 500 subjects is planned. A screening questionnaire will be provided to each\n      subject to determine their eligibility to be in the study. The screening questionnaire\n      consists of 6 questions related to household income level, grocery shopping frequency,\n      employment field, and age. For subjects who are determined to be eligible, they will be\n      asked to complete the study survey questionnaire.\n\n      The survey questionnaire consists of 53 questions to assess subject's beliefs and knowledge\n      about organic and conventional fresh fruits and vegetables and how their beliefs and\n      knowledge affect their purchasing behavior related to organic and conventional fresh\n      produce. There are five major categories in the survey to assess different dimensions that\n      influence subjects' purchasing decisions regarding fresh produce. The categories are issue\n      awareness, purchasing behavior, message framing, credibility, and demographics. Issue\n      awareness is used to assess the subjects' previous knowledge, beliefs and attitude towards\n      organic and conventional fresh produce. Purchasing behavior is used to understand why\n      subjects purchase organic or conventional fresh produce. Message framing is used to\n      determine whether message framing has an impact on the self-reported likelihood to purchase\n      organic or conventional fresh produce. Credibility is used to find which source subjects\n      trust the most regarding fresh produce information.  Lastly, demographic information will be\n      obtained to analyze characteristic differences."
