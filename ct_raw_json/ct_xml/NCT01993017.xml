  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine, in a randomized controlled trial, the benefits and
      costs of the American Heart Association's (AHA) advisory for depression screen and treatment
      of post-acute coronary syndrome patients.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) and comorbid depression have a 2-fold higher
      risk for recurrent ACS and mortality, worse quality of life, and higher costs of care than
      nondepressed ACS patients. The strength of these observational findings prompted the
      American Heart Association (AHA) to advise that routine depression screening for ACS
      patients and referral for depression diagnosis and treatment as indicated occur.
      Unfortunately, there are no randomized controlled trials (RCT) to inform this potentially
      expensive screening recommendation. Additionally, screening guidelines/advisories in the
      absence of RCT evidence have recently been extensively criticized (and withdrawn). This
      poses a serious dilemma for clinicians, health care systems, and for health care policy
      leaders. A RCT is urgently needed to provide evidence for these different constituents about
      the costs and benefits of the AHA depression screen and treat algorithm.

      Two critical gaps in knowledge must be filled to determine if public health would be
      improved by the AHA strategy for depression screening in post-ACS patients: 1) Does this
      strategy improve quality-adjusted life years for patients with a recent ACS? 2) Is the cost
      of providing depression screening and any type of depression treatment within the acceptable
      and typical amounts reimbursed for health care services? Our specific aim is to determine
      the quality-adjusted life year benefits and health care costs of following the AHA's
      advisory for depression screening and then referral for further diagnosis and treatment in
      post-ACS patients, if depression is found. To accomplish this aim, we will randomize
      patients from three different, geographically diverse health maintenance organizations to
      three different groups: 1) to the AHA depression screen and treat if depression is found
      algorithm (intervention group) or: 2) to receive no depression screening (strong control
      group) or: 3) to be screened and a primary care provider notified (minimally enhanced
      control group). Health-related quality of life, depressive symptoms, and costs will be
      obtained from all patients, so that the benefits and the costs of these three different
      depression screening strategies can be compared.

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will complete the Depressive symptom screener (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) after randomization. Those with clinically significant score (&gt;=10) will meet with a study care specialist to discuss treatment options. Treatment will be delivered according to participant  preference, and will be  &quot;stepped algorithm&quot;. Stepped care includes, a) participant preference for either brief, cognitive behavior therapy (CBT), delivered centrally, or antidepressant medication managed at the local site, or both, or neither, and b) review of progress at approximately 2-month intervals, with &quot;stepping up&quot; of care if sufficient progress is not being realized.</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to this arm will complete the depressive symptom screener (8-item Patient Health Questionnaire, PHQ-8) after randomization. Those with clinically significant score (&gt;=10) will have a letter sent to their primary care provider about their positive screen  for depressive symptoms. Depending upon the provider's own evaluation of the participant, the participant may defer depression treatment, initiate treatment or may be referred  to a mental health specialist.</description>

    <description>The main intervention is the impact of screening on quality of life and health care costs. CBT is provided only if depressive symptoms are detected and participant prefers this type of treatment.
CBT will be centrally administered by a trained CBT treatment specialist. The treatment specialist will work with local team members throughout a participant's involvement in the study, and will closely follow each participant until he or she has reached a requisite level of improvement .</description>

    <description>The main intervention is the impact of screening on quality of life and health care costs. Antidepressant Medication is provided only if depressive symptoms are detected and patient prefers this type of treatment.
Antidepressants should be started at the lowest dose, but should be adjusted upward to be within the therapeutic range within 1 week, with further adjustment higher in the therapeutic range possible at 3-4 weeks. Dosage of the first medication selected will be in the therapeutic range by 3 weeks of the initial step, as tolerated.</description>
