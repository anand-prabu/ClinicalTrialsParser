Eligible women will be recruited from the\n      Comprehensive Health Centre Center of Excellence (CHC) in Kingston, Jamaica and from the\n      community.  Women who give written consent for study participation will be enrolled in the\n      study and randomized to one of the two study groups: 1) \"immediate implant\" insertion or 2)\n      \"delayed implant\" insertion (i.e., when their study participation ends after three months of\n      follow up). All participants will receive safer sex counseling, will be supplied with\n      condoms, and will be administered a baseline questionnaire on demographics, reproductive\n      history and contraceptive and sexual practices.  A study clinician will perform a pelvic\n      examination during which a double-headed vaginal swab will be collected to be tested for\n      prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which is a semen biomarker.  Participants will be asked to\n      return for follow-up visits scheduled at 1 and 3 months after enrollment, at which times\n      they will have another double-headed vaginal swab collected during a pelvic examination for\n      testing for PSA and will be administered follow-up questionnaires.  Participants in the\n      \"delayed implant\" group will have the Sino-implant (II) inserted at the 3-month visit if\n      they still want the device.\n\n      Primary objective: To determine whether the frequency of PSA detection during three months\n      of follow up is higher in the immediate implant group than in the delayed implant group."
