            "textblock": "Pre-agricultural societies almost universally used healing ceremonies that involved\n      reverence, rhythm and dance in the presence of a healer.  It is believed that we are \"wired\"\n      for such experiences and they foster an integrative mode of consciousness similar to that of\n      mindfulness based stress reduction, which has been shown to have therapeutic effects in a\n      variety of conditions.  Collaborator Ava Lavonne Vinesett of the Duke Dance Program has\n      developed a healing ceremony based in sub-Saharan African traditions. The investigators plan\n      is to have 25 subjects with a variety of clinical conditions participate in this ceremony.\n      Subjects will then be asked to write a commentary about their experience and to participate\n      in a focus group discussion.  It is anticipated that the study will give us some idea of how\n      promising this approach would be and what kinds of patients might benefit.  Safety issues\n      are minimal and include the possibility of injury (though the dancing is not strenuous) and\n      psychological distress."
