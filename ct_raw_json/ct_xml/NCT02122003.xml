      -  Retrospective studies  showed Sorafenib's efficacy as second line treatment after a
           Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI).

        -  Currently there is no standard of treatment in 2nd line for patients treated in first
           line with pazopanib for metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC).

        -  With this trial we evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib as second line of treatment in
           patients treated with pazopanib for mRCC.

      -  Retrospective studies  showed Sorafenib's efficacy as second line treatment after a
           TKI: AXIS study  showed sorafenib activity, in terms of  Overall Response Rate (ORR),
           and the absence statistically significant difference in Overall Survival (OS) between
           the 2 arms, although there is a significant OS increase of 1.4 months in the Axitinib
           arm. The INTORSECT study (temsirolimus vs sorafenib in 2nd line after sunitinib) didn't
           demonstrate statistically significant difference for Progression Free Survival (PFS),
           but it showed an OS increase in patients treated with sorafenib.

        -  The COMPARZ study demonstrated the non-inferiority of pazopanib vs sunitinib in 1st
           line of treatment for mRCC.

        -  Currently there is no standard of treatment in 2nd line for patients treated in first
           line with pazopanib for mRCC.

        -  Primary objective:to evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib (PFS) as second line of
           treatment in patients treated with pazopanib for mRCC.

        -  Secondary objectives: To evaluate the safety of sorafenib in patients previously
           treated with pazopanib. To evaluate the Overall Survival. To evaluate the Quality of
           Life through specific questionnaires (FKSI-19; European Organization for Research and
           Treatment of Cancer quality of life questionnaire -C30).To assess the predictive role
           for PFS and OS of arterial blood pressure increase from baseline to week 4 and 8 after
           start of treatment with sorafenib. To assess the predictive role for PFS and OS of
           hand-foot syndrome before week 4 and 8 after start of treatment with sorafenib.
