ToleroMune Grass is a novel, synthetic, allergen-derived peptide desensitising\n      vaccine, currently being developed for the treatment of grass allergy.\n\n      The purpose of this optional observational follow-on study is to further evaluate\n      rhinoconjunctivitis symptoms on exposure to Grass in the EEU among subjects who completed\n      all dosing visits in study TG002 approximately one year after the start of treatment."
