Subjects will also be\n      asked for some basic personal information such as their age, race, gender, employment and\n      marital status. Investigators will review the electronic medical record for information\n      about subjects' health conditions and the triage severity score assigned by the ER nurse.\n\n      Subjects who decide to participate in the study will also be randomly assigned, much like\n      the flip of a coin to receive either a new way of educating patients (the Care Transition\n      Intervention) or usual care.\n\n      This means if subject receives the new way of educating, a patient advocate will visit the\n      subject at home one or two days after the ER visit. The patient advocate will talk with the\n      subject about following up with a regular, personal doctor and symptoms to look out for. The\n      patient advocate will help the subject understand their medicines and help the subject make\n      a personal health record. The patient advocate will also tell the subject about the Area\n      Agency on Aging, also called Elder Options. If the subject receives usual care, the subject\n      will not receive a visit from the patient advocate or hear about the Area Agency on Aging\n      but will be given discharge instructions from the ER nurse and doctor.\n\n      If the subject receives the new way of educating (the Care Transition Intervention), the\n      patient advocate will call the subject at least 3 times after the ER visit. The patient\n      advocate will talk with the subject about the same items listed above. If the subject\n      receives usual care, the patient advocate will not call. The subject has a 1 in 2 chance of\n      receiving the new way of educating and a 1 in 2 chance of receiving usual care.\n\n      All subjects will be asked to complete a phone survey with 60 days of their ER visit. This\n      survey will ask the subject about their health, satisfaction with healthcare and quality of\n      life.  All subjects will be asked to give informed consent for the study investigators to\n      record Medicare Claims to determine how many ER visits, hospital admissions and doctor\n      office visits the subject had in the 60 days after the study ER visit.\n\n      Some subjects will also be asked if they are willing to give a separate interview. During\n      this interview, the investigators will ask about what happened when the subject was in the\n      ER. The investigators will also ask about how things went after the ER visit. If the subject\n      was in the group with the new way of educating, the investigators will ask about this as\n      well. This interview will be audio-recorded."
