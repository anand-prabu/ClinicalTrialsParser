As nasal colonization is the principal\n      ecological niche for these bacteria and has been shown to be a significant risk factor in\n      developing S. aureus infection, it is of importance to develop an efficient therapy that is\n      able to clear this bacterium from human nostrils.\n\n      In-vivo studies have shown that P128 treatment is efficacious in reducing and decolonizing\n      MRSA bacteria from rat nostrils.\n\n      Pre-clinical safety studies in animal models indicated no test drug related toxicity signs\n      at the site of application or systemically.\n\n      The present clinical trial is conducted in three parts. Part A consists of safety and\n      tolerability studies in 4 cohorts of 3 healthy subjects who are administered a single dose\n      of three escalating concentrations of the drug and placebo intra-nasally. Part B consists of\n      safety & tolerability as in part A but with multiple doses (3 doses/day for 5 days). Part C\n      comprises of safety/tolerability as well as efficacy studies in chronic kidney disease\n      patients stable on dialysis who are nasal carriers of S.aureus or MRSA on a treatment\n      regimen as in Part B."
