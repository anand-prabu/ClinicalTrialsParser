The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for 8 weeks and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 8-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
