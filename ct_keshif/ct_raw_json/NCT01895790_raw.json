            "textblock": "Although most people with pancreatic cancer (80-85%) suffer distressing pain, it is poorly\n      controlled. Currently, medical management has been focused on frequent use of opioid\n      painkillers (narcotics) which are associated with several complications. Pain in pancreatic\n      cancer is mainly caused by tumor invasion to nerves near pancreatic gland, but in certain\n      patients with pancreatic cancer, pain is believed to be obstructive in nature and is due to\n      outflow obstruction of main pancreatic duct (PD) which extracts pancreatic secretions. This\n      kind of pain is specifically marked by pain occurring after eating. With this respect,\n      decompression of pancreatic duct has been associated with pain relief in people with chronic\n      inflammation of pancreas due to obstruction of its main duct (chronic pancreatitis).\n      Therefore; we think that it might be beneficial in the management of obstructive pain in\n      people with pancreatic cancer.\n\n      Endoscopic stenting of pancreatic duct is a way for decompression and appears to be\n      effective and safe palliative (pain relief) treatment for pain management in patients with\n      chronic pancreatitis. Besides safety, pancreatic stenting seems to be associated with a\n      significant decrease in amount of required opioids and analgesic drugs (and their side\n      effects) for pain management, and may improve patients` quality of life. There are only a\n      few old reports about beneficial effects of endoscopic pancreatic duct decompression for\n      relief of obstructive pain in pancreatic cancer. Currently, we have improved stents. Since\n      prior clinical practice has shown that pain improves, we plan to place stents with the\n      expectation that pain will improve. We hope that it will decrease need for recurrent\n      hospitalizations for pain control and decrease in need for medications (narcotics) and\n      medication side effects, and also will improve the quality of life. Specific instruments\n      will be applied as research tools to monitor pain score and quality of life before and after\n      pancreatic duct stenting in this study."
