  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of 40 or 80 mg
      atomoxetine as a treatment for cocaine dependence. The Phase I studies summarized above
      support the safety of atomoxetine in combination with stimulants. As the next step, the
      investigators will evaluate the safety and tolerability of atomoxetine in a small clinical
      trial with cocaine users. If atomoxetine is found to be promising in this study and
      sufficiently powered, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies will be proposed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an approximately 13 to 14 week double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial
      testing the safety and feasibility of atomoxetine (40 or 80 mg/day) treatment, compared to
      placebo, in methadone-stabilized stimulant users. The study will have 3 phases: 1) a oneto
      two week- methadone-induction phase; 2) an 8-week &quot;treatment&quot; phase; and 3) 1 week
      atomoxetine taper and  about a 4-week methadone &quot;taper and detoxification or transfer&quot;
      phase. Subjects will be randomized to three treatment arms: 40 mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or 80
      mg (n=15) atomoxetine, or placebo (n=15). During the methadone induction phase, subjects
      will be stabilized on methadone. During induction onto methadone, participants will be
      administered increasing doses of methadone starting at 30 mg daily, and this dose will be
      increased for stabilization of opiate withdrawal symptoms from 40 mg up to 140  mg depending
      on individual need. Based on the clinic schedule between 1 to 2 weeks after methadone
      treatment is initiated , atomoxetine treatment will be started at 40 mg/day. For those
      assigned to 80 mg of atomoxetine, the dose will be titrated up to 80 mg/day on the second
      week of treatment phase. At the end of the treatment-phase, subjects will undergo
      detoxification from methadone over a 4-week period based on an individual's needs, and they
      will concurrently be tapered off atomoxetine. All participants will receive a weekly
      one-hour of individual psychotherapy (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) with experienced
      clinicians specifically trained to deliver the therapy, and who will receive ongoing
      supervision.
