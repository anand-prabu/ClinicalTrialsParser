      A prospective open-label, multi-center study evaluating safety and tolerability of Creon
      Micro in pediatric subjects from at least one month to less than four years of age with
      Pancreatic Exocrine Insufficiency (PEI) due to Cystic Fibrosis (CF).  Referring to the
      European Medicines Agency (EMEA) pediatric age criteria for the purpose of the study,
      subjects are categorized as infants and toddlers (&lt; 2 years) and children, (2 years to &lt; 4
      years). In total, 40 subjects will be enrolled (20 subjects in each age subgroup).  Subjects
      receive their prescribed pancreatic enzyme supplementation at the individual dose until
      start of treatment with Creon Micro, if the subjects were on pancreatic enzyme
      supplementation before start of the study. Subjects will be treated with Creon Micro during
      the study. The treatment duration is 3 months.
