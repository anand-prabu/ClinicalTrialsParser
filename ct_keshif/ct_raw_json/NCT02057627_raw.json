An integrated approach addressing both problems simultaneously may improve\n      outcomes. Perinatal Dyadic Psychotherapy (PDP) was developed to prevent/decrease postpartum\n      depression and facilitate optimal mother-infant relationships. The purpose of this pilot\n      study is to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of PDP.\n      Depressed first-time mothers (meeting diagnostic criteria for depression and/or with high\n      depression symptom levels) and their 6-week-old infants will be randomized to receive either\n      the PDP intervention or a control condition. The PDP intervention consists of 8 home-based,\n      nurse-delivered mother-infant sessions consisting of (a) a supportive, relationship-based,\n      mother-infant psychotherapeutic component, and (b) a developmentally based infant-oriented\n      component focused on promoting positive mother-infant interactions. Control mothers will\n      receive usual care plus depression monitoring by phone. Data will be collected at baseline,\n      post-intervention, and 3 month follow-up. Assessments included maternal depression\n      (diagnosis and severity), maternal anxiety (diagnosis and severity), parenting stress, and\n      mother-infant interaction."
