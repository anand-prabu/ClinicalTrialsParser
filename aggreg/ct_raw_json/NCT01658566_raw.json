To confirm the wild type status of p53 and analyze the functional status of p53 pathway\n      by monitoring expression of selected p53-target genes in tumors in patients who have or have\n      not been treated with tamoxifen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I: Patients receive standard of care surgical therapy. Patients may undergo standard\n      surgery.\n\n      Arm II: Patients receive tamoxifen citrate orally (PO) daily for 4 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
