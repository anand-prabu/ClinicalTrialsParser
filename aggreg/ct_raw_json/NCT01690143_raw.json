            "textblock": "This study is for patients that have multiple myeloma that has come back or relapsed and\n      their condition indicates a procedure called an Autologous Hematopoietic Stem Cell\n      Transplantation (AHSCT). AHSCT is a procedure when stem cells from bone marrow or blood are\n      removed before high-dose chemotherapy. Afterwards, the removed stem cells are put back into\n      the patient's body to form a new population of blood cells.\n\n      The high-dose chemotherapy administered before the AHSCT is called \"Conditioning Therapy.\"\n      The FDA has approved the use of the drug melphalan as a conditioning therapy. This research\n      study will look at whether adding the study drug called carfilzomib will improve participant\n      outcomes. Carfilzomib is considered investigational and is not approved by the FDA for the\n      treatment of relapsed multiple myeloma.\n\n      This study is divided into two phases.\n\n      Phase I: Dose Escalation Phase:\n\n      The main purpose of Part I of this study is to examine the safety of the study drug,\n      carfilzomib, and determine the safest amount of the study drug that can be given to subjects\n      who have multiple myeloma. Subjects on this study will receive different dose levels of the\n      study drug. If you are one of the first three subjects to receive the study drug, it will be\n      at what is called the 'starting dose' for the study which is the lowest dose that is\n      expected to be tolerated based on prior research. After the first set of participants\n      receive the study drug, the study doctor will review their health to see how they are\n      tolerating the treatment. This will decide if the study drug dosage will be increased or\n      decreased for the next set of subjects who join the study.  It is anticipated that 12- 18\n      participants will enroll in the Phase I portion of this study.\n\n      Phase II: Safety Confirmation Phase:\n\n      Once the study doctor has discovered the highest possible dose of study drug that subjects\n      can tolerate, up to 28 more subjects may be enrolled at that dose level. The main purpose of\n      the Phase II portion of the study is look at how effective the combination of carfilzomib\n      and melphalan when given before your stem cell transplantation is in treating multiple\n      myeloma."

            "textblock": "This is a phase 1/2a trial. Since this is an AHSCT conditioning regimen trial, only one\n      cycle of therapy will be administered for each subject.\n\n      PHASE 1 The phase 1 component has a typical 3+3 design.\n\n        -  Initially up to three subjects will be enrolled in each cohort starting at cohort 0 in\n           the table below.\n\n        -  If no dose limiting toxicity (DLT) is noted among the 3 initial subjects, 3 additional\n           patients will be accrued at the subsequent cohort.\n\n        -  If 1/3 subjects experience DLT, 3 additional subjects will be accrued at the cohort. If\n           no additional DLT occur, accrual will continue at the subsequent cohort.\n\n        -  If 2 or more subjects experience DLT in a given cohort, the dose will be considered\n           higher than the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the immediately lower dose will be\n           considered the MTD.\n\n        -  If accrual is completed in cohort 4 with 0/3 or 1/6 DLT, the MTD will be considered\n           \"not reached\" and cohort 4 will be expanded in the phase 2 of the trial.\n\n        -  If 2 subjects experience DLTs in cohort 0, patients will be accrued in cohort -1, one\n           subject at a time, with the subsequent subject only being accrued once the current\n           subject has completed the DLT period (transplant day 30). The doses in cohort -1 will\n           be considered the MTD if 0/3 or 1/6 subjects experience DLT.\n\n        -  If \u2265 2 subjects experience DLT in cohort -1 the study will be interrupted without\n           proceeding to phase 2a and the combination of carfilzomib and high dose melphalan will\n           be considered too toxic.\n\n      PHASE 2 Once the MTD for the combination of carfilzomib and high dose melphalan with AHSCT\n      is found, there will be expansion of the MTD cohort so that 28 individuals will be treated\n      at the MTD of carfilzomib and high dose melphalan.\n\n      Screening - Subjects likely to meet eligibility criteria will be offered participation in\n      the study after the investigator verifies with the registration system that there is a\n      current available slot (phase 1).  Subjects will sign informed consent prior to any protocol\n      associated procedure. Screening procedures are outlined in Table 3 and will 1) ensure that\n      subject meets all the eligibility criteria, 2) obtain disease assessment to allow efficacy\n      measurements, 3) assess baseline toxicity and 4) provide initial biological samples for\n      pharmacodynamic and correlative studies.\n\n      Treatment- Subjects will receive the appropriate dose of carfilzomib (according to assigned\n      cohort in phase 1 and at the determined MTD in phase 2) on days -3 and -2. Carfilzomib will\n      be infused over 30 minutes. On day -2, with 60 to 120 minutes of the end of infusion of\n      carfilzomib, subjects will receive 200 mg/m2 of intravenous melphalan as an intravenous push\n      or a fast infusion, according to institutional standard operating procedure (SOP).\n      Prophylaxis of chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting will follow institutional guidelines\n      and SOPs.\n\n      Infusion of autologous cells- Infusion of autologous hematopoietic stem cells will occur on\n      day 0 and follow institutional SOP.\n\n      Follow up phase - On day 1 following HSCT patients will receive pegfilgrastim 6 mg\n      subcutaneously as per institutional standard of care aiming at faster engraftment. The\n      follow up phase will last 100 days and will consist of standard post transplantation\n      supportive care and monitoring of AEs. For the phase 1 component of the study, dose-limiting\n      toxicities will be captured during the first 30 days after transplantation (DLT period).\n\n      Disease assessment- Disease assessment will occur at day 100 (+/- 7 days) and will consist\n      of serum protein electrophoresis, serum and urine immunofixation, 24h urine protein\n      electrophoresis, serum free light chains, bone marrow aspiration and biopsy, complete blood\n      counts and metabolic panel."
