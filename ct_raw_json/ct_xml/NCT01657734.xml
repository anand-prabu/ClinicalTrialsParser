  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant gliomas are aggressive tumours with poor prognosis despite the current multimodal
      treatment. Hence, there is a clear need for new, effective therapies, among which immune
      therapy has emerged as a promising treatment option.

      When interpreting follow-up magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, the radiologist is often
      confronted with images that are difficult to interpret with the conventional anatomical
      imaging techniques. The difference between tumour relapse and therapy-mediated changes is
      not always distinctive.

      In this project, the investigators attempt to characterize the inflammatory response  with
      parameters from advanced MRI techniques like MR spectroscopy, MR perfusion imaging and
      MR-diffusion imaging. These techniques allow characterization of cellular properties like
      metabolism and tissue structure respectively. Doing so, the investigators will monitor
      disease evolution in order to timely detect treatment failure, thereby allowing appropriate
      switch in patient management.

        Patients, older than 3 and younger than 60 years with relapse of high-grade glioma
        (anaplastic astrocytoma WHO grade III or glioblastoma multiforme WHO grade IV),
        histologically diagnosed in the first stage of the disease as well as after relapse or
        relapse of glioma which was grade II in the First phase but grade III or IV upon relapse
        are treated with dendritic cell therapy (immunotherapy) as single treatment approach (No
        radiotherapy and/or chemotherapy).

          -  prospective double blind placebo controlled randomised clinical trial HGG-2010 for
             patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma in which immunotherapy is integrated in
             the current standard of care (concommitant radiochemotherapy).
