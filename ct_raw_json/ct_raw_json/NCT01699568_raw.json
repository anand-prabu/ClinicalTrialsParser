The research sites will be randomized into two groups: the control group patient's\n      sites receive implant surface treated by dual acid (AR Torque Porous, Connection Implant\n      Systems, Aruja, Brazil) and in the test group implants with anodized surface (AR Torque\n      Vulcano-Actives, Connection Implant Systems, Aruja, Brazil). The evaluation of the stability\n      of the implants will be made over 16 weeks, through resonance frequency analysis  with\n      Osstell (Integration Diagnostics AB, Gothenburg, Sweden). Data will be analyzed using\n      descriptive statistics and comparative."
