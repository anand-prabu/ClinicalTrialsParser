All anxiety\n             disorders, impulse-control disorders such as intermittent explosive disorder, as well\n             as non-suicidal self-injury are not excluded diagnoses as far as they are not\n             considered as principal diagnosis.\n\n          -  The patient has a current Axis II (DSM-IV-TR\u2122) diagnosis of antisocial, borderline,\n             paranoid, schizoid, schizotypical, or histrionic personality disorder.\n\n          -  The patient has experienced/experiences hallucinations, delusions, or any psychotic\n             symptomatology in the current MDE.\n\n          -  The patient, in the opinion of the investigator or based on C-SSRS rating, is at\n             significant risk of suicide.\n\n          -  The patient has started formal cognitive or behavioural therapy or systematic\n             psychotherapy within 6 weeks prior to screening, or plans to start such therapy\n             during the study. Any ongoing formal psychotherapy initiated more than 6 weeks prior\n             to screening should be continued with the same methodology and at the same frequency\n             and intensity during the entire study.\n\n          -  The patient has a current diagnosis or history of substance abuse or dependence\n             (excluding nicotine or caffeine) or alcohol abuse or dependence (DSM-IV-TR\u2122 criteria)\n             <6 months prior to the Screening Visit.\n\n          -  The patient reports adjunctive treatment with an antipsychotic medication together\n             with an antidepressant for 3 weeks or more during the current MDE.\n\n          -  The patient has received electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) <6 months prior to the\n             Screening Visit or at any time during the current MDE (if its duration is longer than\n             6 months).\n\n          -  The patient has had vagus nerve stimulation or a deep brain stimulation device\n             implanted for the management of depression.\n\n        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply."
