            "textblock": "BACKGROUND: The skills of patients on oral anticoagulants are critical for achieving good\n      outcomes with this treatment. Self-management, or the capacity of patients to control their\n      INR (International Normalized Ratio)level and adjust their treatment, is an effective\n      strategy of treatment. Capacity of patients to self manage is determined by a range of\n      factors. The identification of these factors would improve the design of self management\n      programmes and in turn increase the number of patients able to self-manage. The objective of\n      our study is to identify those factors that determine the ability of patients on oral\n      anticoagulant therapy to achieve self-management of their treatment.\n\n      METHOD: This will be a three year quasi- experimental prospective study with a control\n      group. 333 patients on anticoagulant therapy from five health centres of the Basque Health\n      Service are to be followed up for a period of six months each after the intervention, to\n      assess their ability to self-test and self-manage. The intervention will consist of a\n      patient training programme involving the provision of information and practical training\n      concerning their condition and its treatment, as well as how to use a portable blood\n      coagulation monitoring device and adjust their anticoagulant dose.\n\n      DISCUSSION: Training programmes for self-management are effective in terms of enabling\n      patients to acquire the necessary skills, though the level of success seems to depend on\n      various patient-related factors. Given the proven benefits of self-management, it would be\n      useful to properly characterise these factors and use this information to successfully\n      increase the percentage of patients on on oral anticoagulants able to self-manage their own\n      treatment."
