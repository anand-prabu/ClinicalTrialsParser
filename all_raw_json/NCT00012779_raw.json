            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      This study was designed to assess the effectiveness of a Health Education Program (HEP) for\n      improving the well-being and reducing the health care use and cost of care of frail older\n      outpatient veterans, and for improving the well-being of their spouse caregivers. HEP is a\n      multi-component group program delivered in 8 weekly, 2-hour sessions, and 10 monthly 2-hour\n      follow-up sessions, it includes emotion-focused and problem focused coping strategies,\n      education and support.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The objectives of this study are to evaluate: 1) effects of HEP on the perceived health\n      status, emotional well-being, and social support of frail veterans; 2) effects of HEP on the\n      perceived health, emotional well-being, social support, burden levels, self-appraisal of\n      change, pressing problems associated with caregiving, knowledge and use of community\n      resources by caregiver; and 3) effects of HEP on the health care use and costs of care\n      recipients.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      HEP was evaluated using a randomized control group design. The design has two levels of\n      intervention, HEP vs. Usual Care (UC), 3 VA medical centers (VAMCs), and 4 times of\n      measurement (at baseline, after the 8th HEP meeting, and at 1 and 2 years after baseline).\n      Data reported here are for 8 week and 1-year psychosocial outcomes and 18 months for VA\n      cost. Caregivers and veterans (n = 466) were randomized in 3 VAMCs, 114 to UC and 119 to\n      HEP. The typical caregiver was 68 years old, married, white, female, with some college\n      education and living with the veteran. The typical veteran care recipient was 74 years old,\n      white, male with some college education, and suffered from one or more chronic health\n      problems. Fifteen HEP groups were conducted. Caregivers and recipients were assessed on: 1)\n      health and functional status; 2) emotional well-being; and 3) social support. In addition,\n      caregivers were assessed for change in coping skills, change in burden level, pressing\n      problems, and knowledge and use of community resources. Data was analyzed using random\n      effects regression models.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Data on two-year outcomes for health and functional status, emotional well-being, and social\n      support of caregivers and veterans, problems associated with caregiving and Medicare plus VA\n      costs are being collected and analyzed for an amended final report."
