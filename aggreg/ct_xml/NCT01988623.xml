    <textblock>
      The investigators will assess the efficacy of Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT) in the
      treatment of communication deficits in children with intellectual disabilities. By
      collecting information about parent and child functioning before and after PRT, The
      investigators will be able to determine whether the intervention is effective in improving
