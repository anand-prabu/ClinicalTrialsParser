            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      In recent years concern has arisen about the potential health hazards of trans-fatty acids\n      in the American diet. Dietary intake of trans-fatty acids has been linked to unhealthy\n      shifts in serum lipid profiles and to coronary heart disease (CHD) in a number of studies.\n      Although several studies have estimated intakes of trans-fatty acids in U.S. populations,\n      presently data is lacking regarding trends in intake of trans-fatty acids in the population.\n       Furthermore, it is unclear how trends in intake of trans-fatty acids may be related to\n      changes in other dietary and non-dietary CHD risk factors and CHD mortality.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The study used newly available nutrient data to recalculate dietary data collected as part\n      of the Minnesota Heart Survey (MHS) to examine trends in intake of trans-fatty acids.  The\n      MHS was an ongoing observational epidemiologic study of trends in risk factors and\n      cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among independent cross-sectional probability samples\n      of the Minneapolis-St. Paul, Minnesota, metropolitan area.  Surveys were conducted in\n      1980-1982, 1985-1987, 1990-1992 and 1995-1997.  Diet was among the CVD risk factors measured\n      as part of each survey.  In this research, 24-hour dietary recalls collected from MHS\n      participants were recalculated using an updated food and nutrient database that included\n      trans-fatty acid values (16:1, 18:1, 18:2, and total).  Intake estimates resulting from\n      recalculation were analyzed to examine temporal trends in trans-fatty acid intake between\n      1980 and 1997, and to examine the relationship of temporal trends in trans-fatty acid intake\n      to temporal changes in other dietary and non-dietary CHD risk factors and changes in CHD\n      mortality. The MHS data provided a unique opportunity to examine a dietary constituent only\n      recently recognized as a potential risk factor for CHD."
