Hemodynamic optimization based on fluid management and stroke\n      volume optimization have been shown to improve patient outcomes, especially for moderate and\n      high risk abdominal surgical patients. A novel closed-loop fluid administration system based\n      on multi-parameter hemodynamic monitoring have been described recently. This prospective,\n      randomized, surgeon  and patient blinded study aims at comparing the cardiac output provided\n      by either this closed-loop system or the anesthesiologist team in high-rish surgical patient\n      elected for abdominal surgery at Pierre B\u00e9nite University Hospital, Hospices Civils of Lyon,\n      France. Primary endpoint is the mean indexed cardiac output during surgery per group. We\n      will also compare hemodynamic parameter (cardiac output, stroke volume, blood pressure heart\n      rate\u2026) and patient's outcomes (morbidity, mortality, transfusion rate, hospital length of\n      stay) between groups"
