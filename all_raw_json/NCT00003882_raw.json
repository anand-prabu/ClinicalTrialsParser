Assess the safety,\n      pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive anhydrovinblastine IV over 1 hour\n      on day 1. Courses are repeated every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. The dose of anhydrovinblastine is escalated in cohorts\n      of 1-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as\n      the dose that at which no more than 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n      Patients are followed at 1 month after treatment, and then monthly until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
