  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled 8-week adjunctive trial of pioglitazone for
      the acute relief of bipolar depression.  All subjects will also meet criteria for insulin
      resistance (IR). The primary objective is to test the hypothesis that adjunctive
      pioglitazone is more effective than placebo for the relief of acute depressive symptoms
      resulting from bipolar disorder that is co-occurring with insulin resistance.
