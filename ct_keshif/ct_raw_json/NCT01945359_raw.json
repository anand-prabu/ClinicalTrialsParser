Patients\n      will be followed for the first 24 weeks of their transition from natalizumab.  Assessments\n      will be performed at Baseline and every 4 weeks thereafter for 24 weeks.  These assessments\n      may include:\n\n        -  Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS)\n\n        -  Relapse Assessment\n\n        -  Patient Reported Outcomes (PRO) including quality of life, fatigue, and cognition\n           outcome measures\n\n        -  Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)\n\n        -  Laboratory testing\n\n      Study drop outs due to DMF intolerability or other etiologies will be encouraged to complete\n      the trial even if placed on alternative therapies."
