Biological therapies such as BCG use different ways to\n      stimulate the immune system and stop cancer cells from growing. It is not yet known whether\n      AD 32 is more effective with or without BCG after surgery for superficial bladder cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of AD 32 with or without BCG\n      after surgery in treating patients who have newly diagnosed or recurrent superficial bladder\n      cancer."

AD 32 is\n      administered by catheter into the bladder within 8 hours after surgery. Patients must hold\n      the AD 32 in the bladder for 90 minutes.\n\n      After pathological and tumor marker analysis, patients are assigned to the low or high-risk\n      group as defined by their p53 and pRb phenotype.\n\n        -  Low risk: Patients with carcinoma in situ receive BCG by catheter into the bladder once\n           weekly for 6 weeks beginning 7-21 days after treatment with AD 32. Patients assigned to\n           the low-risk group who do not have carcinoma in situ receive no further treatment.\n\n        -  High-risk: Patients also receive BCG once weekly for 6 weeks and then once weekly for 3\n           weeks at 3 months, 6 months, and then every 6 months for a total of 3 years after the\n           first BCG treatment.\n\n      All patients undergo cystoscopy every 3 months for the first year and then every 6 months\n      for the next 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 200 patients will be accrued for this study."
