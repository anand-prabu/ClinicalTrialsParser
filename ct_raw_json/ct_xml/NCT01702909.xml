      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Interleukin-2 at the dose and schedule
      used in this study will help increase tumor shrinkage.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this phase II study, the IL-2 schedule (daily IL-2 for 5 days (per week) every 3 weeks)
      will be tested in a cohort of kidney cancer patients to attempt to determine the response
      rate, median duration of response, and median survival. The dose intensity of this schedule
      would allow a patient treated on this regimen to achieve the target threshold (&gt; 1440
      million IU/m2/year).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients must have a histologic diagnosis of metastatic kidney cancer. Patients may
             have received prior systemic therapy or may be previously untreated

          2. Patients must have bi-dimensional measurable disease on physical exam or radiologic
             studies.

          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and estimated survival of at least 3 months.

          4. White blood count of &gt; 3500/mm3, platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt; 9.0
             gm/dl; bilirubin, ALT, AST &lt; 3 x upper limit of normal; serum creatinine &lt; 2.0 mg/dl.

          5. Patients must undergo a low-level cardiac stress test as a screen for possible
             atherosclerotic heart disease.  Patients with a positive stress test would be
             excluded from this trial.

          6. Patients with elevated temperatures &gt; 100.5 F must have sources of occult infection
             excluded.

          7. Patients must be felt to have recovered from effects of prior therapy, such as &gt; 2
             weeks after prior chemotherapy.

          8. Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study.

          9. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must take
             adequate precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Medical illness requiring corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents (such as
             cyclosporin or methotrexate.

          2. Autoimmune disease such as inflammatory arthritis which could be exacerbated by
             immune-based therapy.

          3. Prior history of psychiatric disorder which could be exacerbated by interleukin-2.

          4. Lactation or pregnancy.

          5. Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease including history of recent (&lt; 6
             months prior) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, primary cardiac
             arrhythmias (not due to electrolyte disorder or drug toxicity, for example) beyond
             occasional PVC's, angina, positive low-level stress test, or cerebrovascular
             accident.

          6. Current brain metastasis.
