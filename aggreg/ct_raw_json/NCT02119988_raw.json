            "textblock": "Variceal bleeding is one of the leading causes of death in patients with cirrhosis. Patients\n      with cirrhosis surviving a variceal bleeding are at high risk of rebleeding (over 60% at 1\n      year), and mortality from each rebleeding episode is about 20%.\n\n      Placement of TIPS is a well-established technique that is highly effective in preventing\n      recurrent variceal bleeding, especially if the TIPS is created with an expanded\n      polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE)-covered stent, which has a significantly lower risk of shunt\n      dysfunction than does TIPS created with bare stents. But the risk of hepatic encephalopathy\n      greatly increases and the risk of recurrent variceal bleeding after TIPS placement remains\n      an issue. Besides an insufficient decrease in portosystemic pressure gradient after TIPS\n      creation alone, fragile variceal vessels also are considered a risk factor for recurrent\n      bleeding.\n\n      Accordingly, TIPS combined with variceal embolization has been advocated to achieve the best\n      result possible in preventing recurrent variceal bleeding. However, in recent American\n      Association of the Study of Liver Disease (AASLD) practice guidelines and Baveno V\n      consensus, no treatment strategies were clearly recommended maybe because the exact efficacy\n      of this strategy remains unclear and high-quality randomized controlled trials still lacks.\n\n      So the investigators hypothesized that embolization of these collateral vessels may increase\n      the blood flow within the shunt and into the liver, which can theoretically decrease the\n      incidence of shunt dysfunction and encephalopathy, even can prolong the patients' survival."
