    <textblock>
      This is a multicentre, randomized, single-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group phase III
      local registration study for a treatment period of 12 weeks. This study aims to assess the
      effectiveness and safety of fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID in treatment of
      Chinese adult and adolescent patients with severe persistent asthma for a treatment period
      of 12 weeks versus budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID. The steady-state plasma
      pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will also be assessed.

      Male or female subjects between 17 to 70 (inclusive) years of age with severe persistent
      asthma meeting the inclusion criteria and having completed the screening period of 2 weeks
      will, in a proportion of 1:1, randomly receive fluticasone propionate 1mg via nebulizer BID
      or budesonide 2mg via nebulizer BID for a treatment period of 12 weeks. The clinic visit
      will be arranged at 2 weeks, 4 weeks, 8 weeks and 12 weeks during study treatment. If the
      subjects meet the criteria of pre-defined asthma control at treatment 4 weeks or 8 weeks,
      they will have one chance to be treated with the half dose of study drug. 2 weeks after
      completion of study treatment or after early withdrawal from study, the follow-up visit will
      be performed to assess the post-treatment adverse events. The primary endpoint is the mean
      change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment
      period. Safety assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal
      candidiasis, hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG.
      The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will
      also be assessed.
