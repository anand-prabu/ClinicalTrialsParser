<p>Randomized study. &nbsp;All patients must be randomized to treatment on Arms I and II within 3 months of definitive surgery on Regimen A.</p>
<p>Regimen A: &nbsp;Surgery followed, as indicated, by Radiotherapy. &nbsp;Amputation; or limb-sparing resection followed by involved-field irradiation using megavoltage equipment with or without electron boost.</p>
<p>Arm I: &nbsp;2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy with Hematologic Toxicity Attenuation and Urothelial Protection. &nbsp;Doxorubicin, DOX, NSC-123127; Ifosfamide, IFF, NSC-109724; with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF,</p>

<td colspan="2" class="bigdent">
<p>Patients with primary, high-grade soft tissue sarcoma of the extremities will undergo treatment of their primary tumor with either amputation or limb-sparing surgery and radiotherapy, and then be randomized to either observation or adjuvant treatment with doxorubicin and ifosfamide with mesna (with G-CSF) for five cycles beginning post-operatively. &nbsp;Local recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival will be evaluated in this randomized two-arm trial.</p>
