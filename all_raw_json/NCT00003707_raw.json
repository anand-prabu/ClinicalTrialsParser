Treatment continues every 4 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each receive escalating doses of tipifarnib until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is defined as the dose at which fewer than one\n      third of the patients experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, on day 22 of each course, and at the end of\n      treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
