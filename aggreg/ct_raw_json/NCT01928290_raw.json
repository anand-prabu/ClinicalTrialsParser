Biopsy-proven and inoperable locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cancer of the\n             esophagus, stomach, or gastro-esophageal junction.\n\n          2. Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be accurately measured in at least one\n             dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as \u226510 mm with CT scan, as \u226520 mm by\n             chest x-ray, or \u226510 mm with calipers by clinical exam.\n\n          3. Prior single modality radiation therapy is allowed.\n\n          4. At least 18 years of age.\n\n          5. ECOG performance status \u2264 2\n\n          6. Normal bone marrow and organ function as defined below:\n\n               1. Absolute neutrophil count \u2265 1,500/mcl\n\n               2. Platelets \u2265 100,000/mcl\n\n               3. AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) \u2264 2.5 x IULN\n\n               4.

LVEF \u2265 50%\n\n          7. Women of childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception\n             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control, abstinence) prior to study entry and\n             for the duration of study participation.  Should a woman become pregnant or suspect\n             she is pregnant while participating in this study, she must inform her treating\n             physician immediately.\n\n          8. Ability to understand and willingness to sign an IRB approved written informed\n             consent document (legally authorized representative is allowed).\n\n          9. Patients already receiving treatment with FOLFIRINOX +/- trastuzumab may participate\n             in the study and have their data collected retrospectively if they met inclusion\n             criteria at the start of therapy and sign consent for study participation moving\n             forward.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Chemotherapy in the 6 months prior to registration.\n\n          2. History of other malignancy \u2264 5 years previous with the exception of basal cell or\n             squamous cell carcinoma of the skin which were treated with local resection only or\n             carcinoma in situ of the cervix.\n\n          3. Receiving any other investigational agents at the time of registration.\n\n          4. Known untreated brain metastases.  These patients must be excluded from this clinical\n             trial because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive\n             neurologic dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other\n             adverse events.\n\n          5. A history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or\n             biologic composition to the agents used in the study.\n\n          6. Previous therapy for metastatic gastroesophageal cancer. Previous perioperative\n             chemotherapy is allowed as long as the duration without treatment has been greater\n             than 6 months..\n\n          7. A history of congestive heart failure, transmural myocardial infarction, symptomatic\n             valvular disease, or high-risk arrhythmia.\n\n          8. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements.\n\n          9. Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.  Patient must have a negative urine pregnancy test\n             within 14 days of study entry.\n\n         10. Known HIV-positivity and on combination antiretroviral therapy because of the\n             potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with trastuzumab.  In addition, these\n             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with\n             marrow-suppressive therapy.  Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients\n             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.\n\n        Inclusion of Women and Minorities\n\n        Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial."
