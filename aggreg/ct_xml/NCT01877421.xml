    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1/2a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, dose-escalation
      study to evaluate the safety and proof of concept of Antiplaque Chewing Gum. This is a
      2-part trial with 9 dosing cohorts in Phase 1 and 7 dosing cohorts in Phase 2a. For both
      phases, the oral soft (OST) and oral hard tissues (OHT) will be examined. Changes from
      baseline, such as soft tissue erythema, ulceration and sloughing, will be noted and
      assessments will be made by the principal investigator as to whether they might be
      attributable to the antiplaque chewing gum.

      In the Phase 2a portion of the study, the efficacy of the antiplaque chewing gum in reducing
      existing supragingival plaque and gingivitis will also be assessed. Plaque will be assessed
      using the Turesky Modification of the Quigley-Hein Plaque Index (PI, Turesky et al-1970) and
      gingivitis will be assessed using both the Modified Gingival Index (MGI, Lobene et al-1986)
      and the percent of bleeding sites on gentle probing (BOP) using the methods described in
      Ainamo and Bay-1975.

             (NSAID), tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha blockers] within 30 days prior to study
             entry

          -  Receipt of prescription antibacterial oral products (eg products containing
             chlorhexidine) within 30 days prior to study entry

          -  Pregnant or breast-feeding female
