      OBJECTIVE:

      This Protocol is to facilitate training of Fellows in evaluation of clinical disorders of
      the autonomic nervous system. The training is necessary to enable Fellows to sit for and
      pass the certifying examination in autonomic disorders administered by the United Council
      for Neurologic Subspecialties (UCNS) and to maintain UCNS accreditation of the Fellowship. A
      secondary objective is to include results of evaluations and testing with those from other
      Protocols, for future data analyses.

      STUDY POPULATION:

      Referred patients with known or suspected abnormalities of one or more components of the
      autonomic nervous system and healthy adult volunteers. Volunteers will be studied for
      Fellows to practice and gain normative values for pupillometric function.

      DESIGN:

      Clinical physiologic, neuropharmacologic, and neurochemical testing will be performed during
      outpatient clinic visits or during inpatient admissions, depending on the individual testing
      schedule. Inpatient testing may be done in conjunction with other Protocols (e.g.,
      03-N-0004). Most of the testing under this Protocol can be completed in a single outpatient
      visit over the course of a workday. Testing procedures under this Protocol will be performed
      as needed for adequate Fellow training. In addition to autonomic medical history and
      physical examination, clinical testing procedures may include (A) monitoring of
      hemodynamics, sweating, and other physiologic parameters associated with the Valsalva
      maneuver, orthostasis, or external temperature manipulation; (B) venous blood sampling for
      assays of levels of catecholamines and related neurochemicals; (C) administration of
      autonomic test drugs; (D) skin biopsies; (E) blood volume measurement; (F) pupillometry; (G)
      gastrointestinal phonography; (H) urinary bladder ultrasound; and (I) neurobehavioral rating
      scales.

      OUTCOME MEASURES:

      The main outcome measure is competency in clinical and laboratory evaluation of autonomic
      disorders, based on assessment of the Fellow by the Principal Investigator at approximately
      6-month intervals. A secondary outcome measure is results obtained under this Protocol,
      which may be analyzed and reported as research data along with data from other Protocols

        -  PATIENTS

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients may be included if they are at least 18 years old and are known or suspected to
        have failure of one or more components of the autonomic nervous system, small fiber
        neuropathy, inherited dysautonomia, orthostatic intolerance, neurocardiogenic syncope,
        status post

        endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy, or disorders of catecholamine synthesis or fate.

        Children greater than two years old may be enrolled in this Protocol if they might
        personally benefit from the tests in the Protocol through the establishment of a
        diagnosis.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        There are no exclusion criteria for the study as a whole.

        HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Healthy adult Volunteers (at least 18 years old) may be included, pending normal or
        medically insignificant results of history and physical examination. A repeat history and
        physical examination is required if more than 6 months have gone by from a previous
        workup.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        A candidate Healthy Volunteer will be excluded if the person has any of the following:
        symptoms of autonomic dysfunction, including lightheadedness, fainting, abnormalities of
        sweating, frequent nausea, vomiting, constipation, or diarrhea, or urinary frequency or
        retention. If the Volunteer has a condition requiring medication that in the judgment of
        the Investigators will affect results of the pupillometric tests under this Protocol, the
        Volunteer may be included for training purposes.
