      The primary objective of the study is to assess the pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of
      Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®) in previously untreated patients
      with low tumor burden follicular lymphoma (LTBFL).

      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacodynamics (PD), safety, and
      anti-tumor activity of BI 695500 vs. rituximab (MabThera®), as well as the presence of
      anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).

             of &gt;10 % body weight over the past 6 months, and sweats - the presence of drenching
             night sweats), no significant splenomegaly, no pleural effusion, no complications
             such as ascites or organ compression, and normal serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)

             criteria 2007 at Screening (lesion clearly measurable in at least 2 perpendicular
             dimensions; see Appendix 10.1 for further details).

          -  Adequate hematological function (unless abnormalities are related to lymphoma
             infiltration of the bone marrow) within 28 days prior to randomization, including:

          -  - hemoglobin =9.0 g/dL (=5.6 mmol/L).

          -  - absolute neutrophil count =1.5 × 10^9/L.

             acceptable method of contraception during the trial, i.e., a combination of 2 forms

             Zoster).

          -  Patients with chronic active HBV infection. Patients seropositive because of HBV
             vaccine are eligible. Patients with serologic evidence of past infection may
             participate if they agree to receive a course of antiviral prophylaxis beginning with
             the first infusion of BI 695500/rituximab (MabThera®), and according to local
             guidelines.

          -  Serious underlying medical conditions, which, per the investigator¿s discretion,

             anticoagulants.

          -  Treatment within a clinical trial within 4 weeks prior to initiation of trial
             treatment. Patients who have received treatment with a drug that has not received
             regulatory approval for any indication within 4 weeks or a minimum of 5 half-lives,
             whichever is longer, of the initial dose of trial medication.

          -  Any other co-existing medical or psychological condition(s) that will preclude
             participation in the trial or compromise ability to give informed consent and/or
             comply with study procedures.

          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. For women of childbearing potential, a positive serum
             pregnancy test at the Screening Visit.
