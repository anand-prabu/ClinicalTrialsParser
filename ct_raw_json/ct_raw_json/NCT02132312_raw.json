Administration of test irrigation solutions will take place in a double-masked\n      fashion.\n\n      Intraoperative pupil size will be determined by measurement of pupil diameter from still\n      photos captured from video recordings of the procedure. Pupil diameter measurements will be\n      performed immediately prior to the initial incision and at one-minute intervals until the\n      end of the procedure (wound closure). Pain will be assessed by the Alder Hey Triage Pain\n      Score."

Surgeon's expectation that the protocol-specified mydriatic regimen will not be\n             adequate to perform the procedure and that additional mydriatic treatment\n             (pharmacological or mechanical) will be required.\n\n          4. Presence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, renal,\n             hematological, endocrine, neurological, psychiatric, respiratory, or other medical\n             condition that could increase the risk to the subject as determined by the\n             Investigator.\n\n          5. Presence of active or suspected viral, bacterial, or fungal disease in the study eye.\n\n          6.

Have suspected permanent or low vision in the fellow non-study eye, unless caused by\n             a cataract. The study eye must not be the subject's only good eye.\n\n         12. Use of systemic corticosteroids or NSAIDs in the seven days prior to surgery.\n\n         13. Have a history of clinically significant corticosteroid-induced intraocular pressure\n             increase.\n\n         14. Use of any medication for ocular hypertension or glaucoma in the study eye.\n\n         15. Prior participation in a clinical study of OMS302.\n\n         16. Participating in any investigational drug or device trial within the 30 days prior to\n             the day of surgery.\n\n         17. History of intraocular non-laser surgery in the study eye within the three months\n             prior to the day of surgery, or intraocular laser surgery in the study eye within 30\n             days prior to the day of surgery.\n\n         18. Presence of any condition that the Investigator believes would put the subject at\n             risk or confound the interpretation of the study data.\n\n         19. Be a member of the immediate family of the Investigator or employees of the\n             investigative site.
