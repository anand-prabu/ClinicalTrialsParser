  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The population that will be included in this study, will be regular Turkish hypertensive
      patients who are expected to consume sodium in high amounts. It is hypothesized that, in
      that population, amlodipine/valsartan will be effective at the same rate of blood pressure
      (BP) control rate as expected from literature.
