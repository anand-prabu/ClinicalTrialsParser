Women who are\n             NOT of childbearing potential are those who have undergone a bilateral oophorectomy\n             or who have undergone menopause, defined as an absence of a menstrual cycle for 12\n             consecutive months.\n\n          -  Negative pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Subjects with known hypersensitivity to any of the components of the PEGylated\n             AuroShell suspension (polyethylene glycol, gold).\n\n          -  Patients who are pregnant and/or lactating.\n\n          -  Patients who have undergone splenectomy.\n\n          -  Subjects who are receiving concurrent investigational therapy or who have received\n             investigational therapy within the 30 days prior to AuroShell infusion\n             (investigational therapy is defined as treatment for which there is currently no\n             regulatory authority approved indication).\n\n          -  Subjects with evidence of an active bacterial infection or with a fever \u2265 38.5 \u00baC\n             (101.3 \u00baF) within 3 days of the first scheduled day of dosing.\n\n          -  Subject who has had a course of radiotherapy in the treatment area within the 30 days\n             prior to AuroShell infusion.\n\n          -  Subject who has had a course of chemotherapy or other anti-neoplastic therapy in the\n             30 days prior to AuroShell infusion.\n\n          -  Life expectancy of less than 3 months.\n\n          -  Any other medical condition, including mental illness or substance abuse, deemed by\n             the Investigator to be likely to interfere with a subject's ability to sign informed\n             consent, cooperate and participate in the study, or interfere with the interpretation\n             of the results."
