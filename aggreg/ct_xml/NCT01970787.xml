  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Single-center prospective pilot trial involving up to 22 subjects. This study will
      assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of radiofrequency ablation (RFA) to the anal
      canal using the FDA cleared HALO Ablation System to eradicate anal HSIL lesions in
      HIV-negative subjects with intra-anal intraepithelial neoplasia (AIN). The study
      intervention will demonstrate that a reasonable proportion of subjects will be
      histologically cleared of their anal HSIL within the ETZ in a tolerable and relatively safe
      manner

    <description>Subject tolerability of the RFA procedure as measured by severity. Mild:  Awareness of signs and symptoms, but easily tolerated; are of a minor irritant type; causing no loss of time from normal activities; symptoms would not require medication or a medical intervention; asymptomatic lab findings; marginal clinical relevance; signs and symptoms are transient.
Moderate: Discomfort severe enough to cause interference with usual activities; minimal intervention.
Severe: Incapacitating with inability to do work or usual activities; signs and symptoms may be of systemic nature or require medical evaluation or treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18-75 years

          -  HRA 2 to 12 weeks prior to the 0 month RFA visit yielding one or more flat,
             non-condylomatous biopsy-proven HSILs that are

               1. Located entirely within in the eligible treatment zone

               2. Contiguous with the squamocolumnar junction Eligible treatment zone (ETZ) is
                  defined as

               1. 3 cm above the dentate line to the anocutaneous line

               2. Half of the anorectal circumference (meaning no more than two contiguous
                  quadrants)

          -  If female of child-bearing age, negative pregnancy test within 8 weeks of the 0 month
             RFA visit and declared intent to remain on birth control throughout the trial, or,
             declaration of infertility defined as subject report of status as post-menopausal or
             surgically sterile (status post hysterectomy or tubal ligation).

          -  HIV negative, ELISA/Western blot test obtained within 12 weeks of the 0 month RFA
             visit

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Any biopsy-proven HSIL entirely outside of the ETZ

          2. Any biopsy-proven HSIL partially within the ETZ (for example, an HSIL lesion with
             extension to the perianal skin)

          3. Any condylomas in the eligible treatment zone &gt; 1/2 cm diameter

             â€¢ Note: Condylomas in the eligible treatment zone &lt; 1/2 cm in diameter must be
             excised or cauterized (not treated topically or with IRC) before or during Visit 1 (0
             month RFA visit)

          4. Any anal or rectal pathology requiring treatment including ulcer, fistula, fissure,
             stenosis or proctitis

          5. History of or present anal or rectal cancer

          6. History of pelvic radiation therapy

          7. History of HPV vaccination or plans to initiate HPV vaccination during the trial

          8. History of ablation or resection therapy within the ETZ other than cauterization or
             excision of condyloma(s)

          9. History of topical therapy (Imiquimod, 5-FU) within 6 months prior to the 0 month RFA
             visit within the ETZ

         10. Hemorrhoids &gt; grade II

         11. Fecal incontinence (that the investigator feels may impair healing)

         12. Concurrent disease requiring systemic immunosuppression therapy

         13. Concurrent malignancy requiring systemic therapy

         14. Life expectancy &lt; 2 years
