Several mechanisms of tumor immune evasion have been\n      identified, including low intratumor expression of antigens and elevated expression of\n      inhibitory co-regulatory molecules. An effective immunotherapy is one which would induce\n      necrotic cell death and  proinflammatory cytokine production. Stereotactic Body Radiotherapy\n      (SBRT) which delivers conformal, tumor-ablating radiation dose may be an effective means of\n      conditioning solid tumors favorable to the initiation of robust antitumoral immune\n      responses."
