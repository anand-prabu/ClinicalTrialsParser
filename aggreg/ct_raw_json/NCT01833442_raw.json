Patients\n      will then receive 09 to 12 more months of the meditation protocol. The investigators are\n      expecting to recruit 50 to 60 patients to start. Patients will be blinded to the content of\n      the protocol in the other group at baseline and until one group shows greater efficacy on\n      the primary efficacy variable. The intake physician will be blinded to the treatment groups\n      of the patients."
