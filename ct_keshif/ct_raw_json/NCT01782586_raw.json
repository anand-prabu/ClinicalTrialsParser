Each gene has\n      an \"on/off\" switch that controls how they are expressed in a cell, as well as a \"volume\n      control\" that increases or decreases the level of expression of a particular gene as\n      necessary.  Researchers want to see if the presence and abundance of certain transcripts in\n      a kidney biopsy at one year after transplant can predict which kidneys will have reduced\n      function over time."
