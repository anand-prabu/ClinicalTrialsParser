            "textblock": "Participants : This study was conducted prospectively at the outpatient clinic, Department\n      of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Songklanagarind Hospital.\n\n      Inclusion criteria : The women who had abnormal uterine bleeding and indication for\n      endometrial biopsy were enrolled.\n\n      Exclusion criteria : included 1) contraindications to NSAID or Lidocaine - known sensitivity\n      to these drugs; 2) pregnancy; 3) genital tract infection; 4) coagulation disorder; and 5)\n      unstable vital signs.\n\n      Sample size calculation : Sample size was calculated by assuming the different mean pain\n      score of each groups performing the endometrial biopsy to be 1. To evidence this difference\n      with a power of 80% and a 5% level of significance, a need was calculated with 36 women in\n      each group and  for total was 108 women.\n\n      Z \u03b1/2 = Type I error(alpha error) \u03b1 = 0.05 >> 1.96 Z \u03b2 = Type II error(beta error) \u03b2 = 0.2\n      >> 0.84\n\n        -  Variance of mean pain score between procedure and post procedure 15 minutes = 1.5 \u00b50 =\n           Mean pain score in group 1  \u00b51 = Mean pain score in group 2 \u00b50 - \u00b51 = Different of mean\n           pain score in between each groups = 1 **N = 2(1.5)2(1.96 + 0.84)2/(1)2 = 35.3 N = 36\n           per group\n\n      Study procedures :\n\n        1. Explain the steps of the procedure to the patient and counseling regarding rational and\n           risks/benefits. Obtain consent for the procedure. Perform bimanual exam to determine\n           uterine size and position.\n\n        2. After signing a written informed consent, the women were randomly allocated to 3\n           groups. All women will receive Acetaminophen 500 mg and Ibuprofen 400 mg before\n           procedure 30 minutes.\n\n           The first groups receive paracervical block with 1%lidocaine and 0.9%NSS\n           spray(placebo), the second groups receive 10%lidocaine spray and  paracervical block\n           with 0.9%NSS(placebo) and the third groups receive placebo both paracervical block and\n           spray. Both women and researcher associate were blinded to group allocation. The\n           1%lidocaine,  10%lidocaine spray and both placebos were prepared in sequentially\n           numbered sealed opaque envelops according to the table of random numbers by an\n           independent pharmacist.\n\n        3. The time that start oral medication and vital signs before starting procedure were\n           recorded.\n\n        4. Starting procedure by using largest appropriate speculum for maximum cervical exposure.\n           Cleanse the cervix with povidone iodine. Then administer paracervical block by using\n           local anesthetic drug 5 ml. injects at cervical area 3 and 9 O'clock, depth 0.5-1 cm.,\n           2.5 ml. each sides. After that use anesthetic spray sprays at cervix for 1 times and\n           wait for 3 minutes.\n\n        5. Endometrial biopsy was performed by using a 3-mm EndosamplerTM (MedGyn EndosamplerTM,\n           MedGyn Product Inc, IL, USA). If insertion of EndosamplerTM failed,  a tenaculum was\n           applied to the anterior cervix to help for stabilization and counter-traction.\n\n        6. After get the endometrial tissue sample, remove all equipments, checked and stopped\n           bleeding. And record vital signs after finish the procedure.\n\n        7. The form contained a visual analog scale for women to report their responses of pain at\n           immediately after procedure and after that 15 minutes by using Numerical Rating\n           Scale(NRS) were recorded.\n\n        8. The women were assessed for adverse side effects or complications of procedure e.g.\n           such as dizziness, nausea, vomiting, pelvic pain or others.\n\n        9. Follow up appointment the women for pathological report result at PSU hospital and\n           consider further management.\n\n      Expected outcomes :\n\n      To determine effectiveness of paracervical block, lidocaine spray and only oral analgesic\n      drugs for pain relief during endometrial biopsy.\n\n      Table.
