    <textblock>
      In pre-clinical study, we found that serum thioredoxin reductase activity harbours huge
      difference after any kind of treatments, so we hypothesis that serum activity of thioredoxin
      reductase may be a warning markers in excised non-small lung cancers, serum activity of this
      enzyme may elevated before CT scan

      This is a cooperative research project in Thoracic Surgery Department and Medical Oncology
      department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South
      University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking
      University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity in blood
      in staged(Ⅰ~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the warning relapse ability of thioredoxin
      reductase in blood. The secondary objective is to compare the warning relapse activity of
      blood thioredoxin reductase activity with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) in subjects who
      received surgery. Blood will be collected in subjects before surgery, 5 days after surgery,
      and every 3 months after surgery till 2 years, then every 6 months till 3 years, or collect
      blood till tumor relapse for the subjects at stage ⅠA and low risk ⅠB. Blood will be
      collected before surgery, 5 days after surgery, before adjuvant chemotherapy, after 2
      circles of all adjuvant chemotherapy, then every 3 months after adjuvant chemotherapy till 2
      years, and every 6 months till 3 years, or collect blood till tumor relapse for the subjects
      of high risk ⅠB~ⅢA, evaluation CT results every time collect blood samples.
