Little is known about distraction's\n      effectiveness. Virtual reality may be an effective distraction. The aims of this study are\n      1)to evaluate the effect of virtual reality (VR), a newer interactive kind of distraction,\n      compared to passive distraction (PD) by watching a movie, and usual care (SC) that is\n      provided by the nurses, on pain experienced by adolescents during burn wound care and 2)to\n      determine the relationship among anxiety, desire for distraction, and engagement with\n      distraction on the pain."
