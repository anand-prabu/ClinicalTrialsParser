      This study will  assess whether a negative pressure wound vacuum therapy (NPWT) on closed
      incisions decreases the risk of wound complications among obese patients after cesarean
      section

      All patients having a cesarean section in labor or presenting to the triage unit and
      requiring a cesarean section will be eligible

      Main study intervention: this involves the use of a negative pressure wound vacuum therapy
      on a closed incision.

      Objectives To evaluate whether there is a decrease in wound complications among obese
      patients who are treated with closed incision NPWT versus standard post cesarean section
      wound care protocol.

      Primary outcome variable(s) The primary outcome variable is wound complications defined as
      any readmission for a wound issue within four weeks of discharge, infection, or wound
      breakdown.

      Secondary outcome will look at patient quality of life among those with NPWT versus usual
      care arm.

      A survey addressing pain, breast feeding questions and ability to perform activity of daily
      living will be administered during the inpatient stay and at the postpartum visit.

      Background Obesity, defined as a body mass index (BMI) 30kg/m2, continues to be a growing
      epidemic in the United States. According to National Center for Health Statistics Data1,
      almost one third of adults and 17% of youth were obese in 2009-2010. Furthermore,
      non-Hispanic Blacks have the age-adjusted rates of obesity (49.5%). In a study by Chu et al
      analyzing data from 26 states in the Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS)
      database, 20% of women who delivered were obese and in certain ethnic and insurance
      subgroups, the rates were as high as 33%. In 2008, according to reports by the Pennsylvania
      State statistics, the rates of obesity in the city of Philadelphia were as high as 64%.
      Multiple studies have demonstrated the increased risks for diabetes, hypertension and
      adverse pregnancy outcomes (APO) during pregnancy in the obese population. In addition,
      obesity is a well established independent risk factor for the development of a wound
      complication or infection after a cesarean delivery, with rates ranging from 10-15% .
      Certain measures such as antibiotic prophylaxis and closure of the subcutaneous space are
      techniques that have demonstrated a decreased incidence of wound disruption. Currently no
      randomized controlled trials have looked at the effects of surgical approach or choice of
      abdominal incision in the obese or extremely obese woman undergoing cesarean delivery.
      However, the few retrospective studies that have addressed this issue have demonstrated
      mixed results. Given the paucity of randomized controlled trials evaluating the prevention
      of wound complications in obese women undergoing cesarean delivery, a recent review by
      Tipton emphasized the necessity for such trials to evaluate methods with which to improve
      postoperative wound care and healing in this high risk cohort. In the past decade, negative
      pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has become accepted in the treatment of expediting healing of
      open wounds 15-18. NPWT is a method in which a vacuum device is placed on the wound in order
      to remove excess interstitial fluid, increase tissue vascularity, decrease bacterial
      colonization, and place mechanical stress on adjacent wound edges which aids in wound
      contractility and closure. Therefore, the positive effects of NPWT on open wounds have been
      well studied and established. Recent studies have been performed to assess a potential
      effect of NPWT on closed incisions non-obstetric fields. A recent study by Grauhan et al
      compared the effects of NPWT over closed sternotomy incisions in obese patients compared to
      conventional sterile wound dressing and noted a significant reduction in the rates of wound
      infection in those treated with NPWT.

      Another study by Vargo assessed the effects of NPWT on closed incisions in patients
      undergoing abdominal therapy compared to a historical control also noted a decreased wound
      infection rate and no evidence of skin necrosis. In contrast, a recent study by Masden et
      al. looked at rates of infection and dehiscence in patients with multiple comorbidities
      status post predominantly lower extremity wounds and did not appreciate a difference between
      the NPWT group and dry dressing group24. Therefore, the need for further studies assessing
      the benefits of NPWT on various anatomical sites has been clearly established.
