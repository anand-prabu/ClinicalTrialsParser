White, refined products are\n      still the choice of the general public.  As such, we propose to investigate the feasibility\n      of increasing health benefits of commonly consumed white, refined carbohydrate products by\n      incorporating a soluble fibre blend.\n\n      This research is important to determine the feasibility of developing fibre enriched\n      carbohydrate foods that maintains the original organoleptic properties and is effective in\n      reducing postprandial blood glucose response.\n\n      35 subjects will be recruited in phase I to complete a sensory evaluation on the test foods.\n      Following tasting of the control and fibre-enriched samples, data on each subjects' liking\n      or disliking will be collected through a 9-point hedonic scale.\n\n      An acute crossover RCT will be conducted in phase II by 10 healthy individuals. Subjects\n      will be randomized to consume one the treatments at each visit and blood glucose levels over\n      120min and satiety scores will be measured."
