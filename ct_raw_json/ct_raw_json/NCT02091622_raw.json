This study examined whether an educational intervention could increase the\n      proportion of patients who received information about the transition to end-of-life care\n      (ITEOL).\n\n      Method: Two municipalities (in charge of nursing homes) and two hospitals were randomized to\n      receive an interactive half-day course about ITEOL for physicians and nurses. The proportion\n      of patients who received ITEOL was measured with data from the Swedish Register of\n      Palliative Care (SRPC). Patients were only included if they died an expected death and\n      maintained their ability to express their will until days or hours before their death. Four\n      hospitals and four municipalities were assigned controls, matched by hospital size,\n      population, and proportion of patients receiving ITEOL at baseline."
