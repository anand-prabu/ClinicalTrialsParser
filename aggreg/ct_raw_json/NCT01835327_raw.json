Further, the study\n      poses the hypothesis that a patient's poor recovery status goes on to increase a patient's\n      risk of developing post-operative morbidities such as pneumonia, arrhythmias and delirium.\n      The aim of this study is to address the observation that some patients struggle more than\n      others in their recovery and that 1) this may be a result of intraoperative cerebral oxygen\n      desaturations and 2) that this may affect their post-operative morbidity. If a potential\n      means of predicting poor outcomes is identified this will lead to further research into how\n      to adjust the associated variables, such as cerebral oxygenation, to improve patient\n      post-operative outcome."

What accounts for these different recovery trajectories is\n      unclear. Researchers have developed a Post-Operative Quality Recovery Scale (PQRS) which\n      assesses six domains (physiologic, nociceptive, emotive, activities of daily living,\n      cognitive, and overall patient experience) and has been suggested to serve as a means of\n      tracking patients' recovery from surgery."
