Jacot W, et al evaluated\n      epirubicin combined with ifosfamide (EI) for treatment of refractory and recurrent SCLC in\n      70 cases, the objective response rate (ORR) reached 21.4%, including 1 cases of complete\n      remission, 10% other patients obtained stable disease (SD), all the patients had a median\n      survival of 3.9 months, most (71%) patients with neutropenia, platelet count and anemia are\n      also common, showed that EI treatment of refractory and relapsed SCLC is effectively\n      controlled, toxicity.\n\n      In view of epirubicin combined with ifosfamide (EI) scheme is effective and safety in the\n      treatment of refractory and relapsed SCLC, the investigators will use liposomal doxorubicin\n      plus ifosfamide second-line treatment of refractory and relapsed small cell lung cancer, may\n      obtain better tumor remission rate, improve the prognosis of the patients."
