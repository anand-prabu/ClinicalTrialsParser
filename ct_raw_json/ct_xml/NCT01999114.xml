    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ECG effects of 10, 40, and 80 mcg/hr
      buprenorphine delivered by BTDS alone, or by BTDS dosed with naltrexone, relative to placebo
      in healthy male and female subjects.

             in this study.

             elastoplast.

          -  Subjects with a dermatological disorder at any relevant patch application site that
             precludes proper placement and/or rotation of patch.

          -  Taking antihistamines within 72 hours prior to dosing or systemic or topical
             corticosteroids within 3 weeks prior to dosing.

          -  Subjects will not allow hair to be removed at the proposed patch application site
             which may prevent proper placement of the patch.
