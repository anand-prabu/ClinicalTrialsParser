Assess the safety of this cytotoxic\n      combination in this patient population. III. Assess the preliminary evidence of efficacy of\n      this combination in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study. Patients receive oral temozolomide\n      once daily on days 1-5. Carboplatin IV is administered over 1 hour on day 1. Courses are\n      repeated every 28 days. Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of\n      toxicity and disease progression. Sequential dose escalation of carboplatin with a fixed\n      dose of temozolomide is followed by sequential dose escalation of carboplatin at a higher\n      fixed dose of temozolomide. Dose escalation in cohorts of 3-6 patients each continues until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxic effects. If the\n      combination treatment with carboplatin given on day 1 of temozolomide therapy is more toxic\n      than anticipated, then the study is repeated with carboplatin given on day 5 of temozolomide\n      therapy. Patients are followed at least every 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study."
