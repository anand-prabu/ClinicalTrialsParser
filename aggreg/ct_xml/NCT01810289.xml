      START is clinic-level (not individual-patient) intervention to catalyze the process of ART
      initiation among HIV-infected adults who meet CD4-based criteria for combination ART (e.g.,
      adults with a CD4 T cell level &lt; 350/ul). The three START components are: (1) real-time
      point-of-care CD4 testing using the Alere PIMA platform to ascertain treatment eligibility
      in real time at first presentation to care, (2) targeted knowledge transfer (i.e.,
      dissemination) of recent scientific evidence regarding effects rapid ART initiation on
      survival to front line health care workers; and 3) feedback and reporting to clinic and
      providers. There three components represent empirically validated steps in the PRECEED
      implementation model.

      RATIONALE:  In Africa, up to a 50-75% of HIV-infected, adults fail to initiate (FTI) ART or
      encounter delays of months even after eligibility through CD4+ T-cell testing or clinical
      criteria are established.  Recent randomized trials including ACTG Protocol 5164, ACTG 5221,
      CAMELIA and SAPIT have demonstrated that delays of even weeks in ART initiation increases
      mortality among patients presenting with active opportunistic infections.  Even among those
      without active infections, mortality among untreated persons with a CD4 &lt; 350 approaches
      15/100 person-years - a large proportion of which should be avoidable in patients who have
      presented to care. New dissemination and implementation strategies that are generalizable
      across resource-limited settings are needed to address FTI and make the public health
      approach more effective. The overall goal of the multi-component START strategy is to
      initiate the greatest number of eligible patients in the shortest amount of time possible,
      while maintaining safety, efficacy and cost effectiveness.

      HYPOTHESIS: The START intervention, a combined intervention using provider education, novel
      technology and reinforcing feedback, will increase the rapidity and completeness of ART
      initiation.

      INTERVENTION: START is clinic-level (not individual-patient) intervention to catalyze the
      process of ART initiation among HIV-infected adults who meet CD4-based criteria for
      combination ART (e.g., adults with a CD4 T cell level &lt; 350/ul). The three START components
      are: (1) real-time point-of-care CD4 testing using the Alere PIMA platform to ascertain
      treatment eligibility in real time at first presentation to care, (2) targeted knowledge
      transfer (i.e., dissemination) of recent scientific evidence regarding effects rapid ART
      initiation on survival to front line health care workers; and 3) feedback and reporting to
      clinic and providers. There three components represent empirically validated steps in the
      PRECEED implementation model.

      STUDY DESIGN:  A cluster-randomized, step-wedge trail of 24 clinics operated by the Makerere
      Joint AIDS Program. Four clinic sites will be randomly assigned to the START at 6-month
      intervals between month six and 24 during the three-year trial.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE

      1. Evaluate the programmatic change of START on the cumulative incidence of ART initiation
      in newly treatment eligible HIV-infected patients receiving care under routine program
      conditions in a large, multi-site, HIV care program in Uganda.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES

        1. Evaluate the effect of START on the incidence of mortality in treatment-eligible,
           HIV-infected patients.

        2. Evaluate the effect of START on plasma HIV RNA levels one year after treatment
           eligibility in HIV-infected patients presenting to care in a multi-site, HIV care
           program.

        3. Evaluate the effect of START on the incidence of vertical transmission in all
           HIV-infected women who are pregnant at the time they present to care.

        4. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the START intervention.

        5. To evaluate adaptation of START intervention into clinical care through qualitative
           analysis of counseling interactions and limited interviews with counselors and patients
           regarding their experience of counseling and identification of content of current
           counseling activities and how this changes over time.

      OUTCOMES: The primary outcome of the study is ART initiation.  Secondary outcomes are
      all-cause mortality, plasma HIV RNA at one year after clinic presentation, vertical
      transmission events and cost-effectiveness measures.

      ANALYTIC PLAN: The analytic approach for the primary outcome consists of estimate of a given
      HIV-infected individual's probability of initiating ART on a given calendar day conditional
      on a subject being eligible to initiate on that day (i.e., in the corresponding risk set)
      and the intervention status of the subject's site on the day of enrollment through Cox
      proportional hazard models. Analogous approaches will be used to evaluate the effect of the
      intervention on the cumulative incidence of death one year after eligibility and the
      fraction of patients with undetectable plasma HIV RNA one year after treatment eligibility
      (irrespective of whether or when ART was initiated) as well as vertical transmission events
      among pregnant women.
