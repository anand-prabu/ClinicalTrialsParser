The reason the investigators are looking at these drugs is because one\n      of the things that allows tumors to grow quickly is their ability to stimulate the growth of\n      new blood vessels.  By suppressing the growth of new blood vessels after stem cell\n      transplant, the investigators hope to prevent the tumors from coming back or continuing to\n      grow."

Lymphomas and other lymphoid malignancies will not be studied in this\n             protocol.\n\n             * Brain stem glioma patients who have progressed after radiation therapy do not\n             require histologic confirmation. Brain stem gliomas are defined as intrinsic tumors\n             of the pons causing diffuse enlargement.  These patients are diagnosed on clinical\n             and radiographic appearance of the lesion and the biopsy requirement will be waived\n             for this group.\n\n          -  Patient must be \u2265 1 years of age and \u2264 21 years of age at the time of study entry.\n\n          -  Patient must have a Karnofsky performance status or Lansky* play status \u2265 50\n\n             * For purpose of determining performance scores, wheelchair-bound patients will be\n             considered ambulatory.\n\n          -  Patient must have an adequate supply of stem cells for transplant harvested prior to\n             study enrollment, with adequate supply defined as 3 x 106 CD34+ cells/kg for\n             peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC).

In this instance, 3 x 108 mononuclear cells/kg will be considered\n             adequate.  If necessary, a combination of peripheral stem cells and bone marrow can\n             be used.\n\n          -  Prior radiation therapy and/or chemotherapy, including cyclophosphamide, are\n             permitted.\n\n          -  Prior anti-angiogenic therapy, including thalidomide and oral cyclophosphamide, is\n             permitted.\n\n          -  If on corticosteroids for mass effect and/or edema related to the tumor, patient must\n             be on a stable dose for at least 2 weeks prior to study entry.\n\n          -  Patient must have a life expectancy > 2 months.\n\n          -  Patient must have an adequate bone marrow reserve as defined by:\n\n               -  Hemoglobin \u2265 9.0 g/dl and\n\n               -  Platelet count \u2265 30,000/ mm3 (transfusion independent) and\n\n               -  Peripheral absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \u2265 750/mm3\n\n          -  Patient must have adequate cardiac function tested within 4 weeks of study enrollment\n             as defined by:\n\n               -  Shortening fraction of \u2265 27% by echocardiogram or\n\n               -  Ejection fraction of \u2265 50% by radionuclide angiogram\n\n          -  Patient must have adequate pulmonary function tested within 4 weeks of study\n             enrollment as defined by:\n\n               -  Pulse oximetry > 94% on room air or O2 by nasal cannula and\n\n               -  No evidence of dyspnea at rest.\n\n          -  Patient must have adequate hepatic function as defined by:\n\n               -  Total bilirubin \u2264 1.5x upper limit of normal (ULN) for age and\n\n               -  SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) \u2264 2.5 x ULN (SGOT \u2264 4x ULN if on Zantac)\n\n          -  Patient must have adequate renal function as defined by:\n\n               -  Serum creatinine < 1.5 mg/dl\n\n               -  Glomerular filtration rate (GFR), calculated via I-125 iothalamate clearance,\n                  24-hour creatinine clearance, or Schwartz formula*, \u2265 70 mL/min and \u2265 50\n                  mL/min/1.73 m2 done within 4 weeks of study entry\n\n               -  The Schwartz formula is an estimated glomerular filtration rate in children\n                  based upon serum creatinine and height.

Two\n                  reliable forms of contraception must be used simultaneously unless continuous\n                  abstinence from heterosexual sexual contact is chosen.

If\n                  hormonal or IUD contraception is medically contraindicated, another highly\n                  effective method or two barrier methods must be used at the same time.\n\n          -  Pregnancy surveillance:\n\n               -  Patient must have a negative in office pregnancy test sensitive to within 50\n                  mIU/mL (serum or urine) within 24 hours of beginning thalidomide even if\n                  continuous abstinence is the preferred method of birth control.\n\n               -  A pregnancy test must be performed weekly during the first 4 weeks of therapy\n                  and repeated monthly for patients with regular menses or every 2 weeks for\n                  patients with irregular menses\n\n               -  Negative pregnancy tests are valid for only 7 days.\n\n               -  If irregular bleeding or skipped menses, pregnancy test should be performed and\n                  pregnancy counseling given.\n\n               -  If pregnancy occurs during treatment, thalidomide must be immediately\n                  discontinued.  Any suspected lethal exposure must be reported immediately to\n                  Celgene Customer Care Center at 1-888-423-5346, and the patient referred to an\n                  OB/GYN experienced in reproductive toxicity for further evaluation and\n                  counseling.\n\n          -  Patient (or legally authorized representative) must be able to understand and willing\n             to sign a written informed consent document.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patient must not have any active, uncontrolled cardiac, hepatic, renal, or\n             psychiatric disease defined as \u2265 grade 3 based on NCI Common Terminology Criteria for\n             Adverse Events v4.0 (CTCAE).\n\n          -  Patient must not be receiving any other investigational agents.\n\n          -  Patient must not have any active infection or concurrent illness obscuring toxicity\n             or dangerously altering drug metabolism.\n\n          -  Patient must not have any thromboembolic event (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary\n             embolism) less than 3 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n          -  Patient must not have a history of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of\n             similar chemical or biologic composition to any of the agents used in the study.\n\n          -  Patient must not be pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n        Inclusion of Women and Minorities\n\n        -Both men and women and members of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this\n        trial."
