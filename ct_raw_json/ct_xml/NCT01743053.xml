      This is a prospective, randomised, open label, controlled pilot study to evaluate the safety
      and preliminary effectiveness of the ReCell Autologous Cell Harvesting Device (ReCell) for
      the management of chronic leg ulcers associated with venous insufficiency. Outcome will be
      compared between study participants receiving standard care (debridement, compression
      therapy) and participants receiving ReCell in addition to standard care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Chronic venous leg ulcer (CEAP Clinical classification of 6)

               -  Confirmed, treated venous reflux

               -  No exposed tendon or bone

               -  Ulcer is &gt;4 weeks in duration

               -  Ulcer surface area between 2cm2 and 80cm2

          2. ABI ≥ 0.8

          3. The patient is 18 years of age or older

          4. The patient is willing to complete all follow-up evaluations required by the study
             protocol

          5. The patient is able to abstain from any other treatment of the ulcer for the duration
             of the study, unless medically necessary

          6. The patient agrees to abstain from enrollment in any other clinical trial for the
             duration of the study

          7. The patient is able to read and understand instructions and give voluntary written
             informed consent

          8. The patient is able and willing to follow the protocol requirements (including
             compression therapy)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Study treatment area has exposed bone or tendon

          2. Poorly controlled diabetes

          3. Arterial insufficiency (ABI &lt; 0.8)

          4. Pregnant/lactating females (self-reported or tested, per institutional requirements)

          5. Subjects who have evidence of connective tissue disorders (e.g. vasculitis or
             rheumatoid arthritis) under active treatment

          6. The patient has an active wound infection requiring antibiotic therapy

          7. The patient has had a prior surgical treatment of the ulcer

          8. The patient is known to have a pre-existing condition that may interfere with wound
             healing, e.g. malignancy, autoimmune disease, immunocompromised blood borne diseases,
             the patient has AIDS, is HIV- or Hepatitis-C positive, or currently has a severe
             dermatological disorder (e.g. severe psoriasis, epidermolysis bullosa, pyoderma
             gangrenosum).

          9. The patient is unable to follow the protocol

         10. The patient is taking medication known to have an effect on wound healing (e.g.,
             corticosteroids)

         11. The patient has other concurrent conditions that in the opinion of the investigator
             may compromise patient safety or study objectives

         12. The patient has a known hypersensitivity to trypsin or compound sodium lactate.
