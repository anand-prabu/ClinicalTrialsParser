  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm, long-term extension study will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra (tocilizumab) in patients with moderate to severe
      rheumatoid arthritis who have completed the 97-week WA22762 or the 96-week NA25220 core
      study. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra 162 mg subcutaneously weekly (for patients
      entering from WA22762) or every two weeks (for patients entering from NA25220) for 96 weeks,
      with telephone call follow-up visits at Weeks 100 and 104.
