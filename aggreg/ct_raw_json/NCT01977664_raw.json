The couple gave their informed consent: ICSI will be performed if\n      maturation occurred, otherwise, the treatment would be stopped and the oocytes would be\n      donated for study if the oocytes were not matured after 24 hours of culture. After ovarian\n      hyperstimulation,14 oocytes were obtained. None of them was matured. The cycle was canceled\n      and the oocytes were donated for study.To induce the immature oocytes in vitro, oocytes were\n      1)cultured in follicular fluid containing matured metaphase II oocyte; 2) performed\n      intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) to induce intracellular Ca2+]i oscillations;\n      3)injected with active maturation promoting factor (MPF), 4)injected with cytoplasm of\n      matured metaphase II oocyte."
