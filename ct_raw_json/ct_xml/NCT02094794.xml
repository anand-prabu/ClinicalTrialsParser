    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies the safety and efficacy of total marrow and lymphoid irradiation
      (TMLI) in combination with two chemotherapy drugs, etoposide and cyclophosphamide, as a
      preparative regimen before donor stem cell transplant in treating patients with high-risk
      acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) who have failed previous
      therapy. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) uses imaging to provide a
      three-dimensional view of the area to be irradiated. Doctors can then shape and direct the
      radiation beams at the area from multiple directions while avoiding, as much as possible,
      nearby organs. TMLI is a method of using IMRT to direct radiation to the bone marrow.
      Radiation therapy is given before transplant to suppress the immune system, prevent
      rejection of the transplanted cells, and wipe out any remaining cancer cells. TMLI may allow
      a greater radiation dose to be delivered to the bone marrow as a preparative regimen before
      transplant while causing fewer side effects than standard radiation therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Following a patient safety lead-in, evaluate the anti-tumor activity of the allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplant (alloHCT) preparative regimen - TMLI, cyclophosphamide (Cy)
      and etoposide (VP-16), as assessed by 2-year progression-free survival (PFS).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Estimate overall survival (OS), cumulative incidence (CI) of relapse/progression, and
      non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days, 1 year and 2 years.

      II. Summarize toxicities/complications by organ and severity, including acute/chronic
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and infection.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo image guided TMLI on days -9 to -5, receive etoposide intravenously (IV) on
      day -4 and cyclophosphamide IV on day -2, and undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem cell
      or bone marrow transplant on day 0.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.

             transplantation previously

             echocardiogram or MUGA scan showing abnormal wall motion or ejection fraction &lt; 50%

             planned study enrollment

          -  Patients with other active malignancies are ineligible for this study, other than
             localized malignancies
