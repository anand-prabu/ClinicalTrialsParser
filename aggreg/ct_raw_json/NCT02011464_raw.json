Is to assess the efficacy of pain control of Exparel vs. controls when injected into\n           the posterior capsular space after total knee arthroplasty\n\n        2. Asses the opioid use after Exparel vs. controls\n\n        3. Asses the time to simple and complex knee movement and ambulation.\n\n        4. The safety of Exparel will be assessed by the occurrence of all postsurgical adverse\n           events and serious adverse events through Day 30.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      After IRB approval, 20 subjects will be consented to participate in the study. The study\n      includes subjects undergoing total knee arthroplasty either under general or spinal\n      anesthesia. This study will include men and women (18 - 75 years) who have American Society\n      of Anesthesiologist physical classification status 1 - 3 and underwent total knee\n      arthroplasty.\n\n      Subjects will be divided into two groups, Group A (control) to receive 20ml of saline while\n      Group B (study) to receive 20ml of liposome bupivacaine into the posterior capsular space\n      during total knee arthroplasty. Patients from both groups will receive a femoral nerve block\n      with catheter placement for continuous infusion of local anesthetic. All subjects will have\n      access to rescue analgesics after surgery. Multimodal analgesia will supplement pain as per\n      standard care by the anesthesia team. Tylenol Orally 1g TID (not to exceed 4g in 24hrs),\n      oxycontin 10mg orally, twice/day, Celebrex 200 mg orally once a day and Percocet 5/325 prn\n      will serve as this multimodal approach. The time, day and number of requests for break\n      through (additional) analgesia will be noted by both anesthesia team and primary care team.\n      Pain scores will be assessed using a 0 - 10 numeric scale. Pain will be assessed for the\n      following intervals: hospital arrival, PACU arrival, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, hours later\n      and after hospital discharge 10 +/- 5 days after the block. Pain inquiries will assess both\n      posterior and anterior aspects of the knee. Pain at rest and for simple leg movements (knee\n      extension, straight leg raise) to fully ambulatory will be noted. These assessments will be\n      made in conjunction with rehab and physical therapy specialists."
