  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Maastricht III procedure consists of performing organ donation in patients in whom
      cardiac arrest is consecutive to a decision to withdraw life support.This MIII  procedure is
      not applied in France, in contrast with other industrialized countries.The proposed study is
      designed to evaluate the feasibility of adapting the MIII procedure in France by conducting
      a single-centre, prospective study. Within the population of patients admitted to the Nantes
      University Hospital Medical Intensive Care Unit for whom a clinical team meeting decides to
      withdraw life support, the investigators want to determine the delay elapsed between the
      life support withdrawing and the onset of spontaneous cardiac arrest, that is without any
      intentional procedure susceptible of precipitate the death onset. The cardiovascular state
      observed during this period and its duration determine the viability of the organs
      harvested. The invetigators also want to determine the incidence of refusal of organ
      donation that would be formulated by the family and/or loved ones if they had been asked to
      consent to an MIII procedure at the time of announcement of the clinical team's decision to
      withdraw life support.Anonymous data concerning the patient will be collected by using a
      predefined grid, completed partly by the medical team in charge of the patient and partly by
      a CRA from data in the patient's medical file.The study with families and/or loved ones will
      be conducted in the context of the CHU de NANTES Clinical Ethics Unit and according to this
      unit's methodology. The main working tool used by the Clinical Ethics Unit consists of
      interviews between its members and the various parties participating in elaboration of a
      decision (in this case, the virtual possibility of organ donation according to the MIII
      procedure).The purpose of this interview is to stimulate reflection on issues not previously
      considered, by introducing new elements and by using, as a tool, the principles of
      biomedical ethics developed by Beauchamps and Childress. This study should be able to
      determine which types of patients could be concerned by the Maastricht III procedure. The
      expected results should help to define the quantitative impact and feasibility of this
      procedure on organ donation and could be used to subsequently propose a larger-scale
      multicenter  prospective study.

    <description>The interventional nature of the study is justified by the need for particular monitoring of patients in whom life support is withdrawn following the clinical team's decision. The questions posed to the patient's family and/or relatives, do not modify the care provided to the patient.</description>
