  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Iron deficiency and vitamin D deficiencies are common in menstruating women. The present
      assay studied the influence of the consumption of a flavoured skimmed milk with iron (iron
      pyrophosphate) or with iron and vitamin D3 in iron deficient women on:

        -  Iron metabolism

        -  Biomarkers of bone remodelling

        -  Cardiovascular risk indexes
