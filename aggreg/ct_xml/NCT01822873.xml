  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study hypothesis is that patients with dry age-related macular degeneration experience
      visual function impairments such as defects in dark adaptation, glare intolerance, poor
      light transition and reading in low lighting conditions. Studies have shown that patients in
      the early phases of AMD with normal visual acuity commonly reported difficulty with these
      visual functions but there have been no systematic studies evaluating these deficits in this
      population.

      This prospective, exploratory study will include up to 130 patients with dry AMD and 60
      controls. These patients will undergo the following non-invasive visual function testing:

        -  microperimetry with eye tracking

        -  low luminance visual acuity

        -  specialized color vision (cone-specific)

        -  contrast testing and night vision testing.

      High-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SDOCT) images will be taken of
      the central retina using the Spectralis OCT unit. The values of visual function tested will
      be correlated with the findings on SDOCT (volume/amount of drusen present in early AMD).

      There are no known risks to the subjects beyond what is normal for standard examinations of
      the eye, visual function testing and standard ocular photographic procedures.

      This prospective,  exploratory study will be performed in multiple arms:

      A. Arm 1: a pilot study of  up to 40 patients (30 patients with dry age-related macular
      degeneration and 10 normal age-matched controls) in order to test 1) the feasibility  of
      performing the visual function tests in this population and 2) test/retest reliability over
      1-2 months. If the pilot study reveals that the visual function tests proposed are feasible
      and have high reliability, the larger study (Phase 2) will be subsequently performed.

      B. Arm 2: a study of up to 150 patients (100 dry AMD patients and 50 controls) with the goal
      of evaluating the changes in visual function in dry AMD as compared to age-matched control
      subjects. Study will include patients determined on examination have dry AMD as well as
      age-matched normal control subjects without dry AMD.  If two eyes satisfy the inclusion
      criteria, both eyes will be tested.

      The patients first will undergo microperimetry testing, which incorporates an eye tracker
      that operates independently of the microperimeter and is able to compare results with a
      reference database of normal subjects. A Line Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope (SLO) is used to
      capture confocal images of the retina. Using the SLO image, the operator can see the area to
      test.  For follow-up examinations, the same area will be tested and the machine generates a
      report on change from previous examination. The test takes approximately 5 minutes.

      Patients will then undergo low luminance visual acuity using a computer-based test followed
      by cone specific vision testing.  The cone contrast test (CCT) is a computer-based color
      test that rapidly identifies type (red, green, or blue) and severity (mild, moderate, and
      severe) of color deficiency, quantifies color performance, and allows early detection of
      acquired color deficiency.  The automated test takes approximately 5 minutes to complete for
      all three cone tones; studies have shown impairment in blue and green cones in AMD. The
      system also provides tests for low contrast sensitivity, night vision (simulate low lighting
      conditions, with darker background).

      Using computerized visual acuity charts, the patients will also be tested for contrast
      sensitivity. The duration of each test can vary but typically lasts for 10-15 minutes.

      Follow-up visual function testing will be performed at different timepoints depending on the
      Arm of the study: at 1-2 months for Arm 1 and approximately 3, 6 and 9 months for Arm 2
      using the same protocol, based on standard of care clinic visits.

        Subjects will be identified from patients of the Duke Eye Center presenting for
        ophthalmologic consultation. Patients with dry AMD are routinely available from this
        clinic and will be the primary study group.
