A subject of clinical urgency for\n      researchers, clinicians, patients, and health care underwriters such as Medicare, is the\n      role of allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT) in the treatment of older\n      patients with higher risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).  The use of reduced intensity\n      conditioning (RIC) regimens has extended HCT to the care of older patients with acute\n      myelogenous leukemia (AML) and lymphoma and a number of retrospective and phase II trials\n      for patients with MDS now show the curative potential of RIC alloHCT in selected patients.\n\n      This protocol is designed evaluate the relative benefits of RIC alloHCT compared to\n      non-transplant therapies focusing on overall survival.   This will be done by having\n      patients biologically assigned to the alloHCT arm or the hypomethylating therapy/best\n      supportive care arm and following them for survival at 3 years."

Patients with de novo MDS who have, or have previously had, Intermediate-2 or\n                  High risk disease as determined by the International Prognostic Scoring System\n                  (IPSS).  Current Intermediate-2 or High risk disease is NOT a requirement.\n\n               2. Patients must have fewer than 20% marrow blasts at the time (within 30 days) of\n                  registration and consent.\n\n               3. Patients may have received prior therapy for the treatment of MDS, including but\n                  not limited to: growth factor, transfusion support, immunomodulatory (IMID)\n                  therapy, DNA hypomethylating therapy or cytotoxic chemotherapy prior to trial\n                  registration.\n\n               4.

Patients are eligible if no formal unrelated donor search has been activated\n                  prior to enrollment.  Patients who have started a sibling donor search or who\n                  have found a matched sibling donor are eligible.\n\n               7. Patients and physicians must be willing to comply with treatment assignment:\n\n                    1. No intent to proceed with alloHCT using donor sources not specified in this\n                       protocol, including Human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-mismatched related or\n                       unrelated donors < 6/6 HLA related matched or < 8/8 HLA unrelated matched)\n                       or umbilical cord blood unit(s).\n\n                    2. No intent to use myeloablative conditioning regimens.\n\n                    3. Intent to proceed with RIC alloHCT if a matched sibling or matched\n                       unrelated donor is identified.  There is no requirement as to the timing of\n                       the transplantation.\n\n               8.

Specific testing for organ function is not required for\n                  eligibility but, if available, these tests should be used to judge eligibility.\n\n               9. Signed informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with the following will be ineligible for registration onto this study:\n\n               1.

Concurrent malignancy other than superficial squamous cell or basal cell\n                  carcinoma of the skin\n\n               5. Prior autologous or allogeneic HCT\n\n               6.
