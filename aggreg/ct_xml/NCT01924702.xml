      The purpose of this study is to determine if non-invasive electrical brain stimulation can
      enhance the outcome of intensive language therapy in chronic aphasia.

    <textblock>
      Stroke is the leading cause of death and disability worldwide. Given the increasing average
      lifespan worldwide, the incidence and prevalence of patients with stroke will dramatically
      increase in the future. One of the most frequent and devastating conditions after stroke is
      aphasia, which affects language production and comprehension. High-frequent intensive
      speech-and-language therapy is currently the treatment of choice in chronic aphasia.
      However, despite its general effectiveness, treatment effect sizes are only low to moderate.
      Thus, there is a pressing need to explore novel training-adjuvant therapies to enhance
      treatment efficacy. Moreover, very little is known about the neurobiology of
      treatment-induced recovery in chronic aphasia. This is the prerequisite to improve existing
      and/or develop new treatment paradigms.

      Thus, in the present project the investigators aim to assess whether the outcome of
      intensive language training can be enhanced by adjuvant non-invasive brain stimulation. They
      will be using anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (atDCS) that has previously
      been shown to enhance (a) language and motor learning in healthy subjects and (b) motor
      recovery in stroke patients. Specifically, in a longitudinal group comparison design, two
      matched groups of patients with chronic anomia will receive two weeks of intensive language
      training with or without atDCS. Treatment effects will be assessed immediately after the two
      week intervention period and several months after the end of the training. The Investigators
      will also use functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to elucidate
      language network changes in the two groups.
