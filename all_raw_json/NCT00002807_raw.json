Patients are stratified by center, tumor\n      grade (1 vs 2 vs 3), surgical staging (yes vs no), and sexual health assessment (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients undergo laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy or total abdominal hysterectomy\n      and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. After surgery, patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo observation alone.\n\n        -  Arm II: Beginning within 12 weeks (preferably within 6-8 weeks) after surgery, patients\n           undergo radiotherapy 5 days a week for 5 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity. Protocol-defined brachytherapy is allowed.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at 16-18 weeks after surgery (arm I) or 5 and 9\n      weeks after initiating radiotherapy (arm II); and then at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 60\n      months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 400 patients will be accrued for this study."
