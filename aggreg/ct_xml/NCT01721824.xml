  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study, is to evaluate the effect of the Sherpa method (a supported
      employment intervention) on employment or education, when given to people with onset
      affective disorders or anxiety disorders who are not likely to be able to return to work
      within three month.

      The hypothesis is that the Sherpa method is associated with a shorter recovery period and
      more people returning to work or education, compared to treatment as usual.

      Background: The Sherpa method is a modified Individual Placement and Support (IPS)
      intervention, aiming at supporting people with affective disorders or anxiety disorders
      regain their workability and return to work or education. Previous studies have showed, that
      IPS has an effect on employment when offered to people with severe mental illness. Further
      studies are crucial to demonstrate whether the modified IPS, the Sherpa method, has an
      effect when offered to people with affective disorders or anxiety disorders who are not yet
      chronified.

      Methods/design:The trial design is a randomized, assessor-blinded, clinical trial of the
      Sherpa method in addition to treatment as usual compared to treatment as usual alone for 434
      participants diagnosed with an affective disorder or anxiety disorder, living in the Capital
      Region of Denmark. The primary outcome is competitive employment or education. Secondary
      outcomes are days of competitive employment or education, disease symptoms, level of
      functioning, quality of life, empowerment, number and duration of hospital admissions and
      out-patient treatment at follow-up 12 and 24 months after baseline.

    <description>During the first 6 months participants are usually offered 3 meetings with their mentor per month, lasting approximately 1 1/2 hours each. The following 6 months they are offered 1 meeting per month, lasting approximately 1 hour. The estimated duration of the Sherpa intervention is 12 months, but since the needs of the participants are very individual, this may vary.</description>
