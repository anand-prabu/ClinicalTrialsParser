Patients are stratified according to response to prior\n      chemotherapy (chemosensitive at least 60 days after prior therapy vs chemoresistant less\n      than 60 days after or progression during prior therapy).\n\n      Patients receive oral temozolomide once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21. Treatment repeats every\n      28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed prior to each course of chemotherapy, at 30 days after study\n      completion, and then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days and then every 8 weeks thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37-79 patients (14-33 chemosensitive and 23-46 chemoresistant)\n      will be accrued for this study."
