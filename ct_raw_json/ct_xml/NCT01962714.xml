  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randized controlled trial will assess whether a novel CAM intervention, Loving-kindness
      Meditation (LKM), is not meaningfully inferior to another group-based PTSD treatment ,
      Cognitive Processing Therapy (Cognitive Only version; CPT-C) for reductions in PTSD and
      depressive symptoms. 170 male and female Veterans with current PTSD will be randomized to
      LKM or CPT-C. We hypothesize that Veterans randomized to LKM will report mean reductions in
      PTSD and depressive symptom severity that are not meaningfully worse than CPT-C. We further
      hypothesize that reductions in posttraumatic maladaptive beliefs will more strongly mediate
      PTSD and depressive symptom improvement for those assigned to CPT-C than those assigned to
      LKM.

      Aim 1: Evaluate if LKM is non-inferior to CPT-C in producing reductions in PTSD symptoms
      among Veterans with current PTSD. Aim 2: Evaluate the non-inferiority of LKM and CPT-C in
      producing reductions in depressive symptoms among Veterans with current PTSD.   Exploratory
      Aim: Evaluate potential mediators of response to LKM and to CPT to provide preliminary
      information regarding whether they are consistent with the mechanisms of change
      conceptualized by each intervention to be associated with improvement in PTSD and
      depression.

      Methods:  A randomized controlled non-inferiority trial comparing LKM to CPT-C. In the
      proposed project 170 Veterans with PTSD will be randomized to LKM or CPT-C.  Comprehensive
      assessments will be performed at baseline as well as at the end of the 12-week interventions
      and 3 and 6 months later.  PTSD symptoms, depression, posttraumatic maladaptive cognitions
      and self-compassion will be assessed weekly during the treatment phase to assess temporality
      of change and to assess mediators of outcomes.
