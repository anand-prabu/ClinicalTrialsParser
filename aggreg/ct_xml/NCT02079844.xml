    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether cognitive impairment associated with
      schizophrenia is attenuated by add-on roflumilast administration to second generation
      antipsychotics (SGA) in participants with stable schizophrenia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called roflumilast. Roflumilast is being tested as an
      add-on treatment to second generation antipsychotics (SGA) to treat cognitive impairment in
      people with stable schizophrenia. This study will look at improvement in cognitive
      impairment associated with schizophrenia in people who take roflumilast as an add-on to SGA.

      The study will enroll approximately 22 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of three treatment groups—which will remain
      undisclosed to the patient and study doctor during the study (unless there is an urgent
      medical need)  All participants will receive the following treatments at different periods
      throughout the study:

        -  Roflumilast Dose A + SGA

        -  Roflumilast Dose B +SGA

        -  Placebo (dummy inactive pill) - this is a tablet that looks like the study drug but has
           no active ingredient + SGA.

      All participants will be asked to take one tablet at the same time each day throughout the
      study.

      This single-centre trial will be conducted in the United Kingdom. The overall time to
      participate in this study is up to 64 days. Participants will make 2 screening visits to the
      clinic and then must be brought to the clinic every day for dosing during each of 3
      Treatment Periods. Each Treatment Period will be 8 days in duration. All participants will
      also make 1 final visit 14 days after last dose of study drug for a follow-up assessment.

    <description>The Spatial Span test assesses the participants working memory. During this task, participants are presented with a board containing blue blocks randomly arranged. The rater first taps out a pattern of blocks, beginning with two blocks and increasing with participant proficiency, and the participant is tasked with tapping the same pattern. After discontinuation of this part of the subtest, the participant is then tasked with tapping out the reverse pattern after the rater's demonstration. These patterns also begin with two blocks and increase with participant proficiency. The total score for this subtest ranges from 0 to 32.</description>

    <description>Brain electrical activity changes will be quantified with electroencephalogram (EEG) battery tests.
The P300 occurs after the presentation of a novel, behaviorally relevant target stimulus embedded among irrelevant stimuli. It reflects allocation of attention and activation of immediate memory.
The amplitude of P300 indexes brain actions when the mental representation of the stimulus environment is updated, while its latency indexes stimulus classification speed unrelated to response selection processes. The participants are instructed to push a button when hearing the target stimulus, but not when hearing the standard. They are asked to press the button as fast as possible.</description>
