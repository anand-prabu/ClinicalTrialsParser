Secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed at\n      baseline, week 12 and 52 and will be quantified based on the following: Neurological\n      assessment of the MS functional composite assessment which comprises of Expanded Disability\n      Status Scale (EDSS), the expanded EDSS (Rating Neurologic Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis,\n      the Scripps neurological rating scale (NRS), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT),\n      the nine-hole peg test, and 25-foot walking time.
