ABI results\n      from traumatic or non-traumatic brain injury due to internal or external source (e.g.\n      infection, brain tumor, hypoxia). Preclinical studies regarding cell therapy in animal\n      models of ABI showed improvements of neurological dysfunction. UCB possess various stem or\n      progenitor cells and is known to secrete neurotrophic factors to repair injured brain. This\n      clinical research aims to determine the safety and efficacy of allogeneic UCB for patients\n      with ABI."
