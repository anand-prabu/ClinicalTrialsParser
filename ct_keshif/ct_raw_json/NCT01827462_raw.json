This project will use state-of-the-art technology developed by the Stanford\n      Human Immune Monitoring Center to survey older individuals for signs of immune system aging\n      and to gather information about the factors associated with the decline of immune function."

            "textblock": "At the initial study visit each year, volunteers will provide information about their\n      current health and health history.  Vital signs will be assesed and the volunteer will be\n      immunized with the current licensed seasonal influenza vaccine.   Follow-up visits will be\n      conducted on Day 6-8 and Day 28, with a phone call at 6 months post-immunization.  A blood\n      sample will be collected pre-immunization and at each follow-up visit.  Volunteers will be\n      followed for up to 8 years.\n\n      Our main effort will be to survey elderly and younger control subject responses to influenza\n      vaccination using our functional cellular array technology.  We will compare these results\n      with serum antibody responses from day 28 blood samples measuring hemagglutination\n      inhibition (HAI) titers against the vaccination strains.  This is the accepted standard for\n      determining whether there is an effective antibody response to influenza vaccine antigens.\n      In addition, we will follow-up subjects yearly by phone to ask whether they have experienced\n      any influenza-like illness episodes or serious adverse events following immunization.  In\n      this way, we will be able to correlate the accepted standard assay for an appropriate\n      antibody response to influenza vaccination with our new assay, and also begin what we hope\n      will be a valuable longitudinal study of immune responsiveness in the elderly.\n\n      We also think that there will be a T-cell array \"signature\" of immune senescence both in\n      terms of the number of responding cells and their cytokine profile that will both allow a\n      more rapid read-out of this condition (day 6-8 after vaccination) and give some mechanistic\n      clues regarding this phenomenon.  In addition, we want to obtain as much information as\n      possible with these samples and thus propose to do the following assays:\n\n        -  Subject Analysis - We will use fluorescence activated cell sorting to determine the\n           precise number of each white blood cell type in a given patient sample and their\n           activation state (B cells, T cells, NK cells, gamma-delta T cells, monocytes, dendritic\n           cells).  We are particularly interested in whether the reports of increased CD8+CD28- T\n           cells or decreased gamma-delta T cells  correlate with immunosenescence.  This subset\n           analysis also will be important for normalizing the gene expression data.\n\n        -  Gene Expression Analysis- We will collect part of the blood sample in a PAX gene tube\n           and prepare probes from the mRNA for gene expression analysis using Agilent microarrays\n           that survey global gene expression.  This will tell us if there is a particular \"gene\n           expression signature\" that correlates with immune senescence.\n\n        -  Serum Cytokine Analysis - As there have been reports of changes in the serum cytokine\n           repertoire in older people, we will survey serum samples for 26 different cytokines\n           using the Panomics/Luminex system now running the Human Immune Monitoring Center at\n           Stanford.\n\n        -  Monocyte Activation Potential - As antigen presentation capacity may also be a variable\n           influencing the robustness of the adaptive immune response, in Year 1 we examined\n           circulating monocytes as a source of antigen presenting cells. We examined the\n           potential of these cells to respond to in vitro activating stimuli ( cytokines and LPS)\n           as measured by expression of cell surface activation markers (DR, CD86, CD40) and\n           intracellular phosphoproteins ( eg. pp38, pSTATs). Expression of these markers was\n           measured by FACS analysis."
