Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as oxaliplatin,\n      irinotecan hydrochloride, leucovorin calcium, fluorouracil, and gemcitabine hydrochloride,\n      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells.\n      Giving combination chemotherapy together with radiation therapy before surgery may make the\n      tumor smaller and reduce the amount of normal tissue that needs to be removed. Giving\n      chemotherapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery."
