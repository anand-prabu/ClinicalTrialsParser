  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile (rate and the
      amount of nicotine absorbed) following a single use of the THS 2.2 compared to the PK
      profiles from a single use of a conventional cigarette (CC) and from a single use of
      nicotine gum in a Japanese population.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is Japanese.
