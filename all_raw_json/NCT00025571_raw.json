Photosensitizing drugs such as HPPH are absorbed by tumor cells\n      and, when exposed to light, become active and kill the tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of photodynamic therapy with HPPH in\n      treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients undergo laser light therapy via\n      bronchoscopy on day 3.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of HPPH until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-17 patients will be accrued for this study within 2\n      years."
