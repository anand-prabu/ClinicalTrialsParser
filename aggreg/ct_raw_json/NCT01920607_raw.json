In the event of failure of\n      conservative treatments, surgery can help improve continence problems in a significant\n      number of cases.\n\n      Sacral nerve stimulation is currently the standard surgical treatment for severe anal\n      incontinence when sphincter repair (sphincteroplasty) is not recommended.\n\n      A new method of treatment based on sphincter reinforcement through the implanting of a band\n      of magnetic beads*, has proved to be reliable and efficient on a small series of cases,\n      particularly after the failure of sacral nerve stimulation.\n\n      The aim of our trial, which compares the \"magnetic anal sphincter* and sacral nerve\n      stimulation\" in a homogeneous population of patients affected by severe anal incontinence is\n      to define the position of this new approach in the treatment algorithm of this functional\n      disorder, determining its clinical and medical/economic advantages compared to those of the\n      current standard treatment.\n\n      * FenixTM (Torax Medical)"
