The primary endpoint is the mean\n      change from baseline in morning peak expiratory flow (PEF) over the 12 week treatment\n      period. Safety assessments include adverse events, vital signs, oral and oropharyngeal\n      candidiasis, hematological, biochemical tests), 24-hour urinary cortisol and 12-lead ECG.\n      The steady-state plasma pharmacokinetics of fluticasone propionate inhalation solution will\n      also be assessed."
