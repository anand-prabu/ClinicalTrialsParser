        gastric outlet obstruction iv) intra-abdominal abscess. Note: Complete resolution of an
        intra-abdominal abscess must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib
        even if the abscess occurred more that 6 months ago.

                  wound healing complications or within 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib
                  if there were wound complications (particularly when associated with delayed or
                  incomplete healing) within 28 days. Note: Complete healing following abdominal
                  surgery must be confirmed prior to initiating treatment with cabozantinib even
                  if surgery occurred more that 28 days ago.

          -  Other disorders associated with a high risk of fistula formation including PEG tube
             placement within 3 months before the first dose of study therapy or concurrent
             evidence of intraluminal tumor involving the trachea and esophagus.

          -  Concurrent malignancy except for treated non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical
             carcinoma in situ.

          -  The subject requires chronic concomitant treatment of strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g.,
