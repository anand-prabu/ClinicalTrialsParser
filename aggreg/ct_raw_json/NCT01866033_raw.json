Participants will fast overnight for at least 10 hours prior to study drug\n      dosing. Participants will stay in the study center for pharmacokinetic sampling. Serial\n      pharmacokinetic samples will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after dosing and\n      safety will be monitored throughout the study."
