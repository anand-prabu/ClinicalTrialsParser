The study objective is to evaluate severe\n      hypoglycemia or documented symptomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycemic events reported as\n      adverse events. The study will begin after the study approval by ethics committee. All\n      patients with type 2 diabetes on acarbose or metformin monotherapy and prescribed Glucobay M\n      will be included in study after taking the informed consent. Patients will be observed for\n      up to 24 weeks (2 weeks).The study involves general examination of patients, collection of\n      data like history of disease, concomitant medication, drug dose etc. The study is planned to\n      enroll 10000 subjects from multiple study centers spread across India. The study data will\n      be analyzed with appropriate statistical methods."
