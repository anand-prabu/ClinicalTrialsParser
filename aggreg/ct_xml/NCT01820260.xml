        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be competent to understand the nature of the trial and provide informed
             consent

          -  Part 1: Subjects with 5 to 20 clinically typical, visible and discrete AKs on the
             face Part 2: Subjects with 5 to 20 clinically typical, visible and discrete AKs on
             either the face, the balding scalp (the balding part of the scalp should be at least
             25 cm2) or a contiguous area of approximately  250 cm2 on the chest

          -  Subject at least 18 years of age

          -  Female subjects must be of either:

               1. Non-childbearing potential, i.e. post-menopausal or have a confirmed clinical
                  history of sterility (e.g. the subject is without a uterus) or,

               2. Childbearing potential, provided there is a confirmed negative urine pregnancy
                  test prior to trial treatment, to rule out pregnancy

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential1 must be willing to use effective
             contraception at trial entry and until completion

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Location of the treatment area (full face, full balding scalp or chest)

               -  within 5 cm of an incompletely healed wound,

               -  within 10 cm of a suspected basal cell carcinoma (BCC) or squamous cell
                  carcinoma (SCC

          -  Prior treatment with ingenol mebutate gel within the treatment area

          -  Lesions in the treatment areas that have:

               -  atypical clinical appearance (e.g., hypertrophic, hyperkeratotic or cutaneous
                  horns) and/or,

               -  recalcitrant disease (e.g., did not respond to cryotherapy on two previous
                  occasions

          -  History or evidence of skin conditions other than the trial indication that would
             interfere with the evaluation of the trial medication (e.g., eczema, unstable
             psoriasis, xeroderma pigmentosum)

          -  Use of cosmetic or therapeutic products and procedures which could interfere with the
             assessments of the treatment areas.

          -  Clinical diagnosis/history or evidence of any medical condition that would expose a
             subject to an undue risk of a significant AE or interfere with assessments of safety
             and efficacy during the course of the trial, as determined by the investigator's
             clinical judgment

          -  Any abnormal laboratory tests that are medically significant and would impact the
             safety of the subjects or the interpretation of the trial results, as determined by
             the investigator's judgment

          -  Anticipated need for hospitalisation or out-patient surgery during the first 15 days
             after the first trial medication application. Note that cosmetic/therapeutic
             procedures are not excluded if they fall outside of the criteria detailed in
             Prohibited Therapies or Medications

          -  Known sensitivity or allergy to any of the ingredients in ingenol mebutate gel

          -  Presence of acute sunburn within the treatment areas

          -  Current enrolment or participation in an investigational clinical trial within 30
             days of entry into this trial.

          -  Subjects previously assigned to treatment in Part 1 or rand

          -  Female subjects who are breastfeeding.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject is unlikely to comply with the
             Clinical Study Protocol (e.g. alcoholism, drug dependency or psychotic state)
