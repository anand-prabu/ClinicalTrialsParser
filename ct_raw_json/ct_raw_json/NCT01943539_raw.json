The study examines two\n      populations, children diagnosed with ADHD (ADHD and not on medication) and neuro-typical\n      children.  The investigators plan to evaluate 80 subjects (N = 40 per group) in three site\n      locations over a 29 day study period. The 29 day study period includes 2 in-clinic sessions\n      and 27 days of out-patient game play.  During the 27 days of out-patient game play, the\n      subjects will be instructed to play EVO 5 days per week for typically 30 minutes per day\n\n      The investigators' hypothesis is that EVO will be playable and interesting to ADHD children\n      and cognitive measures, as captured by EVO, will show a difference between ADHD children and\n      age-matched neuro-typical children."
