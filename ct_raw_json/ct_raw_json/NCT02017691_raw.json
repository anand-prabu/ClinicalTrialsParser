In addition during the first\n      15 minutes NIRS measurements will be recorded. crSO2 measurements in addition SpO2\n      measurements will be used to guide supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support\n      during the first 15 minutes after birth. Control group: Only SpO2 measurements will be used\n      to guide supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support during the first 15 minutes\n      after birth.\n\n      Hypothesis: Supplemental oxygen support and respiratory support guided by crSO2 and SpO2\n      measurements will reduce the time in % minutes of crSO2 <10th or >90th centile in preterm\n      neonates during the first 15 minutes after birth\n\n      Outcome Parameter: Primary outcome parameter will be duration in % minute of crSO2 <10th or\n      >90th centile."
