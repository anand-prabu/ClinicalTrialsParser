New or recurrent non-fatal coronary artery disease (myocardial infarction and unstable angina pectoris)
Cardiac failure requiring hospitalization
Arteriosclerotic disease requiring hospitalization (aortic aneurysm, aortic dissection, and arteriosclerosis obliterans)
Renal impairment (development of microalbuminuria, progression to overt proteinuria, or overt proteinuria [≥ 300 mg/gCr], confirmed by two consecutive laboratory tests performed after the initiation of study treatments; doubling of serum creatinine level; and progression to ESRD)

    <description>Febuxostat will be taken once daily after breakfast (generally within 30 minutes after eating) but can be taken around the time of breakfast even if no food has been eaten. When the dose is to be increased, the principal or sub-investigator will carry out any required examinations and tests as needed.
The starting dose of the investigational product (febuxostat) will be 10 mg/day.
The dose will be increased to 20 mg/day at Week 4.
The aim is to increase the dose to 40 mg/day at Week 8.</description>
