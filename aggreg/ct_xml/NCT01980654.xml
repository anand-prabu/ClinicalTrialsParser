  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib when combined with rituximab (determined by the overall response rate [ORR]) in previously untreated subjects with FL.</measure>
    <time_frame>When last subject enrolled has completed 3 years of study follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects in Arm 1 will have imaging efficacy assessments every 12 weeks for the first 8 assessments and then every 16 weeks thereafter.
Subjects in Arm 2 will have imaging efficacy assessments at the end of 8 weeks and then every 12 weeks thereafter for 8 assessments and then every 16 weeks thereafter.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in subjects with FL as assessed by the duration of response (DOR).</measure>
    <time_frame>When last subject enrolled has completed 3 years of study follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>DOR is defined as the interval between the date of the first documented response (CR, PR) and the date of the first documented evidence of progressive disease (PD) or death.  DOR will be analyzed for the subjects who achieve an overall response during the duration of study.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in subjects with FL as assessed by progression free survival (PFS).</measure>
    <time_frame>When last subject enrolled has completed 3 years of study follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PFS is defined as the time interval between the date of the first dose and the date of the earliest occurrence of PD or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the efficacy of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in subjects with FL as assessed by overall survival (OS).</measure>
    <time_frame>When last subject enrolled has completed 3 years of study follow-up</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects will be followed for survival information up to three years after the last dose of study treatment, until new treatment or death, whichever occurs first. OS is defined as the duration of time from the date of the first dose to the date of death from any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To evaluate the safety and tolerability of ibrutinib combined with rituximab in previously untreated subjects with FL</measure>
