The results obtained during pre-clinical study,\n      both in laboratory and in experimental animals, suggest that nanostructured artificial human\n      corneas could help to treat various corneal diseases that occur with any substance loss or\n      serious structural alteration, with no relevant side effects."

In an initial phase, will be included 5 patients sequentially (be\n      subjected to the experimental treatment), with a month and a half safety period between\n      patients.\n\n      At random, 5 of these patients will be implanted cornea and 10 control patients will receive\n      conventional treatment of corneal trophic ulcers in advanced stages.\n\n      The study population consists of patients with corneal trophic ulcers refractory to\n      conventional treatment attending the ophthalmology departments involved in this research\n      project.\n\n      It is estimated that the inclusion period is approximately 24 months, and a follow-up period\n      of 24 months for each patient. Thus the total duration of the study will be about 48 months\n      from the inclusion of the first patient until the end of the follow-up period of the last\n      patient included.\n\n      To all patients enrolled in the trial, assigned to the experimental group will proceed to be\n      implanted an anterior lamellar nanostructured artificial cornea with allogeneic cells from\n      dead donors and biomaterials.\n\n      The implant of this Advanced Therapy drug will cover defects or structural alterations\n      existing in the affected cornea.
