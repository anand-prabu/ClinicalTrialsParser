      Primary Objective:

      In the dose escalation: to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of SAR125844.

      In the expansion cohort: to evaluate the preliminary anti-tumoral effect of SAR125844.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To characterize and confirm the global safety profile of SAR125844 including cumulative
      toxicities.

      To assess preliminary antitumor activity of SAR125844. To explore the pharmacodynamic
      effects (PDy) of SAR125844. To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of SAR125844. To explore
      the relationship of MET gene amplification status with anti-tumor effects.

      To evaluate other pharmacodynamic biomarkers.

      For both cohorts, escalation and expansion, the duration of the study for one patient will
      include a period for inclusion of up to 3 weeks and a 4-week treatment cycle(s).The patient
      may continue treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or willingness to
      stop, followed by a minimum of 30-days follow-up.

      If a patient treated in dose escalation part or in an expansion cohort, continues to benefit
      from the treatment at the time of Clinical Study Report, the patient can continue study
      treatment for a maximum of 1 year and will continue to undergo all assessments as per the
      study flowchart. Such patients will be followed at least until 30 days after the last IMP
      administration.
