The study begins once participation in the study is confirmed by\n      the physician and informed consent/assent is obtained from the patient and/or guardian.\n      Concurrent participation in the BAT patient registry (BT-010) is encouraged to collect\n      safety and clinical outcome data.\n\n      Assessments: One 5 mL of blood collected to yield 2 mL serum sample will be collected\n      post-BAT administration.  The blood sample should be collected no later than 24 hours post\n      BAT administration. To ensure sufficient detectable circulating levels of BAT for\n      pharmacokinetic analysis the target window of time for collection should be between 6 and 24\n      hours post-BAT administration.\n\n      Pharmacokinetic or Efficacy Parameters: The serum concentration(s) obtained will be modeled\n      using a population pharmacokinetic approach based on a previously developed model for BAT\n      serotypes A-G in healthy adult human subjects.\n\n      Individual Bayesian Pharmacokinetics parameters (i.e. clearance (CL), volume of distribution\n      (Vc), volume of distribution of the central and the peripheral compartments (Vp)) and\n      corresponding exposure metrics will be derived from the population analysis.\n\n      Primary Endpoints: The primary endpoint is the dosage level at which pharmacokinetic\n      equivalence is reached i.e. the dosage at which BAT is most effective against the symptoms\n      of botulism. Following the estimation of exposure in pediatric patients, and similar to what\n      was done for adult subjects, the margin of efficacy for 90% survival will be estimated in\n      order to verify the appropriateness of the administered pediatric dose."
