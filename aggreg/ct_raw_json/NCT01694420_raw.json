            "textblock": "This is a multicenter, single arm, 48-week open-label study of FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF\n      [Stribild] in acute HIV infection. Study sites will be members of the Duke-UNC Acute HIV\n      Infection Study Consortium. Participants will be enrolled for 96 weeks. Clinical care and\n      study drug (ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF) will be provided for the first 48 weeks. After week 48,\n      clinical care but not study drug will be provided through week 96. A study participant\n      suppressed at week 48 can continue on FDC ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF.\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that once daily fixed-dose combination elvitegravir (ELV),\n      cobicistat (COBI), emtricitabine (FTC), and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) will rapidly\n      reduce viral replication to <50 copies RNA/ml in participants with acute HIV infection. The\n      secondary hypotheses to be considered are 1) virologic response rates as measured by plasma\n      HIV RNA levels will be non-inferior or superior to a historical group of participants from\n      the PHI cohort treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, 2) compared to historical controls treated with\n      EFV/FTC/TDF, plasma HIV RNA will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with\n      ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 3) compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF, immune\n      activation as measured by the proportion CD4+ and CD8+ cells expressing HLA-DR and CD38+\n      will decrease more rapidly in PHI participants treated with ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF, 4)in a subset\n      of participants samples will be obtained from compartments such as the gastrointestinal\n      tract, and lymphoid tissues to assess changes over time in parameters such as HIV-1 RNA,\n      immunologic responses to HIV, and tissue and anatomic reservoirs. We hypothesize that\n      treatment with the ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will demonstrate improved viral clearance in these\n      compartments as compared to historical controls treated with EFV/FTC/TDF. 5) in a subset of\n      participants who remain suppressed on therapy, resting CD4 cells with replication-competent\n      HIV-1 (latent reservoir) will be quantitated and compared to similar measurements in PHI\n      participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF.  In addition, we will compare these results to those\n      measured in HIV-1 infected participants treated and 6) ELV/COBI/FTC/TDF will be well\n      tolerated, and the proportion of participants who require treatment modification will be\n      less than that observed in participants treated with EFV/FTC/TDF."
