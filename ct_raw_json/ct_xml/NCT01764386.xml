  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 3b study is to assess the effects of combination therapy with
      naltrexone SR/bupropion SR (NB) used in conjunction with a comprehensive lifestyle
      intervention (CLI) and in a manner consistent with its intended use after marketing
      approval, on body weight and cardiovascular risk factors compared to the effects of Usual
      Care in subjects who are overweight with dyslipidemia and/or controlled hypertension or
      obese. At Week 26, subjects originally assigned to Usual Care switch to treatment with NB
      and CLI, and subjects assigned to NB and CLI continue treatment for the duration of the
      study (78-weeks treatment period).
