      Assess the safety and efficacy of VNS paired with tones for tinnitus using a randomized,
      controlled, parallel study design.

    <textblock>
      Patients who have moderate to severe tinnitus, at least one year post diagnosis, may enroll.
       All patients will be implanted and randomized to one of two groups:

        -  a group receiving VNS paired with tones and;

        -  a group that receives VNS and tones, but with different settings.

      After device use training, therapy is delivered at home by the patient for 6 weeks.
      Patients have eight baseline audiometric assessments along with two questionnaire
      assessments, an assessment after recovery before treatment starts, and tinnitus assessments
      every two weeks during therapy through the 6 week randomized portion of the study.  After
      the randomized portion, all patients receive VNS paired with tones.  Patients will continue
      to return for quarterly visits and tinnitus assessments through the first year after
      implant, regardless of their therapy status.  Interested patients can continue to receive
      longer-term treatment after the first year.  A goal of up to 30 patients enrolled and
      implanted across four sites is planned for this study.

          9. Any other form of tinnitus treatments (e.g. Herbal medication, acupuncture or
             chiropractic medicine) are not allowed during the study.

         10. Any drug known to mimic, increase or decrease release or removal of a diffuse
             neuromodulator, such as norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin, benzodiazepines, and

         11. Significant cardiac history

         12. Use of any medication known to cause or increase tinnitus, such as NSAIDS (ibuprofen,
             naproxen, nabumetone, etc.), aspirin and other salicylates, furosemide (Lasix) and
             other &quot;loop&quot; diuretics, &quot;mycin&quot; antibiotics such as vancomycin, quinine and related
             drugs, and chemotherapy agents such as cisplatin.
