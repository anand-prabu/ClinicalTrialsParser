  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of Dotarem®-enhanced MRI as
      compared to Gadovist®/ Gadavist®-enhanced MRI in the diagnosis of brain tumors in terms of
      overall lesion visualization and characterization (off-site assessment).

      270 patients will be randomized between 2 arms defining the sequence of administration of
      the contrast agents at the dose of 0.1mmol/kg, with a minimum of 48 hours and a maximum of
      14 days in between.

      Each patient will, therefore, receive two MRI during his/her participation in the study.

      The two arms consist in :

        -  Dotarem® in the first MRI, then Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the second MRI.

        -  Gadovist®/Gadavist® in the first MRI, then Dotarem® in the second MRI.

      Contrast-enhanced MRIs will be performed on 1.5 or 3 Tesla systems.

      MRI examinations will be evaluated centrally by blinded independent readers for the main
      evaluation criterion.

    <description>Overall lesion visualization and characterization, based on assessment of the primary or largest lesion if there is more than one lesion present, assessed by 3 independent off-site readers, based on a 4-point scale:
0. Poor: does not allow adequate visualization and characterization of the lesion; 1. Fair: allows partial visualization and characterization of the lesion ; 2. Good: allows adequate visualization and characterization of the lesion; 3. Excellent: allows excellent visualization and characterization of the lesion.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Female or male adult patient (patient having reached legal majority age)

          -  Patient with known or highly suspected primary intracranial tumors (intra-axial or
             extra-axial) detected by previous CT or MRI examination who are scheduled to undergo
             a routine contrast-enhanced MRI

          -  Female patient must have effective contraception throughout the study and must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test at inclusion, or be surgically sterilized, or
             post-menopausal (minimum 12 months of amenorrhea)

          -  Patient having provided his/her written informed consent to participate in the trial
             prior to any study-related procedure being conducted

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with rapidly evolving brain tumor that could change in appearance between the
             time of the two study MRI examinations.

          -  Patient undergoing current or recent treatment within past 6 weeks or scheduled for
             any treatment that could results in changes of lesion appearance between the two
             study examinations. This would include, but not restricted to, the following: current
             or recent radiation therapy, surgery, starting or recent chemotherapy.

             claustrophobia, infusion pumps, cochlear implants metallic or others according to the
             imaging site standard practice)

          -  Patient with known severely impaired renal function (defined as eGFR MDRD&lt; 30
             ml/min/1.73m2)

             contrast agent injection scheduled for the study and patient expected to receive any
             other contrast agent within 24 hours of the last study contrast agent injection

          -  Patient presenting with any condition which, based on the investigator's clinical
             judgment, would prevent the patient from completing all trial assessments and visits

          -  Patient under guardianship and/or unable or unwilling to cooperate with the
