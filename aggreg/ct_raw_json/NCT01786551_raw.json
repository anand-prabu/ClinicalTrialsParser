After a 12h fast, subjects will be assigned to a combination of oral\n      fat loading test (OFLT) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) (day 1), followed by a two\n      week treatment with 50 mg eplerenone. After two weeks, subjects will receive the second\n      OFLT/OGTT treatment (day 15). Starting 5 days prior to the first intervention (day1), the\n      participant's usual diet (ad lib) will be supplemented with 2 bullion broths each day.\n      Standardization of sodium intake is necessary as variations in dietary sodium intake may\n      affect outcome measures. We will evaluate the following parameters at day 1 and day 15 of\n      the study. Prior to OFLT/OGTT, and 2h, 4h thereafter we measure a parameter of vascular and\n      systemic inflammation: IL-6"
