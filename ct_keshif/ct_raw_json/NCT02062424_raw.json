The information will be\n      provided to the participants via leaflets and recipes.\n\n      After the baseline visit the subjects will be randomized to group A, B or C: In group A the\n      subjects will receive dietary advice, according to the specific IHD dietary guideline, in\n      group B the subjects will receive dietary advice according to the current national dietary\n      guidelines and in group C the subjects will be instructed to follow their normal dietary\n      habits."
