  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators recently conducted a double-blind, randomized controlled trial (n=60) of
      limited duration (12 weeks), and found that compared with placebo, oral mirtazapine, an
      FDA-approved antidepressant, significantly reduced meth use in those receiving mirtazapine,
      as determined by reduction in meth-positive urines.  Sexual risk behaviors also declined
      significantly in the mirtazapine arm compared to placebo. Mirtazapine decreased meth use
      despite low adherence: by medical event monitoring system (MEMS) caps, only 48.5% of daily
      doses were taken. All participants received weekly substance use counseling and monthly,
      brief clinician-delivered adherence counseling. The investigators propose expanding upon
      these results by lengthening the treatment period to 24 weeks, with adherence reminders
      added to the counseling, and determining if efficacy is sustained up to 12 weeks after drug
      discontinuation. The sample size for this 9-month study is 120.
