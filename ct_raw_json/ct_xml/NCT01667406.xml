  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infertility affects one in six couples in the UK and has devastating physical, social and
      emotional consequences for affected couples. In vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatment is now
      widely and successfully used to enable infertile couples to conceive. However, IVF treatment
      can result in the potentially life threatening condition, ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome
      (OHSS). Mild forms of OHSS occur in approximately 1 in 3 of all IVF cycles, whilst
      approximately 1 in 10 IVF cycles result in moderate or severe OHSS. OHSS is caused by the
      use of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) used in IVF treatment to stimulate oocyte (egg)
      maturation. Kisspeptin is a hormone which stimulates reproductive hormone secretion and is
      responsible for the release of reproductive hormones which result in oocyte maturation and
      ovulation (the release of an egg from the ovary). The significant advantage of kisspeptin
      over current treatments to stimulate ovulation, is that it would stimulate a more
      physiological increase in reproductive hormones and oocyte maturation during IVF treatment.
      The aims of this project are to investigate whether administration of kisspeptin to women
      can result in oocyte maturation.
