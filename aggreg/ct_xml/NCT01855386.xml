    <textblock>
      The thought is that Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) plays a key role in the
      progression to prediabetes/T2DM in those with a history of Gestational Diabetes (GDM). The
      investigators want to know if having a fatty liver will be connected with more glucose
      abnormalities (higher fasting/oral glucose tolerance test glucose, more insulin resistance)
      and that a history of GDM will be common in those with NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A liver ultrasound will be completed during the last trimester of pregnancy along with a
      questionnaire.  The questionnaire includes baseline maternal characteristics, age, race,
      ethnicity, parity, blood pressure, medications, activity level, sociodemographic and
      behavioral risk factors, pregravid BMI, previous obstetric history, medical and family
      history.

      The subject will come in person to clinic three times after the subject has had their baby
      (6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after childbirth) The Subject will give blood samples
      during the 6 weeks postpartum visit and 12 months postpartum visit.  The blood will be drawn
      by putting a needle into a vein in the subject's arm.  Each time, one small tube of blood
      will be taken. This will take about five minutes. The Investigators anticipate that the
      total volume of blood taken over the course of study from each subject will be around 110
      milliliters.

      The subject will have their blood pressure measured with a blood pressure cuff during each
      visit. The height, weight and pulse rate will also be measured. This will take about five
      minutes.

      The subject will have an ultrasound of her liver at the 6 week postpartum visit and 12 month
      postpartum visit.  This will take about 30 to 60 minutes.

      The subject's understanding and approval of these procedures is required if they are to
      participate in this study.

      The investigator's study coordinator will call the subject twice: 3 months and 9 months
      after the subject has had the baby. During each phone call, the study coordinator will ask
      the subject how the baby is being fed. The investigators will also update information about
      development of any new medical problems and medications the subject's doctor might have
      started.
