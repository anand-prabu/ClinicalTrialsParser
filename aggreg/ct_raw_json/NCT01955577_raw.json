The effect of treating proximal and distal intra-articulatio tibial fractures has\n      been positive until now.\n\n      Complications such as malunions, nonunions, re-fractures and extended time of ring fixation\n      will occur in 5-10% of all tibial fractures in patients treated with ring fixator. Factors\n      like trauma of soft tissue, smoking and compromised afflux of blood are associated with a\n      higher frequency of nonunion.\n\n      It has been documented that elderly people with hypovitaminosis D have a higher risk of\n      being affected by osteoporosis and fractures. Furthermore, there is a possible association\n      between the severity of fracture and hypovitaminosis. The time of fracture healing is also\n      extended compared to fractures in patients who are not affected by osteoporosis.\n\n      Until now research has not shown whether the fracture healing process is influenzed by\n      vitamin D."
