  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ginseng (American ginseng, Asian ginseng, Korean ginseng etc) is expected to show positive
      hypoglycemic effects, including improvements in glycated blood proteins[HbA1c], fasting
      glucose, fasting insulin, and the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance
      [HOMA-IR]).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ginseng has demonstrated to have significant hypoglycemic effect. Its major pharmacological
      component is considered to be ginsenosides. Several trials have been undertaken in diabetes
      some of which have demonstrated advantages in glycemic control in both diabetic as well as
      non diabetic individuals although clinical consistency of results is lacking.The lack of
      high quality data in this area to support diabetes recommendations represents an urgent call
      for stronger evidence. A systematic review and meta-analysis of controlled trials remains
      the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; of evidence for recommendations and clinical guidelines development.
      Therefore, investigators will conduct a systematic review and meta-analyses of controlled
      trials to assess the effect of ginseng on glycemic control.
