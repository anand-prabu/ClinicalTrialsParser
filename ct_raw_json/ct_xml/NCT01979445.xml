      There are two separate objectives in this study:

        1. to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic profile when patients treated with cangrelor are
           switched to oral prasugrel administered 30 min after cangrelor infusion is discontinued
           and

        2. to demonstrate the pharmacodynamic profile when patients treated with cangrelor are
           switched to clopidogrel 600mg administered during or immediately after the infusion.

         13. Any surgical or medical condition which, in the judgment of the Investigator, might
             interfere with the pharmacokinetics, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of the
             study drug (if applicable).

             5 half-lives, whichever is longer, prior to the administration of the drug, or
             planned use of investigational medicinal products or devices.
