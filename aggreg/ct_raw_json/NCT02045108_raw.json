To\n      this end, specific study purposes are: 1) replicate previous findings that cognitive\n      retraining reduces drinking levels, 2) test whether cognitive retraining can be enhanced\n      with tDCS, and 3) investigate the neural changes that result from cognitive retraining and\n      tDCS.  We hypothesize that those participants who receive alcohol avoidance cognitive\n      training will have greater reductions in drinking.  In turn, those participants who receive\n      a higher level of applied tDCS during alcohol avoidance response training will have better\n      avoidance learning, as well as, a larger reduction in drinking behavior.  Finally, those\n      participants receiving a higher level of applied tDCS will have more neuronal response\n      associated with alcohol avoidance during the brain imaging session."
