            "textblock": "The spread of artemisinin resistance in Plasmodium falciparum, which compromises the\n      therapeutic efficacy of artemisinin combination treatments (ACTs), is the greatest threat to\n      current global initiatives to control and eliminate malaria and is considered the highest\n      priority of the WHO Global Malaria Programme. If not eliminated, resistant parasites could\n      spread across Asia to Africa, as happened with resistance to other antimalarials in the\n      past.\n\n      Conventional descriptions of the epidemiology of malaria in low transmission settings\n      suggest that malaria prevalences are low (<10%) and heterogeneous. Most or all infections\n      are thought to be symptomatic so the focus of malaria control activities is on the\n      identification and treatment of symptomatic individuals. We and others have shown recently\n      that artemisinin resistant P. falciparum is prevalent in Western Cambodia, and that it is\n      now also found along the Thailand-Myanmar border and Vietnam. We have recently developed\n      highly sensitive quantitative PCR (qPCR) methods for parasite detection using >1mL of blood\n      which are 5,000 times more sensitive than conventional microscopy, and 100 times more\n      sensitive than currently used PCR.\n\n      We have studied villages along the Thai-Myanmar border which are typical for the region and\n      are classified by conventional epidemiological techniques as low-transmission (5-20% malaria\n      prevalence). Our studies suggest that the majority of the population is infected. In Pailin,\n      Western Cambodia, in areas where the National Malaria Control Programme and WHO believe that\n      malaria has been all but eliminated, we have also found very high rates (>80%) of\n      sub-microscopic parasitaemia in patients with fever or history of fever who are RDT\n      negative. Thus, there is a lot more asymptomatic malaria in low transmission settings than\n      previously thought, suggesting that control and elimination activities need to be rethought.\n\n      This study is designed to conduct and evaluate the efficacy of pilot implementation of\n      targeted chemo-elimination in selected areas with the goal of eliminating malaria in these\n      regions. This differs from mass drug administration (MDA); it is a strategy used to identify\n      specific areas where mass treatment is necessary, in this case to eliminate all malaria\n      parasites. Elimination will be targeted at communities with significant levels of\n      subclinical infection and transmission which will be identifiable in the future by comparing\n      rates of positivity by RDT or microscopy from new population samples against our qPCR data,\n      which shows the true falciparum prevalence.\n\n      The study will assess the feasibility, safety and acceptability of this strategy and its\n      impact on the transmission of malaria and the progression of artemisinin resistance. In\n      addition it will evaluate the contribution of low parasitaemia carriage to transmission of\n      artemisinin resistant malaria. These pilot studies are a necessary prelude to future scale\n      up and policy implementation.\n\n      Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) is a highly efficacious and inexpensive ACT which is\n      well tolerated by all age groups when used to treat uncomplicated multi-drug resistant\n      falciparum malaria in South East Asia. Monthly DP treatments have proved highly effective\n      and well tolerated. When used as part of a MDA strategy, the addition of a gametocytocidal\n      drug contributes towards the goal of malaria elimination by adding a strong transmission\n      blocking activity to the regimen. Primaquine (PQ), the only currently licensed\n      8-aminoquinoline, is relatively safe and very effective when used at a dose of 0.25 mg\n      base/kg, and does not require G6PD screening. Thus, we propose to evaluate the potential of\n      this strategy to eliminatie malaria focally in areas where artemisinin resistance in P.\n      falciparum is prevalent using DP plus PQ."
