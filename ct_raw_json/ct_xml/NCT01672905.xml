      RATIONALE: Studying samples of blood or tumor tissue from patients with cancer in the
      laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to cancer.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial studies prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody levels in
      samples from patients treated for prostate cancer on trial ECOG-E9802.

      OBJECTIVES:

      Primary

        -  To evaluate changes in prostate-specific antigen (PSA) antibody levels over time among
           patients treated on ECOG-E9802.

      Secondary

        -  To characterize the concordance of PSA antibody assessment between the ECOG Immunology
           Laboratory and the NCI Immunology Laboratory.

      OUTLINE: Previously tested samples are evaluated for changes in PSA antibody levels over
      time (from baseline to follow-up at 12 and 24 weeks) at the ECOG Immunology Laboratory and
      the NCI Immunology Laboratory. Results are compared between the laboratories.
