  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims at assessing factors that affect patient choices for end of life care. 300
      patients would be assigned either to a control arm (questionnaire alone) or intervention arm
      (standardized explanation+ questionnaire). Our intervention is a standardized explanation
      which explains  what code status, advance directive and end of life care mean. Based on
      patient responses, factors that affect choices of code status would be analyzed. We will
      also evaluate if a standardized explanation improves patient understanding of end of life
      issues. This would be determined by generating a composite score of correct responses to a
      subset of objective questions in the questionnaire

    <description>Patients in both arms were administered a questionnaire, that assessed demographics, subjective questions as well as a set of objective questions designed to assess patient understanding of code status. The responses to the objective questions were scored and the composite score of correct responses was used as a marker of patient understanding. Patients in the control arm were administered the questionnaire alone. Patients in the intervention arm first received our standard explanation, and were then administered the questionnaire</description>
