It was\n      approved for the treatment of hepatic coma, fibromyalgia, ataxia in China and is widely used\n      as supplement for the treatment of epilepsy, insomnia, stress and tobacco dependence. It has\n      been recently shown that GABA can prevent and reverse the development of diabetes in type 1\n      mice models. Participants will receive placebo or GABA for 52 weeks.\n\n      The study will consist of 4 weeks screening period, 2 weeks run-in period, 52 weeks\n      treatment period and 4 weeks follow-up period. Enrollment is expected to occur over 2 years.\n\n      To assess the efficacy and safety of GABA for the treatment of juvenile type 1 diabetes in\n      new onset subjects."
