             iliac artery

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has a life expectancy of less than 1 year;

          -  Patient has a known allergy to stent graft components, including stainless steel or
             heparin;

          -  Patient has a known intolerance to antiplatelet, anticoagulant, or thrombolytic
             medications that would prevent compliance with the protocol;

          -  Patient has a condition (unrelated to the study) that is expected to require
             indefinite, or lifelong, anticoagulation

          -  Patient has had vascular access / catheterization in the lower extremity within 30
             days of study enrollment;

          -  Patient has had a previous or planned coronary intervention within 30 days prior to
             enrollment in this study or required at time of study procedure; Patient has had a

             target lesion(s);

          -  Patient has aneurysmal dilation proximal or distal to the target lesion(s) that would
             interfere with the placement of the device;

          -  Patient has a target lesion requiring atherectomy or any ablative device to
             facilitate stent delivery;

          -  Patient has a target lesion situated in such a way that an implanted device will
             prevent blood flow or perfusion to the internal iliac artery if patent
