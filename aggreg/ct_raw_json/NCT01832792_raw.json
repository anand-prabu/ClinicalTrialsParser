Symptom outcomes will be assessed, and an estimate\n      of cost-effectiveness made.  Results are proposed to be disseminated locally and\n      internationally (through submission to conferences and peer-reviewed journals), and will\n      hopefully inform local service provision.\n\n      Please note that we are only able to offer the intervention to individuals who are currently\n      registered with a General Practitioner that is covered by Oxford Health NHS Foundation Trust\n      - this is typically restricted to practices in Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire, and parts of\n      Wiltshire."
