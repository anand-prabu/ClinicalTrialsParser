Monoclonal antibodies such as bevacizumab\n      can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them\n      without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor\n      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody with\n      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells"

Determine the time on study (a reflection of time to progression, treatment-related side\n      effects, and patient preference) of patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      V. Assess urine protein/creatinine ratio and serum complement levels as screening measures\n      for renal injury in patients treated with bevacizumab.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes once every other week and vinorelbine IV\n      over 6-10 minutes once weekly for 8 weeks. Treatment repeats every 8 weeks for 4 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or\n      partial response or stable disease after completion of the fourth course may receive\n      additional courses of concurrent bevacizumab and vinorelbine administered once every other\n      week or may continue therapy on the schedule as above.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 56 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
