PPVP will result in improved knowledge and awareness in older minorities in the senior\n           center setting (primary hypothesis);\n\n        2. Participants who are vaccinated through the project will experienced increased trust in\n           receiving vaccines from a pharmacist;\n\n        3. Participants will be satisfied with and trust the PV information provided by\n           pharmacists in the PPVP;\n\n        4. PPVP is an efficient approach to educating patients in the senior center based on its\n           costs;\n\n        5. Participating pharmacists will be activated to implement PPVP learnings in their\n           practice."
