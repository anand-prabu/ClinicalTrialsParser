            "textblock": "Postoperative pulmonary complications contribute to the morbidity of surgical patients.\n      During general anesthesia, up to 90% of patients will develop atelectasis, which is thought\n      to be a major contributing factor to their development. The adjustment of ventilator\n      settings to prevent the occurrence of atelectasis and reduce pulmonary complications remains\n      controversial.  Despite the use of similar mechanical ventilation strategies, two recent\n      studies (IMPROVE, PROVHILO) involving 1300 patients diverged in their conclusions regarding\n      the impact of these strategies in the prevention of pulmonary complications.  In these\n      studies, the absence of imagery to assess the pulmonary end-result of the different\n      ventilation strategies complicates the interpretation of their results.\n\n      On arrival in the operating theatre, each patient will undergo a baseline lung ultrasound\n      examination. The anesthetic technique and monitoring will be standardized. The radial artery\n      will be cannulated after induction of anesthesia for blood gas monitoring. Ventilator\n      settings will be adjusted according to randomization.\n\n      A second lung ultrasound examination will be performed 5 minutes following induction of\n      general anesthesia.  In the PEEP group, a lung ultrasound examination will be performed\n      immediately following the first recruitment maneuver.  A lung ultrasound examination will\n      also be performed at the end of surgery before emergence of general anesthesia.\n\n      Fifteen minutes after arrival in the recovery room, a last lung ultrasound examination will\n      be performed.  Fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) and vital signs will be recorded during\n      each ultrasound examination.  Arterial blood samples will be collected simultaneously.  The\n      aeration score will be calculated for each lung ultrasound examination."
