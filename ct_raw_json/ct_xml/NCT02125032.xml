  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study, is to determine whether treatment using transcranial low voltage
      pulsed electromagnetic fields (T-PEMF) can reduce the symptoms patients with Parkinson's
      Disease (PD) experience. The symptoms include movement, mentality and the nervous system in
      general.

      Furthermore the purpose of this study is to clarify whether a group of patients with PD,
      gain a statistical improvement in their symptoms when treated with active T-PEMF, compared
      to a group of patients with PD who receive placebo T-PEMF .

    <time_frame>At baseline and at endpoint at week 8.</time_frame>
    <description>Comment on &quot;Title&quot;: It is expected that the outcome measure UPDRS will report a change after 8 weeks of treatment compared to baseline.
Comment on &quot;Time Frame&quot;: Data will be assessed at each group after 8 weeks, and will be presented when all included patients have received their intervention.</description>
