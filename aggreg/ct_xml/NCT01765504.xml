      Using the 9 centers (Appendix B) involved with the planned multicenter NIRS comparative
      effectiveness trial the specific aims of this study are:

        1. To demonstrate the feasibility of collecting rScO2 data from patients undergoing
           cardiac surgery in a multicenter study design.

        2. To demonstrate the feasibility of using a standard algorithm for treating rScO2
           desaturations during cardiac surgery in a multicenter study design.

    <textblock>
      Brain injury after cardiac surgery is a chief source of patient mortality and healthcare
      costs and can significantly impair quality of life.  Reducing the burden of this
      complication has wide public health implications.  The broad manifestations of perioperative
      brain injury include stroke, delirium, and cognitive decline.5  All forms of injury are
      believed to result primarily from cerebral embolism and/or reduced cerebral blood flow
      (CBF).  The risk for cerebral hypoperfusion is likely the highest during cardiopulmonary
      bypass (CPB), when mean arterial pressure (MAP) is kept low (~60 mmHg), particularly for
      patients who are aged and who have cerebral vascular disease.  Near-infrared spectroscopy
      (NIRS) is used increasingly to monitor regional cerebral oxygen saturation (rScO2) in
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, although limited data show that it improves patient
      outcomes.  Regardless, clinical evidence supporting the efficacy of NIRS-based monitoring is
      needed urgently because the cost of NIRS sensors (~$220/patient) could add $132 million
      annually to hospital costs for cardiac surgery.  We must address this issue quickly because
      the rising prevalence of NIRS use and advocacy by experts and industry will likely soon
      result in NIRS becoming a standard of care.  We are in the process of submitting a
      multicenter, prospectively randomized comparative effectiveness trial to assess the efficacy
      of NIRS monitoring in patients who are undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG)
      surgery with CPB, and/or valve surgery, and who are at risk for brain injury.  The goal of
      the planned proposal is to determine whether interventions to correct rScO2 desaturations
      (value &lt;50% or 20% reduction from room air baseline) reduce the frequency of neurologic and
      other complications compared with standard care (no clinical monitoring).  In order to
      demonstrate feasibility of our proposal we need to demonstrate the ability of the team to
      collect rScO2 data from multiple centers and to show the ability of the team to properly
      follow an algorithm for treating rScO2 desaturations that occur during surgery.  Thus, the
      aim of the current study is to collect preliminary data to support our larger comparative
      effectiveness trial.
