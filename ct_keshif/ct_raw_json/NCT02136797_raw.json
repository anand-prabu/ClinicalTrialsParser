A\n      transfusion is the process by which blood from one person is transferred to the blood of\n      another. In this case, the T-cells are made from the blood of donors who are immune to CMV.\n      The T-cells are then grown and taught to attack the CMV virus in a lab."

The patient must have a clinically documented condition associated with CMV\n                  (e.g. interstitial pneumonia, hepatitis, retinitis, colitis) Or\n\n               2. The patient must have microbiological evidence of CMV viremia or tissue invasion\n                  as attested by viral culture, or detection of levels of CMV DNA in the blood or\n                  body fluids consistent with CMV infection.\n\n        Patient must also satisfy at least one of the following criteria:\n\n          1. The patient's CMV infection is clinically progressing or CMV viremia is persistent or\n             increasing (as evidenced by quantitation of CMV DNA in the blood) despite two weeks\n             induction therapy with antiviral drugs.\n\n             Or\n\n          2. The patient has developed CMV viremia as attested by viral culture, or detection of\n             levels of CMV DNA in blood or body fluids while receiving prophylactic doses of\n             antiviral drugs to prevent CMV infection post transplant.\n\n        Or c. The patient is unable to sustain treatment with antiviral drugs due to drug\n        associated toxicities (e.g. myelosuppression [ANC< 1000\u03bcl/ml without GCSF support] or\n        nephrotoxicity [corrected creatinine clearance \u2264 60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or serum creatinine > 2\n        mg/dl]) CMV infections are life threatening, and may involve multiple organ systems such\n        as the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, hematopoietic and central nervous systems.\n        Antiviral drugs used for treatment may also compromise renal and hematopoietic function.\n        Therefore, dysfunctions of these organs will not affect eligibility for this protocol.\n\n        4. Patients must meet the following clinical criteria to receive CMVpp65-CTL infusions\n\n          1. Stable blood pressure and circulation, not requiring pressor support\n\n          2. Evidence of adequate cardiac function as demonstrated by EKG and/or echocardiography.\n\n          3. A life expectancy of at least 3 weeks, even if requiring artificial ventilation.\n\n          4. There are no age restrictions The patient's HCT donor has not been previously\n             infected by or sensitized to CMV (e.g. a cord blood transplant or a marrow or PBSC\n             transplant from a seronegative donor).\n\n        The patient's HCT donor, if seropositive, is either not available or not willing to\n        provide leukocytes for generation of CMV-specific T-cells.\n\n        b. There are CMVpp65-specific T-cells available in appropriate doses in the MSKCC Adoptive\n        Immune T-cell Therapy Bank that are matched with the patient for 2 HLA alleles and that\n        exhibit CMVpp65-specific cytotoxic activity that is restricted by an HLA allele shared by\n        the patient\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients requiring high doses of glucocorticosteroids (\u2265 0.3 mg/kg prednisone or its\n             equivalent)\n\n          -  Patients who are moribund\n\n          -  Patients with other conditions not related to CMV infection (e.g. uncontrolled\n             bacterial sepsis or invasive fungal infection) which are also life-threatening and\n             which would preclude evaluation of the effects of a T-cell infusion.\n\n          -  Patients who are pregnant Donors in Group 1 (Historical Donors) Donors in Group 1\n             would have already been determined to be eligible and will have donated blood or\n             leukocytes to establish CMV-specific T-cells under IRB # 05-065, 07-055, 95-024, or\n             11-130. There are no additional eligibility requirements for these donors.\n\n        Donor Inclusion Criteria (Prospective Donors):\n\n        Transplant donors and healthy HLA typed volunteers who  give written consent to provide\n        Tcells for Third-party donation (section 5.1, Groups 2 and 3),  will need to meet the\n        following eligibility requirements prior to donation:\n\n          1. Donors must satisfy the criteria specified in FDA 21 CFR 1271.\n\n          2. Donors must be typed for HLA-A, B, C and DR at high resolution\n\n          3. Donors must have a hemoglobin value > 10g/dl\n\n          4. Donors must be capable of undergoing, at least, a single standard 2 blood volume\n             leukapheresis or a donation of one unit of whole blood\n\n        Donor Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  HTLV/HIV(+) or Hepatitis B or C antigen(+) donors\n\n          -  Donors who are known CMV seronegative"
