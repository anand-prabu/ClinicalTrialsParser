      The purpose of this study is to find a recommended dose of LY2940680 that can be safely
      given in combination with etoposide and carboplatin followed by LY2940680 alone in
      participants with extensive-disease small cell lung cancer. The study will also compare
      progression-free survival in participants who are administered etoposide, carboplatin and
      LY2940680 followed by LY2940680 alone versus etoposide, carboplatin, and placebo followed by
      placebo alone.

             Participants with a history of non-metastatic prostate cancer, including biochemical
             relapse only, will be eligible even if diagnosed less than 5 years previously

          -  Symptomatic central nervous system (CNS) metastases and asymptomatic CNS metastases
             requiring concurrent corticosteroid therapy. Treated stable CNS metastases are

             corticosteroids for ≥1 week

          -  Presence of clinically significant third-space fluid collections that cannot be
             controlled prior to study entry

          -  Significant weight loss (that is, ≥10%) over the 6-week period prior to study entry

          -  Concurrent administration of any other antitumor therapy. An exception will be made

             only or breast cancer participants continuing adjuvant antiestrogen therapy only (for
             example, an aromatase inhibitor)

          -  Females who are breastfeeding
