  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the effects of cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) for
      procrastination, and to investigate whether it can be delivered via the Internet. Two
      treatment groups will be used, one with therapist contact and one without, as well as a
      wait-list control group. It is assumed that the treatment group with therapist contact will
      be superior to the treatment group receiving no therapist contact since procrastination can
      be partially explained as a self-regulatory failure. Both treatment groups are presumed to
      be superior to the wait-list control.
