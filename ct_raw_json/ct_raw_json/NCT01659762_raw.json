This is a phase I dose-escalation,\n      open label, non-randomized, non-placebo controlled, single group assignment study to\n      evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous infusion of EPIC MSC2011-001.\n      EPIC EPIC MSC/IBD will be infused intravenously and will be administered at one of three\n      dose levels: (Tier 1) 2 million cells/kg patient body weight; (Tier 2) 5 million cells/kg,\n      and (Tier 3) 10 million cells/kg. This Phase I clinical trial will enroll 16-20 subjects\n      with moderate to severe Crohn's. The duration of this study for each patient is 12 weeks.\n      The investigators anticipate that this study will be completed within 2 years of\n      commencement.\n\n      Primary objective: To describe and compare the safety and tolerability of a single infusion\n      of fresh autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells infused to patients with\n      moderate to severe Crohn's disease.\n\n      Secondary objective: Efficacy of autologous bone marrow derived Mesenchymal stromal cells\n      infusion to patients with moderate to severe Crohn's disease as assessed through disease\n      activity index, and quality of life index.\n\n      Safety variables:Adverse events (AEs),Laboratory parameters (hematology, biochemistry,\n      urinalysis), Vital signs."
