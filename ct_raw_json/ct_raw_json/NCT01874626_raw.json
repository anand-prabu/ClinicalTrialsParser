Subjects will apply an amount\n      equivalent to a 4 inch line of investigational product to the affected ankle approximately\n      every 4-6 hours.  At Visit 1 two doses will be applied at the site.  All subsequent doses of\n      the investigational product will be applied every 4 to 6 hours with a total of 4 doses in a\n      24 hour period.  Duration of treatment with the investigational product is 7 days."
