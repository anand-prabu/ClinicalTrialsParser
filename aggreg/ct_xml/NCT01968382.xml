      Hypothesis: Oral administration of hyperimmune bovine colostrum enriched with anti-LPS
      antibodies will reduce endotoxemia, and improve pathophysiological and clinical parameters
      related to severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH).

      Aim: To perform a phase 2a &quot;proof of concept&quot; placebo-controlled, dose-ranging study of Imm
      124-E (hyperimmune bovine colostrum enriched with IgG anti-LPS) in subjects with severe AH
      on steroids.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects with severe alcoholic hepatitis (20&lt;= MELD &lt;=28) about to receive prednisolone (40
      mg/day x 28 days) will be randomized 1:1:1 to additionally receive either one of two doses
      of Imm 124-E (2400 mg/day or 4800 mg/day) orally or placebo for the same duration.  Standard
      of care nutrition support and alcohol cessation recommendations will be provided to all
      subjects.  Alcohol withdrawal will be managed per standard of care.  Subjects who meet Lille
      criteria for failure of treatment on day 7 or side effects requiring discontinuation of
      steroids will be removed from the study.  The primary endpoint is a decrease in plasma
      endotoxin levels.

      The secondary endpoints will include:

        1. Mechanistic endpoints:  TNF-Î±, immune-inflammatory markers, microbiome-metagenome

        2. Efficacy-related: number of subjects meeting Lille failure criteria at day 7 ,
           mortality (at 30 days, 90 days, and 180 days), time to drop in conjugated bilirubin by
           50%, bile acids, liver function tests, change in MELD, and sequential organ failure

        3. Safety related: tolerability, adverse events.
