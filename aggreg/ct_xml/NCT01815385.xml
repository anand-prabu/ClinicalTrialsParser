  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic diseases such as obesity and diabetes are modern day epidemics. Early life
      exposure to an adverse developmental environment, including environmental toxins, are linked
      to increased susceptibility to obesity, metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.  Although
      the mechanisms underlying the fetal origins of metabolic disease are poorly understood,
      strong evidence suggests that alterations in the epigenome play a critical role in this
      process.  The central hypothesis of this proposal is that intrauterine exposure to
      benzo[a]pyrene leads to epigenetic changes which will have functional consequences and may
      be a marker for, or may contribute to, increased susceptibility to adverse outcomes in
      childhood including increased adiposity and the subsequent development of obesity, metabolic
      syndrome or diabetes. The goals of this proposal are to: 1) determine benzo[a]pyrene levels
      in umbilical cord blood of newborns, 2) determine whether benzo[a]pyrene exposure during
      pregnancy correlates with early onset of obesity and metabolic disease by examining the
      children at 12 and 24 months of age, 3) determine whether in utero benzo[a]pyrene exposure
      programs metabolic disease through alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression, and
      4) determine the plasticity of the DNA methylation patterns in the same offspring at 12
      months of age. The long-term goal of this project is to define biomarkers that identify
      neonates at &quot;high-risk&quot; for diminished attainment of full health potential, who can then be
      targeted for preventative measures.
