  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to study the effects of potato resistant starch on the
      microbiota (microorganisms or bacteria) and short chain fatty acids levels of the gut.
      Levels will be measured and compared between elderly residents of a long term care facility
      and in pre-elderly, adults from the general public. A correlation between the use of potato
      resistant starch and specific clinical and quality of life endpoints between elderly
      residents of a long term care facility and in pre-elderly, adults from the general public
      will be studied.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigator hypothesizes that the microbiome in LTC residents (≥70 years)
      is less diverse and more prone to imbalance compared to adults (30-50 years) from the
      general population and that this imbalance of the gut microflora in the LTC residents is
      partially related to inadequate RS in their diet.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigator hypothesizes that ingestion of potato resistant starch of
      food grade quality (MSPrebiotic) will stabilize the gut microbiome (i.e. high
      Firmicutes/Bacteroides ratio)in LTC residents (i.e. similar to that of adults from the
      general population), thereby improving gut health and reducing the risk of diarrhea and/or
      gut infection.

      To assess the impact on the potato resistant starch on the microbiota, pyrosequencing will
      be performed on stool samples to determine the original composition and assess any changes
      over the study period.  In addition the impact of the potato resistant starch on
      inflammatory markers will be assess through blood samples collected over the study period.
