  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a non-randomized controlled cohort study evaluating the impact of social
      network-based HIV education on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, clinical outcomes,
      food security, social support, HIV knowledge, and risk behaviors among people living with
      HIV/AIDS, as well as members of their associated social support networks.  The intervention,
      known as the Mfangano Health Net Microclinic Pilot Program, consists of a 6-month education
      program on HIV biology, interpersonal communication and community mobilization for both HIV
      positive individuals and their self-selected social network members selected irrespective of
      HIV status.  Investigators hypothesize that participation in the microclinic program will
      improve ART adherence, cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) count, social support, HIV
      knowledge and food insecurity and will reduce HIV-related stigma, as compared to
      participants in control communities.
