  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a survey study to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of an affordable, $400
      flat rate, same-day consultation, simulation, and delivery of a single fraction of
      palliative radiation therapy for patients with symptomatic bony metastatic disease who are
      currently enrolled in hospice. Treatment planning and delivery of palliative radiotherapy
      will utilize &quot;standard of care&quot; techniques.
