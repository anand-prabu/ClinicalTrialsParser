Treatment repeats every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 80 patients (60 patients age 70 and over and 20 patients\n      under age 60) will be accrued for this study."
