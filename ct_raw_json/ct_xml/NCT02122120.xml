    <textblock>
      Home enteral nutrition  (HEN) has always been recognized as a life-saving procedure, but
      with the ongoing economic crisis influencing health care, its cost-effectiveness has been
      questioned recently.

      Objective: The unique reimbursement situation in Poland enabled the otherwise ethically
      unacceptable, hence unavailable, comparison of the period of no-feeding and the long-term
      feeding and the subsequent analyses of the clinical value of the latter and its
      cost-effectiveness.

      Background: Home enteral nutrition  (HEN) has always been recognized as a life-saving
      procedure, but with the ongoing economic crisis influencing health care, its
      cost-effectiveness has been questioned recently.

      Objective: The unique reimbursement situation in Poland enabled the otherwise ethically
      unacceptable, hence unavailable, comparison of the period of no-feeding and the long-term
      feeding and the subsequent analyses of the clinical value of the latter and its
      cost-effectiveness.

      Design: The observational multicentre study in the group of 456 HEN patients was performed
      between January 2007 and July 2013. Two twelve-month periods were compared. During the first
      one patients were tube fed with home-made diet without monitoring, while during the other
      the complex HEN was carried out. The latter included tube feeding and complex monitoring by
      nutrition support team. Number of complications, hospital admissions, length of hospital
      stay (LOS), biochemical and anthropometric parameters and costs of hospitalization were
      compared.
