      This project will be the first to evaluate the Moving Forward app in VA. Identifying an
      effective treatment for anxiety and depression in primary care is imperative within VHA as
      they are both common, chronic, and debilitating conditions associated with a number of
      personal and health-related costs. In close partnership with app developers at MHS, a major
      contribution of this research is the actionable feedback on the acceptability, feasibility
      and effectiveness of augmenting traditional PST with the Moving Forward app for future app
      development. If effectiveness can be established, Moving Forward has the potential for
      integration into the larger continuum of care for depression and anxiety in PC-MHI (e.g.,
      care management, co-located collaborative care). Lastly, this pilot project will provide
      preliminary data for future research on SmartPhone technology. Veteran feedback on treatment
      components, ease of executing the study successfully and preliminary effect size
      calculations, will inform the design of the larger project.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Access and engagement in evidence-based psychotherapies for Veterans are high priorities for
      the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), especially the Office of Rural Health (ORH) and
      the office of Mental Health Services (MHS). SmartPhone applications are an emerging
      technology with a vast potential to extend the reach of traditional in-person psychotherapy
      by allowing increased digital access to providers and self-management tools. Due to the
      relatively recent development of this technology, there are no data on the effectiveness of
      SmartPhone-delivered psychotherapy. Preliminary data on acceptability and satisfaction are
      promising, suggesting a need for further research. The National Center for PTSD in
      collaboration with the National Center for Telehealth &amp; Technology (T2) recently completed
      the development of an app called Moving Forward, a Veteran-friendly adaptation of Problem
      Solving Therapy (PST), an evidence based therapy available through Primary Care Integration
      Clinics (PC-MHI). In partnership with MHS, this proposed pilot project will gather
      preliminary data on the effectiveness and acceptability of Moving Forward and provide timely
      feedback to the app creators. Participants will include approximately 40 Veterans diagnosed
      with an anxiety or mood disorder interested in obtaining mental health treatment in PC-MHI.
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either PST augmented by the Moving Forward
      app or PST alone. Participants will complete assessments at baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks.
      Investigators propose 3 specific hypotheses. In hypothesis 1, investigators predict a
      moderate effect size will be observed when comparing homework completion and satisfaction
      for patients randomized to PST plus the Moving Forward app compared to patients randomized
      to PST alone. In hypothesis 2, investigators predict a moderate effect size will be observed
      when comparing change scores on the problem solving style for patients randomized to PST
      plus the Moving Forward app compared to patients randomized to PST alone. In hypothesis 3,
      investigators predict a moderate effect size will be observed when comparing depression,
      anxiety, stress and quality of life change for patients randomized to PST plus the Moving
      Forward app compared to patients randomized to PST alone. Key informant interviews will
      provide qualitative feedback on the Moving Forward app which investigators will share with
      our partners at MHS. The proposed project is important to the VA mission to improve access
      for all Veterans particularly those who face barriers to engagement in traditional
      face-to-face treatment. The proposed research addresses one of three primary focus areas of
      the Office of Research and Development (Access), two of HSR&amp;D's research priorities
      (Access/Rural Health and Mental Health), and three of Secretary Shinseki's Transformational
      Initiatives for the 21st Century including improving: 1) access to care, 2) mental health,
      and 3) patient-centeredness. This proposed work is innovative as it focuses on a rapidly
      emerging mobile technology that has great potential to improve access and engagement in
      mental health service delivery. To date, there have been no randomized effectiveness trials
      that have examined SmartPhone apps for mental health service delivery. The project is also
      timely as there is a temporary moratorium (imposed by the Office of Information Technology)
      on app dissemination within VHA, presenting an opportunity to study Moving Forward prior to
      its release. At the completion of this project, investigators expect that the work proposed
      in this study will highlight the clinical value of the Moving Forward app, which will inform
      both VA policy makers and the scientific community at large about the utility of SmartPhone
      technology in mental health care delivery. Investigators also expect that this study will
      provide our partners at MHS with helpful feedback on the Moving Forward app design and
      future app development.

    <description>All Veterans will receive a standard 6-session administration of PST (Nezu &amp; D�Zurilla, 1999). Session 1 will take place in-person during a scheduled appointment and will last for 1 hour. Subsequent sessions will take place over the telephone and will last for approximately 30 minutes. Participants in this arm will also receive the Moving Forward app for SmartPhones, which was adapted from PST to be used either as a standalone treatment or as an adjunct to other related therapies such as in-person PST or the Moving Forward website. The phone content matches PST. Benefits of the app include 24-hours accessibility of psychoeducational materials and worksheets.</description>

          -  substance dependence diagnosis and current use,

          -  any psychotic spectrum diagnoses or

          -  inability to provide informed consent.

          -  Diagnosis will be confirmed by chart review and MINI clinical interview.

          -  Acute suicidal ideation will be determined by the assessing or treating clinician.

          -  During the baseline and follow-up interviews, any Veteran who endorses a &quot;1&quot; or
             higher on item # 21 on the DASS &quot;I feel that life isn't worthwhile&quot; or item # 9 on
             the PHQ-9 &quot;thoughts that you would be better off dead or of hurting yourself&quot; will be
             asked follow-up questions on the suicide risk protocol (see appendix 3).

          -  Current substance or alcohol use will be determined by the alcohol and substance use
             modules of the MINI.
