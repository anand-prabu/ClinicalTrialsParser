This sample size far\n      exceeds any database established thus far. As many as 40% of affected PKD patients are\n      reportedly unaware of a family history of this disease, in part because many patients may go\n      undiagnosed until they present with a medical complication (e.g., hypertension, kidney\n      failure). Furthermore, this initiative will provide an opportunity to compare data from\n      racially diverse populations."
