In\n      order to provide a baseline sample, participants will attend the laboratory in the morning\n      following an overnight fast and voiding of any urine.  Following this participants will be\n      given 30mls (30 mls provides 323 mg/380 \u00b5mol of anthocyanins) of tart cherry juice or\n      placebo, diluted with 60 mls of water to consume within 10 minutes.  Participants will be\n      required to consume identical dosages of the supplement immediately prior to evening meals\n      and breakfasts (or same time each morning following blood sampling if non-breakfast eater)\n      over the next 96 hours.  Further blood and urine samples will be collected at 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,\n      24, 26, 48, 50, 72, 74 and 96 hours and will require participants to return to the\n      laboratory at each of these time points.

Following the washout period they will repeat the supplementation\n      period consuming the supplement they did not receive during the first period."
