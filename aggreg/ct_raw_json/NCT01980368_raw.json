            "textblock": "Age-adjusted colorectal cancer (CRC) mortality has declined over the past two decades for\n      both genders leading to significant increase in the proportion of CRC survivors. Fatigue is\n      one of the most consistently identified problems among CRC survivors, persisting a year or\n      more after diagnosis for some. Physical activity is critical to improve fatigue symptoms\n      among CRC survivors. It has been established in previous studies that CRC survivors who\n      engage in physical exercise report reduced fatigue and better quality of life compared to\n      those who lack physical exercise (Paddle, Au, &amp; Courneya, 2008). However, it can be a\n      challenge to engage fatigued CRC survivors in physical activity. An alternative form of\n      physical exercise is Tai Chi Easy (TCEasy), a simple and repetitive form of exercise that\n      consists of movements with meditation. When performed at a moderate level, TCEasy provides\n      an alternative to standard moderate intensity aerobic exercise. Our Arizona State University\n      collaborators in this proposed study have experience in testing the same form of exercise\n      among women with breast cancer survivors. We intend to further study the effects of TCEasy\n      in improving fatigue and fatigue related symptoms among the colorectal cancer survivors."
