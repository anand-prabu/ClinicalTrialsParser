Findings from this ancillary study\n      will inform clinical practice on the role(s) of vitamin D and/or omega-3 fatty acid\n      supplements in fracture prevention. Because of the very high prevalence of low vitamin D\n      levels and fractures in older adults, this trial will enable us to prove or disprove whether\n      high-dose vitamin D and/or fish oil supplementation is effective in the primary prevention\n      of age-related osteoporotic fractures in the U.S. These nutritional supplements may offer\n      low-cost preventative interventions and reduce the burden of osteoporotic fractures with the\n      potential for substantial individual and public health benefits."
