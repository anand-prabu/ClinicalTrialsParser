  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, 24-week, randomized, multicenter, open-label, controlled study.  subjects
      will be randomized into one of two treatment arms; oral administration of cinacalcet daily
      in addition to standard of care treatment arm or a standard of care arm. Randomization will
      be stratified by age group. All subjects receive standard of care which can include therapy
      with Vitamin D sterols, calcium supplementation, and phosphate binders.

    <description>Subjects will receive oral administration of cinacalcet daily in addition to standard of care therapy. Cinacalcet will be provided in 5 mg capsules that must be sprinkled onto soft food or suspended into a liquid suspension for administration and 30 mg tablets for swallowing. The protocol specified doses for use in this study are: 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, and 180 mg. The maximum dose of cinacalcet that will be administered at any time during the study will be 2.5 mg/kg/day based on the subject's dry weight during randomization or 180 mg daily, whichever is lower.  The treatment period consists of Weeks 1 - 20. Following completion of the treatment period, all subjects will enter a 4 week safety follow-up period through Week 24.</description>
