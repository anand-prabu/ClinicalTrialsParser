Some patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously on days 9-14.\n      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 5-10 courses.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of topotecan until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT). Dose escalation of gemcitabine then continues in\n      cohorts of 3-6 patients until the MTD is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose below\n      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience DLT.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
