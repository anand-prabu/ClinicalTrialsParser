Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating\n      non-small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of two combination\n      chemotherapy regimens in treating patients who have non-small cell lung cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      weight loss in the past 6 months (less than 5% vs at least 5%) and disease stage (stage IIIB\n      with pleural or pericardial effusion or pleural implants vs stage IV/recurrent). Patients\n      are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours followed by carboplatin IV over\n           15-30 minutes on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 followed by\n           cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1 only.\n\n      Treatment continues in both arms every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40-90 patients (20-45 per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 12 months."
