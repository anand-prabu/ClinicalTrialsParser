The trial will be divided into 2 periods. During\n      the initial treatment period (first and second years in the study) participants will receive\n      Broncho-Vaxom\u00ae (3.5 mg) or placebo for ten days each month for two consecutive years. This\n      period will allow the observation of key secondary outcomes while participants are receiving\n      therapy. A rolling enrollment strategy will be used anticipating a two year enrollment\n      period for the whole study.  The second period (third year in the study) will be a one year\n      observation of the time to occurrence of the first WLRI episode (primary outcome) while off\n      study drug along with the secondary outcomes noted above. During both the treatment and\n      observation periods, participants will be managed by study physicians using a rescue\n      algorithm applied in the PEAK trial commensurate with the NAEPP-EPR III guidelines."
