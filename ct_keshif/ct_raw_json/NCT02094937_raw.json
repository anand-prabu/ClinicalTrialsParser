The study is divided into Run-in period,\n      Period 1 (open-label treatment), Period 2 (double blind treatment) and Follow-up. Subjects\n      with well controlled asthma after completing a run-in period of 4 weeks will be switched\n      from middle-dose ICS/long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) equivalent dose to once-daily FF/VI\n      100/25 mcg for an 8 weeks treatment period (Period 1). After this, subjects will be\n      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either FP 250 mcg twice daily, FP 100 mcg twice daily\n      or FF 100 mcg once daily in a 12 week double blind treatment period (Period 2). There will\n      be a 1 week Follow-up Period following completion of the double-blind treatment period, or\n      early withdrawal from the study.  Overall , the total duration of subject's participation in\n      the study will be for 25 weeks. RELVAR is a registered trademark of the GSK group of\n      companies."

The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to\n             Fridericia's formula (QTcF), machine overread. The QTc should be based on single or\n             averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief\n             recording period.
