Three\n      assessment tools are selected to evaluate the study result: Mann Assessment of Swallowing\n      Ability (MASA), videofluoroscopic swallowing study (VFSS), and Chinese version Swallowing\n      Quality-of-Life Questionnaire (CSWAL-QOL). The hypothesis of this study is that the\n      effortful swallowing exercise would have better treatment efficacy."
