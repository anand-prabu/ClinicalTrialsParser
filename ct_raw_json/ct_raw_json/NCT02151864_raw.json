We have\n      identified hedgehog dysregulation as a novel mechanism for hepatocarcinogenesis and hepatic\n      fibrosis/cirrhosis. Therefore, we hypothesize that the hedgehog inhibitor may be an ideal\n      drug target for treating both hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and Child-Pugh A cirrhosis\n      (CPA)."

Dose\n      escalation will be based on the dose-limiting toxicities encountered through Day 42 of\n      investigational treatment.\n\n      Patients will be dosed on a flat scale of daily dosing of LDE225 prescribed by the dose\n      cohort."
