Patients will be randomized to one of four\n      possible treatment groups (Acthar [low dose (40 U [0.5 mL]) or high dose (80 U [1.0 mL])] or\n      equivalent volumes of Placebo [low or high 'dose']) in a 2:1:2:1 ratio\n      (Acthar:Placebo:Acthar:Placebo).

In Weeks 5-8, patients will taper the study medication. Patients will\n      continue on their stable steroid regimen during this phase of the study.\n\n      After completion of Week 8 in the double-blind phase, patients may choose to participate in\n      the optional open-label phase where they will receive an Acthar maintenance regimen for 44\n      weeks. The initial Acthar regimen will be assigned based on the study medication regimen the\n      patient received at the completion of the double-blind phase (Visit 6, Week 8). Acthar\n      regimen may be adjusted based on the Investigator's judgment with the goal of achieving a\n      stable Acthar regimen no later than Week 28.  Once the stable Acthar regimen is achieved,\n      the Investigator should consider tapering the steroid regimen to a low daily dose or\n      completely discontinue."
