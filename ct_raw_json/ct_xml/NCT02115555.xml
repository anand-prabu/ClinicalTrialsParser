    <textblock>
      The study will compare three treatment strategies to look at the best clinical outcomes.

      The investigator hypothesizes that the combined approach of a health information technology
      program plus a conflict-management contract will lead to the best outcomes.

    <textblock>
      This study will compare three strategies for enhancing adherence to diabetes care in our
      population.  The study will look at which strategy results in the best short-term clinical
      outcomes for the population.  Also, the study will look at patient satisfaction of contact
      with his/her health care team, quality of life, and family dynamics.

      The three arms are:

        1. HIT (health information technology) aided approach

        2. Contracted conflict-management strategy

        3. Combination of the HIT-aided approach and the contracted conflict management strategy

The subject will receive messages from the HIT system on the meter based upon the SMGB tests. In addition,  adolescent-parent pairs will meet with a health educator to establish a behavioral contract that will set patient-centered self-management goals for the adolescent. This arm combines arms 1 and 2.</description>
