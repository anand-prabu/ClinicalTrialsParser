  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled cross-over trial. The hypothesis of this study is that the
      differences in manual acupuncture manipulation can impact clinical effect though the
      acupuncturists follow the same needling regimen. In this study, acupuncturist 1 (clinical
      experience &gt;15 years) and acupuncturist 2 (&lt;5 years) will give treatments to cancer patients
      receiving cisplatin chemotherapy (n=36) for at least two continuous cycles, once per day, 5
      days per cycle. Acupuncturist 1 determines all the treatment regimens (selection of
      acupoints and methods of needling manipulation, needle retention time). Randomly, half of
      the patients will receive treatments from acupuncturist 1 in the first treatment cycle and
      from acupuncturist 2 in the second cycle; while the other half will be treated in other way
      round. There is a washout period (21 days) between two cycles. The needling manipulation of
      two acupuncturists will be measured objectively during treatments. The clinical effect will
      be measured by the control of vomiting and nausea during and after chemotherapy treatments.
