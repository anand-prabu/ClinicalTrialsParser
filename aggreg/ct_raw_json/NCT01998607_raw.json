The survey will be conducted in two rounds. The two\n      survey rounds will be conducted 12 to 18 months and 24 to 30 months after XGEVA becomes\n      commercially available in the participating countries. The initial contact and screening of\n      potential participating oncology practitioners will continue until a total of 210 eligible\n      and consenting oncology practitioners complete the survey per round. For the 5 largest\n      European countries by population, it is intended that 30 oncology practitioners will be\n      surveyed per country per survey round. If this sample size cannot be achieved, oncology\n      practitioners from another country in that region will be surveyed to achieve a regional\n      sample size of 150 per survey round. Oncology practitioners from the Nordic countries will\n      be surveyed to achieve a regional sample size of 60 per survey round. For all countires, the\n      number of surveys collected in each country in the second survey round will, where possible,\n      equate to the number of surveys collected in each country in the first survey round."
