We hypothesize that the intervention group will\n      have reduced percent adiposity and that this change will be associated with estrogen\n      metabolites.\n\n      Women between the ages of 35-65 years of age, who are at high-risk of breast cancer will be\n      enrolled into the study and randomized into two groups: control and intervention groups.\n      Both groups will provide biologic specimens, undergo Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)\n      scans, complete questionnaires and dietary recall interviews."
