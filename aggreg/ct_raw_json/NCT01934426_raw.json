All patients will\n      follow up to end of study to identify 14 days readmission and 30 days readmission to\n      geriatic ward.\n\n      Expected Outcomes: (1) To compare the prediction value of derivation cohort and validation\n      cohort. (2) To identify high risk indicators of admission and readmission for elderly. (3)\n      To determine the risk factors in admission elderly association with quality indicators."
