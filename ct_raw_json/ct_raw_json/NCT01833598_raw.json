            "textblock": "Tendinopathy is a clinical syndrome of chronic pain and tendon degeneration that impairs a\n      person's ability to perform daily activities and recreation. Traditional conservative\n      treatments include activity modification, exercises, ice/heat, and medications and\n      corticosteroid injection. A newer treatment is percutaneous needle tenotomy (PNT), in which\n      the affected area is repetitively needled to disrupt pathological tissue and induce\n      bleeding. This turns a nonhealing chronic injury into an acute injury with enhanced healing\n      capability. Another is Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP), whereby patients' own platelets are\n      injected into the affected area, also activating growth factors. There has been promising\n      research in these tendinopathy treatments but more research is needed.\n\n      The investigators plan to expand on prior studies to identify a reproducible and efficacious\n      treatment for chronic tendinopathy to reduce pain and improve function and quality of life.\n      Our goal in this study is to assess the efficacy of ultrasound guided (USG) PNT versus PNT\n      with peritendinous PRP as a treatment for chronic tendinopathy."

            "textblock": "Subjects will be recruited over a 2 year period . The potential subjects will be identified\n      on the basis of the presence of a tendinopathy that has failed conservative treatment,\n      defined more specifically as a tendon injury that has not healed or responded over 3 months\n      since initial injury with treatments including physical therapy, bracing, modalities, rest,\n      and/or oral medications. We will also include corticosteroid injection in this failed\n      treatment group. Preliminary results including safety will be analyzed at follow up at 2, 4,\n      6, 8 and 12 weeks. Subjects will follow up in the office at 4 weeks post intervention. The\n      other follow-ups will be performed by telephone.\n\n      After clinically identifying the presence of tendinopathy, the potential subjects will be\n      evaluated by a study team member using inclusion and exclusion criteria.  Patients will be\n      randomized using envelopes with assignments into one of 2 groups: percutaneous needle\n      tenotomy alone or PNT with peritendinous PRP injection. They will be assigned a number that\n      identifies them.\n\n      In order to blind all subjects to their treatment, the subjects will then undergo either a\n      sham venipuncture if in the PNT-only group or a blood draw of 10 to 60ml by a study team\n      member under sterile conditions if in the PNT +PRP group. (The subject will be blinded to\n      whether or not blood is actually drawn by keeping the arm behind a curtain.) The amount of\n      blood drawn in the PNT +PRP group will be determined by tendon affected, as large tendons\n      will need more volume and concentration of the PRP and its contained factors: 10ml blood\n      drawn for small tendons and 60ml blood for large tendons\n\n      The PNT procedure will be performed by a fellowship-trained, board-certified interventional\n      spine and sports medicine physician under direct and continuous ultrasound guidance (USG),\n      with the injection syringe covered with opaque tape to blind the patient to their treatment.\n\n      Post procedure, patients will be instructed to take over the counter (OTC) acetaminophen\n      500mg or tramadol 50mg to be taken by mouth for pain relief every 6 hours as needed. Ice\n      applied over the tendon will not be allowed for 3 days and NSAIDs are to be avoided after\n      the intervention is performed for the remaining duration of the study due to their\n      anti-inflammatory properties. We allow participants to be on anti-inflammatory medication\n      prior to the intervention, but we do not want to disrupt the post-procedure inflammation\n      process essential for healing.\n\n      The post-procedure protocol also consists of relative rest until the first telephone\n      follow-up appointment in 2 weeks, regardless of tenotomy site. Patients will be allowed to\n      continue their usual activities of daily living during that period, regardless of an upper\n      versus a lower extremity tenotomy site. Between weeks 2 and 4, patients will progressively\n      advance to multi-planar isometric exercises and light resistance exercises as tolerated,\n      according to instructions given.\n\n      Gradual return to activities will be discussed at the office 4-week follow-up appointment.\n      Patients will be instructed to perform isotonic exercises from weeks 1-6, then eccentric\n      training from 6-10 weeks, and then finally plyometrics and sports-specific exercise around\n      weeks 8-12. Unrestricted activity will be permitted around 12 weeks post procedure. Physical\n      therapy will not be prescribed for the patients in this study. Subjects will follow up at 2,\n      6, 8, and 12 weeks after the procedure over the telephone by a study team member and at week\n      4 in the office by the attending physician. At each visit, a study team member will collect\n      information for the questionnaire rating the subject's pain, function, sleep, general well\n      being, pain medication usage, return to activities, and any complications. At each follow\n      up, subjects will be assessed for primary and secondary outcome measures and adverse events.\n       Patients will be instructed to contact the study team immediately if at any point they have\n      concern for an adverse event.\n\n      Subjects will be blinded to their treatment until the end of their participation in the\n      study."
