The aim of the goal-directed\n      heamodynamic therapy (GDT) is to improve the altered cardiovascular function and to reach\n      the desired intraoperative values of oxygen supply (DO2) and cardiac index (CI). Standard\n      haemodynamic measurements, such as heart rate (HR), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and central\n      venous pressure (CVP) remain relatively unchanged despite reduced blood flow. However, GTD\n      is able to detect early hypo perfusion abnormalities. The aim of goal-directed heamodynamic\n      therapy, based on the titration of fluids and vasoactive drugs to physiological flow-related\n      end points is to reduce perioperative complications, perioperative morbidity and mortality.\n      We hypothesise, that following this treatment regimen results in reduced postoperative\n      complications (primary endpoint) and reduced length of hospital stay (secondary endpoint)."
