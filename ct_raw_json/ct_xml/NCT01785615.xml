  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Little is known regarding the association of individual components of the metabolic syndrome
      (MBS) and prothrombotic, inflammatory and preclinical cardiac structural and functional
      markers in women with this syndrome. Less is known about adequate treatment as the
      pathological mechanism of this syndrome is not well understood.

      The purpose of this study is two fold;

        1. To determine basic differences in biochemical and cardiovascular structural markers in
           women with and those without MBS and their association with the individual components
           of MBS.

        2. To determine the impact of atorvastatin to lower the risk factors of Metabolic
           Syndrome.  Atorvastatin is one of the most effective drugs approved by the United
           States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of high cholesterol.  It
           belongs to a class of drugs called statins and its role in primary prevention is still
           unclear. Thus this population seems to be an ideal group that may benefit from this
           intervention.

      The first phase of the study is an observational phase as previously described. The second
      phase was a prospective evaluation of the effect of a well known &quot;statin&quot; drug (Liptor) on
      different biochemical factors measured in the blood. The eligible study participants had
      blood work done upon enrollment and if criteria was met(according to the Adult Treatment
      Panel III), they were given dietary counseling (NYHA - New York Heart Association Step 1
      diet) as a lead in phase. Lab work was repeated at 3 weeks to evaluate the impact of the
      diet and if participant's profile still met criteria for MBS,randomization for either
      atorvastatin (Liptor) 80mg or placebo (sugar pill) for 12 weeks took place.

    <description>We sought to determine basic differences and frequency of cardiometabolic biological markers such as inflammatory (hsCR), prothrombotic (PAI-I), lipogenic (HDL, Triglycerides, Apolipoprotein-A, Apolipoprotein-B and leptin), oxidative stress (myeloperoxidase), platelet reactivity (ADP and Collagen assays) and structural markers such as Carotid Intima Media Thickening (C-IMT) and simple echo markers (Left ventricular (LV) wall thickness of inter-ventricular septum (IVS), posterior wall (PW), LV mass, left atrial size and fractional shortening) in women with vs. those without the Metabolic Syndrome. The impact of high dose atorvastatin vs. Placebo on these biological markers at 3 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks after randomization was also studied.</description>
