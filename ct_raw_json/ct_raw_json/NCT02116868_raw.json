The analysis of pupillary reflex is a new tool to assess\n      analgesia during the intraoperative and postoperative period.\n\n      During laparoscopic surgery, carbon dioxide insufflation that produce pneumoperitoneum may\n      induce hemodynamics events such as tachycardia or hypertension. These events may be\n      misleading or confusing. Actually, these events are mainly considered as insufficient\n      analgesia. Thus, anesthesiologists deepen analgesia and/or anesthesia by increasing\n      concentration of anesthetics or opioids. These inappropriate actions may induce hypotension\n      and/or bradycardia especially in elderly patients. On the contrary, insufficient analgesia\n      may exist in hypovolemic patients or in patients with neuromuscular blocking agents."
