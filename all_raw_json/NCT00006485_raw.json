Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining flavopiridol with irinotecan\n      in treating patients who have locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors."

Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. During the first\n      week of the second course, patients receive flavopiridol alone on day 1 and irinotecan alone\n      on day 2.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of flavopiridol until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more\n      of 6 patients in the initial cohort experience dose limiting toxicity during the first\n      course of treatment. An additional 10 patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
