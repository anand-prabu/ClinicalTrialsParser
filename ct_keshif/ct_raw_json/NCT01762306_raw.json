Traditionally, because of a larger number\n      of patients, the diagnosis of its cause is performed via fractional curettage under local\n      anesthesia such as paracervical nerve block or intravenous meperidine.\n\n      Pain is one of a common adverse effect of this procedure and this topic should be concerned\n      by a responsible doctor.\n\n      NSAIDs, Diclofenac Potassium in this study, is known as a drug which is effective for pain\n      control and is as effective as coxib in acute pain management. Because of its cost, easy\n      accessible and easy administration, Diclofenac Potassium was selected to be used in this\n      study. Its onset of action is about 1 hour and only one dose of this drug do not cause any\n      serious side effects.\n\n      The hypothesis of this study is that \"Diclofenac Potassium has an additional effectiveness\n      for acute pain control in patients undergoing fractional curettage under paracervical nerve\n      block due to abnormal uterine bleeding\" Double blind randomised controlled trial was\n      performed in this study with 45 patients included in each group."
