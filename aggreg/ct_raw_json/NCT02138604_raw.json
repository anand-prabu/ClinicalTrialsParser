            "textblock": "For patients with chest pain , the ECG remains the most important initial risk assessment\n      tool. Myocardial ischemia or infarction is highly likely in patients with significant ST\n      segment changes on the ECG or elevation in myocardial markers of necrosis. Identification of\n      high-risk patients is more difficult in those with non ischemic ECG and negative markers on\n      presentation.\n\n      One of the most sensitive indices of contractility is the rate of increase of\n      intraventricular pressure during isovolumetric contraction, (left ventricular dP/dt and\n      arterial dP/dt). Dp/dt (dP/dt ejc ) represents the rate of change of pressure during\n      ejection. It has been shown that cardiac contractility and dP/dt decreases during acute\n      myocardial ischemia.\n\n      We theorized that a higher value of dP/dt would be found for non ischemic chest pain than\n      during ischemic chest pain because ischemia reduces myocardial contractility, whereas chest\n      pain of non cardiac origin increases dP/dt by the stress of the pain itself.\n\n      The current study describes a noninvasive plethysmographic dP/dt changes in patients\n      presenting at the emergency department with acute chest pain, which could be added to the\n      diagnostic triage of ischemia in the ED, thus decreasing the number of unnecessary\n      admissions."
