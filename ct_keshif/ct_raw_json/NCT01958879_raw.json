A total of 60 patients with TMJ internal\n      derangement with failed conservative management, were subjected to TMJ arthrocentesis. All\n      arthrocentesis were performed by the same maxillofacial surgeon. Subjects were randomly\n      allocated into two groups (30 cases in each group). Subjects in the group 1 received\n      irrigation with Ringer solution and in the group 2 ,subjects underwent irrigation with\n      Ringer solution with corticosteroid (Dexamethasone )  .Two examiners evaluated\n      Temporomandibular disorder's signs  ( mouth opening,click , crepitus and pain) before, one\n      month and 6 months after arthrocentesis."
