            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will receive radium-223 by\n      vein over about 1 minute at the beginning of every study cycle for 6 cycles.  Every 4 weeks\n      is a study cycle.\n\n      You will need to be well hydrated before each dose by drinking at least 2-3 cups (8 ounces\n      each) of water.\n\n      Do not take additional drugs, including over-the-counter products and herbal/alternative\n      drugs, during the study without talking with the study doctor first.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      You will have a study visit before each dose of radium-223.  The following tests and\n      procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests, as well as\n           to check your prostatic specific antigen (PSA) and testosterone levels.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing.\n\n      At Week 12, you will have bone marrow biopsy and aspiration performed to check the status of\n      the disease and for biomarker testing.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive the study drug for up to 6 doses. You will be taken off study early if the\n      disease gets worse, if you have intolerable side effects, if your study doctor thinks it is\n      in your best interest to stop, or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      End of Treatment Visit:\n\n      After you stop receiving the study drug for any reason, the following tests and procedures\n      will be performed:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  You will have a sodium fluoride PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Blood (about 3-4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine and biomarker tests, as well as\n           to check your PSA and testosterone levels.\n\n        -  Urine will be collected for biomarker testing.\n\n        -  You will have a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy performed for biomarker testing.\n\n      Long-Term Follow-Up:\n\n      The study staff will check up on you about every 6 months after your last dose of study\n      drug. This will consist of a phone call, an e-mail, or a review of your medical records. If\n      you are contacted by phone, the call will last about 5 minutes.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Radium-223 is FDA approved and commercially available for\n      the treatment of metastatic CRPC that has spread to the bones but not to other organs.  It\n      is investigational to look for biomarkers that may be related to CRPC in patients who are\n      receiving radium-223.\n\n      The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.\n\n      Up to 25 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."
