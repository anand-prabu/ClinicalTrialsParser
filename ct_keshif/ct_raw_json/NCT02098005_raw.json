            "textblock": "Chronic spinal pain (CSP) includes chronic low back pain, failed back surgery, chronic\n      whiplash associated disorders, chronic non-traumatic neck pain, etc. The current\n      investigators and others have provided evidence for impaired motor control of spinal muscles\n      in patients with CSP. In addition, there is increasing evidence that central mechanisms,\n      i.e. hyperexcitability of the central nervous system and brain abnormalities (e.g. decreased\n      brain matter density) play a role in CSP. Hence, treatments for CSP should not only address\n      the spinal muscles and joints, but also the brain. Therefore, a modern neuroscience\n      approach, comprising of pain neuroscience education followed by cognition-targeted motor\n      control training, can be applied.\n\n      The scientific objective entails examining the effectiveness of the modern neuroscience\n      approach vs. usual care evidence-based physiotherapy for reducing pain and improving\n      functioning in Flemish patients with CSP. A secondary objective entails examining the\n      effectiveness of the modern neuroscience approach vs. usual care evidence-based\n      physiotherapy for altering brain's structure and function (magnetic Resonance Imaging) in\n      Flemish patients with CSP. Therefore, a multi-center triple-blind randomized controlled\n      trial will be conducted.\n\n      To comply with this scientific objective, 120 CSP patients will be recruited and subjected\n      to the baseline assessment. The baseline assessment includes the assessment of pain\n      (including symptoms of central sensitization and conditioned pain modulation), the\n      assessment of restrictions in functioning, brain imaging, the evaluation of motor control\n      and muscle properties, spinal mobility, and psychosocial correlates. Baseline analysis will\n      provide descriptive statistics and will lead to calculate correlation between the different\n      outcome measures and predictors of pain and dysfunctioning. In a next step, included\n      patients will be randomized to the experimental or control group. Those in the experimental\n      group will receive neuroscience education combined with cognition-targeted motor control\n      training. Those in the control group will be subjected to a control intervention, including\n      back/neck school and general exercises. After the neuroscience education has been given, the\n      experimental subjects will fill in the neurophysiology of pain test. Several follow-up\n      assessments will take place. Part of the assessment (functionality (PDI questionnaire) and\n      psychosocial correlates (Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), pain vigilance and awareness\n      questionnaire (PVAQ), Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK), Illness Perception Questionnaire\n      revised  (IPQ-R)) will be re-evaluated after the first 3 sessions. The complete 'baseline'\n      assessment will be repeated in the month following the treatment complement, rounding up the\n      short-term follow-up assessment. Six months after the baseline assessment, pain, functioning\n      and psychological correlates are assessed in an intermediate online assessment. One year\n      after baseline assessment the complete assessment is repeated for the last time, unless the\n      intermediate assessment indicates that treatment effects are no longer present. Both short\n      and long term treatment effects can be studied and predictors for therapy success can be\n      unraveled. Also correlations between changes in different outcome measures can provide\n      relevant and innovative information.\n\n      The proof of principal suggests a strong effect reported by large effect sizes for pain and\n      disability compared to usual care."
