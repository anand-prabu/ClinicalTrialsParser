      Hemorrhoids is the most common disease in rectum with a prevalence of 30 % of population.
      This means that many patients are referred to surgical specialist reception with diagnosis
      hemorrhoidal disease. The aim of this study is to describe population of patients with
      hemorrhoidal disease that are referred to a specialised colorectal unit and to determine
      what treatment they are given at a general practitioner as well as in colorectal unit.
