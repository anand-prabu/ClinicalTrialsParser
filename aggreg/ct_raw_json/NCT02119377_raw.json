            "textblock": "This is an Internet-based survey of transgender and transsexual (trans) people aged 18 years\n      and older living in Australia.  This population has received limited attention from public\n      health researchers, planners, and practitioners.  However, a growing body of evidence\n      suggests that trans people experience disparities in several important areas of health\n      compared with the population generally.  In particular, trans people are more likely to\n      experience mental health problems (notably depression and anxiety disorders), use alcohol,\n      tobacco, and illicit drugs, and think about or attempt suicide.  Additionally, trans people\n      commonly report that their physical and mental health needs are not met, and underutilise\n      preventive health care.\n\n      Participants were recruited using several non-probability sampling techniques, (including\n      purposive sampling and snowball sampling), because random sampling is not possible with this\n      population.  Medical, social, support, and advocacy networks used by trans people were used\n      to promote the study.  A mixed quantitative and qualitative methodology was used.  Validated\n      quantitative instruments were used to obtain measures of health and well-being, which will\n      be compared against population norms.  Qualitative items complement these measures,\n      providing rich experiential data.\n\n      The investigators hypothesised that:\n\n        -  the prevalence of depressive and anxiety disorders will be higher than for the\n           population generally, and that these conditions will commonly be undiagnosed and\n           untreated;\n\n        -  depressive and anxiety disorders will be associated with risky behaviours, such as\n           tobacco, alcohol, and illicit drug use; and,\n\n        -  trans people will report poor relationships with medical practitioners.\n\n      The investigators hypothesised that poor mental health is a consequence of several\n      interrelated factors: body dysphoria (as a consequence of experiencing difficulty accessing\n      medical treatment to alter sexual characteristics); societal discrimination and stigma\n      (including harassment and violence); institutionalised discrimination (including difficulty\n      changing identifying documents, and exclusion of surgical procedures and related treatments\n      from public and private health systems); social isolation; and the belief held by many\n      clinicians that transsexualism is a mental disorder (which may be a barrier to trans people\n      forming trusting relationships with medical practitioners)."
