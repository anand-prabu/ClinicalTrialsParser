The\n      investigators and others have shown that less toxic preparative regimens (reduced intensity\n      or 'mini' transplants) allow reliable allogeneic engraftment and durable remissions,\n      significantly broadening the population of patients who may be offered this therapy to those\n      who are older and more infirmed.  The field is now focusing on the period post transplant\n      for approaches to immune recovery leading to improved outcomes.\n\n      The primary objective of this registry is to catalogue data from patients who undergo\n      standard of care reduced intensity allogeneic transplantation."
