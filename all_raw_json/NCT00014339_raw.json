Enzyme products such as Wobe-Mugos E may help to reduce the\n      side effects of multiple myeloma therapy. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more\n      effective with or without Wobe-Mugos E in treating multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of chemotherapy with or\n      without Wobe-Mugos E in treating patients who have stage II or stage III multiple myeloma."

Compare the long-term survival of patients with chemotherapy-naive stage II\n      or III multiple myeloma treated with standard melphalan and prednisone with or without\n      adjuvant Wobe-Mugos E. II. Compare the effect of these two regimens on the reduction of the\n      side effects from chemotherapy in these patients, using 2 quality of life questionnaires.\n      III. Compare the effect of these two regimens on tumor response rate and new metastasis\n      development in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study. Patients\n      are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive oral melphalan and oral\n      prednisone on days 1-4. Patients also receive adjuvant enzyme therapy with oral Wobe-Mugos E\n      3 times daily beginning prior to or on day 1 of the first course of chemotherapy. Arm II:\n      Patients receive melphalan and prednisone as in arm I. Patients also receive an oral placebo\n      3 times daily as in arm I. Treatment continues for a minimum of 12 months to up to 4 years\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients continue on melphalan and prednisone on a\n      4-week course until achieving maximum response or plateau phase and then receive 2\n      additional courses of therapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline; at 1, 3, and 6\n      months and every 6 months for up to 4 years during study; and then at end of study. Patients\n      are followed for survival for 1 month after completing the study and all patients receive\n      the enzyme product.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 250 patients (125 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 1.5 years."
