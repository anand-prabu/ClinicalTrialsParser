            "textblock": "The aim of the current study is to examine the role of serotonin on the cognitive parameters\n      of motivation. They are embedded in a conceptual framework of motivation that merges\n      decision-making and reinforcement learning theories. Every action is conceived as path from\n      one state to another. The different states are associated to different values (positive for\n      rewards and negative for punishments), and the different actions to different costs (risk,\n      effort and delay). The tasks are designed such that the sensitivity to the state and action\n      parameters can be inferred by fitting computational models.The primary objective is to\n      characterize the effect of Citalopram 30mg on reward sensitivity, assessed in an incentive\n      force task, in which participants are asked to squeeze a hand grip to win monetary rewards.\n      Secondary objectives are to characterize the effect of Citalopram 30mg on other cognitive\n      parameters of motivation (assessed with a motivational battery that includes rating, choice\n      and learning tasks)."
