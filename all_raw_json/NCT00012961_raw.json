Patients must have more than one outpatient contact during the preceding\n      six months. Each subject will participate in two one-hour interviews, one at baseline and\n      another six months later. An informant, psychiatrist, therapist, etc. will also be\n      interviewed to help validate participant response.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Project work is ongoing."
