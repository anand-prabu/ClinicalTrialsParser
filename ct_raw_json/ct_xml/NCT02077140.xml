    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of MDT-10013 in men and
      women 18 to 80 years of age who are undergoing bunionectomy. The primary objective is to
      determine the analgesic efficacy of MDT-10013 compared with standard of care in the
      treatment of acute postoperative pain after subjects undergo bunionectomy.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Is a female who is pregnant or breastfeeding.

             or delayed wound healing (e.g., autoimmune disorder).

             product or to the opioid medication (oxycodone).

          4. Before surgery, has current orthostatic hypotension (defined as systolic blood
             pressure decrease of at least 20 mm Hg or a diastolic blood pressure decrease of at
             least 10 mm Hg or an increase in heart rate by 20 beats per minute within 3 minutes
             of sitting up or standing).

          5. Has severe asthma, defined as requiring frequent or ongoing treatment to control
             symptoms. Exercise-induced asthma or mild asthma not requiring ongoing treatment may
             not be exclusionary at the discretion of the investigator.

          6. Has a current gastrointestinal disorder associated with bleeding, a history of such a
             disorder, or gastrointestinal inflammatory diseases as Crohn's disease or ulcerative
             colitis.

          7. Has any clinically significant cardiovascular condition as evidenced by physical
             examination, medical history, and/or baseline ECG.

          8. Has evidence of bradycardia as shown by heart rate of &lt;50 beats per minute via
             screening ECG.

          9. Has a known infection with human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B virus, or
             hepatitis C virus.

         10. Has a chronic pain condition that may interfere with the subject's assessment of pain
             postoperatively, as determined by the investigator.

         11. Has any poorly controlled or serious medical conditions, psychiatric illnesses, or
             clinically significant laboratory values that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could compromise the safety of the subject or the scientific integrity of the study
             (e.g., uncontrolled hypertension, autoimmune disease, or clinically relevant symptoms
             of thyroid dysfunction).

         12. Has presence or history of local or systemic malignant disease in the past 5 years
             (history of basal cell carcinoma will be allowed).

         21. Is judged by the investigator not to be a suitable candidate for study treatment and
             pain relief medication on the basis of medical history, concomitant medication, and
             concurrent systemic disease.

         22. Is not stabilized on the following medications for at least 8 weeks prior to dosing:
             selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake
             inhibitors (SNRIs).

         23. Is unable to refrain from taking nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or
             opioids within the 24-hour period prior to surgery.

         24. Has participated in any other clinical trial in the 4 weeks prior to Screening.

         25. Experiences any surgical complication that, in the opinion of the investigator,
             precludes implantation of MDT-10013.
