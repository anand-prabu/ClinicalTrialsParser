Preliminary results have\n      shown that visual field (VF) loss is more highly correlated with retinal blood flow as\n      measured by OCT than any neural structure measured by OCT or other imaging modality.\n      Accordingly, the goal of the proposed project is to improve the diagnostic and prognostic\n      evaluation of glaucoma by further developing novel functional OCT measurements using\n      ultrahigh-speed (70-100 kHz) OCT technology.\n\n      Retinal blood flow, ONH circulation, optic disc rim volume, peripapillary nerve fiber layer\n      volume, and macular ganglion cell complex volume are all pieces of the same glaucoma puzzle.\n      This project will develop novel imaging methods that allow us to look at the whole picture\n      using one tool - ultrahigh-speed OCT."
