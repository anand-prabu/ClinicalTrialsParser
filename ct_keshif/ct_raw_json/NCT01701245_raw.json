The study period begins with a 2 week run-in period, followed by a 4 week\n      comparative period when the subjects are randomized to either active treatment or control\n      1:1. The comparative period will be followed by a period where all subject will receive\n      GammaCore\u00ae for 4 weeks.After the subject signed the Consent Form for participation the\n      baseline (visit1) data will be collected. Subject will be informed how to complete the 2\n      week diary during the run-in period During the run-in period, all subjects will use stable\n      SoC according to their individual prescriptions. The subject will record as CH attack\n      regarding duration and frequency and the use of medication and oxygen.\n\n      Once subjects have finalized the run-in period, they are randomized to continue in 4 weeks\n      comparative period. During this period, the control group continues with stable SoC and the\n      active group is provided with a GammaCore\u00ae device for prophylactic and acute treatment in\n      addition to the stable SoC Subjects stimulate 3 x 2 times daily as part of the prophylactic\n      treatment regimen (cervical vagal nerve). Three 90 second stimulations are self-administered\n      by the subject with 5 minutes between each stimulation on the right side of the neck.\n\n      This preventive stimulation regimen is performed:\n\n        -  First Daily Treatment - within 1 hour of waking\n\n        -  Second Daily Treatment - 7-10 hours following the first daily treatment\n\n      Acute CH attack:\n\n        -  3 x 90 second treatments consecutively at the onset of pain or symptoms. If the attack\n           is not aborted within 15 minutes the subject should be informed to take SOC abortive\n           medication.\n\n        -  If an acute cluster headache attack is treated with the GammaCore\u00ae device, the subject\n           will try to work within the preventive treatment window to avoid a preventive treatment\n           in the 2-hour refractory period following the acute treatment.\n\n      A total of minimally 6 stimulations for the preventive part and as needed for the acute\n      attacks. The active group also continues with the stable SoC during the entire 4 weeks\n      period. Both groups record all CH attacks in the diary together with medication and oxygen\n      use. All adverse events shall also be recorded in the diary.\n\n      The end of the 4 week comparative period marks the completion of the randomized part of the\n      study, however all subjects are provided the option to continue to a 4 week GammaCore\u00ae\n      treatment with the same stimulation parameter as during the 4 week randomization period. All\n      subjects randomized to the SoC group will receive training.\n\n      During the entire study period, subjects are allowed to take rescue medication including\n      oxygen inhalation for abortion of CH attacks. The amount and doses of the medication and\n      oxygen are recorded in the diary."
