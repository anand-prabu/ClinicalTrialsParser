A sample size of 246 subjects with heart failure will be\n      recruited over a 3 year period. All subjects will receive a cardiopulmonary exercise test\n      and 9 supervised exercise training sessions during a 3 week run-in period prior to\n      randomization. Subjects completing 6 of 9 training sessions will be randomized to the HEART\n      Camp Intervention group (HC) or to a standard care (SC) exercise group. The HC intervention\n      group will receive cognitive-behavioral strategies that address the intervention components\n      of knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, behavioral self-management skills and social\n      support. The SC group is provided access to the exercise facility and regular facility staff\n      for the 18 month study period. Our central hypothesis is that the HC group will have\n      significantly better adherence to exercise at 18 months.  We will test our hypothesis with\n      the following Specific Aims: Aim 1. To evaluate the effect of HEART Camp on adherence to\n      exercise (measured by accelerometry and self-report); Aim 2. To evaluate which components of\n      the HEART Camp intervention mediate the effects of the intervention on adherence; Aim 3. To\n      evaluate the effect of HEART Camp on specific health outcomes;  Aim 4. To explore selected\n      demographic variables (race, gender, age) as potential moderators of the effect of the HEART\n      Camp intervention on adherence; and Aim 5. To explore the perceptions and experiences that\n      contextualize exercise adherence."
