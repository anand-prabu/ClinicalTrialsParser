  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Relapse contributes significantly to the chronicity of substance use disorders, one of the
      most costly medical/mental health problems facing our nation.  The incorporation of exercise
      into relapse prevention efforts will address stress, a critical factor in relapse, provide
      other health benefits, and improve overall quality of life.  Combined, these changes will
      reduce the risk of relapse to substance use while also lessening the burden of this
      psychiatric disorder upon society

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About half of all individuals who receive treatment for substance use disorders (SUD)
      relapse within a year. Stress and an individual's biological response to it are significant
      predictors of relapse. Thus, interventions that decrease stress and normalize an
      individual's biological response to stress are desperately needed. Exercise decreases stress
      and improves the body's regulation of stress. The proposed project will utilize exercise as
      a novel relapse prevention intervention with individuals who have recently completed
      inpatient SUD treatment. This project will evaluate the efficacy of a motivational
      intervention for exercise in a randomized clinical trial of 150 SUD patients beginning
      Aftercare treatment at the VA St. Louis Health Care System. Participants will be randomized
      to one of two interventions: (1) standard care (SC), or (2) standard care plus a
      motivational intervention targeting exercise that lasts for six months. Participants are
      followed every three months for one year. Results from this study will advance exercise as a
      new strategy for enhancing stress regulation and prevention of relapse in SUD populations.

    <description>Relapse is assessed during the duration of the study and is a time to event variable so it will be assess over time.  Relapse is defined as drinking alcohol in excess of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol (NIAAA) at-risk guidelines.</description>

    <measure>Change in moderate to vigorous physical activity</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and every three months for one year.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Moderate to vigorous physical activity frequency, duration and intensity will be assessed over time to examine changes in response to the intervention.  Frequency is defined as how often and individual engages in moderate to vigorous physical activity.  Duration is the amount of time (minutes) per episode that individual engages in moderate to vigorous physical activity.  Intensity is defined two ways: (1) self-report rating of intensity and (2) metabolic equivalent of the moderate to vigorous physical activity.</description>

    <description>Stress reactivity is assess via a standardized psychosocial stressor paradigm that induces stress.  Stress is assessed via salivary cortisol and self-report of stress.</description>
