Several imaging methods exist, but are limited\n      by cost, invasiveness, or exposure to radio-isotopes.  Conventional echocardiography is a\n      noninvasive method that allows estimation of left ventricular size and function;  however,\n      quantitative measurements of volume are not widely used due to lack of reproducibility and\n      inaccurate measurements.  Real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is a new technique\n      that can be used to derive volume measurements from a single image acquisition.  We\n      hypothesize that real-time three-dimensional echocardiography is an accurate method for\n      making left ventricular volume measurements.  We therefore propose to measure left\n      ventricular volumes using real-time three-dimensional echocardiography in human subjects and\n      correlate these measurements with magnetic resonance imaging, a more accurate noninvasive\n      method for obtaining these measurements."
