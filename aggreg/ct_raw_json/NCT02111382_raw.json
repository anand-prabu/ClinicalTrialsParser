Studies have shown that the\n      technique may affect both central and autonomous nervous system, modulating some reflexes\n      (Traube-Hering baro signal), and modifying brain cortex electrical activity through central\n      sensitization in subjects with chronic low back pain.\n\n      Thus, investigators hypothesize that the compression of the 4th ventricle may modulate peak\n      alpha frequency (electroencephalographic assessment) and promote physical relaxation in\n      subjects in vigil."
