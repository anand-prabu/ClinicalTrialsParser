Nurses have one of the highest incidences of work\n      related back injuries of any profession.  Over the past 20 years, efforts to reduce\n      work-related injuries in nursing have been largely unsuccessful.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The goal of this study is to reduce the incidence and severity of occupational\n      musculoskeletal injuries in nursing through the redesign of stressful patient handling\n      tasks. This study addresses three objectives: 1) conduct a quantitative, biomechanically\n      based, ergonomic evaluation of the eleven \"at risk\" tasks in nursing practice; 2) redesign\n      the techniques or equipment needed to perform these tasks safely or with reduced risk of\n      musculoskeletal injury; and 3) conduct laboratory- based assessment of the biomechanical\n      benefit of the proposed intervention strategies.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Using a randomized experimental design with a control group, ten \"at risk\" tasks will be\n      evaluated.  The sample included 160 experienced nursing staff.  Data were collected using:\n      1) Caregiver Data Form and Anthropometry Data Sheet; 2) 3-D Electromagnetic Tracking System;\n      3) EMG; and 4) modified Borg Scale for Perceived Comfort.   Include: caregiver\n      characteristics, joint torque, spinal forces, spinal tolerance limit and damage load limit,\n      erector spinae surface EMG, joint angles, percent of population capable of performing each\n      task by gender, velocity of lift, reach, heart rate, and perceived comfort.\n\n      Status:\n\n      This project is complete."
