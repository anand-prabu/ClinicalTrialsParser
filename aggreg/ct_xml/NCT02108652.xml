    <textblock>
      This phase II, single-arm study was designed to evaluate the effect of MPDL3280A treatment
      in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial bladder cancer. Patients will be
      enrolled into 1 of 2 cohorts. Cohort 1 will consist of patients who are treatment-naïve and
      ineligible for platinum-containing therapy. Cohort 2 will contain patients who have
      progressed during or following a prior platinum-based chemotherapy regimen. Patients in both
      cohorts will be given a 1200 mg intravenous (IV) dose of MPDL3280A on Day 1 of 21-day
      cycles. Treatment may continue for up to 16 cycles or 12 months, whichever is first, in the
      absence of toxicity or disease progression.  Patients will be followed for up for 2 years.
      Patients who complete the initial treatment stage of up to 16 cycles may be eligible for
      MPDL3280A re-treatment upon subsequent disease progression during the follow-up period and
      without intervening systemic anti-cancer therapy.
