Patients are randomized to one\n      of five treatment arms based upon a patient's history of antiretroviral therapy (naive vs.\n      experienced).  The five treatment arms are:\n\n        1. ddI plus hydroxyurea placebo.\n\n        2. hydroxyurea (lower dose) plus ddI placebo for 4 weeks; then hydroxyurea (higher dose)\n           plus ddI.\n\n        3. hydroxyurea (higher dose) plus ddI placebo for 4 weeks; then hydroxyurea (higher dose)\n           plus ddI.\n\n        4. hydroxyurea (lower dose) plus ddI.\n\n        5. hydroxyurea (higher dose) plus ddI. After the completion of week 12, patients on\n           combination therapy remain on their current therapy and patients on ddI plus placebo\n           have hydroxyurea replace the placebo at 1 of 2 assigned doses (1:1 randomization).
