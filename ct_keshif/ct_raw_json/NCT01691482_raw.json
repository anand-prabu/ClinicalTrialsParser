Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.",

Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.",

Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is half the difference between the maximum and minimum FEV1 values.",

Variability in daily FEV1 was measured as the fluctuation around the mean FEV1 data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) and the half range.

Variability in daily IC was measured as the fluctuation around the mean IC data collected from Day 1 to Day 10. Variability was measured by the coefficent of variation (CV) and the half range. The CV is the dispersion of the data around the mean, whereas the half range method is half the difference between the maximum and minimum IC values.",

It has been demonstrated that the combination\n      of a short acting beta2-agonist and a short acting anticholinergic yields greater efficacy\n      as measured by FEV1 when compared with the response to the individual short acting\n      bronchodilators.   However, daily bronchial response to these agents is poorly understood.\n      It is also poorly understood how the variation in magnitude of the response to the\n      individual agents and how the variation in response for one agent coincides with the\n      variation in response to the other agent.  This study will seek to define the pattern of\n      response of each individual agent and the relationship between them. The study will also\n      explore if the combination of the two agents leads to less variation in response compared to\n      the individual agents.  This is a randomized, open label, two period cross-over study.\n      Eligible subjects will be randomized to a sequence of either albuterol/salbutamol via\n      metered-dose inhaler (MDI) followed by ipratropium via MDI or the same dose of each\n      bronchodilator given in the opposite order.  Each study period will consist of 10 clinic\n      visits to be conducted over 10 to 14 days."
