            "textblock": "In our experience, women with severe pelvic organ prolapse (POP) frequently have bothersome\n      nocturia. The International Continence Society (ICS) defines nocturia as \"having to wake at\n      night one or more times to void.\" Though some of this nocturia may be secondary to\n      obstructed bladder emptying, the investigators hypothesize that in some women compression of\n      the bilateral ureters due to prolapsed pelvic organs during the day and subsequent relief of\n      that prolapse while the patient lays supine overnight results in nighttime post-obstructive\n      diuresis (inability to concentrate urine) and resultant large nighttime urine volumes and\n      nocturia. Previous case reports have proposed that vaginal and uterine vault prolapse causes\n      obstruction due to descent of the bladder floor which leads to compression of the bilateral\n      ureters between the uterus and the borders of the genital opening. No large prospective\n      studies, however, have evaluated the possible impact of this phenomenon on patients or the\n      possible post-operative changes following surgical correction of POP.\n\n      Using the Nocturnal Enuresis, and Sleep interruption Questionnaire (NNES-Q), voiding\n      diaries, and urine studies, the investigators aim to evaluate the pre-operative and\n      post-operative voiding habits and urinary parameters of women with severe pelvic organ\n      prolapse and bothersome nocturia who undergo colpocleisis. Colpocleisis is a procedure which\n      surgically obliterates the vaginal lumen to treat severe POP in properly counseled patients\n      with >90% satisfaction rates. Other treatments offered to women, such as the laparoscopic or\n      open sacrocolpopexy, uterosacral ligament suspension, and sacrospinous ligament suspension,\n      also offer high rates of success. The investigators aim to determine whether surgical\n      correction of severe pelvic organ prolapse, to be defined as either with colpocleisis,\n      laparoscopic or open sacrocolpopexy, uterosacral ligament suspension, or sacrospinous\n      ligament suspension, results in improvement and/or resolution of nocturia  and\n      post-obstructive diuresis."

            "textblock": "1. Significance or Clinical Relevance of Project:\n\n           Numerous women undergo pelvic organ prolapse surgery every year. The most common\n           reasons for surgical management of POP include symptoms immediately related to the\n           prolapsing organs, such as pelvic pressure, vaginal bulge sensation, vaginal mucosal\n           irritation, as well as defecatory dysfunction, limitations on sexual intercourse, and\n           aesthetic dissatisfaction. When counseling patients about possible surgical management\n           of POP, clinicians would be remiss if they did not address the potential quality of\n           life improvement surgery may provide from a urinary standpoint, as well as possible\n           decreased risk of renal failure. Stress and urge incontinence and urinary urgency are\n           frequently alleviated by restoration of the pelvic floor support, however, nocturia may\n           be treated as well.\n\n        2. Relevant Research of Others:\n\n           Several case reports exist describing urinary obstruction, bilateral hydronephrosis,\n           and acute or chronic renal failure that can occur with severe pelvic organ prolapse. No\n           larger scale prospective descriptive studies exist, however, demonstrating the urinary\n           symptoms or pathophysiology behind the urinary tract obstruction that may accompany\n           pelvic organ prolapse. Also, no prospective studies exist to evaluate the improvement\n           in those symptoms and relief of physiologic obstruction after surgical correction of\n           pelvic organ prolapse.\n\n        3. Methods/Materials:\n\n      Women referred to the urogynecology clinic for management of apical Stage III-IV POP with\n      bothersome nocturia as noted in their initial urogynecologic evaluation who opt for surgical\n      management will be identified for inclusion in the study. In addition to routine\n      urogynecologic and pre-operative work-up, after consenting for the study, they will be asked\n      to complete pre- and post-operative Nocturia, Nocturnal Enuresis, and Sleep interruption\n      Questionnaires (NNES-Q) (appendix), voiding diaries (appendix), and awake and asleep renal\n      nocturia urine panels. Women will serve as their own pre- and post-operative control\n      subjects.\n\n      Enrolled patients will be educated on how to perform the voiding diary and awake and asleep\n      renal nocturia urine panel. The voiding diary will require the patient to measure the date,\n      time, voided urine amount (using a urine hat placed over a toilet), degree of incontinence\n      (dry, moist, soaked), presence or absence of urge to urinate, activity immediately prior to\n      urination episode, and fluid intake for three non-consecutive twenty-four hour periods. The\n      awake and asleep renal nocturia urine panels will require the patient to collect her urine\n      output into two laboratory provided basins for one twenty-four hour period. The \"renal\n      nocturia, awake\" urine panel will be obtained from urine collected from 0600-1800. The\n      \"renal nocturia, asleep\" urine panel will be obtained from urine collected from 1800-0600,\n      ie through the following day.\n\n      Six to thirteen weeks post-operatively, enrolled patients will be asked to repeat the NNES-Q\n      questionnaire, voiding diary, and awake and asleep renal nocturia urine panels as described\n      above.\n\n      Patients who complete all of the aforementioned questionnaires and studies will be\n      reimbursed with a $25 check. This compensation will be disclosed to potential study\n      candidates prior to enrollment in the study.\n\n      The data obtained will be de-identified and then entered into SPSS v. 20 software for\n      statistical analysis."
