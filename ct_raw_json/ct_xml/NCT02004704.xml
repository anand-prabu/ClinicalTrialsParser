      The primary objective of this study is to obtain data regarding the ongoing safety of
      recombinant human acid sphingomyelinase (rhASM) in patients with acid sphingomyelinase
      deficiency (ASD) who are exposed to long-term treatment with rhASM

      The secondary objectives of this study are to obtain data regarding the efficacy of rhASM
      and to characterize rhASM pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics following long-term
      administration.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria :

          -  The patient has completed the treatment period of a previous study of rhASM with an
             acceptable safety profile.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test.

          -  Patients must practice true abstinence or use 2 effective forms of contraception

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  The patient is breast-feeding.

          -  ALT or AST &gt;250 IU/L or total bilirubin &gt;1.5 mg/dL.

          -  The patient is unwilling or unable to abstain from the use of alcohol for 1 day prior
             to and 3 days after each rhASM infusion for the duration of the study.

          -  The patient requires medications that may decrease rhASM

          -  Any new condition or worsening of an existing condition which in the opinionof the
             Investigator would make the patient unsuitable for enrollment, or could interfere
             with the patient participating in or completing the study.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
