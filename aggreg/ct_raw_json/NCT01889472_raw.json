The present investigation evaluates if CPAP compliance would\n      increase when an oral appliance is used in combination with a nasal mask compared to the use\n      of an oro-nasal mask. Eligible patients are those demonstrating a low compliance when using\n      an oro-nasal mask during CPAP therapy. Patients will be treated with automatic CPAP with one\n      of the above-detailed interfaces for 4 weeks and data will be extracted from the machine\n      report in each condition."
