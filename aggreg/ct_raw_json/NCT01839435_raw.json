It mainly affects young adults and is\n      associated to fewer complications and to a short length of stay. The notion of outpatient\n      refers to a shorter hospital length to stay i.e. less than 12 hours without an overnight\n      hospitalization. This notion came from 3 learned society recommendations' (SFCD, ACHBT, and\n      AFCA) and has been considered as a national priority.\n\n      There is no consensus about appendectomy in an outpatient setting."
