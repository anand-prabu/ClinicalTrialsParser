Evaluations of safety, PK, and ECG parameters of cardiac\n      repolarization will be performed on Study Day 1 and Day 2 of Cycle 1.\n\n      Cycles will be repeated every 28 days, until toxicity, progressive disease, patient or\n      investigator decision to discontinue treatment, or until a maximum of six treatment cycles.\n      Patients who are clearly benefitting from the treatment based on anti-cancer disease control\n      and tolerability will be able to continue to receive drug past 6 cycles after discussion\n      with the Sponsor. Tumor assessments will be performed after every 2 cycles during treatment.\n\n      The rationale for conducting this study is based on (a) prior data demonstrating the\n      clinical benefit in advanced solid tumors as defined by tumor response or stable disease for\n      at least 4 months, (b) tolerability of TH-302 at the proposed dose, and (c) a requirement to\n      perform a dedicated ECG study to address the clinical evaluation of the potential for QT/QTc\n      interval prolongation of TH-302."
