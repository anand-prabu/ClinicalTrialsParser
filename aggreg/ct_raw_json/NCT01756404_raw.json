Within each group, 12 volunteers will be given canagliflozin\n      once or twice daily and 4 volunteers will be given placebo (inactive medication) once or\n      twice daily for 14 days. The dose of canagliflozin will be different for each of the 5\n      groups and the second group will not begin treatment until at least 21 days after the first\n      group start treatment. This 21-day gap will be applied to all subsequent groups.  Each\n      volunteer will participate in the study for approximately 58 days."
