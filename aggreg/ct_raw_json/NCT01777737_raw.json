This novel therapeutic strategy, with very encouraging preliminary data is\n      based on its pathophysiological basis, primarily related to the elimination of Pneumocystis\n      colonization. That elimination, could serve as a potent weapon for reducing morbidity and\n      mortality and the cost associated with this devastating disease."
