  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients with intrinsic positive
      end-expiratory pressure (PEEPi), Neurally adjusted ventilatory assist (NAVA) reduce work of
      breathing and trigger delay at any external  positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEPe) level
      compared with pressure-support ventilation (PSV)
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients randomly underwent a 30 mins PSV and NAVA crossover ventilation (15 mins each)
      at progressive PEEPe levels. Progressive levels of PEEPe were applied stepwise in increments
      of 40% of baseline static PEEPi, every 30 mins, from zero to 160% of baseline static PEEPi
      during the protocol (0, 40%, 80%, 120% and 160% of static PEEPi, respectively). During PSV,
      pressure support level was set to meet a Vt 6ml/kg, I/E cycling was 30% of the maximum
      inspiratory peak flow, flow trigger was 1L/min, and inspired fraction of oxygen (FiO2) was
      set to the similar level before the study protocol. During NAVA, NAVA Level was set at 15
      cmH2O / µV and a peak airway pressure limit was set in order to apply the same inspiratory
      pressure support at each PEEPe level during PSV. The new setting of NAVA was defined as
      NAVA15. Moreover the trigger was set at 0.5 µV and the I/E cycling fixed at 70% of the peak
      of EAdi. During the entire protocol, FiO2 and peak air way pressure were maintained the same
      levels at each PEEPe level between PSV and NAVA. Arterial blood gases were measured at the
      end of PSV or NAVA15 ventilation at each PEEPe level.
