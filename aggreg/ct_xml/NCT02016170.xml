      Recently, two new oral P2Y12 antagonists have been approved for clinical use: prasugrel, a
      third generation thienopyridine, and ticagrelor, a first in class
      cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP). These agents have been shown to be associated with
      more potent platelet inhibitory effects compared with clopidogrel. In addition, both agents
      have shown to be superior to clopidogrel in preventing recurrent ischemic events in the
      setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS).  Understanding how to switch patients from
      prasugrel to ticagrelor is an unmet need of clinical interest.  The proposed PD
      investigation will have a prospective, randomized, parallel design aimed to show that
      switching patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor provides similar levels of platelet
      inhibition.

    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy consisting of aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist is the
      cornerstone of treatment for secondary prevention of thrombotic events in patients with
      coronary artery disease. Recently, two new oral P2Y12 antagonists have been approved for
      clinical use: prasugrel, a third generation thienopyridine, and ticagrelor, a first in class
      cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP). These agents have been shown to be associated with
      more potent platelet inhibitory effects compared with clopidogrel. In addition, both agents
      have shown to be superior to clopidogrel in preventing recurrent ischemic events in the
      setting of acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Therefore, current guidelines recommend prasugrel
      or ticagrelor (as first line therapy according to European Society of Cardiology) in ACS
      patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI).  Despite the broader
      indication for ticagrelor (also medically managed ACS) and its mortality benefit, prasugrel
      has a higher uptake than ticagrelor in the US market, likely due to its earlier approval.
      Further, implementation of prasugrel into institutional protocols, particularly for ST
      elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients undergoing primary PCI, may also be a
      reason for the slow uptake of ticagrelor. However, many clinicians would indeed consider
      ticagrelor as the long-term treatment of choice for a variety of reasons. Therefore,
      understanding how to switch patients from prasugrel to ticagrelor is an unmet need of
      clinical interest. However, currently, there are no data on the pharmacodynamic (PD) effects
      of switching from prasugrel to ticagrelor. The proposed PD investigation will have a
      prospective, randomized, parallel design aimed to show that switching patients from
      prasugrel to ticagrelor provides similar levels of platelet inhibition. This study will
      provide insights on the PD effects of switching and will help clinicians to choose the most
      appropriate schema to avoid complications related to inadequate antiplatelet therapy in
      patients with coronary artery disease if switching from prasugrel to ticagrelor is desired.
