Besides, For the studies in\n      the current review that have looked at the Lauren classification in relation to HER2, a\n      higher level of overexpression or amplification was found in the intestinal phenotype\n      compared to the diffuse or mixed types. As lauren classification was reported as an\n      independent prognostic factor result in favored outcomes in gastric cancer (GC), there may\n      probably be histologic bias exists when compare overall survival (OS) between HER2 statuses\n      without controlling this confounding. Similarly, patients with different disease settings\n      (early stage and advanced stage; resectable and metastatic) affect outcomes either.\n\n      In this study, the investigators will retrospectively analyze HER2 status and lauren\n      classification in 800 gastric patients who received gastrectomy in the Cancer Center of Sun\n      Yat-Sen University between January 1996 and December 2006 with formalin-fixed and paraffin-\n      embedded tumor tissue samples. To avoid potential influence by histologic classifications\n      and disease settings, the investigators assess difference in OS between HER2 positive and\n      HER2 negative groups in resectable Lauren classification of GCs, and further evaluate the\n      prognostic value of HER2 status according to tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stages."
