            "textblock": "It is well established that individuals living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n      (COPD) demonstrate significant improvements following a formal rehabilitation program. The\n      problem lies in the fact that these functional improvements diminish over a 12 month period.\n      This decline in function is associated with decreased participation, a decline in health\n      status, and an increased need to access the healthcare system. The objective of this project\n      is to evaluate the effectiveness of a post-rehabilitation community-based exercise program\n      for individuals with COPD and compare the outcomes with those achieved through standard\n      care.\n\n      Individuals with COPD who have completed a previous rehabilitation program will be enrolled\n      in the study. Study participants will be assigned randomly to either a year-long community\n      exercise program or usual care. Those assigned to the community program will exercise twice\n      weekly at a local community centre supervised by trained fitness instructors. A case manager\n      will facilitate the transition from the hospital rehabilitation program to the community\n      centre. The case manager will also be available to participants and instructors for consult\n      as needed. Continuing to build on an established partnership with the City of Toronto, the\n      case manager will ensure fitness instructors receive specialized training in order to\n      properly supervise and support the individuals with COPD.  Participants assigned to usual\n      care group will receive standard care by their family physician and respiratory specialist.\n       Functional status will be evaluated before the program begins and again at 6-months and\n      1-year. The outcome of each group will be compared to determine the effectiveness of the\n      community exercise program. It is hypothesized that individuals who participate in the\n      community exercise program will have better function and quality of life versus those\n      individuals who receive standard care."
