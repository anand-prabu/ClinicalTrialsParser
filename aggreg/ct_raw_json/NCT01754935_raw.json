In\n      autoimmune diseases, JAK3 is an essential component of the immune signaling cascade.  This\n      cascade ultimately contributes to abnormal immune response that results in chronic\n      inflammation and, in the case of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), irreversible damage to cartilage\n      and bones. Selective inhibition of JAK3 offers a new disease modifying approach to the\n      treatment of RA, and a broad range of other autoimmune diseases."
