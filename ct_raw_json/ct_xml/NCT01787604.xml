      Authors hypothesize that there is no difference in aortic insufficiency more than grade 2+
      between the standard aortic valve reimplantation procedure and aortic root reimplantation
      procedure more than 15%.

      A single blind prospective randomized non-inferiority study is conducted. Our hypothesis is
      that there is no difference in aortic insufficiency more than grade 2+ between the standard
      aortic valve reimplantation procedure and aortic root reimplantation procedure more than
      15%. If there is truly no difference between groups (Aortic Root Reimplantation Procedure
      and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure), then total 40 patients for both groups are
      required to be 70% sure that the upper limit of a one-sided 95% confidence interval (or
      equivalently a 90% two-sided confidence interval) would exclude a difference in favour of
      the Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure of more than 14%.  The blinding process is applied
      to a patient, who is informed about received valve-sparing operation, but don't know the
      type of the last. The study was approved by Institutional Review Board. Depending on a type
      of the procedure, the patients are divided into two groups: Aortic Root Reimplantation
      Procedure  group includes 30 patients and Aortic Valve Reimplantation Procedure group
      consists of 30 patients. Randomization is conducted intraoperatively by using accidental
      sampling after examining the aortic valve and making a decision on the possibility of a
      valve-sparing operation.
