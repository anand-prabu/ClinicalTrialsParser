A total of 32 patients will be enrolled to this study\n      over a two year enrollment period.  Following informed consent and eligibility check, all\n      patients will start oral regorafenib therapy (160 mg  daily for 3 weeks on / 1 week off; 28\n      day cycle) and will continue therapy until progression or patient withdrawal.  Patients will\n      undergo radiological staging after the first two cycles of regorafenib therapy.  Patients\n      with progressive disease will be removed from the study. Patients who have at least stable\n      disease will continue regorafenib therapy, at the Investigator's discretion, and will be\n      radiologically restaged bimonthly."
