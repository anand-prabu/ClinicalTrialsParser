            "textblock": "Pregnancy-associated diabetes, known as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is associated\n      with an increased lifetime risk of developing diabetes mellitus (DM) or pre-diabetes.  Up to\n      30% of women with GDM will continue have abnormal blood glucose tests 6 or more weeks after\n      delivery. Early diagnosis and treatment of continued impaired glucose metabolism or DM is\n      essential because serious health problems can result.\n\n      Current guidelines recommend a 75-gram, 2-hour glucose tolerance test (GTT) 6 or more weeks\n      after delivery for women diagnosed with GDM in order to identify those with continued DM or\n      impaired glucose metabolism. However, approximately half of these women do not get glucose\n      testing after delivery. The ability to test women while they are still hospitalized after\n      having a baby could greatly increase diagnosis, care and treatment of women with abnormal\n      glucose metabolism.\n\n      Our objective is to determine if a 75-gram, 2-hour GTT administered to women with GDM two to\n      four days after delivery can identify those who will have an abnormal GTT at 6-12 weeks\n      after delivery."
