Twenty surgeons perform TKAs at\n      our institution, with approximately 400 TKAs implanted per year.\n\n      The PSI system of Smith &Nephew\u00ae (Patient-Matched Cutting Blocks [PMCB]; the VISIONAIRE\u00ae\n      technology) is applied. The preoperative image modality is based on a long leg standing\n      X-ray as well as an MRI of the knee. The Genesis II\u00ae Endoprosthesis (Smith & Nephew\u00ae) is\n      used as the TKA implant.\n\n      This study is a observational monocentric prospective study.\n\n      Estimated enrollment: 70 Enrollment time: September 2011-October 2012 Primary outcome:\n      Alignment\n\n      The postoperative X-rays (AP, lateral view, and long leg standing), taken 7-to-10 days after\n      surgery are evaluated in terms of component position and restoration of the mechanical\n      alignment. X-rays are routinely monitor-guided but not calibrated at our institution.\n\n      As a secondary outcome the learning curve is evaluated using the following parameters\n      collected during surgery: the fit of the cutting blocks, changes of the implant size, bony\n      recuts, soft tissue releases, and changes in inlay size. Gap balancing was subjectively\n      judged by the operating surgeon. Operation time, number of blood transfusions, and early\n      postoperative complications were recorded within the first 14 days after surgery."
