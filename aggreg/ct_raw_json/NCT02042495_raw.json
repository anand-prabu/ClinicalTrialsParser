This is a phase IIa\n      study of metformin to be used to the pre-operative period of women diagnosed with\n      endometrial cancer by comparing their endometrial biopsy specimens taken at their initial\n      visit and after 4-6 weeks of treatment of metformin on the day of their surgical staging."
