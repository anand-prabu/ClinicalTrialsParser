The urine collected here will be analysed to check that the supplement is equivalent\n      to the food. Stage 2 will only be conducted with supplement and placebo.\n\n      Healthy male volunteers with higher (than average) blood uric acid will be selected and will\n      be asked to consume a standard supplement/placebo added to their own diet for 4 weeks per\n      phase. Two arms are separated by 4 weeks resting period: quercetin supplement and placebo.\n      Blood and urine samples will be taken every other week to detect any changes of uric acid\n      and other biomarkers.\n\n      ----- i) Quercetin is found in a variety of foods including apples, berries, brassica\n      vegetables, capers, grapes, onions, shallots, tea, and tomatoes, as well as many seeds,\n      nuts, flowers, barks, and leaves.\n\n      ii) Uric acid, a compound found in both in the human body and urine, is produced by the\n      breakdown of purines, which are nitrogen-containing compounds in substances such as nucleic\n      acids (DNA). They enter the circulation from digestion of certain foods, drinks (alcoholic\n      beverages like beer and wine) or from normal breakdown and turnover of cells in the body.\n      Most uric acid is removed by the kidneys and disposed of in the urine; the remainder is\n      excreted in the stool."
