            "textblock": "This is a study to determine the safety and efficacy of the drug, mebendazole, when used in\n      combination with three additional chemotherapy agents, vincristine, carboplatin, and\n      temozolomide, for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors.  Mebendazole is a drug used to\n      treat infections with intestinal parasites and has a long track record of safety in humans.\n       Recently, it was discovered that mebendazole may be effective in treating cancer as well,\n      in particular brain tumors. Studies using both cell cultures and mouse models demonstrated\n      that mebendazole was effective in decreasing the growth of brain tumor cells.\n\n      This study focuses on the treatment of a category of brain tumors called low-grade gliomas.\n      Low-grade gliomas are tumors arising from the glial cells of the central nervous system and\n      are characterized by slower, less aggressive growth than that of high-grade gliomas.  The\n      category of low-grade glioma includes many subtypes.  One such subtype, pilomyxoid\n      astrocytoma, is a grade II tumor which has an aggressive nature with an increased rate of\n      recurrence and decreased survival rate compared to other low-grade gliomas.\n\n      Low-grade gliomas are often able to be treated by observation alone if they receive a total\n      surgical resection.  However, tumors which are only partially resected and continue to grow\n      or cause symptoms, or those which recur following total resection require additional\n      treatment, such as chemotherapy.  Due to their more aggressive nature, pilomyxoid\n      astrocytomas, even when totally resected, will often be treated with chemotherapy.  The\n      current first-line treatment at our institution for these low-grade gliomas involves a\n      three-drug chemotherapy regimen of vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide.  However,\n      based on our data from our own historical controls, over 50% of patients with pilomyxoid\n      astrocytomas will continue to have disease progression while on this treatment.  We believe\n      that mebendazole in combination with vincristine, carboplatin, and temozolomide may provide\n      an additional therapeutic benefit with increased progression-free and overall survival for\n      low-grade glioma patients, particularly for those with pilomyxoid astrocytomas."

            "textblock": "Pilomyxoid astrocytoma is a variant subtype of pilocytic astrocytoma, which follows a more\n      variable and aggressive course than that of pilocytic astrocytomas with decreased duration\n      of disease-free and overall survival. There is no current standard of care in treating\n      patients with pilomyxoid astrocytoma. Surgery is often the primary treatment strategy if the\n      tumor is amenable to resection.  However, gross total resection is often not possible due to\n      the common locations of these lesions and the severe morbidity associated with aggressive\n      resection. The long-term biological behavior of residual tumor often necessitates the use of\n      adjuvant chemotherapy to improve disease progression and recurrence rates.  To date, there\n      are no published clinical trials focused specifically on the treatment of pilomyxoid\n      astrocytoma.\n\n      In 2002, a Children's Oncology Group phase II pilot study was initiated to evaluate the\n      combination of carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide in children with progressive or\n      symptomatic low-grade gliomas. The full data from this study has yet to be released and the\n      latest reports do not give outcome results specific to the group of patients with pilomyxoid\n      astrocytomas. This regimen is the current first-line treatment used at our institution for\n      children with pilomyxoid astrocytoma.  However, based on our own historical patient data,\n      over 50% of patients with pilomyxoid astrocytoma will continue to progress while on this\n      treatment.\n\n      Mebendazole is a benzimidazole drug developed for the treatment of human parasitic\n      infections. Recently, mebendazole has displayed efficacy in numerous cancer models including\n      glioblastoma multiforme, an aggressive high-grade form of glioma. A mouse glioblastoma model\n      demonstrated that mebendazole significantly inhibited tumor growth and extended mean\n      survival by 63% compared to controls. The combination of mebendazole and temozolomide\n      displayed a similar anti-tumor effect, prolonging survival by 72% over controls. The\n      pre-clinical efficacy of mebendazole in glioblastoma multiforme, its ability to cross the\n      blood brain barrier, and its track record of safety make mebendazole a strong candidate for\n      the treatment of low-grade glioma.\n\n      This is a phase I-II pilot study of mebendazole in combination with our current regimen of\n      carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide for treatment of pediatric patients with\n      pilomyxoid astrocytoma, and other progressive or symptomatic low-grade gliomas.  We believe\n      that mebendazole in combination with our current regimen may provide an additional\n      therapeutic benefit for low-grade glioma patients, particularly those with pilomyxoid\n      astrocytoma.\n\n      This pilot study includes both phase I and II portions.  The objective of the phase I\n      portion is to determine if the standard dose of mebendazole 100 mg twice daily is\n      \"well-tolerated\" when used in combination with the current three-drug regimen.  Mebendazole\n      will be given in combination with carboplatin, vincristine, and temozolomide in cohorts of\n      three patients in an effort to determine if this four-drug combination is \"well-tolerated\".\n      The four-drug regimen will be considered \"well-tolerated\" if none or one of the initial\n      three-to-six enrolled patients has a severe adverse event related to therapy after one\n      induction cycle (10 weeks) of treatment.\n\n      In the phase II portion of the study, potential subjects will be offered the option to\n      participate in the study, to receive mebendazole with the three other drugs (CVT+M). Those\n      who do not wish to receive mebendazole will then be given the option to enroll as a control\n      and receive the three current drugs alone (CVT). Treatment will take place over a period of\n      70 weeks. After one cycle of induction chemotherapy (10 weeks duration), evaluation will be\n      performed to assess response. Patients with stable disease or decreasing tumor size will\n      continue maintenance therapy with an additional six 10-week maintenance cycles. Patients who\n      demonstrate progression following the induction cycle will be taken off-study to continue\n      treatment.  Following completion of therapy, patients will be monitored to assess event-free\n      and overall survival.  Data will be compared between the CVT+M and CVT treatment arms.\n\n      For the phase II portion of the study, the outcome variables of interest are\n      progression-free and overall survival.  Survival will be estimated using the Kaplan-Meier\n      Product-Limit Method and compared using the log-rank test.  Patients who are lost to\n      follow-up or who are alive at the end of the study will be considered 'censored' for the\n      survival analysis.  Similarly, patients who have not progressed (or who have not died) as of\n      their last known follow-up, will be considered 'censored' for the time-to-progression\n      analysis."
