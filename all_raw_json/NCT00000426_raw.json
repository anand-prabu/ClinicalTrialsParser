We placed women aged 19-27 who take in low amounts of calcium in their\n      diets in one of two groups. We will give women in one group a placebo (inactive pill) and\n      women in the other group 1500 milligrams of calcium per day (as calcium carbonate). We will\n      monitor the results by looking at the change in bone mineral density measured at the hip,\n      total body, forearm, and spine. Treatment will last 3 years."

We accept women aged\n      19-27 on the basis of good health and the 7-day food diary demonstrating a dietary\n      calcium-to-protein ratio (in milligrams:grams) that does not exceed 13. The outcome variable\n      is the change in BMD at hip, total body, forearm, and spine. Treatment lasts for 3 years. We\n      expect that bone mass will increase in both groups but will increase to a greater extent in\n      the calcium-supplemented group than in the nonsupplemented group."
