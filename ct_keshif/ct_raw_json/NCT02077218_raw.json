Patients who have undergone a stem cell\n      transplant are at an especially high risk for CAD, and current diagnostic tests are invasive\n      and sometimes fail. A CT scan involves a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the\n      body taken from different angles. The pictures are created by a computer linked to an x-ray\n      machine. Studying samples of blood from patients who have undergone a stem cell transplant\n      in the laboratory may help doctors identify and learn more about biomarkers related to CAD.\n      Using a CT scan in combination with biomarker analysis may be a better and less-invasive way\n      to diagnose CAD."
