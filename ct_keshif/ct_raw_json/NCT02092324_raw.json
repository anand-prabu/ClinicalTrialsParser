Ruxolitinib\n      phosphate may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for\n      cells to reproduce. This trial also studies the genetic makeup of patients. Certain genes in\n      cancer cells may determine how the cancer grows or spreads and how it may respond to\n      different drugs. Studying how the genes associated with CNL and aCML respond to the study\n      drug may help doctors learn more about CNL and aCML and improve the treatment for these\n      diseases."

To determine the proportion of patients with chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) and\n      atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) who have a hematologic response to ruxolitinib\n      (ruxolitinib phosphate) (partial response [PR], complete response [CR], complete response,\n      partial [CRp]).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the frequency of grade 3 or 4 hematologic and non-hematologic adverse events\n      experienced by subjects during therapy with ruxolitinib.\n\n      II. To determine whether hematologic responses correlate with certain types of mutations in\n      colony stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) and reduction in mutant CSF3R allele burden in\n      the peripheral blood.\n\n      III. To determine the maximum clinical responses for each subject and the median duration of\n      maximum clinical responses.\n\n      IV. To determine the mean % reduction of spleen size, estimated by the longest dimension in\n      the cranio-caudal axis as measured by ultrasound compare to baseline.\n\n      V. To determine the mean % reduction of total symptom score as measured by a modified\n      Myeloproliferative Neoplasm Symptom Assessment Form version 2.0 (MPN-SAF) compared to start\n      of study (day 1, cycle 1).\n\n      VI. To determine overall survival in subjects who complete a minimum of 6 cycles.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive ruxolitinib phosphate orally (PO) every other day, once daily (QD), or\n      twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 24 courses (96 weeks) in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up within 2 weeks and at 4-6\n      weeks."
