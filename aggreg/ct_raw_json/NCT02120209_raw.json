The first step of an\n      efficient and cost-effectiveness strategy of fall prevention is the screening of individuals\n      at higher risk of falls. Recently, a brief geriatric assessment (BGA) composed of a few\n      number of items has demonstrated to successfully predict the risk of prolonged LHS (5). We\n      hypothesized that the use of the BGA items would make it possible to predict the occurrence\n      of falls among older inpatients."
