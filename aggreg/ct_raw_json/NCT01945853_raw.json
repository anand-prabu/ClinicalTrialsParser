These results will be correlated to the ALS Functional Rating Scale - Revised\n      (ALSFRS-R) score to assess if any changes in MRI can be predictive in the disability of the\n      ALS patients at baseline and at 6 month intervals. The participants will be asked to return\n      every 6 months for a neurological examination, ALSFRS-R assessment, measurement of the vital\n      capacity and MRI as outlined above to monitor progression of the disease."
