In the preclinical setting, everolimus was able to\n      improve the activity of sorafenib. Sorafenib and everolimus, by hitting crucial pathways\n      which are essential for osteosarcoma cell proliferation and survival, with an entirely\n      different approach aimed to overcome the resistance to standard  chemotherapy showed by\n      relapsed osteosarcoma. In this trial, all patients will be treated with sorafenib and\n      everolimus at the dosage of 800 mg and 5 mg per day, respectively. Both drugs have to be\n      taken orally. The treatment will be continued until progression or unacceptable toxicities.\n      The objective of the present trial is to obtain a 50% rate of patients alive and free from\n      progression of their disease 6 months after trial enrolment. The disease will be evaluated\n      every 2 months with a CT scan."
