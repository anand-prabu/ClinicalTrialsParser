  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Distal radius fractures are one of the most commonly seen fractures in children.
      Traditionally, minimally angulated or non-displaced distal radius fractures are treated with
      short or long-arm cast immobilization for up to 8 weeks. The traditional fiberglass casts
      used must be kept dry to prevent inflammation and potential infection.  If a fiberglass cast
      gets wet, it must be removed and replaced.  In general, waterproof casting has been shown to
      improve patient comfort and overall satisfaction.

      We intend to explore the efficacy of a new, waterproof cast made of a hybrid mesh in the
      treatment of minimally angulated distal radius fractures in children using a randomized,
      controlled, cross-over study design.   We will include patients between 4 and 14 years of
      age with minimally angulated distal radius fractures (&lt;15 degrees of angulation on sagittal
      or coronal planes) presented to the Orthopaedic Institute for Children Urgent Care Facility
      within 7 days of injury. As determined by a power analysis, a total of 26 patients will be
      enrolled in the study.

      Patients eligible for the study will be randomized into one of two equally sized (n=13)
      groups:  patients in Group 1 will receive a short arm cast made of the waterproof hybrid
      mesh material and patients in Group 2 will receive a regular fiberglass cast.  Both groups
      will follow-up at two weeks for clinical and radiological evaluation, after which they will
      be transitioned into a regular fiberglass cast (Group 1) or a hybrid mesh waterproof cast
      (Group 2) for an additional two weeks.  This crossover will allow both groups to experience
      each type of cast.  After four weeks of immobilization, patients in both groups will
      discontinue casting and be advised to avoid contact sports or strenuous activities until
      week 8.

      Patients in both groups will follow up 8 weeks after initial treatment for clinical and
      radiological evaluation to evaluate range of motion, pain, and fracture alignment. Physical
      function will be evaluated at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using the Activities Scale for Kids -
      Performance, a validated, highly reliable, self-reported measure that assesses physical
      function in children between 5 and 15 years.  Pain will be evaluated using the Faces Pain
      Scale, a validated, highly reliable scale commonly used in the pediatric population.
      Patient satisfaction will be measured at Weeks 1, 2, and 4, and the radiographs at Week 8
      will be compared with initial radiographs to assess fracture displacement and angulation.
      Skin changes will be assessed at week 2 and week 4 by an independent observer blinded to the
      type of cast that has been removed and digital photographs will be obtained and analyzed
      using ImageJ Image Processing and Analysis Software to calculate the surface area of any
      described skin changes as a percentage of total skin area originally covered by the cast.
      Itching will be assessed at weeks 1, 2, and 4 using a visual analogue scale in which a
      horizontal line of 100 mm will be presented to the patient with &quot;no itching&quot; at the left end
      of the scale and &quot;strongest itching&quot; at the right end.

      We hope to determine whether the new, waterproof cast can result in similar clinical
      outcomes and patient satisfaction for distal radius fractures as compared with the
      traditional fiberglass cast.
