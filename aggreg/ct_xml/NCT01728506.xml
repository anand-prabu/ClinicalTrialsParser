  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of a behavioral weight loss and
      exercise intervention delivered via the internet at different cancer centers in New England.
       The investigators hypothesize that participants will lose 7% of their body weight.  The
      research is being done because many women who are treated for breast cancer are overweight
      and treatment for breast cancer is often accompanied by weight gain.  Individuals who are
      overweight may be more likely to have their breast cancer come back.  Also women who
      exercise at least three hours a week seem to have less chance of their cancer coming back.
      The investigators hope to identify an effective weight loss and exercise intervention for
      breast cancer survivors that can be easily accessed by many people.

      This study is designed to determine the feasibility of conducting a distantly
      delivered-weight loss and exercise intervention for patients who have been treated for
      breast cancer at three cancer centers, and to evaluate the efficacy of an Internet-based
      behavioral weight loss and exercise intervention delivered to overweight/obese breast cancer
      survivors in three New England locations.

      Participants will be recruited from three New England Cancer Centers - the Vermont Cancer
      Center, Norris Cotton Cancer Center at Dartmouth University and the University of
      Massachusetts Cancer Center.  Participants from each center will undergo baseline
      assessments that include diet assessment, body measurements (height, weight, etc), a
      physical activity assessment and be asked to complete a series of questionnaires.

      Patients that meet the minimum requirements will be enrolled on the study.  They will
      participate in weekly on-line &quot;chats&quot; about behavioral and diet modifications led by a
      qualified facilitator.  Participants will also engage in increasing amounts of aerobic
      activity (typically walking) throughout the course of the intervention.  The intervention
      lasts 6 months.  At the end of those 6 months, participants will have the same assessments
      that were collected at baseline.  Following the collection of those assessments,
      participants will have completed the study.
