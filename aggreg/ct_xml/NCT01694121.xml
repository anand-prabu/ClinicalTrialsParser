  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of the MEN Count intervention, an HIV
      intervention and prevention program for heterosexual Black men. The MEN Count model
      integrates HIV risk reduction and gender-equity counseling with housing and employment case
      management via multiple one-on-one sessions delivered by a peer case manager over 60-90 day
      period. MEN Count was developed and pilot tested using a CBPR approach via funding from an
      NIH R21, in Boston, MA. Similar CBPR methods accompanied by a more rigorous evaluation
      design (i.e., a randomized controlled trial- RCT) will be used to test MEN Count in an
      employment training community service agency for Black men in Philadelphia (NCCF). Study
      participants (N=504) will be Black men reporting heterosexual risk for HIV [unprotected sex
      with a woman in the past 30 days and 2+ female sex partners in the past 6 months] and either
      current unemployment or homeless in the past 6 months. To evaluate the effectiveness of MEN
      Count, a two-armed RCT will be conducted in which participants will be randomized to receive
      either MEN Count or an attention comparison program similar to MEN Count in structure but
      focused on general men's health- nutrition, exercise and primary health care utilization. We
      will assess program impact on reduction in number of unprotected sex episodes and incident
      cases of STI (Chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis) via survey and STI testing, respectively, at
      baseline and 6 and 12 month follow-ups. Additionally, quality assurance and process
      evaluation efforts will be conducted to ensure high quality program adherence and delivery,
      as well as to support program replication should the model prove effective.
