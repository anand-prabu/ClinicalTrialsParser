      The purpose of the study is to evaluate non-inferiority of warfarin monotherapy to warfarin
      plus aspirin in patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) and prior (&gt;12 months) coronary
      stenting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been reported that 5-10% of patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention
      (PCI) have concomitant AF. Most of those patients have an indication for oral
      anticoagulation (OAC) to prevent stroke or systemic thromboembolism, and also for
      antiplatelet therapy (APT) to prevent ischemic cardiac events, particularly stent thrombosis
      (ST). However, combined use of OAC and ATP is associated with increased risk of major
      bleeding. Thus, we need to balance the risk for stroke or systemic thromboembolic events and
      coronary events against the risk for bleeding.

      The AF guideline of European Society of Cardiology (ESC) published in 2010 recommended OAC
      alone with vitamin-K antagonist (VKA) as life-long antithrombotic therapy after 12 months of
      combined use of OAC plus APT in AF patients undergoing coronary stenting. However, no
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and few observational data support this recommendation.
      Aspirin monotherapy is the commonly used APT regimen in non-AF patients beyond 1 year after
      coronary stenting. No APT coverage after coronary stenting was reported to be associated
      with increased risk for ST. It is currently unknown whether OAC is equally effective as
      aspirin in preventing very late ST beyond 1 year after stenting, although  several RCTs have
      shown that VKA was at least as effective as aspirin for the secondary prevention of ischemic
      cardiac events in patients mostly without coronary stent.

      Therefore, we planned a prospective randomized controlled open label trial comparing
      warfarin alone versus warfarin plus aspirin in AF patients beyond 1 year after coronary
      stenting.

      The patient enrollment period is 1-year and follow-up duration is at least 1-year.
      Therefore, the anticipated mean follow-up duration is 1.5-year.
