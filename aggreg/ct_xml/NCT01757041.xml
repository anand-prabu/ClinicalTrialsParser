  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sub-Saharan Africa (sSA) has the highest regional rates of perinatal mortality worldwide.
      Group B Streptococcus (GBS) has been identified as a leading cause of early onset neonatal
      sepsis (EOS, in &lt;7 days of life) in sSA. In other regions, maternal carriage is associated
      with early onset neonatal sepsis, but in addition, other adverse perinatal outcomes
      (stillbirths, early neonatal death, low birth weight and prematurity). Robust data on
      maternal GBS carriage in sSA and its burden on adverse perinatal outcomes are lacking, with
      important consequences for public health interventions.

      Through investigation of maternal carriage and perinatal outcomes at three different sites:
      rural, semi-rural and urban, this study will provide a comprehensive description of the
      burden of GBS in coastal Kenya, informing public health policy and driving forward
      interventions. Risk factors for maternal colonisation and invasive neonatal disease will be
      assessed, including through retrospective immunological investigation of cord blood in
      neonates subsequently identified as having invasive GBS disease or other adverse perinatal
      outcomes, compared to those without.

      GBS isolates from maternal colonisation will be typed (sero-typing and molecular analysis),
      and these isolates will be compared to existing archived neonatal isolates from
      investigation of neonatal sepsis in KDH (Kilifi District Hospital). This is important so
      that we know the prevalent sub-types causing neonatal disease in Kenya, those which are
      carried by mothers, and therefore whether maternal GBS carriage correlates with a high risk
      of perinatal disease. GBS vaccines in development are type-specific and this will inform
      their use in sSA.

      Stillbirths will also be investigated, in individual cases, through additional detailed
      microbiological and other laboratory investigations to make an assessment of the
      contribution of GBS to stillbirths in Kenya.
