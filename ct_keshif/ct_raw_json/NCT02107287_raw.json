Patients with high risk disease would receive hypofractionated RT to the\n      prostate and to the external and internal iliac lymph nodes using IMRT plus long-term\n      hormonal therapy.  The objective of the study is to show that long term grade>2 late\n      toxicity is acceptable and similar to published data using hypofractionated technique in the\n      prostate only."
