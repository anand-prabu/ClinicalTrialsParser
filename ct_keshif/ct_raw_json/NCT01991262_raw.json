Seven drugs are\n      presently approved in the USA and/or EU for the treatment of CHB in patients with\n      HBeAg-positive and -negative disease. They fall into 2 classes: antiviral/immunomodulators\n      (IFN\u03b1 and pegIFN\u03b1-2a) and antiviral nucleos(t)ide analogs (NUCs). [7, 8] EASL and AASLD\n      Treatment Guidelines (2009) [7, 8] recommend that HBV therapy may be initiated with any of\n      the currently approved agents, but that IFN\u03b1 (standard or pegylated), Tenofovir (TDF) or\n      Entecavir (ETV) are preferred first-line options for treatment of CHB patients with\n      HBeAg-positive and HBeAg-negative disease.\n\n      Poor adherence to therapy is a complex challenge for physicians treating patients with\n      chronic diseases. In clini\u00accal practice, adherence rates averages 50%, falling most\n      dramatically after the first 6 mo of treatment. [9] Guidelines on CHB therapy emphasise the\n      need for optimal adherence, with risk of resistant viral strains emerging if the virus has a\n      drug free holiday. [10] For ex\u00acample, antiviral resistance has been reported in up to 70%\n      patients after 4 years on Lamivudine, 29% after 5 years of Adefovir dipivoxil and 1% after 4\n      years of Entecavir monohydrate[11-13]. The number of dose omissions that may lead to this is\n      variable but any omission poses a po\u00actential risk of viral replication breakthrough.\n      Although, the data for CHB are lacking, it is evident from the HIV literature that\n      near-perfect adherence (> 95% adherence rates) is needed to achieve a non detectable viral\n      load and avoid emergence of resistant strains[14, 15]. Hence, in the clinical setting of CHB\n      therapy, the goal of adherence remains 100%.\n\n      Unlike other chronic conditions, the rapid viral rep\u00aclication potential and mutation rates\n      of hepatitis B virus require very high levels of adherence to achieve and maintain\n      virological suppression. [16] Suboptimal adher\u00acence risks exacerbating existing liver\n      disease, which can be life-threatening particularly in patients with advanced cirrhosis.\n      Furthermore, it can lead to the development of drug-resistant strains, limiting therapeutic\n      options and additionally poses the public health risks of transmission of drug-resistant\n      viral strains to non-immune individuals in the community, or to those whose previous\n      vaccina\u00action are no longer protective. [17, 18] Given the global burden of the disease,\n      widespread transmission of drug-resistant strains may have serious and wide-reaching\n      consequences.\n\n      1.1 Study Rationale Non- adherence to treatment is a well known issue across many\n      therapeutic areas. In Hep C, literature review shows that adherence in real life may reach\n      65%, with most drop-outs during first 3 months, mainly due to minor side effects. In Hep B,\n      reported adherence studies show 50%-80% adherence, with an average of ~65%. Most drop-outs\n      are during first 6 months of treatment. Non-adherence to treatment is believed to contribute\n      not only to liver deterioration but also to emerging viral resistance.\n\n      Studies for adherence support show an average improvement of around 10%-15% at the best.\n      Assessed  methods are:\n\n        -  Patient education\n\n        -  Patients empowerment\n\n        -  SMS reminders\n\n        -  Pills' boxes with electronic reminders\n\n      The lack of symptoms along with chronicity of treatment, financial burden and lack of\n      patient's education - are recognized as important factors for non-adherence.\n\n      The abundance of new drugs for viral hepatitis, high disease prevalence and the close\n      relation between effective treatment and clinical outcomes - create a clear need for not\n      only providing treatment but also an efficient support system aimed at supporting patients'\n      adherence.\n\n      1.2 Research Question We expect that an ongoing patients' support system will contribute to\n      adherence increase. The support should be provided by HCPs, be continuous and provide\n      reminders, medical education and direct contact between patients and HCPs.\n\n      Therefore, study hypothesis is:\n\n        -  An ongoing 6 months adherence support will increase adherence rates for Hep B patients\n\n        -  Adherence rate increase will be at least 20%.\n\n        -  Direct weekly telephone contacts will contribute major improvement. Smart phone\n           application daily reminders will contribute as well and there is need to assess its\n           relative contribution.\n\n           2 OBJECTIVES 2.1 Primary Objectives At least 20% improvement in adherence rates for\n           newly treated Hep B patients. Adherence rate will be defined as the per cent of days\n           the patients took their hepatitis B virus medications during study treatment and the\n           number of missed doses.\n\n      2.2 Secondary Objectives\n\n      The difference in adherence improvement among 3 types of adherence support:\n\n        1. Weekly telephone call + daily text messages reminders.\n\n        2. Weekly telephone calls.\n\n        3. Daily text messages reminders.\n\n        4. Control - no adherence support\n\n      3 STUDY DESIGN 3.1 Overview of Study Design This is an epidemiological non-interventional\n      study conducted in the community. Medical students (Hereinafter \"Supporters\"), attending\n      senior years (4th or 5th year) will receive training about the Educational Support Program.\n      In case not all vacancies can be filled with suitable medical students, senior years nursing\n      students will be approached. Every supporter will be supporting a maximum of 10 recruited\n      patients simultaneously. Every 5 supporters will report to a nurse. Every 2 nurses will\n      report to a Hepatologist (Hereinafter \"Investigator\"). Overall, every Hepatologist shall be\n      recruiting a maximum of 100 patients.\n\n      During the pre-study phase, eligible patients, who are prescribed with HBV treatment with\n      Entecavir by their respective Investigator, will be informed of the Support Program.\n      Interested patients will receive ICF for signature. Upon signature, the recruiting\n      Investigator will randomize the newly recruited patient into one of the four study groups.\n\n      Randomization will be provided by CHS computerized system (Randomization engine).\n\n      Patients in the supported groups (Groups 1; 2 and 3) shall undergo the procedure described\n      hereby:\n\n      Upon recruitment, the patient will be introduced to the nurse, who will appoint a supporter\n      to the patient, install the smart-phone reminder application (to relevant groups - Group 1\n      and Group 3) and explain the support format according to patient's group:\n\n      Group 1:\n\n      Receive weekly phone calls from their Supporters who will monitor HBV treatment adherence\n      and adverse events, respond to the patients' queries, suggest possible remedies to patients'\n      basic complaints (per definition and qualification in training), refer more complex queries\n      and/or complaints to respective nurse and refer patients to physicians for further\n      treatment, if required. The Supporter will record the data on a Patient Follow-Up Form and\n      report, on a monthly basis, to the respective nurse. In addition, patients in this group\n      will install the reminder application on their smart-phones and will be reminded on a daily\n      basis, by the application, to take their medication.\n\n      Group 2:\n\n      Receive weekly phone calls from their Supporters who will monitor HBV treatment adherence\n      and adverse events, respond to the patients' queries, suggest possible remedies to patients'\n      basic complaints (per definition and qualification in training), refer more complex queries\n      and/or complaints to respective nurse and refer patients to physicians for further\n      treatment, if required. The Supporter will record the data on a Patient Follow-Up Form and\n      report, on a monthly basis, to the respective nurse.\n\n      Group 3:\n\n      Patients in this group will install the reminder application on their smart-phones and will\n      be reminded on a daily basis, by the application, to take their medication.\n\n      Group 4:\n\n      Patients in the 4th group (control group) will continue the SOC without any further support.\n\n      Every month, patients will receive a letter from their respective Investigators, summarizing\n      their study status in the previous month (Appendix A). Every quarter (3 months), each nurse\n      will report study progress to responsible Investigator and schedule a follow-up appointment\n      for the patient with the investigator. The patient will bring the pill boxes to the\n      follow-up appointment for counting.\n\n      At the end of the supporting phase, the patients will continue HBV treatment according to\n      standard care and their physician's instructions. During the follow-up phase, all groups\n      will be handled as Group 4 patients.\n\n      3.2 Study Population\n\n      Approximately 250 Na\u00efve Hep B patients are expected to participate in the study and will be\n      divided into 4 study arms:\n\n      Group 1: 63 pts receiving weekly telephone contact & daily text messages for 6 months.\n\n      Group 2: 63 patients receiving weekly telephone contacts for 6 months. Group 3: 63 patients\n      receiving daily text messages for 6 months. Group 4: 63 patients receiving no adherence\n      support.\n\n      3.2.1 Inclusion Criteria\n\n        -  Adult male and female patient (> 18 years).\n\n        -  Prescribed treatment of Entecavir for HBV\n\n        -  Must have access to a smart-phone.\n\n        -  Written informed consent.\n\n      3.2.2 Exclusion Criteria\n\n        -  Patients with hepatitis C, hepatitis D or HIV co-infection.\n\n        -  Co-infected patients who require additional medication.\n\n        -  Patients with prior liver transplantation\n\n        -  Patients with impaired renal function requiring dialysis\n\n        -  Immune-suppressed patients receiving HBV antiviral prophylaxis\n\n        -  Pregnant patients.\n\n        -  Inability or unwillingness to provide informed consent or abide by the requirements of\n           the study.\n\n        -  Parallel participation in another clinical trial.\n\n        -  Patients who cannot take medication independently. 3.3 Data Source/Data Collection\n           Process\n\n      Adherence to treatment will be assessed by 3 methods:\n\n        1. Supporters' weekly documentations.\n\n        2. Pill count - Patients will be instructed to bring the boxes to quarterly follow-up\n           visits with the Hepatologist.\n\n        3. Drugs dispense data from pharmacies - every 3 months.\n\n      Safety assessment will be completed by:\n\n        1. Supporters' weekly documentations.\n\n        2. Documentation by treating hepatologists, during ongoing visits. 3.4 Definitions of\n           Study Variables Adherence will be quantified into percentage and will be calculated as\n           the percent of days in which the patient took the prescribed medication out of the\n           number of days the patient was instructed to take the medication by prescription.\n\n      3.4.1 Outcomes/Endpoint Variables\n\n      Primary endpoint:\n\n      Adherence rate will be defined as the percentage of days the patients took their hepatitis B\n      virus medications during study treatment and the number of missed doses. Adherence will be\n      measured as a combination of:\n\n        1. Drug dispense at pharmacy (every month)\n\n        2. Self report by patient (every week)\n\n        3. Pills count (every 3 months)\n\n      A responder will be defined as a patient with at least 80% adherence to drug treatment.\n\n      Secondary endpoint:\n\n      The difference in adherence improvement among 3 types of adherence support\n\n        1. Weekly Phone Call + Daily Application Reminder\n\n        2. Weekly Phone Call\n\n        3. Daily Application Reminder\n\n      4 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS 4.1 Statistical Analysis Methods All measured variables and derived\n      parameters will be listed individually and, if appropriate, tabulated by descriptive\n      statistics.\n\n      For categorical variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, absolute and\n      relative frequency and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) for proportions by study arm.\n\n      For continuous variables summary tables will be provided giving sample size, arithmetic\n      mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (if appropriate), median, minimum and\n      maximum, percentiles and 95% CI (Confidence Interval) by study arm for means of variables.\n\n      4.1.1 Primary Objective Responders will be defined as patients with at least 80% adherence\n      to drug treatment. 95% Confidence Interval (95% CI) will be calculated for the rate of\n      responders per study arm (arms 1, 2 and 3).\n\n      4.1.2 Secondary Objectives Chi-square test or Fisher's Exact test (as is appropriate) will\n      be applied for testing the statistical significance of the difference in responders rate\n      between study arms 1 (Weekly Phone Call + Daily Application Reminder), 2 (Weekly Phone Call)\n      and 3(Daily Application Reminder) vs. group 4 (no support).\n\n      The effect of telephone call will be tested comparing groups 1+2 vs. groups 3+4.\n\n      The effect of daily SMS will be tested comparing groups 1+3 vs. group 2+4. Logistic\n      Regression model will be applied for testing the statistical significance of the difference\n      in responders' rate between study arms 1, 2 and 3 vs. group 4 and between the active groups\n      with adjustment to suspected confounders related to study outcome which will be found\n      different between the arms.\n\n      Logistic regression will be applied for analyzing the effect of telephone call and daily SMS\n      (as described above) with adjustment to suspected confounders.\n\n      All tests will be two-tailed, and a p value of 5% or less will be considered statistically\n      significant.\n\n      The data will be analyzed using the SAS \u00ae version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary North Carolina).\n\n      4.2 Power/Sample Size Rational for Sample size calculation Sample size calculation is based\n      on demonstrating a difference of at least 21% in response rate in the comparison between\n      study arms 1, 2 and 3 vs. group 4. This difference reflects an odds ratio of 0.23 with\n      statistical significance of 5% with statistical power of 80% when the sample size is 252, 63\n      in each study arm.\n\n      Sample Size Justification A two group continuity corrected Chi square test with a 0.050\n      two-sided significance level will have 80% power to detect the difference between a Group 1\n      proportion and a Group 2 proportion  (odds ratio of 0.231) when the sample size in each\n      group is 64.\n\n      Reference: nQuery advisor 2.1\n\n      5 STUDY CONDUCT This study will be conducted in accordance with International Society for\n      Pharmacoepidemiology (ISPE) Guidelines for Good Pharmacoepidemiology Practices (GPP) and\n      applicable regulatory requirements.\n\n      5.1 Ethics Committee Review and Informed Consent 5.1.1 Ethics Committee Review The\n      investigator must ensure that the required approvals from Ethics Committees, Independent\n      Review Committees, Regulatory Authorities, and/or other local governance bodies are obtained\n      before study initiation at the site.\n\n      5.1.2 Informed Consent In accordance with local regulations, subjects should provide either\n      written or oral consent before enrollment into the study. Investigators must ensure that\n      patients, or, in those situations where consent cannot be given by patients, their legally\n      acceptable representatives, are clearly and fully informed about the purpose of the study,\n      potential risks, the patient's rights and responsibilities when participating in this study.\n      If local regulations do not require an informed consent document to be signed by the\n      patient, the site staff should document key elements of the informed consent process in the\n      patient's chart.\n\n      This study does not require that informed consent is obtained from patients. 5.2\n      Responsibilities within the Study The study shall be conducted as described in this approved\n      protocol. All revisions to the protocol must be discussed with, and be prepared by BMS.\n\n      5.3 Confidentiality of Study Data The confidentiality of records that could identify\n      patients within the database must be protected, respecting the privacy and confidentiality\n      rules in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirement(s).\n\n      For the purposes of protecting a patient's identity, a unique code will be assigned to each\n      patient, such as a series of numbers and/or letters (for example, CA180330-0001-00001).  The\n      data that is recorded with the patient's assigned code is called \"key-coded data\".\n      Key-coded study data will be managed by the sponsor and/or its delegates in a study-specific\n      electronic database (the \"study database\"). Only the investigator and the site staff have\n      access to the link between patient's assigned code and the patient's identity. However, in\n      case of an audit or inspection, subject to local laws and regulations, government officials,\n      IRB/EC representatives and sponsor representatives may access this information at the study\n      site. If the study requires on-site monitoring, subject to local laws and regulations,\n      sponsor representatives will also access the primary data source at the study site (see\n      section 6.4). Data that could directly identify the patient will not be collected in the\n      \"study database\".\n\n      5.4 Quality Control Power/Sample Size Representatives of BMS and/or its delegates must be\n      allowed to visit all study site locations to assess the data quality and study integrity. On\n      site, they will review study files and, if allowed by local laws and regulations, patient\n      medical charts to compare them with source documents, discuss the conduct of the study with\n      the investigator, and verify that the facilities remain acceptable.\n\n      In addition, the study may be evaluated by BMS internal auditors and government inspectors\n      who must be allowed access to CRFs, source documents, other study files, and study\n      facilities. BMS audit reports will be kept confidential.\n\n      The investigator must notify BMS promptly of any inspections scheduled by regulatory\n      authorities, and promptly forward copies of inspection reports to BMS.\n\n      5.5 Database Retention and Archiving of Study Documents The investigator must retain all\n      study records and source documents for the maximum period required by applicable regulations\n      and guidelines, or institution procedures, or for the period specified by the sponsor,\n      whichever is longer. The investigator must contact BMS prior to destroying any records\n      associated with the study. Location of database and supporting documentation will be\n      outlined in the final observational study report.\n\n      6 ADVERSE EVENT REPORTING The INSTITUTION/PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with the\n      related and non-related Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) and/or Pregnancies within 24 hours of\n      becoming aware of the event.\n\n      The INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with the related and non-related non-serious Adverse Events\n      within 7 days of becoming aware of the event.\n\n      All Adverse Events and/or Serious Adverse Events must be reported to:\n\n      Bristol-Myers Squibb Company Global Pharmacovigilance FAX Number:  609-818-3804 or Email:\n      WorldWide.Safety@bms.com\n\n      The INVESTIGATOR must notify BMS with all Adverse Events in aggregate in the Final Study\n      Report (FSR)."
