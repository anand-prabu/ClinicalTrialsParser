It is not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is\n      more effective for multiple myeloma.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing two combination chemotherapy regimens\n      to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II or stage III multiple myeloma."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral idarubicin and oral dexamethasone daily on days 1-4.\n           Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression\n           or unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive oral dexamethasone daily on days 8-11\n           during course 1 only.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral dexamethasone daily, doxorubicin IV continuously, and\n           vincristine IV continuously on days 1-4. Courses repeat as in arm I. Patients receive\n           additional dexamethasone as in arm I.\n\n      Patients without a maximal response after completion of course 4 may receive up to 2\n      additional courses.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and then prior to each study course.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 200 patients (100 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2 years."
