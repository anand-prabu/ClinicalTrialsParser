            "textblock": "Background\n\n      High heart rate (HR) represent per se a risk factor for cardiovascular mortality and heart\n      failure (HF) progression, despite optimal HF therapy. Beta-blockers remain the therapy of\n      choice in all patients with systolic HF, but they may worsen atrioventricular (AV)\n      conduction and increase right ventricular (RV) pacing percentage. Several studies have\n      demonstrated detrimental effects of RV  pacing on cardiac function. Percent RV pacing >\n      40-50%  is an independent predictor of death and hospitalization for HF in implantable\n      cardioverter-defibrillator(ICD) patients, particularly in those with preexistent left\n      ventricular dysfunction.1,2 Cumulative RV pacing > 2% and ejection fraction (EF) < 40% are\n      independent predictors for Ventricular Tachycardia(VT)/Ventricular Fibrillation (VF)\n      occurrence in ICD patients.3 Therefore reduction of cumulative RV pacing as far as possible\n      should be achieved in ICD patients. Ivabradine is a specific inhibitor of the If current of\n      the sinus node, that induces a selective and dose dependent HR reduction; it is a pure HR\n      lowering agent without effects on AV conduction or contractility.4  In HF patients implanted\n      with an ICD ivabradine could act as an heart rate control drug in combination with a\n      beta-blocker without increase right ventricular (RV) pacing percentage and may be an option\n      to reduce left-ventricular dysfunction progression and ventricular arrhythmias burden and\n      appropriate ICD therapy.\n\n      Aim\n\n      The aim of this prospective, randomized and controlled trial is to evaluate the use  of the\n      ivabradine in combination to a low-dose of beta-blocker (bisoprolol) versus up-titration of\n      beta-blocker (bisoprolol) to obtain heart rate (HR) control with reduction in RV pacing in\n      single-chamber or dual chambers ICD recipients HF patients with moderate to severe left\n      ventricular dysfunction (FE \u2264 40%) and an heart rate \u226570 bpm  in sinus rhythm over a\n      12-months follow up.\n\n      Besides we want to assess if the combination of ivabradine to a low-dose of beta-blocker\n      (bisoprolol) versus titration of beta-blocker (bisoprolol)  may determine a lower degree of\n      left ventricular dysfunction progression, the reduction of ventricular arrhythmias burden\n      and ICD appropriate therapy occurrence and the improvement of quality of life in ICD heart\n      failure patients.\n\n      Endpoints of the study\n\n      Primary endpoints:\n\n      Right ventricular pacing percentage increase > 50% or Cardiovascular death or Heart failure\n      decompensation or Crossover due to worsening heart failure.\n\n      Secondary endpoints:\n\n      Ejection fraction decrease < 5% and Left Ventricular End-Systolic Volume decrease <15%.\n\n      Ventricular arrhythmias and ICD appropriate therapy reduction.
