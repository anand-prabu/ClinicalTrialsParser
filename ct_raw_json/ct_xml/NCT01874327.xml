  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy of a novel intervention implemented in a classroom
      setting aimed at improving joint attention and joint engagement skills with infants who are
      at risk of developing an Autism Spectrum Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed intervention adapts a parent-mediated intervention that successfully improved
      outcomes in toddlers with autism. The intervention model (a) targets the foundations of
      social-communication (joint attention, imitation, play), (b) uses naturalistic strategies to
      increase the rate and complexity of social-communication and (c) includes parents as
      implementers of the intervention to promote generalization across settings and activities
      and to ensure maintenance over time.

      In addition to testing the primary effects of this early intervention on the developmental
      outcomes of children with signs of autism, we will examine whether this method is superior
      to an early intervention focused on global infant development. Because brain development
      occurs rapidly in infants and toddlers, we will use high density EEG to investigate (1)
      biomarkers of change in these infants as a result of intervention and (2) biomarkers
      predicting response to treatment, with focus on the neural correlates of social attention
      and learning from joint engagement.

      Study Aims:

      AIM 1: To examine the effects of the experimental intervention (Baby JASPER) on primary
      (joint attention) and secondary outcomes (receptive language, play, symbol-infused joint
      engagement and parent use of social communication support strategies).

      AIM 2: To examine maintenance and generalization of the effects of the experimental
      intervention on children and their parents.

      AIM 3: To examine electrophysiological biomarkers of change with treatment as well as
      predictors of social communication outcomes in children after intervention.

      AIM 4 (exploratory): To examine the effect of potential child level and parent level
      moderators on the primary and secondary outcomes of the study across the two conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Have elevated scores on the ADOS-Toddler version and clinical concern from
             professional (Pediatrician, Psychologist, etc). Because of the young age of children,
             we expect to intervene with children who do not yet have a diagnosis of ASD but may
             only show some risk by virtue of elevated scores on the ADOS-T.

          -  Have a parent available for parent-mediated sessions 2 times per week in the
             classroom

          -  Do not have seizures

          -  Do not have associated sensory or physical disorders

          -  Are not co-morbid with other syndromes or diseases

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Other co-morbid syndromes or diseases

          -  Seizure activity
