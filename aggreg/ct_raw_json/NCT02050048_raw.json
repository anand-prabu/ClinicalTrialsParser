Pancreatitis is inflammation of the pancreas, and it is the most frequent serious\n      complication of ERCP.  Typically, a small amount of IV fluids are given during this\n      procedure (~ 1 liter).  We are testing whether using a larger amount of fluids (2 - 3\n      liters) will reduce the risk of PEP."

Following the phase II portion, if the data suggests that the intervention arm\n      (high volume group) is safe, the investigators will begin enrolling patients who are\n      undergoing ERCP in a more urgent setting as inpatients.\n\n      We plan on enrolling 1,400 consecutive high risk patients undergoing ERCP.  We are assuming\n      a baseline PEP risk of 9.2%.  Fluid administration will be based on Ideal Body Weight (IBW)\n      in order to standardize the aggressive fluid administration across all body weights and\n      reduce the potential for adverse cardiopulmonary outcomes.\n\n      All participants will be monitored for 90 minutes following their procedure to assess the\n      development of any adverse symptoms.  Analysis by a data safety monitoring board (DSMB) will\n      take place throughout the study.  The DSMB is comprised of a panel of experts independent of\n      NorthShore University HealthSystem."
