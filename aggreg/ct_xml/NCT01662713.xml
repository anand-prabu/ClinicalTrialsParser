    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to find out if a non-invasive imaging device called
      Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) can help doctors to see the tissue and blood vessels
      that are related to non-melanoma skin cancers.  OFDI was designed to see microscopic details
      of your skin without needing to use any invasive techniques such as surgery or biopsy.

    <textblock>
      Non-melanoma skin cancer (NMSC) is the most common cancer in the United States, with more
      than 750,000 diagnosed patients treated every year. Its prevalence and incidence have
      significantly increased over the past two decades and it has been estimated that 20% of all
      Americans will develop this type of cancer during their lifetime (Neville et al., 2007).
      Biopsy and surgical resection of NMSC can result in tissue mutilation and scaring.
      Therefore, there is a need for new imaging technologies that can be used to non-invasively
      guide biopsy and surgery.

      Optical Frequency Domain Imaging (OFDI) is a second-generation imaging implementation of
      optical coherence tomography (OCT) developed at the Wellman Center.  OFDI provides
      high-resolution three-dimensional imaging in tissue.  It uses an interferometric
      depth-sectioning technique and employs a near-infrared light source.  Through analysis of
      phase information in the recorded signal.  OFDI can detect blood vessels within tissues and
      tumors.  Importantly, OFDI-based vascular imaging can be performed without the need for
      exogenous contrast agents, making it relatively easy to deploy in clinical settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects with Fitzpatrick skin type I-VI

          2. Subjects with ages between 18 and 80 years of age

          3. Presence of at least one NMSC lesion

          4. Subjects referred by primary dermatologist

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects with active localized or systemic infections

          2. Subjects participating in potentially confounding clinical studies of investigational
             therapies, either drug or device.

          3. Subjects using any drug that may increase or decrease local vasculature, locally or
             systematically, such as VEGF inhibitors (e.g. rapamycin), anticoagulants, and
             beta-blockers, or high dose corticosteroids sildenafil (Viagra 速)., topical lidocaine
             cream, etc.

          4. Subjects receiving any topical treatment for actinic keratosis on the area where the
             imaging will be performed (e.g. 5-fluorouracil (Effudex速), imiquimod (Aldara速),
             diclofenac sodium (Solaraze速), etc)*

          5. Subjects with any autoimmune disease (lupus erythematosus, sclerodermia, etc)

          6. Subjects taking any topical /systemic chemotherapy or immunosuppressants

          7. Subjects who are pregnant and/or breastfeeding

          8. Subjects with tape adhesive allergies

               -  e.g.: If the lesion is located on the arms and the subject is applying the
                  treatment on the face, this will not be an exclusion criteria.
