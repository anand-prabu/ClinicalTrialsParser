The first 5 subjects will receive 25 mg/kg, with an escalation of dose after each 5 subjects enrolled. The study drug will be brought to the operating room and administered over 5 minutes by the anesthesiologist after an IV has been placed. Prior to the administration of the study drug, and again 24 and 48 hrs after CPB, 3.0 ml of blood will be collected for determinations of carnitine levels (free, total, and acylcarnitine), mitochondrial function, ROS and bioavailable NO as described in Aim 3A. Additional blood (0.5-1.0 ml) will be obtained to determine carnitine levels before CPB, and then before and 0.5, 1.5, 3, 5, 9, 12, and 24h after the second dose."

            "textblock": "AIM:  To pilot a trial assessing the safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) of perioperative IV\n      L-carnitine administration in these patients. To this end, a pilot clinical trial is\n      proposed. Infants with VSD or AVSD undergoing complete repair will receive L-carnitine, in\n      one of 3 doses (25, 50, or 100 mg/kg, IV), just prior to CPB, and again 2 hr after CPB.\n      Serial blood samples will be obtained to determine free, total, and acylcarnitine levels,\n      and plasma markers of mitochondrial function, oxidative stress, and bioavailable NO. Adverse\n      events will be sought, and clinical outcomes will be assessed.\n\n      Study design: The inclusion and exclusion criteria are as described in Aim 3A except only\n      infants with VSD or AVSD will be enrolled (no TOF). The safety profile of L-carnitine is\n      outstanding, with no reports of toxicity from overdose reported113.  In fact, the only\n      adverse reactions reported are transient nausea and vomiting, and less commonly gastritis.\n      However, although rare, seizures have been reported to occur in patients receiving\n      L-carnitine. Therefore, the major adverse events that will be monitored include evidence of\n      seizure activity and GI bleeding. As per routine, any patient suspected of having seizures\n      is monitored with continuous EEG. Dosing is not well studied in children, particularly\n      critically ill children67, 114-116117. In addition, the effect of CPB on L-carnitine\n      clearance in children is not known. Therefore, a major goal of this sub-aim is to establish\n      a pharmacokinetic profile of L-carnitine in this patient population undergoing surgery with\n      CPB, in order to move forward with a larger randomized trial powered for efficacy in\n      prevention of increased PVR post-bypass in at-risk infants. Plasma concentration profiles\n      after IV bolus dosing in adults were described by a two-compartmental model67, 113, 114,\n      118. Usual pediatric dosing is not well delineated, but recommendations include a 50 mg/kg\n      bolus followed by an infusion of 50mg/kg/day, that can be increased to 300 mg/kg/day113,\n      119.  Therefore, we will begin at a lower dose (25 mg/kg), and escalate the dose after each\n      group of 5. No intra-patient escalation will be allowed and the dose will not be escalated\n      until all patients in the current dose level have been followed to hospital discharge or 30\n      days post-op and the safety and PK data have been analyzed. The DSMB will approve all dose\n      escalations. The dosing goal will be to achieve normal or supra-normal free carnitine levels\n      (~50 \u03bcmol/L) and low AC levels (~3 \u03bcmol/L) just before and for 24 hrs after CPB; the period\n      with the greatest risk of pulmonary vascular morbidity."
