PTPS can affect up to 80% of patients undergoing\n      thoracotomies, and results in significant impairment. A proposed mechanism for PTPS is the\n      compression of the intercostal nerves during routine closure. Closure of thoracotomies using\n      intracostal sutures is a novel technique where sutures are passed through holes drilled into\n      the rib; thus, avoiding compression of the nerves. We propose a double-blind, randomized\n      control study involving 90 patients undergoing elective posterolateral thoracotomies.\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to undergo thoracotomy closure with pericostal\n      sutures or intracostal sutures. Our primary outcome will assess the incidence and severity\n      of PTPS at 3, 6, and 12 months after surgery between groups."
