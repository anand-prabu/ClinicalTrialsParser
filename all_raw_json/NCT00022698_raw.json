Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 12 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients maintaining a response or stable\n      disease after 12 courses may continue treatment at the discretion of the investigator.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 65 patients will be accrued for this study within 9 months."
