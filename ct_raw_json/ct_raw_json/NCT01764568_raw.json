            "textblock": "Current Canadian Clinical Practice guidelines emphasize the need for effective psychosocial\n      adjuncts to pharmacotherapy for schizophrenia (Canadian Psychiatric Association 2005). This\n      randomized control trial seeks to contribute to the body of evidence supporting psychosocial\n      treatments by assessing the effectiveness of metacognitive training (MCT) and cognitive\n      remediation (CR) at treating the persistent positive and cognitive symptoms of\n      schizophrenia. Other features of interest, including insight and specific cognitive biases\n      will also be examined using verified measures. MCT is a therapy designed to improve patient\n      awareness and insight into the cognitive biases that are frequently seen in schizophrenia,\n      which has been associated with decreased psychopathology (specifically decreased positive\n      symptoms) and improved psychosocial function. CR is a therapy designed to improve\n      performance in a variety of neurocognitive functions such as attention, memory, and\n      executive functioning which has been associated with improved cognitive and psychosocial\n      functioning. Both MCT and CR will be compared to treatment as usual (TAU) as done previously\n      (Kumar er al, 2010; Moritz et al, 2011).\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n        1. MCT will produce greater change in delusions (severity and conviction) than CR and TAU.\n\n        2. CR and MCT will produce greater change in social/everyday functioning than TAU.\n\n        3. CR will produce greater improvement in basic attention and memory measures relative to\n           MCT and TAU.\n\n        4. MCT will produce greater reduction on tasks measuring targeted reasoning biases\n           relative to CR and TAU.\n\n        5. CR will increase efficiency of functional networks on a working memory task, relative\n           to MCT and TAU.\n\n        6. MCT will lead to a greater decrease in the neural response to evidence matches relative\n           to CR and TAU."

            "textblock": "Justification:\n\n      Participants who complete the screening and baseline (pre-treatment) interviews will be\n      randomly assigned to one of 3 conditions: 1) MCT, 2) CR or 3) TAU. Randomization of subjects\n      will occur at the beginning of each cycle (which will incorporate all conditions).\n      Interventions will be administered in 2-month cycles, with CR and MCT running\n      simultaneously. This will suffice to obtain 75 subjects per condition over 5 years.\n\n      Both treatment groups will take place twice a week for 8 weeks.\n\n      The groups will be run by Clinical Psychologists and PhD level psychology students. Allied\n      health professionals, such as Occupational Therapists or Social Workers, may co-facilitate\n      groups.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The objectives of this research project is to assess the relative effectiveness of MCT and\n      CR at treating the persistent positive symptoms of schizophrenia in a stable patient\n      population. Specifically, we will use verified measures to examine the impact of these\n      interventions on delusions and hallucinations, as well as on other features of interest,\n      including insight and specific cognitive biases. We will use functional neuroimaging, both\n      electroencephalography (EEG) and functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and\n      simultaneous EEG/fMRI to measure the changes in the neural responses while subjects are\n      performing various cognitive tasks. It is expected that improvements in cognitive\n      performance and function seen with MCT and CR correlate with select improvements in\n      efficiency of particular brain networks. We anticipate a double dissociation, in that\n      subjects with decreased positive symptoms following MCT may present with different patterns\n      of activation than those with improved neurocognitive function following CR.\n\n      Research Method.\n\n      Participants.\n\n      Recruitment will be done through inpatient and outpatient departments in Vancouver, British\n      Columbia, Canada. Diagnosis of schizophrenia spectrum disorder will be confirmed using the\n      MINI (Sheehan, 1998). Both inpatients and outpatients will be recruited; patients must be\n      identified as suitable, as determined by their treating psychiatric team.\n\n      Procedures Participants who complete the screening interview and baseline (pre-treatment)\n      assessments will be randomly assigned to one of three conditions: 1) MCT, 2) CR or 3) TAU.\n      Randomization of subjects will occur at the beginning of each cycle.\n\n      Baseline (pre-treatment), midpoint, and post-treatment assessments will include symptom and\n      cognitive assessment, as well as self-reported measures, as outlined above. Patients who are\n      willing and eligible will also be involved in three neuroimaging tasks while undergoing EEG\n      and fMRI.\n\n      EEG and fMRI scanning Participants will be prepared for EEG by trained graduate students and\n      research staff. Once the EEG cap is placed on the subjects head they will be moved into the\n      MRI scanner where they will perform the cognitive tasks. Once completed the subject will\n      have the EEG cap removed before continuing with the MRI scanning.\n\n      Measurements\n\n      Symptom Ratings\n\n      General psychopathology will be assessed using the Scale for the Assessment of Negative\n      Symptoms (SANS; Andreasen, 1984) and the Scale for the Assessment of Positive Symptoms\n      (SAPS; Andreasen, 1984). Patient depressive symptoms will be measures using the Beck\n      Depression Inventory, Second Edition (BDI-II, Beck 1996). Patient perception of their\n      quality of life will be measured using the World Health Organisation Quality of Life scale\n      (WHOQoL). Patient perception of stigma and its impact on their quality of life will be\n      measured using the Internalized Stigma of Mental Illness scale (Ritsher et al, 2003). All\n      symptom rating scales will be administered by trained raters blinded to the treatment\n      allocations of subjects\n\n      Cognitive Biases\n\n      While MCT for psychosis is fundamentally concerned with dysfunctional thinking in psychotic\n      illnesses, it directly targets cognitive biases known to be involved in delusional thinking\n      including the jumping to conclusions bias, the attributional bias, and the bias against\n      disconfirmatory evidence. Two cognitive biases commonly seen in schizophrenia will be\n      evaluated using the \"jumping to conclusions (JTC) scale\" and the \"bias against\n      disconfirmatory evidence (BADE)\" tasks. These tasks were developed, in part, by the\n      Principal Investigator and have been described in previous research (Lecomte & Woodward,\n      2005; Woodward 2006a; Woodward 2006b; Woodward 2007; Moritz & Woodward 2005; Woodward 2009).\n\n      The test of Premorbid Function (ToPF) is a word-reading task that will be used to estimate\n      the premorbid intelligence (IQ) of the individual (Wechsler, 2011). The Wechsler Abbreviated\n      Scale of Intelligence, Second Edition (WASI-II; Wechsler, 2011) will provide a measure of\n      current cognitive function (or intelligence). The Repeatable Battery for the Assessment of\n      Neuropsychological Status (RBANS; Randolph, 1998) will be used to review neurocognitive\n      function of the individual, including attention, processing speed, working memory, verbal\n      and visual memory. Trailmaking test will provide measures of basic attention, speed of\n      processing, mental flexibility, and executive functioning. The Controlled Oral Word\n      Association test (COWAT) is a verbal fluency task that measures executive functioning.\n\n      Insight\n\n      The Beck Cognitive Insight Scale (BCIS; Beck, Baruch, Balter, Steer, & Warman 2004) will be\n      administered to evaluate patients' degree of insight into cognitive biases and limitations.\n\n      Social Cognition\n\n      Social Cognition will be assessed using; the Ambiguous Intentions Hostility Questionnaire\n      (AIHQ; Combs et al, 2007), which measures hostile social cognitive biases in those with\n      paranoia, and The Awareness of Social Inference Test (TASIT; McDonald et al, 2003).\n\n      Feedback from Participants\n\n      After the final session in active treatment conditions, patients will be asked to complete a\n      questionnaire comprising 10 questions on acceptance and subjective efficacy (Moritz &\n      Woodward 2007a). Data accumulated therein will be used together with frequency of unattended\n      sessions to establish acceptability and feasibility of the various treatment conditions.\n\n      Statistical Analysis\n\n      Two to four,  two-month cycles of each condition per year for 5 years should allow us to\n      obtain 75 subjects per condition (MCT, CR, TAU), which is sufficient to produce a power of\n      0.8 to detect a large effect in a three group means comparison design (Cohen 1992) using\n      p=0.05 as the cutoff for significance."
