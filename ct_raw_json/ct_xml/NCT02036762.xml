      THE AIM OF THIS STUDY IS TO TEST IF THE STRETCHING OF THE RESPIRATORY ACCESSORY MUSCLE
      PROVIDE SOME BENEFIT ON THORACOABDOMINAL MECHANICS, FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, PSYCHOLOGICAL AND
      SOCIAL ASPECTS IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE WILL BE SUBMITTED TO PASSIVE STRETCHING
      OF RESPIRATORY MUSCLES AND EXERCISE IN TREADMILL DURING 12 WEEKS, TWICE A WEEK. ONE WEEK
      AFTER THE TRAINING PERIOD, THE FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY, THE THORACOABDOMINAL MECHANICS AND
      LEVELS OF ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION WILL BE ASSESSED.
