  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In a multicenter, randomized clinical trial of default options in advance directives among
      patients with incurable diseases, we will determine whether this simple and readily scalable
      intervention can improve patients quality of life and reduce resource utilization without
      reducing the number of days that patients are alive and living outside of an acute-care
      hospital.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital free days</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The primary outcome is &quot;Hospital-Free Days&quot; (HFDs), a measure that PI Halpern has been developing in collaboration with Dr. Jeffrey Silber at Penn's Center for Outcomes Research. As the name describes, HFDs represent the number of days alive and not in an acute care facility. Although this is a simple concept, and provides an outcome measure of obvious importance to patients, the use of HFDs as a primary outcome in an RCT is highly innovative. To bolster confidence in the results, we will evaluate two key variations on the theme. First, we will explore &quot;Healthcare Facility-Free Days,&quot; which represents the number of days alive where a patient is in neither an acute care facility, a chronic care facility, or a nursing home. We will also evaluate HFDs within a defined period of follow-up - 6 months in this case. This is analogous to the established outcome of ventilator-free days used commonly in RCTs among ICU patients</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospital and ICU admissions</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The numbers of admissions will be analyzed as count data. From the dates of hospital and ICU admissions, we will calculate the proportion of each patient's total survival time during study follow-up that was spent in the hospital or ICU.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Costs of care</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We will combine all costs of inpatient and outpatient hospice, hospital stays, and life-sustaining procedures.  The perspective will be that of all potential payers. Costs will be inflated to the date on which analyses are performed using the U.S. gross domestic product deflator</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hospice utilization</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We will analyze hospice utilization in 2 ways: (a) time from advance directive completion to hospice enrollment; and (b) duration of hospice utilization prior to death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Choices to receive 4 potentially life-sustaining interventions, and the concordance of these choices with whether the interventions were actually received</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We will record selections that patients made on their advance directives about  4 specific life-sustaining interventions. Utilizing data from the Pennsylvania Healthcare Cost Containment Consortium and the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, we will be able to determine which patients received each intervention. Thus, we will be able to reliably evaluate the proportions of patients who received unwanted interventions. Because we cannot determine the denominator of patients with indications for these interventions, we will not evaluate the proportions of patients who went without desired services.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Choices regarding post-hospitalization care, and the concordance of these choices with the care actually received</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Patients will indicate on their advance directives forms their selections for post-hospitalization care. We will utilize data from the Pennsylvania Health Care Cost Containment Consortium and New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services to asses if the care patient indicate is the care they receive.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision regret</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Decision regret will be measured using Dr. Jamie Brehaut's  5-item Decision  Regret Scale that has previously been shown to have good internal consistency and strong  inverse associations with decision satisfaction.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Decision satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Satisfaction will also be measured with the CANHELP instrument's global satisfaction with end-of-life care question.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quality of Life using the McGill Quality of Life (MQOL) instrument.</measure>
    <time_frame>up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MQOL is a well-Validated  and widely used  scale designed specifically for patients with serious  illnesses. The MQOL can be completed by family members on behalf of patients who have lost the capacity to complete it themselves. Thus, we will have surrogates (the individuals identified on patients' advance directive forms as their appointed healthcare agents) complete the MQOL for incapacitated patients to minimize missing data.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Surrogates' Perception of the quality of death and dying</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months of patient death</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Because we are recruiting patients with serious life-limiting illnesses, we anticipate that some  patients will die over the course of this study period. We will speak with surrogates of deceased patients to assess their perceived quality of death and dying using the quality of dying and death (QODD) instrument</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-traumatic stress in surrogates</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months of patient death</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The risk of post-traumatic stress disorder in surrogates among deceased patients will be assessed using the Impact of Events Scale. The IES is a valid and reliable scale that has been used frequently to assess PTSD risk among family members of critically ill patients.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Complicated grief among surrogates</measure>
    <time_frame>within 3 months of patient death</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Complicated grief will be assessed using Prigerson's Inventory of Complicated Grief to distinguish pathologic grieving from normal bereavement.</description>

    <description>Subjects in this group will receive an advance directive form that defaults to an overall goal of care directed towards life extension (vs. comfort oriented care) unless the subject specifies otherwise. The form also  states 4 specific life extending interventions (cardiopulmonary resuscitation, mechanical ventilation, hemodialysis, and feeding tube insertion) will be provided unless patients specifically opt-out from such selections. It also will state that  upon discharge from the hospital, long-term care (vs. hospice care) will be provided unless the patient chooses otherwise.</description>
