  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/1b, open-label, multicenter study of oral MLN9708 designed to assess the
      pharmacokinetics (PK) of single dose MLN9708 in patients with normal renal function and in
      patients with severe renal impairment (RI) (according to Cockcroft-Gault estimates).
      Twenty-eight PK-evaluable patients will be enrolled in either 1 of the 2 arms of the study.
