To evaluate changes in the levels of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1),\n      E-selectin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), soluble vascular endothelial growth\n      factor receptor (VEGFR) and basic fibroblast growth factor (B-FGF) during therapy with\n      ADH-1, cisplatin and gemcitabine.\n\n      II. Radiographic assessment of disease status after 3 cycles of chemotherapy with ADH-1,\n      cisplatin and gemcitabine.\n\n      III. To evaluate progression-free and overall survival of patients with locally advanced or\n      metastatic pancreatic or biliary tract adenocarcinomas treated with ADH-1 given with\n      cisplatin and fixed dose rate gemcitabine for 3 cycles. Patients with stable or responsive\n      disease after 3 cycles will continue on maintenance cisplatin and fixed dose rate\n      gemcitabine.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive ADH-1 intravenously (IV) over 20-80 minutes on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and\n      18, cisplatin IV and gemcitabine hydrochloride IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.
