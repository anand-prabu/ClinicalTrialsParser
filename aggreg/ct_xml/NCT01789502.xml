  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, randomized study to compare of outcome of fully covered metal
      stents with that of plastic stents for preoperative biliary drainage in distal common bile
      duct cancer and pancreas head cancer with respect to the re-intervention rate, the incidence
      of stent-related adverse events, the effectiveness of biliary drainage, surgical outcomes
      and hospital stays.

      Pancreaticoduodenectomy (Whipple's procedure) is curative option in periampullary tumor.
      Preoperative endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatog-raphy (ERCP) is usually undertaken in
      patients with resectable disease to relieve biliary obstruction, which is thought to impair
      immune response, clotting, and other functions that impact intraoperative and postoperative
      outcomes. Despite conflicting data pertaining to preoperative biliary drainage, ERCP with
      biliary stenting has become standard practice in patients with periampullary malignancies.
      In a recent multicenter randomized trial, patients who underwent preoperative biliary
      drainage had a 74% rate of complications compared with 39% for those who directly underwent
      surgery without preoperative biliary drainage. In this trial, however, all patients
      underwent placement of plastic stents. In ERCP, self-expandable metal stent are being
      increasingly placed for palliation of malignant biliary obstruction. Compared with plastic
      stents, self-expandable metal stents have large caliber and have demonstrated longer patency
      duration. Even in patients with resectable malignant disease, self-expandable metal stents
      which are placed below the level of transection may not impair technical outcomes at surgery
      and can be safely removed along with the surgical specimen.

      This prospective study is designed to compare the re-intervention rate, the incidence of
      stent-related adverse events, the effectiveness of biliary drainage, surgical outcomes and
      hospital stays in patients with periamupllary tumors who are undergone with self-expandable
      metal stents or plastic stents placement for preoperative biliary drainage
