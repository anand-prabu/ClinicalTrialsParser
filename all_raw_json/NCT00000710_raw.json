The most effective route and\n      dose of ddI has yet to be determined.\n\n      Patients are given intravenous drug for 14 days with a 1 day washout period, then 76 weeks\n      of oral medication. To expedite this safety study and still be able to maintain close\n      monitoring of the patient's health, an overlapping dosing regimen is used. After 6 patients\n      have been enrolled and at least 4 have completed 4 weeks of dosing without significant toxic\n      effects, a second group of patients is started at the next dose level.\n\n      AMENDED: An alternative oral dosing formulation of ddI will be provided as a buffer powder\n      blend packaged in sealed foil sachets in several strengths."
