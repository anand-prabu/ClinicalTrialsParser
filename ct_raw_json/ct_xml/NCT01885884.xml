  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot, randomized controlled trial of an embedded collaborative model of
      supportive care designed to improve quality of life and decrease use of unwanted healthcare
      services at the end of life for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. We will enroll 30
      patients who are receiving treatment at the Hillman Cancer Center for recently diagnosed,
      locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma, as well as their accompanying
      caregivers and providers. Patients will be randomized to receive either the supportive care
      intervention or usual care. The purpose of this study is to refine an embedded collaborative
      model of supportive care and to develop protocols for recruitment, randomization, and
      longitudinal data collection.
