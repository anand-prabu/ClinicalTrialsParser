It is not yet known if cisplatin and vinorelbine are more\n      effective with or without tirapazamine in treating non-small cell lung cancer\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of cisplatin plus\n      vinorelbine with or without tirapazamine in treating patients who have stage IIIB or stage\n      IV non-small cell lung cancer."

Compare the overall survival duration of patients with stage IIIB or IV\n      non-small cell lung cancer treated with vinorelbine and cisplatin with or without\n      tirapazamine. II. Compare the complete and partial response rates, time to disease\n      progression, and time to treatment failure in these patients treated with these regimens.\n      III. Compare the clinical benefit of these regimens, in terms of performance status and body\n      weight, in these patients. IV. Compare the toxicity and safety of these regimens in these\n      patients. V. Compare the quality of life of patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive tirapazamine IV over 2 hours followed by cisplatin\n      IV over 1 hour on day 1. Patients also receive vinorelbine IV over 6-10 minutes on days 1,\n      8, 15, and 22. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and vinorelbine as in arm I. Treatment\n      repeats every 28 days for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during each course of\n      treatment, at 30 days after the last course of treatment, and then every 8 weeks for 2-3\n      years. Patients are followed every 8 weeks for 2-3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 800 patients will be accrued for this study."
