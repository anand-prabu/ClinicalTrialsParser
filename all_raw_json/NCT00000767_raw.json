A prime-boost immunization approach using a\n      novel priming immunogen expressing env, gag, and pol genes of the HIV-1 IIIB strain will be\n      attempted in this study.\n\n      In Part I, vaccinia-immune volunteers are randomized to one of two regimens. Group A\n      receives priming with TBC-3B on days 0 and 56, followed by boosting on day 224 (8 months)\n      with one of the following: TBC-3B, an alternative immunogen such as pseudovirion particles\n      or a recombinant HIV-1 subunit or peptide vaccine, or placebo. Group B receives priming with\n      control vaccine (DryVax), followed by boosting with an appropriate placebo. At least 50\n      percent of subjects in Part I will be observed for a minimum of 8 weeks before subsequent\n      volunteers are enrolled in Part II. PER 11/18/94 AMENDMENT, Part I boosting is given on day\n      392. PER 5/19/95 AMENDMENT, Part I boosting is given on day 756 if not available on day 392;\n      if the appropriate product is not available then, the study will end on day 756. In Part II,\n      vaccinia-naive volunteers are randomized to one of three regimens. Group C receives TBC-3B\n      on day 0 and saline placebo on day 56. Group D receives TBC-3B on days 0 and 56. Both Group\n      C and D receive boosting with TBC-3B or an alternative immunogen on day 224. Group E\n      receives control vaccine (DryVax) on days 0 and 56, followed by appropriate placebo on day\n      224.
