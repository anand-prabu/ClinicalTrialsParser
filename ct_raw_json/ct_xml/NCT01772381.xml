    <textblock>
      Introduction: Babies born at term by elective caesarean section (CS) and before onset of
      labor are more likely to develop respiratory complications than babies born vaginally. In
      developing countries resources are scarce and it is difficult to provide expensive
      treatments as neonatal care.

      Aim of the Work: To assess the effect of prophylactic dexamethasone administration before
      elective cesarean section at term in reducing neonatal respiratory complications.

      Patients and methods:  600 women were included in the study and were planned to have
      elective caesarean section. 300 received dexamethasone 12 mg twice, 12 hours apart 48 hours
      before delivery. 300 patients were the control group.

      The outcomes were: incidence of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), incidence
      of transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN), the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome
      (RDS) and the need for mechanical ventilation.

      Dexamethasone which is a long acting corticosteroid can be used prior to elective cesarean
      section to decrease neonatal respiratory morbidity by enhacing fetal lung maturity.
