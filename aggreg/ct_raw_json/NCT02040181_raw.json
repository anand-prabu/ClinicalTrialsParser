The difference may be due to ethnicity. Thus we want to\n      establish a estimated creatinine clearance equation fitting in Taiwanese.\n\n      Besides, there are lots of studies discussing difference between CG and MDRD. We have found\n      that MDRD overestimated CG in patients who were older or thin. Therefore, we want to\n      analysis which characteristics of patients the difference are largest or smallest."
