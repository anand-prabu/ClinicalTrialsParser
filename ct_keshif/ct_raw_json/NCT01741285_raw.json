            "textblock": "Rationale:\n\n      Thus far, most clinical studies investigating the effects of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)\n      in asthma have concentrated on non-smoking asthmatics. However, a considerable proportion of\n      asthma patients smokes. Cigarette smoke consists of ultra-fine particles with a diameter\n      between 0.1 and 1 \u00b5m and therefore reaches even the smallest airways. In line with this, it\n      has been reported that smoking is associated with small airways dysfunction. The latter may\n      help to explain the observation that treatment with course particle inhaled corticosteroids\n      is less effective in smokers with asthma. Recently, extra-fine particle aerosols such as\n      hydrofluoroalkane-beclomethasone (HFA-QVAR) have become available for the treatment of\n      asthma, which are more likely to reach the smaller airways. Based on the above, we\n      hypothesize that extra-fine particle treatment with HFA-QVAR will be superior in improving\n      small airways dysfunction, especially in ex-smokers and smokers with asthma.\n\n      Objective: To perform a study comparing the efficacy of extra-fine particle HFA-QVAR 200 \u00b5g\n      b.i.d. to an equipotent dose of course particle HFA-beclomethasone (HFA-Clenil) 400 \u00b5g\n      b.i.d. and with coarse particle HFA-fluticasone  (GSK) 250 \u00b5g in ex-smokers and smokers with\n      asthma.\n\n      Study design:\n\n      This study will be an open-label, randomised, three-way cross-over, two-center study. 20\n      smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma will receive the following treatments for two weeks:\n\n      Treatment period A: 2-week treatment with HFA-QVAR (TEVA Pharma) 200 \u03bcg b.i.d. Treatment\n      period B: 2-week treatment with HFA-Clenil (Chiesi) 400 \u03bcg b.i.d. Treatment period C: 2-week\n      treatment with HFA-Fluticasone (GlaxoSmithKline) 250 \u03bcg b.i.d.\n\n      Study population:\n\n      20 smokers and 20 ex-smokers with asthma, aged 18-65 years, will receive the following\n      treatments for two weeks:\n\n      Intervention (if applicable):\n\n      A: 2-week treatment with HFA-QVAR (TEVA) 200 \u03bcg b.i.d. B: 2-week treatment with HFA-Clenil\n      (Chiesi) 400 \u03bcg b.i.d. C: 2-week treatment with HFA-Fluticasone (GlaxoSmithKline) 250 \u03bcg\n      b.i.d.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary end-parameter is the decrease in peripheral\n      airways resistance (R5-R20) at the provocative dose of small particle adenosine causing the\n      Forced Expiratory Volume in one second (FEV1) to drop with 20%. The co-primary end-parameter\n      is the PD20 small particle adenosine.\n\n      All patients will attend 7 visits to the outpatient clinic. At baseline and after treatment,\n      the following investigations will be performed: PC20AMP, PD20 small particle adenosine,\n      spirometry, IOS, body plethysmography, blood collection, filling in of questionnaires, and\n      nasal epithelial brushings."
