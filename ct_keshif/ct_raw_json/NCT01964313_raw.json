Centrifugation of plasma and\n           WBC will be done on-site within 30 minutes for DNA extraction. Samples will be stored\n           at -80\u2103 freezer for subsequent applications.\n\n        -  A nested case-controlled study is designed for the genetic analysis:\n\n             1. Cases: Patients suffered from death, myocardial infarction, stroke and coronary\n                revascularization and bleeding during the 2-year follow up. We expected to get 600\n                cases in the study cohort;\n\n             2. Controls: among patients without any of the above events during follow, matched\n                controls of 1:1 ratio will be selected according to date of admission (\u00b1 1 month),\n                age (\u00b1 5 years), sex, baseline ACS diagnosis, whether treated with PCI , the same\n                pattern of antithrombotic therapy and the study center.\n\n        -  Genotyping Genotype testing using exome DNA chips (Exome Beadchip). Exome Beadchip is a\n           high-throughput DNA chip designed by Illumina's, containing 240,000 SNP on exons in the\n           genome that may lead to functional changes.\n\n        -  Analysis:\n\n             1. To analysis the impact of genetic characteristics on selection of treatment\n                strategy in ACS patients, and its interaction with other baseline clinical\n                variables.\n\n             2. To analysis the impact of genetic characteristics on patient outcomes, and its\n                interaction with clinical characteristics and management patterns."
