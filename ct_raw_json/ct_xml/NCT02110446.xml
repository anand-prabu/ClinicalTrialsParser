      To evaluate the efficacy of Chinese herbal medicine (SS-1) for the Sjögren's syndrome (SJS)
      patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators take a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, cross-over design
      clinical trial to evaluate the effect of Chinese herbal medicine (SS-1) on the regulation of
      oxidative-related cytokines and the antioxidant capacity for the Sjögren's syndrome (SJS)
      patients. Through the oxidative stress reduction, the quality of life and clinical
      manifestation  will be improved. Investigators will also use a SJS cell model to elucidate
      the antioxidant mechanism of SS-1.

      The SJS patients in this clinical trial will be screened and be referred from the
      out-patient department (OPD) of the Rheumatology Department of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital.
      The patients will be divided into two groups (A and B) at random and all of them keep the
      routine treatment in the rheumatology OPD.  Group A patients will receive 12 weeks SS-1
      treatment first and stop the SS-1 for 4 weeks to enter the wash-out phase, and then receive
      12 weeks placebo treatment after the wash-out phase. Group B patients receive 12 weeks
      placebo first and stop the placebo treatment for 4 weeks to enter the wash-out phase, and
      then receive 12 weeks SS-1 treatment after the wash-out phase. SS-1 is composed of the
      powder of Gan-Lu-Yin, Sang-Ju-Yin and Xuefu-Zhuyu-Decoction with the ratio of 2:1:1 and the
      placebo is composed with corn starch, pigment and 1/100 SS-1. Patients in both groups take 6
      gram of experiment medicine three times per day. Investigators plan to evaluate the
      associated parameters at the time just before treatment (V1), after treatment for 12 weeks
      (V2), at the end of wash-out phase (V3) and when the crossover treatment is completed (V4).
      Investigators use EULAR Sjogren's syndrome patient reported index, ocular surface disease
      index and SJS symptom questionnaire for clinical evaluation, and use the SF-36 for quality
      of life. And investigators use the schirmer's test, salivary scintigraphy, oxidative stress
      marker and related cytokine for objective observation.

      Expected Results:

        1. SS-1 may improve the clinical manifestation and quality of life for the patients with
           Sjögren's syndrome

        2. To evaluate the effect of the Chinese medicine on the tongue diagnosis before and after
           treatment.

        3. SS-1 may reduce the oxidative stress (8-OHdG and mtDNA 4977 bp deletion) and elevate
           the antioxidant capacity (TAC, GSH, mtDNA copy number, SOD, GPX, CAT).

        4. SS-1 may have the regulatory effect on cytokine secretion and immune function.

        5. SS-1 may have the capacity of reducing the oxidative stress, elevating the antioxidant
           capacity and regulating the immune response in the model of submaxillary salivary gland
           cell line with the induction of IFN-γand IFN-α.

        6. Identification of the single herb in the SS-1 mixture that regulates oxidative stress
           and cytokine in the model of submaxillary salivary gland cell line, and set up of the
           Chinese herbs screen platform for Sjögren's syndrome.
