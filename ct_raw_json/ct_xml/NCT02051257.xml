    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the highest possible dose of central memory enriched T cells that
      can be given following standard stem cell transplant before unmanageable side effects are
      seen in patients with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that has returned after previous
      treatment. A T cell is a type of immune cell that can recognize and kill abnormal cells of
      the body. Central memory enriched T cells will be made from a patient's own T cells that are
      genetically modified in a laboratory. This means that the T cells are changed by inserting
      additional pieces of deoxyribonucleic acid (genetic material) into the cell to make it
      recognize and kill lymphoma cells. Central memory enriched T cells may kill the cells that
      are not killed by stem cell transplant and may lower the chances of the cancer recurring.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the safety and describe the full toxicity profile of cellular immunotherapy
      utilizing ex vivo expanded autologous central memory T cell (Tcm)-enriched T cells that are
      genetically modified using a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral vector to express a cluster
      of differentiation (CD)19 specific-, hinge optimized, CD28-costimulatory chimeric antigen
      receptor (CAR) as well as a truncated human epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
      (CD19R[EQ]28zeta/EGFRt+ Tcm) (autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched
      T cells) in conjunction with a standard myeloablative autologous hematopoietic stem cell
      transplant (HSCT) for patients with high-risk intermediate grade B-lineage non-Hodgkin
      lymphomas.

      II. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) based on dose limiting toxicities (DLTs).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the tempo, magnitude, and duration of engraftment of the transferred T cell
      product as it relates to the number of cells infused.

      II. To study the impact of this therapeutic intervention on the development of normal CD19+
      B-cell precursors in the bone marrow as a surrogate for the in vivo effector function of
      transferred autologous CD19R(EQ)28zeta/EGFRt+ Tcm.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive autologous CD19CAR-CD28-CD3zeta-EGFRt-expressing Tcm-enriched T cells
      intravenously (IV) over 15 minutes on day 2 or 3 following HSCT. Patients who experience
      disease progression and have not experienced serious treatment-related toxicities at greater
      than or equal to 100 days post T cell infusion will be allowed to receive an optional second
      T cell infusion.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 24 hours, weekly for 1
      month, monthly for 1 year, and then annually thereafter for a minimum of 15 years.
