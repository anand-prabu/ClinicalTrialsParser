  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia (PPE) is the only clinical adverse event that commonly
      occurs with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin treatment and it warrants
      special attention because it is the most common dose-limiting toxicity. this study is
      designed to test the effectiveness of a henna and propolis treatment protocol in the
      management of capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal doxorubicin induced palmar-plantar
      erythrodysesthesia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study with 250 cancer patients
      that will receive chemotherapy treatment with capecitabine and/or pegylated liposomal
      doxorubicin. The selection of potential participants will be based on pre-determined
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients will be randomly allocated either to the
      treatment group or the placebo group. Treatment will be delivered twice a week and
      assessments will take place at 0, 4, 8 and 12 weeks. The intervention group will receive the
      application of henna and propolis to the hands and/or feet of the patients and the control
      group will receive the placebo. At both baseline and follow-up, patients in both groups will
      be assessed for their degree of palmar-plantar erythrodysesthesia, the Quality of Life, the
      need for dose-limiting due to PPE and Pain intensity using standardized rating scales. Data
      will be analysed with inferential and descriptive statistics.

    <description>Based on the treatment protocol for this study the patients  will receive the henna and propolis treatment for 12 weeks (supervised treatment for first week and then unsupervised sessions twice a week). The treatment will include the application of the henna mixture (paste) (40gr natural henna and 40ml of purified water) to the affected areas (feet or/and hands) and wear socks or/and gloves. The treatment session will last for 2 hours and then the mixture will be rinsed with fresh water and the propolis (olive oil based) applied.</description>
