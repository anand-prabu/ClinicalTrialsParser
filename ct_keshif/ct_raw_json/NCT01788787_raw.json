Reach is defined as the proportion of smokers that enroll\n      in treatment with the Quitline.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the efficacy of AAC dissemination approach. Efficacy is defined as\n      the proportion of smokers who agree to be connected to the Quitline that enroll in treatment\n      who successfully achieve abstinence assessed 6 months following treatment enrollment.\n\n      Our primary outcome of interest is 7-day point prevalence abstinence. However, we will also\n      examine other definitions of abstinence including 24-hour point prevalence, 30 day point\n      prevalence, and continuous abstinence.\n\n      Specific Aim 3:  Evaluate the real-world impact of an AAC dissemination approach. Impact =\n      Reach x Efficacy."

Cotinine is a chemical released in your body when\n      it breaks down nicotine.  You will receive a kit in the mail with supplies for the testing.\n      The study staff will call you to make sure that you received the kit and to discuss the\n      instructions with you.  To collect the saliva, you will put a small piece of cotton in your\n      mouth for a few minutes.  You will mail the saliva sample back to the study staff, using a\n      postage-paid envelope.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your participation in this study will be complete after you collect the saliva sample and\n      mail it back to the study staff. Study data will be destroyed 5 years after the study has\n      been completed and the data has been analyzed. Data collected in this study will not be used\n      for future research.\n\n      This is an investigational study.\n\n      Up to 1,459 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will be enrolled at Harris\n      Health System clinics.\n\n      Harris Health System Staff:\n\n      If you agree to take part in the interview, you will be asked about your thoughts about\n      factors that may help or interfere with carrying out the Ask Advise Connect program (such as\n      time demands, resistance from patients and/or co-workers, or concerns about the\n      effectiveness of Quitline counseling).  This interview should take about 45 minutes.\n\n      Interviews will be audio-recorded, and the recordings will be sent to an outside company to\n      be transcribed (spoken words will be copied down in written form).  Before your recording is\n      sent to the outside company, your name and any personal identifying information will be\n      coded to protect your privacy.  The transcripts and audio recordings will be encrypted and\n      password-protected.  The audio recordings will be erased once the data have been published.\n\n      Interview Data:\n\n      Your responses will not be shared with your colleagues or anyone except the research staff\n      at MD Anderson.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Your participation in this study will be over after you complete the interview. Study data\n      will be destroyed 5 years after the study has been completed and the data has been analyzed.\n      Data collected in this study will not be used for future research.\n\n      This is an investigational study.\n\n      Up to 50 participants will be enrolled in this part of the study.  All will take part at\n      Harris Health System clinics."
