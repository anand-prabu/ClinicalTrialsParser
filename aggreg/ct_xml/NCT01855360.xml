  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The rate of progression of transthyretin cardiac amyloidosis, as measured by changes in strain echocardiography, in a group of patients taking a combination of doxycycline and TUDCA.</measure>
    <time_frame>Time Frame: * (FDAAA)  outcome measure is assessed every 6 months by serial echocardiography, with final measurement 18 months after enrollment.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Outcome measure, namely changes in longitudinal echocardiographic strain, will be compared to previously determined changes derived from a cohort of patients with TTR cardiac amyloidosis who were not receiving specific therapy for amyloid deposition.</description>
