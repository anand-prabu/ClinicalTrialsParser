  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Computer simulations are being developed to predict air flow abnormalities in the airways of
      patients with lung disease.  The purpose of this study is to obtain actual gas flow
      measurements in the lungs of healthy patients and patients with lung disease and use these
      measurements to validate the computer models.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Biotechnology High Performance Computing Software Applications Institute (BHSAI) of the
      Department of Defense (DoD) is studying airflow in the lungs using computational fluid
      dynamics in order to characterize disease-specific airflow patterns and provide useful
      information for medical applications. To validate these models, they are seeking to obtain
      experimental data of airflow in human lungs, both healthy and diseased. An assessment of
      airflow can be obtained by using hyperpolarized noble gas (HNG) magnetic resonance imaging
      (MRI) or, more specifically, hyperpolarized helium-3 (HHe) MRI in conjunction with
      flow-encoding schemes that are well-established in conventional proton MRI

      Four chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients and four healthy subjects will
      undergo pulmonary function tests (PFTs), computed tomography (CT) scan covering the mouth,
      neck, and chest, and hyperpolarized helium 3 MRI.  Before and after the MRI scans, three
      spirometry readings will be taken while the subject is lying in the same position as in the
      MR scanners.   Data will be analyzed by the BHSAI.  UVa will provide the de-identified raw
      image data and the de-identified results of the spirometry and other tests to BHSAI

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy subjects:

               -  Normal PFT values: FEV1 &gt; 90% predicted; and Forced vital capacity (FVC) &gt; 90%
                  predicted

               -  Normal chest x-ray (CXR)

               -  Medical history: No active pulmonary symptoms (cough, shortness of breath,
                  sputum); Negative history of pulmonary disease; Negative smoking history (never
                  smoked)

          -  Pulmonary Disease Subjects:

               -  PFT values:  FEV1/FVC &lt; 70% (indicative of obstruction); and 30% &lt; FEV1 &lt; 50%
                  predicted

               -  CXR normal except hyperinflation

               -  Symptoms - chronic shortness of breath

          -  All test subjects, healthy and with COPD should have similar physical anthropometric
             characteristics:

               -  Similar age with age difference less than 3 years

               -  Similar height (within 3-4 inches)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any condition for which a MRI procedure is contraindicated.

          -  Presence of any non-MRI compatible metallic material in the body, such as pacemakers,
             metallic clips, etc.

          -  Likelihood of claustrophobia

          -  Chest circumference greater than that of the helium MR coil.

          -  Pregnancy, by report of subject.  Clinically in the Department of radiology at UVA,
             self report is used when screening patients for MR scans as well as CT scans and
             fluoroscopy studies.  If the subject reports there is any chance of their being
             pregnant a urine pregnancy test will be performed prior to any imaging.
