This\n      has increased the need to risk-stratify patients with cirrhosis to better direct their\n      treatments and provide an accurate prognosis for their outcomes.  The traditional assessment\n      of the liver patient has been limited to imaging, static measures of \"liver function tests\"\n      and liver biopsy.  This protocol is designed to increase the spectrum of tests in the\n      evaluation of the patient with end stage liver disease."

            "textblock": "This study involves using the dual cholate test as our quantitative liver function test of\n      choice. Clearance of the oral cholate provides an assessment of portal blood flow. Clearance\n      of the intravenous (IV) cholate provides an assessment of the systemic blood flow. The ratio\n      of these clearances indicates the fraction of cholate that is shunted to the systemic\n      circulation, and is called the cholate shunt fraction.2\n\n      This study will measure cholate elimination rate constant (cholate Kelim), clearance of\n      orally administered cholate, clearance of intravenously administered cholate and cholate\n      shunt. This study will compare the presence and extent of the cholate clearances and shunt\n      fraction with the presence and extent of hepatic fibrosis and portal hypertension (as\n      measured by a hepatic venous pressure gradient [HVPG] procedure.)\n\n      The patients who will be enrolled in this study may or may not be those who are undergoing\n      clinically indicated hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurements at Baylor\n      University Medical Center, with or without a liver biopsy. Patients having the HVPG\n      measurements will be admitted to Baylor University Medical Center (BUMC) and prepared in the\n      routine clinical fashion for their clinically-indicated HVPG measurement. The cholate test,\n      including blood draws, will be performed after the HVPG procedure. The cholate test may also\n      be performed in the Hepatology clinic"
