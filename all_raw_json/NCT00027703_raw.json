Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing\n      or die. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block cancer growth in different\n      ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells\n      and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.
