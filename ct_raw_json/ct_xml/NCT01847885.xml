  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation (small levels of
      electricity) reduces post-stroke shoulder pain.  This study involves a device called the
      Smartpatch System.  The Smartpatch System delivers mild electrical stimulation to the
      muscles in the shoulder.  The Smartpatch System includes a small wire (called a &quot;Lead&quot;) that
      is placed through the skin into the muscle of the shoulder.  It also includes a device worn
      on the body that delivers stimulation (called the Smartpatch Stimulator).
