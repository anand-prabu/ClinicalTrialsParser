Several factors could\n      contribute: age, male sex, low body mass index (BMI), HIV infection per se, vitamin D\n      deficiency, using tenofovir/a protease inhibitor (time on and/or current use). Tenofovir is\n      used in a backbone of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues with emtricitabine (FTC), licensed\n      as TRUVADA\u00ae, or without this analogue, licensed as VIREAD\u00ae. FTC closely resembles lamivudine\n      (3TC) but is 5-fluorinated, the daily intake of fluoride is ~15 mg. Fluoride induces bone\n      formation by stimulating osteoblasts, of often impaired bone quality.\n\n      The aim of the study is to compare in a cross-sectional design fluoride levels, bone\n      renewal, bone mineral density (BMD) in HIV+ male patients treated by TRUVADA\u00ae or VIREAD\u00ae for\n      more than 60 months. The patients will be randomly selected, then matched according to age,\n      ethnic origin, BMI."
