In order to identify the factors that may affect the rate of embryo\n      cleavage, there are many studies about morphokinetics and culture medium, oxygen tension,\n      oocyte quality or type of medication used for ovarian stimulation. However there are no\n      published data with respect to the influence of semen quality in the embryo kinetic.\n\n      In this study The investigators propose that the sperm quality may has influence in the\n      embryo division."
