  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine if SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution is effective in
      promoting corneal epithelial wound healing in conditions associated with corneal epithelial
      disorders.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is currently no product approved for corneal epithelial wound healing. A Phase 1 Study
      SJP-0035/1-01 was conducted in healthy volunteers to investigate the safety, tolerability,
      and pharmacokinetic profile of SJP-0035 ophthalmic solution and to determine the appropriate
      dose to be evaluated in patients with moderate to severe corneal epithelial disorders.

      This Phase 2a study is being conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SJP-0035
      ophthalmic solution in patients to promote corneal epithelial wound healing in conditions
      associated with corneal epithelial disorders.
