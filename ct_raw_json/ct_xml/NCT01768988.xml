  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind controlled, parallel arms trial, aimed to assess the
      efficacy of pregabalin on pancreatic cancer induced abdominal pain. The goals of this study
      include (1) assessing the analgesic effect of pregabalin in comparison to placebo; assessing
      the presence of central sensitization and its potential reversion by Pregabalin; (3)
      assessing quality of life of patients treated with pregabalin in comparison to placebo; (4)
      to compare adverse effects in patients treated with Pregabalin in comparison to placebo; (5)
      to compare anxiety and depression in patients treated with pregabalin in comparison to
      placebo.
