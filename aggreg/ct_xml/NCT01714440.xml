  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past, the major problems in kidney transplantation were surgical complications, acute
      rejection, and infections.  Right now, researchers are focusing on improving immune
      suppression therapy and achieving better long-term survival of kidney transplants.  One of
      the ways to try to understand what causes loss of function after many years is to find out
      if there is a genetic factor involved.

      There are a number of differences in specific genes that have been identified and are
      thought to affect transplant outcomes.  Studying these gene variations (differences between
      people or differences between populations) is important in determining whether these
      variations are related to transplant outcomes and how this information can help patients
      achieve better long-term transplant survival.

      The major aim of this research study is to investigate the relationship between genetic
      variation in DNA (inherited code material in the cells of the body) and factors affecting
      transplant outcomes, like the drugs people receive or the way their immune systems work, for
      example.  To do this, investigators will collect blood samples from participants.  Genetic
      material will be separated from each blood sample and analyzed, looking for genetic
      variation.
