      The purpose of this study is to determine the changes in quality of life and degree of
      tremor for patients with essential tremor or Parkinsonian tremor who are treated by
      stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tremor is the most common of all movement disorders.  Patients with essential tremor (ET) or
      Parkinsonian tremor (PT) may be severely disabled by their tremor.  When the tremor is
      inadequately controlled by medications, surgical options are often offered.  However, some
      patients may prefer a noninvasive treatment approach and some patients are not surgical
      candidates for medical reasons.

      Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a treatment that uses high-energy highly-focused
      radiation (X-rays) to destroy a tiny region in the brain that causes tremor to occur.  This
      region is known as the ventral intermedius nucleus of the thalamus and is the same area
      targeted by surgical deep brain stimulator (DBS) treatment or neurosurgical operation
      (thalamotomy).  Multiple case series publications using Gamma Knife stereotactic radiation
      have been reported that show stereotactic radiosurgery is safe and effective treatment for
      ET and PT, making it a standard treatment for inoperable and inadequately controlled tremor
      patients.  However, radiation treatment by linear accelerator machines are much more common
      than Gamma Knife treatment machines in the United States, and there are no reports of large
      series of ET and PT patients treated using linear accelerator-based SRS using a noninvasive
      mask-based targeting system.

      This clinical trial asks the question of whether linear accelerator-based SRS is as safe and
      effective as that reported for Gamma Knife procedures, and whether it is a valid alternative
      to surgical thalamotomy or implantation of a deep brain stimulator (DBS) device.  The
      primary measurements are quality of life related to tremor before and after stereotactic
      radiosurgery treatment, and secondary measurements are degree of tremor severity and usage
      of tremor-related medications.

      Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) is a standard-of-care treatment for patients with severe
      tremor.  This clinical trial is a questionnaire-based trial that only involves completion of
      2 questionnaires at the consultation appointments with neurology and radiation oncology.
      The questionnaires only take a few minutes and will provide us with valuable information
      about how severe the patient's tremor is before and after SRS treatment at 3-month intervals
      for 1 year.  Patients can receive this treatment without participating in the clinical trial
      questionnaires.  All associated steps listed below are considered the Standard of Care and
      are billed to the patient's insurance per the usual routine.

      What to expect:

        1. All patients interested in SRS treatment for tremor must be evaluated by a movement
           disorder neurologist, Dr. Peter Hedera or Dr. Fenna Phibbs.  The neurologist will
           assess the severity of the tremor.  For clinical trial participation a questionnaire
           will be completed as a baseline measurement (this takes a few minutes).  If the patient
           is an appropriate candidate for SRS and there may be additional evaluations and
           discussion with the entire Movement Disorder group at monthly meetings.

           ** Please note: for Parkinson's disease patients, please come to the neurology
           evaluation &quot;functionally off medication&quot;, which means do NOT take the morning dose of
           Parkinson's related medications.

        2. Patients referred for SRS treatment will be evaluated by a radiation oncologist, Dr.
           Anthony Cmelak.  At this appointment, discussion will include descriptions of the
           procedure in detail and review of the risks and benefits of treatment.  For clinical
           trial participation, a questionnaire will be completed as a baseline assessment of the
           patient's tremor-related quality of life (this takes a few minutes).

        3. If the patient chooses to proceed with SRS, in the department of radiation oncology a
           tight-fitting thermal plastic mask will be custom made to fit around the patient's head
           and a CT scan of the head will be performed in radiation oncology.  This step takes
           about 45 minutes.

        4. A specialized MRI of the brain will be obtained for treatment planning.  This step
           takes about 1 hour.

        5. The patient will meet with a neurosurgeon, Dr. Joseph Neimat, who will be involved in
           the SRS planning and procedure.

        6. The patient will undergo a neuropsychological evaluation prior to SRS treatment, which
           is the standard of care for patients considering DBS.

        7. Approximately 1-2 weeks after completing all the consultation appointments and
           obtaining the imaging for planning, the single stereotactic radiation treatment will be
           performed.  The SRS procedure takes approximately 2.5 hours.  It is entirely outpatient
           and does not require anesthesia.  The procedure is noninvasive and painless (X-ray
           treatment).  During the entire treatment, the head is held tightly in the plastic mask.
            Oral anti-anxiety medication may be given to relax the patient.

           Follow-up:

        8. At 3 month intervals for 1 year, the patient will have follow-up appointments with
           radiation oncology and neurology.  A brain MRI may be performed at some of these
           intervals to document the treatment effect on the brain tissue. For participation in
           the clinical trial, at these follow-up appointments the quality of life questionnaire
           will be completed at the radiation oncology visit and the severity of tremor
           questionnaire will be completed at the neurology visit .

        9. At 6 months after SRS treatment, a neuropsychological evaluation will be performed.

      All patients interested in stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) or participating in this
      questionnaire-based clinical trial should feel free to call the contact phone numbers listed
      below or have their physician refer the patient for consultation with Dr. Peter Hedera or
      Dr. Fenna Phibbs in the neurology department at Vanderbilt or with Dr. Anthony Cmelak in the
      radiation oncology department at Vanderbilt.
