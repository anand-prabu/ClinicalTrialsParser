Aortic valve predilation is\n      aiming at facilitating the crossing of the aortic annulus, accurate valve positioning and\n      does also provide information on the anatomy of the valve complex. However, BAV has been\n      shown to have a number of potentially detrimental effects, such as:\n\n        -  Functional cardiac arrest induced by rapid pacing leads to transient coronary,\n           cerebral, and renal ischemia.\n\n        -  In patients with a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), prolonged cardiac\n           depression after rapid pacing is observed and may result in hemodynamic failure and\n           systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). Both are associated with a high\n           periprocedural mortality.\n\n        -  BAV has been identified as a major source of thrombotic and valvular material and\n           increases the risk for coronary obstruction with subsequent myocardial infarction and\n           stroke.\n\n        -  The local trauma in the left-ventricular outflow tract caused by BAV may potentially\n           contribute to aortic root rupture."
