            "textblock": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the most common diseases in the\n      world. In a recent study, we showed that administration of levofloxacin is superior to\n      placebo in the treatment of decompensation of COPD; it is accompanied by a substantial\n      reduction in mortality and a significant reduction in the residence time in hospital.\n\n      In Tunisia, few data are available on the epidemiology of COPD decompensation. The choice of\n      antibiotic to be used in this situation is challenging to the clinician who must choose\n      between traditional antibiotics (cyclins, aminopenicillins, cotrimoxazole...) and new\n      antimicrobial agents.  Recently, it has been emphasized the selection of patients for\n      treatment according to the degree of systemic inflammation (C-Reactive Protein). Indeed,\n      there would have a correlation between the tracheobronchial infection and elevated\n      inflammatory markers. As the elevation of these markers is proportional to the intensity of\n      the inflammatory reaction of the body, is based on the kinetics of these biomarkers in\n      antibiotic treatment seems logical. Thus, C-Reactive Protein  allowed not only knowing when\n      to start antibiotics, but also through their kinetic, these markers can guide the duration\n      of therapy and shorten the duration of antibiotic therapy: a rate cut would ensure that the\n      antibiotic treatment was adopted.\n\n      The objectives of this randomized prospective and double blind study are to evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of a short treatment of 48 with levofloxacin compared with treatment\n      with the same molecule during a time guided by monitoring markers of inflammation in\n      patients admitted to the emergency for exacerbation of COPD and to study the epidemiology of\n      viral and bacterial COPD decompensation."
