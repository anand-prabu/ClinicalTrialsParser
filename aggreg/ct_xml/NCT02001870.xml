  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As age increases the chances for a woman to become pregnant decrease as well spontaneously
      as through assisted reproductive technologies (ART). For the treatment of unexplained
      infertilities two techniques can be used: intra-uterine insemination (IUI) and in vitro
      fertilization (IVF). The aim of the present study is to compare the efficiency in term of
      delivery rate of IUI and IVF in couples in whom the female age is over 37 years.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IUI can be used to treat infertility when tubes are normal, with no severe endometriosis and
      enough motile spermatozoa can be inseminated. In these cases IUI are usually performed (4 to
      6 attempts) and IVF only in case of IUI failure. Indeed if the pregnancy rate per attempt is
      higher with IVF, IUI can be performed more frequently (6 times a year vs. 2 for IVF) so that
      the pregnancy rates after one year of treatment are close. When female age is over 37 years,
      some ART centers prefer to perform directly IVF, since chances of pregnancy decreases with
      time. However there is no argument in the literature in favor as well as in disfavor for
      such an attitude. Indeed the delivery rates after one year treatment with IUI or IVF are not
      known in this population. Therefore we propose a multicentric randomized controlled trial
      comparing IUI and IVF in women over 37 with unexplained infertility. Couples will be
      randomly allocated to IUI or IVF during one year. In case of absence of pregnancy after 4
      IUI, couples will be treated by IVF. ART attempts will be performed according to usual
      procedures of each center. The follow-up will be ended either at the end of the first year
      of treatment if no pregnancy is obtained or at the time of delivery if a pregnancy is
      obtained. All data of attempts (demographics data, type and doses of treatment, adverse
      effects, outcome, number and health state of newborns....) will be recorded.
