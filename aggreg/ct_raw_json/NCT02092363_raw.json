A total of 6 cycles of\n      paclitaxel and carboplatin will be given. Additional cycles may be given as per\n      institutional standard of care after discussion with the Medical Monitor. Treatment with\n      OMP-54F28 will continue after completion of treatment with paclitaxel and carboplatin. The\n      planned dose levels of OMP-54F28 are 5 and 10 mg/kg."

Depending on emerging safety data from the Phase 1a study 54F28-001 with\n      continuing dose escalation, additional higher dose levels of OMP-54F28 may be evaluated in\n      this study. Alternative dosing schedules of OMP-54F28 may be explored based on emerging\n      nonclinical and clinical data for safety, PD, PK and efficacy. The starting dose for a new\n      dosing schedule will be chosen to result in an AUC equivalent to the highest dose level that\n      cleared on the previously studied dosing schedule. No dose escalation of OMP-54F28 will be\n      allowed within a dose cohort.\n\n      Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or maximum administered dose (MAD) has been\n      determined, up to 10 patients may be enrolled in the cohort-expansion phase to better\n      characterize the safety, tolerability and PK of OMP-54F28 combined with paclitaxel and\n      carboplatin. Up to approximately 34 patients may be enrolled into the study."
