A clinical history of olive pollen induced allergic rhinoconjunctivitis with or\n             without asthma at least one year prior to trial entry.\n\n          3. Positive SPT to olive pollen (wheal diameter \u2265 3 mm).\n\n          4. A positive specific IgE against olive pollen (\u2265Class 2; \u22650.70 KU/L) documented in the\n             last 5 y\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. FEV1 < 70% of predicted value at screening after adequate pharmacologic treatment.\n\n          2. Uncontrolled or severe asthma.\n\n          3. A clinically relevant history of symptomatic perennial allergic rhinitis and/or\n             conjunctivitis caused by an allergen to which the subject is regularly exposed and\n             sensitized.\n\n          4. History of severe asthma exacerbation  or emergency room visit or admission for\n             asthma in the previous 12 months.\n\n          5. At screening, current symptoms of, or treatment for, upper respiratory tract\n             infection, acute sinusitis, acute otitis media or other relevant infection (serous\n             otitis media is not an exclusion criterion).\n\n          6. Treatment with parenteral corticosteroids, oral corticosteroids or anti-IgE in the\n             previous 3 months or during the study (except for steroids if needed as rescue\n             medication).\n\n          7. Currently treated with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, tricyclic\n             antidepressants, \u03b2-blockers, mono amine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) and any other drug\n             containing alum (e.g. antacids) taken on a daily basis.\n\n          8. Previous treatment by other allergen concomitant IT or immunotherapy with Olea\n             europaea extracts within the previous 5 years (initiation of subcutaneous\n             immunotherapy is acceptable if treatment has been discontinued before reaching\n             maintenance dose; for SLIT 3 months in the last 5 years is accepted).\n\n          9. History of anaphylactic shock due to e.g. food, insect venom, exercise or drug.\n\n         10. History of severe and recurrent angioedema.\n\n         11. Any contraindication according to the Investigator Brochure (IB).\n\n         12. Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to screening."
