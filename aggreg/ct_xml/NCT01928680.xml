  <brief_summary>

      It is a phase II trial to explore the efficacy and safety of cisplatin plus capecitabine in
      anthracycline and taxane-pretreated metastatic triple negative breast cancer patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cisplatin contained regimens have been demonstrated to be effective in metastatic triple
      negative breast cancer patients in some phase II clinical trials. Meanwhile, Capecitabine is
      also a highly effective choice for metastatic breast cancer with considerable duration of
      response. Combination of cisplatin and capecitabine have been proved effective in metastatic
      breast cancer in several phase II trials. This study is aimed to investigate the efficacy
      and safety of this combination in triple negative breast cancer patients.
