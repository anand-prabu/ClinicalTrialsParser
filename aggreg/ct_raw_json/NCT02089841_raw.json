Therefore, the purpose of this study was to\n      assess the efficacy of Artemether-lumefantrine for the treatment of uncomplicated malaria\n      among children after five years of wide scale use of the drug in Tanzania."

ACTs have proven to\n      be highly efficacious in different parts of the world with different malaria endemicity.\n      Artemisinins clear asexual parasites rapidly and they are also potent against P. falciparum\n      gametocytes, hence reducing disease transmission and spread of drug resistance. Nonetheless,\n      a report in Kenya shows an increase in proportion of patients with parasitaemia on day 1.\n      Most recently, resistance against artemisinins has been confirmed in four countries of\n      South-East Asia, and it may spread to  Africa.\n\n      In order to safeguard ACTs life span, WHO recommends all suspected malaria cases to be\n      confirmed with parasitological diagnosis, followed by prompt treatment with effective\n      antimalarials. It also emphasizes on the need to conduct efficacy studies for the first and\n      second line antimalarial treatments after every two years so as to be able to detect\n      resistance early on its course. Therefore, based on this notion, this study aimed to assess\n      the therapeutic efficacy of Artemether/Lumefantrine among children with uncomplicated\n      falciparum malaria in Bagamoyo district, five years after its wide scale use in Tanzania."
