The context\n      of the disease and current data on sunitinib suggest that sunitinib may have activity in\n      patients with advanced non resectable cholangiocarcinoma.\n\n      Thereby, it is proposed to conduct an open label single arm trial aiming evidencing activity\n      of sunitinib in such a patient population."
