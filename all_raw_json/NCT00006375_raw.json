Determine the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of this regimen in these\n      patients. III. Determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral LY293111 twice daily.\n      Treatment continues for a maximum of 6 months in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LY293111 until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Additional patients\n      are treated at the MTD. Patients are followed at 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
