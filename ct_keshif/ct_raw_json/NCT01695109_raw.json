A possible mechanism of this effect might be\n      associated with changes in food choices, as suggested by animal studies. It has been shown\n      that functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the brain is a valuable tool in obesity\n      research and can be used to study the response of several brain regions to the visual\n      presentation of preferred in comparison to non preferred food items and  to non food items\n      The aim of this study is to search for possible effects of liraglutide in comparison to\n      placebo on 1. food choices and 2. changes in brain function as evidenced by fMRI in healthy\n      volunteers.\n\n      Findings of this study will help not only to get deeper insight into the mechanism of the\n      anorexic effect of GLP-1 mimetics, but also into the regulation of food choices per se. In\n      the future, it is planned to extend the results of this study in normal weight volunteers to\n      obese diabetic subjects."

Study\n      sessions will be performed on the fourth day after placebo/liraglutide interventions.\n\n      Study sessions: On study days participants arrive at the trial centre at 8.00 am after a 12h\n      fast. Participants are instructed to eat a light dinner around 8.00 pm the previous day and\n      to spend around 8h resting during the night before the study days. Upon arrival, blood\n      pressure and heart rate is measured and an iv line is started, from which a blood sample is\n      taken from the antecubital vein for blood glucose, insulin and plasma hormone concentrations\n      determination. The occurrence of nausea, vomiting, dizziness or any other adverse events\n      (AE's) is reviewed together with the subject.\n\n      Instructions for the fMRI examination are reviewed together with the subject. The subject is\n      advised to leave all ferromagnetic items behind, and baseline hunger/satiety visual analogue\n      scales (VAS) are recorded. Then, the fMRI session with the food items paradigm (together\n      with repeated recordings of hunger/satiety VAS) takes place. Afterwards, another blood\n      sample and hunger/satiety VAS is taken and the subject is allowed to eat ad libitum from a\n      buffet breakfast. Food intake is recorded in detail, including meal choices and calorie\n      intake. After a final hunger/satiety VAS recording and another blood sample subjects are\n      dismissed from the trial centre.\n\n      Outcome variables: Main outcome variables are fMRI activity in the brain during the high\n      calorie/low calorie food items paradigm and food intake at the buffet liraglutide vs.\n      placebo at the end of treatment. Secondary outcome parameters are hunger/satiety VAS\n      ratings, total and active plasma ghrelin, peptide YY (PYY), glucose and insulin\n      concentrations."
