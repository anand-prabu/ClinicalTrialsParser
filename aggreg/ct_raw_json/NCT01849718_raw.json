The therapy Garden Nacadia has an evidence-based design that is\n      specially designed for the treatment of stressed people.\n\n      Nacadia-therapy can be described as a process in which the patient's health and well-being\n      is assumed to enhance by the presence of the natural environment and through participating\n      in meaningful gardening activities.\n\n      NEST concerns research on the effect of Nacadia-therapy. The study consists of randomized\n      and longitudinal studies of the effects of Nacadia-therapy compared to acknowledged\n      cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT).\n\n      The outcome measures for example consist of: ability to return to work, health care use,\n      psychological measurements related to stress, health, quality of life and changes in\n      medication use. Further, exploratory studies of the garden therapy in the form of\n      observations and interviews will be performed, to get a better understanding of the garden\n      and the garden activities' importance for the therapeutic purposes.\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      - garden therapy, in a designed natural environment, will lead to improved health and\n      well-being for people who are off sick with stress-related disorders"

Because the Nacadia-therapy uses a large number of\n      hours, it has been decided to compare it with the longest conventional treatment that can be\n      offered through the public health insurance of stress-related disorders such as anxiety and\n      depression.\n\n        1.
