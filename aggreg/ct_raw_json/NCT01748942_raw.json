Determine the effect of postoperative corticosteroids on postoperative dysphagia\n      following TORS.\n\n      II. Determine the effect of postoperative corticosteroids on length of hospital stay\n      following TORS.\n\n      III. Determine the complications associated with postoperative corticosteroid use after\n      TORS.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients receive dexamethasone intravenously (IV) at the time of surgery and orally\n      (PO) every 8 hours for up to 4 days following surgery.\n\n      ARM II: Patients receive dexamethasone IV at the time of surgery and placebo PO every 8\n      hours for up to 4 days following surgery.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 12 months."
