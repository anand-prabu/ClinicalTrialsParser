      HYPOTHESIS: The investigators hypothesize that sonoelastography (SE) provide accurate
      quantitative measurements that can be used to stage liver fibrosis in patients with chronic
      liver disease.

        1. To measure liver stiffness with sonoelastography in adults with suspect diffuse liver
           disease who will undergo nonfocal liver biopsy as part of their routine clinical care.

        2. To assess the sensitivity and specificity of sonoelastography for the detection and
           staging of liver fibrosis

      BACKGROUND Chronic liver disease is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the
      United States. A retrospective cohort study identified 2,353 patients with newly diagnosed
      chronic liver disease (63.9 cases/100,000 population)1,2 Extrapolating this incidence rate
      there will be approximately 150,000 patients with chronic liver disease diagnosed in
      gastroenterology clinics each year 1. Almost 20%, or an estimated 30,000 patients per year,
      had established cirrhosis at the time of presentation to the gastroenterologist 3.

      Cirrhosis remains a major public health problem and disease-related complications were
      associated with nearly 40,000 deaths and more than 1.4 billion dollars spent on medical
      services in the US.   There is a great need to develop and identify methods of risk
      stratification and prognostication for patients with chronic liver disease 4 Hepatic
      fibrosis is the final common pathway for many different liver insults and is now known to be
      a dynamic process that is at least partially reversible. The diagnosis and quantification of
      fibrosis relies on liver biopsy 5, and liver biopsy is currently the gold standard for
      detecting and staging hepatic fibrosis 6. However, liver biopsy is an invasive procedure
      with significant risks, including hemorrhage, infection and visceral perforation.  In
      addition, liver biopsy is a poor gold standard, because it is limited by interobserver
      variability in interpretation and sampling errors in 25-45% of cases5,6, .

      A number of indirect markers and indices of liver fibrosis have been used in clinical
      practice. Noninvasive tests can be distinguished by direct vs. indirect measures of fibrosis
      and also classified by the modality of the test as serum vs. imaging.7  Biomarkers of the
      structural elements of fibrogenesis and the key inflammatory mediators involved in the
      genesis or degradation of scar tissue are often referred to as direct components. Indirect
      markers can reflect the accompanying alterations in hepatic function.

      Fibrotic livers demonstrate increased stiffness.  This property can be exploited and
      measured using a newly developed ultrasound technology named Ultrasound Elastography
      (Transient Elastography (TE) or sonoelastography (SE)8. SE is performed by insonating the
      patient with a low energy, low amplitude, and low frequency shear wave created by focused
      ultrasound or by a vibrating probe on the skin.  The small tissue movements produced by the
      propagated wave are then measured with ultrasound. The propagated wave travels faster with
      increasing fibrosis: the stiffer the tissue, the faster the shear wave propagates.9 A
      pulse-echo ultrasound acquisition allows measurement of the wave velocity and the results
      are presented as kilopascals (kPa). Tissue elasticity is calculated as the median of 10
      measurements and ranges from 2.5 to 75 kPa with normal values around 5.5 kPa10 (Normal liver
      stiffness ranges between 3.3-7.8 kPa)11 Hepatic stiffness can be measured within a cylinder
      of tissue 1 cm wide and 4 cm in length producing an estimated sampling area that is 100
      times greater than a biopsy.12,13 A meta-analysis assessing the capacity of transient
      elastography to diagnose moderate fibrosis found pooled estimates for sensitivity and
      specificity of 70% and 84% respectively12,13.  The mean AUROC for the diagnosis of
      significant fibrosis was 0.84% with a optimal cut-off of 7.6 kPa, and the diagnostic
      accuracy of SE for cirrhosis had an AUROC ranging from 0.90- 0.99 (mean AUROC 0.94) and
      cut-off from 9.0 to 26.5 kPa.14,15  The benefits of SE are that it is inexpensive,
      reproducible, painless, rapid (&lt; 10 min), easy to perform, and can be used for diagnosis,
      prognosis and monitoring disease progression.15 Limitations of sonoelastography are that
      measurements cannot be obtained in the presence of marked obesity, ascites, or unusually
      narrow intercostal spaces when externally applied vibrating shear wave generators are used.

      SPECIFIC AIMS

        1. To evaluate liver stiffness with the diagnostic imaging method of sonoelastography
           among adults with suspect liver diseases.

        2. To obtain estimates of the sensitivity and specificity of sonoelastography for the
           detection and staging of liver fibrosis.

      STUDY PROCEDURES Study Visit 1: (SE or sonoelastography )

        -  Sonoelastography will be performed prior to standard pre-biopsy ultrasound imaging
           using a FDA-approved ultrasound unit. This unit will use ultrasound energy within the
           limits set by the FDA for diagnostic ultrasound to create a shear wave front that is
           progressively distorted as it traverses the tissue. Ultrafast ultrasound imaging will
           then be used to detect the speed of propagation of the shear wave front.

        -  The unit will emit no ionizing radiation and will perform ultrasound acquisition within
           the acoustic power and intensity limits established by the

      FDA for diagnostic sonography. At these energy levels there are no known bioeffects of
      ultrasound. Sonoelastography measurements will require approximately 15 minutes, and will be
      painless.

        -  The unit is a cart-based ultrasound system used to perform non-invasive diagnostic
           ultrasound studies. The system functions in a manner identical to all diagnostic
           ultrasound systems and transducers for the conventional modes: B-mode, Harmonic
           imaging, Spatial Compounding imaging and Power Doppler. Additionally, the system uses a
           new imaging mode based on shear wave elastography to map tissue stiffness. The
           elastography mode produces color-coded images of different tissues based on their
           elasticity. The color scale represents a quantitative assessment of tissue stiffness,
           thereby allowing elasticity of tissue to be quantified in units of kilopascals (kPa).

        -  At the conclusion of Study Visit 1, the patient will return to usual care.

      Tests and Parameters:

      Sonoelastography parameters:

      Mean liver stiffness (elastogram) in kilopascal (kPa). SE normal values approximately 5.5
      kPa (Normal liver stiffness ranges between 3.3-7.8 kPa) Significant Fibrosis (F3): = or &gt;
      7.6 kPa, Cirrhosis (F4): = or &gt; 9.0- 26 kPa

      Data Collection

      Data to be collected includes:

        -  Gender, ethnicity, Age, BMI, History of previous and current medication use, detail
           history of alcohol intake, comorbidities, signs and symptoms.

        -  Biochemical liver tests that are typically performed as part of routine clinical care
           (AST, ALT, APH, GGT, TB, IB, DB, Albumin, Total proteins, PT).

      Other laboratory data typically performed as part of routine clinical care:

      RBC, WBC, Platelets, Glucose, Creatinine, lipid profile. Any laboratory study for the
      diagnosis of the suspected diffuse liver disease: Viral serology, including HCV, HBV,
      Ferritin, ceruloplasmin, AMA, ANA, Alphafetoprotein.

      Any liver histopathologic report.

      - Sonoelastography report. TABLE 1: Measure parameters of grading fibrosis/cirrhosis between
      the sonoelastography and Histology. 5,8, ,15. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Fibrosis marker Fibrosis
      Cirrhosis SonoElastography Normal liver stiffness ranges between 3.3-7.8 kPa Significant
      Fibrosis (F3): 7.6 kPa

      Cirrhosis (F4):

      9.0- 26 kPa Histology (METAVIR) F0- No fibrosis F1- Portal fibrosis without septa F2- Portal
      fibrosis with rare septa F3- Numerous septa without cirrhosis F4- Cirrhosis

      Descriptive statistics will be shown as mean Â± standard deviation or percentages as
      appropriate. The patients will be divided according to fibrosis stage. The groups' binary
      diagnostic by different diagnostic methods will be compared with the gold standard by
      McNemar's Test. We will use contingency tables to analyze the correlation between
      sonoelastographic measurements. Factors independently correlated with liver stiffness will
      be assessed by multiple regression analysis. The diagnostic performance of fibrosis and/or
      liver stiffness will be determined in terms of sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values, diagnostic accuracy and area under receiver operating
      characteristics (ROC) curves. This is a pilot study and the investigators are planning to
      enroll 100 subjects to include in this study. With 100 patients included in this study the
      investigators can have a &gt; 80% power to detect a significant diagnostic power by
      SonoElastography with a true AUC between of 0.85 as opposed to the null with an AUC of 0.62
      or lower using a two-sided test with 5% type I error. In addition, multivariate linear and
      logistic regression models will be used to evaluate the diagnostic power of independent
      factors taking into account possible confounders by patient demographic and clinical
      characteristics. The primary outcome of interest will be fibrosis.

      RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS Ultrasound Elastography: Ultrasound elastography requires the
      administration of ultrasound energy at levels similar to those used in diagnostic
      ultrasonography. There are no known bioeffects of ultrasound at these energies.

      Pregnant women are excluded from this study. There are no known risks of sonoelastography to
      an embryo or fetus (a developing baby still in the womb). There may be risks to an embryo or
      fetus that are currently unknown.

      POTENTIAL BENEFITS Although knowledge about liver diseases and fibrosis has increased
      dramatically over the last few years, much remains to be learned. The imaging strategy that
      will be evaluated, ultrasound sonoelastography, has the potential to reduce the number of
      liver biopsies performed for the diagnosis and monitoring of hepatic fibrosis. This study is
      expected to provide a basis for future investigation into non-invasive imaging markers of
      hepatic fibrosis. Any data obtained for the purposes of this study will be available to the
      subject's primary physicians.
