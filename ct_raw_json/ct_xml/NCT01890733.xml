    <textblock>
      This is a post-marketing study to further assess the safety and effectiveness of the
      InSpace™  device implantation  in comparison to surgical repair of full thickness Massive
      Rotator Cuff Tear .

      The effectiveness will be assessed by comparing the scores of the ASES, Constant and Quick
      DASH outcome questionnaires with respect to pain reduction, improvement of activity of daily
      living(ADL) and improvement of range of motion (ROM).

        Main Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 40 or older.

          -  Positive diagnostic imaging (CT arthrogram or MRI)*  of the affected shoulder
             indicating full thickness Massive RCT  of at least 5cm  in diameter (according to
             Cofield classification) or long - narrow tears of at least 4cm2 (W&gt;2cm and L&gt;2cm)
             including fatty infiltration grade III or IV (according to classification of
             Goutallier) involving more than one tendon.
                                            -  Persistent pain and functional disability of the
             affected shoulder for at least 3 months.

        Main Exclusion Criteria :

          -  Known allergy to the balloon material (copolymer of PLA and -θ-caprolactone).

          -  Evidence of significant osteoarthritis or cartilage damage in the shoulder

          -  Evidence of gleno-humeral instability

          -  Previous surgery of the shoulder in the past 2 years, excluding diagnostic
             arthroscopy
