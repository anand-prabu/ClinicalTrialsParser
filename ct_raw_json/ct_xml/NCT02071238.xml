  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Understanding of an operation and its risks has been shown to give patients more realistic
      expectations, increase cooperation and result in higher satisfaction. Traditionally,
      informed consent for surgical procedures involve a discussion between the surgeon and the
      patient, but many patients easily forget the details of these talks. The investigators wish
      to investigate if providing a written pamphlet along with the standard oral discussion
      improves patients' ability to remember the details of the operation, improving the quality
      of the informed consent process.

      Objective of this study The investigators' study objectives are to see if additionally
      providing a written document along with the discussion of surgical risks improves risk
      recall for patient seen in consultation for open carpal tunnel release, and if this has any
      effect on overall satisfaction after the procedure.

      To accomplish this goal, the investigators intend to provide patients with a written
      document outlining the same risks as are discussed in consultation and investigate if their
      recall of the risks is improved compared to patients who receive discussion alone. The
      investigators propose to do this as a prospective randomized control trial of patients who
      are new referrals to the Halifax Infirmary Plastic Surgery Clinic.

      Background The informed consent process The risks and benefits of an operation or procedure
      are typically discussed as part of the informed consent process for an initial surgical
      consultation. Informed consent is a legal requirement for surgery and is based on the
      components of disclosure, comprehension, competence and voluntary choice. Despite this,
      patients are often unable to recall the specific risks that were reviewed. Additionally,
      failure to understand the possible risks and failure of communication are more common
      reasons for patients to seek legal action. Patients have historically reported that they
      wished they had received more information about their operation prior to surgery.

      Increased understanding of a procedure and its risks has been shown to give patients more
      realistic expectations, increase cooperation and result in higher satisfaction.
      Traditionally, obtaining informed consent for surgical procedures has involved an oral
      discussion, but this may be insufficient as oral information tends to be poorly retained.

      Previous research in the field of otolaryngology has shown that written documentation in
      addition to oral discussion increases recall of both general knowledge of a procedure and of
      the specific risks of a procedure. Siau et al. (2010) found that this effect was even more
      pronounced for recall of the risks associated with the operation and that subjectively
      patients were found to be happy to have received a pamphlet and found it helpful. Early
      research into this subject in general surgery suggested that the optimal time to provide
      additional information regarding a procedure is at the time of the initial consultation or
      at least one week prior to surgery.

      The investigators' research is important as it could show that providing a written document
      in conjunction with the standard oral discussion improves patients' risk recall in the
      informed consent process for open carpal tunnel surgery. In addition, the investigators wish
      to look into whether this in turn increases satisfaction with the procedure. Though past
      research has drawn a link between comprehension and satisfaction, very little research has
      been conducted specifically on this topic. In the future this research could be extended to
      other surgical practices.

      Hypothesis The investigators are testing whether providing a written document in conjunction
      with the standard oral discussion improve patients' risk recall in the informed consent
      process for open carpal tunnel release and increase patients' subjective satisfaction with
      their operation.

      Patient Selection

      The investigators study will be a prospective randomized study of 100 consecutive patients
      being seen for open carpal tunnel release consultation at the Halifax Infirmary. Inclusion
      criteria will be:

      The sample size was chosen based on previous studies investigating risk recall and a power
      calculation for sample size given the hypothesis (n = 28).
