Tumor, normal breast tissue and blood samples will be\n      collected at baseline and at surgery. Post-operative treatment will be at the discretion of\n      the investigator.\n\n      Primary objective: to determine if a short course of RANKL inhibition with denosumab can\n      induce a decrease in tumor proliferation rates as determined by Ki67 immunohistochemistry\n      (IHC) in newly diagnosed, early stage breast cancer in pre-menopausal women.\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        -  To determine the number of absolute Ki67 responders after a short course of denosumab\n           (defined as <2.7% IHC staining in the post treatment tumor biopsy).\n\n        -  To determine the effects of a short course of denosumab on serum C-terminal telopeptide\n           levels (CTX).\n\n        -  To determine the effects of a short course of denosumab on  RANK/RANKL gene expression\n           and signaling as assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and gene expression profile in\n           the tumor.\n\n        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on tumor apoptosis rates using\n           IHC\n\n        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on modulating the immature\n           mammary epithelial cell populations in the tumor.\n\n        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on estrogen signaling pathways\n           in the tumor.\n\n        -  To determine the effect of a short course of denosumab on various immune - To determine\n           effect of safety profile of denosumab"
