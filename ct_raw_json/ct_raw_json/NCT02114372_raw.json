Data collection to assess outcome measures\n      associated with disease progression will occur at baseline and every 6 months thereafter at\n      the clinic during the follow-up period of 48 months. Blood, urine, and saliva samples will\n      be collected from participants during the study for biomarker analyses to assess risk\n      factors for dementia, Alzheimer's disease or confounding factors of dementia risk. Adverse\n      events experienced by the participants during their participation in the study will be\n      monitored."
