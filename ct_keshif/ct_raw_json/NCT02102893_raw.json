            "textblock": "Neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) are neoplasms originating from neuroendocrine cells located\n      throughout the body. They secret various peptides and cause various symptoms (carcinoid\n      syndrome) or not. The incidence of NETs was not well-known till recently when Yao et al. and\n      Hausa et al. published their surveys of NETs using data from the US Surveillance,\n      Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and from the Norwegian Registry of Cancer\n      (NRC). The NETs incidence was 1.09 per 100,000 in 1973 and increased to 3.31 and 5.25 per\n      100,000 in 1993 and 2004, respectively, based on the SEER data. The NETs incidence in Norway\n      increased from 2.35 per 100,000 during 1993-1997 to 4.06 per 100,000 during 2000-2004.  The\n      incidence of NETs in Taiwan by using the Taiwan Cancer Registry (TCR) data was increased\n      from 0.3 to 1.51 per 100,000 from 1996 to 2008. The increased incidence for NET worldwide\n      probably was partially due to the awareness and improvement of diagnostic technology.\n      Compared with the incidence in western countries, the incidence of NET is much lower in\n      Taiwan.  And the incidence of NETs in Asian Pacific Islanders was also lower than the whites\n      and blacks in US. Gastroenteral-pancreatic NETs (GEP-NETs), accounting for half to two\n      thirds of all NETs, is the most common site of NETs. As the progress in the understanding of\n      pathophysiology for GEP-NET, there are two novel targeted agents shown to be effective for\n      the treatment of GEP-NET. Meanwhile, response to mTOR inhibitor was better for Asian than\n      Caucasian in the phase III study using everolimus for advanced pancreatic NETs. These\n      information suggests that there is racial difference for either genetic or environmental\n      risk factors and these factors result in different incidence and/or clinical outcome.\n      Currently, there is limited data for thorough epidemiologic study in Taiwan. The aim of this\n      study is to collect clinical information for GEP-NET, and survey the prognostic factors for\n      GEP-NET in Taiwan. We suppose that this epidemiologic study would provide a database\n      potentially to improve the diagnosis, and treatment of GEP-NET. This study plans to include\n      500 GEP-NET patients."
