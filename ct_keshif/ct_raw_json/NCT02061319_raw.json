We will also see if Nordic walking: improves heart performance\n      (measured by heart ultrasound); improves how active people are (measured by an activity\n      monitor); increases aerobic fitness (measured by a treadmill test); improves body\n      composition (measured by waist size); and reduces hormone levels in the blood."

Follow-up measures will be taken at the end of intervention (12\n      weeks) and after a 14-week no-intervention observation period (26 weeks).  After initial\n      randomization to treatment group, participants will be stratified by treatment group and\n      randomly assigned to one of three follow-up measurement conditions at 12 weeks:\n      echocardiograph and cardiopulmonary test (N=80); cardiopulmonary test only (N=60); or no\n      follow-up echocardiograph or cardiopulmonary test (N=76).  The primary outcomes will be: a)\n      changes in exercise capacity measured by 6MWT; and b) changes in disease-specific HRQL\n      measured by the MLHFQ.  Additional measures will examine the effects of the exercise\n      interventions on: cardiac performance; leisure time activity; cardio-respiratory fitness;\n      body composition; neurohormonal activation; and generic HRQL"
