The population\n      evaluated in this study was selected at the Graduate Clinic in Dental Implantology -\n      UNIP-SP.\n\n      The selected patients were randomly allocated (by a computer generated list) into:\n\n      Group IM - (n = 20) - patients who received placement of implants and prosthesis within a\n      period of 3 days, characterizing immediate loading implants protocol; Group NL - (n = 20) -\n      patients who received single-stage dental implants with no placement of dental prostheses\n      within a period of 4 months, characterizing non-loading implants;\n\n      The surgeries, as well as all postoperative follow-up, were performed at the dental clinic\n      of UNIP-SP. Surgical areas were anesthetized (2% mepivacaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine) and\n      mucoperiosteal incisions in the alveolar ridge mucosa were made. The surgical sequence\n      follow the protocol described by the implant company supplier of implants (SIN - S\u00e3o Paulo,\n      SP, BR). In all cases, for maxilla rehabilitation, 6 implants were installed, while, for\n      mandible, 5 were used. Soft-tissue was sutured with simple interrupted sutures using\n      absorbable polygalactin 910 suture. Postoperative care were: amoxicillin 500 mg (8-8 hours/7\n      days); sodic dipyrone 500mg (6-6 hours/3 days); 0.12% Chlorhexidine mouthwash (12-12\n      hours/10 days).\n\n      The patients in the IM Group received Br\u00e5nemark full arch prosthesis within 3 days after the\n      implant. All prosthesis used straight mini-abutments (SIN, S\u00e3o Paulo, SP) and received\n      occlusal adjustment and a monthly clinical monitoring (including modified bleeding on\n      probing and peri-implant probing depth).\n\n      Evaluation of osteogenic markers The collection of peri-implant crevicular fluid (PICF) was\n      performed immediately after implant insertion (Baseline) and after 7, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120\n      days. The site to be collected was dried and isolated with sterile gauze. PICF was collected\n      at four sites per implant using absorbent paper strips (Periopaper, Oralflow, Smithtown, New\n      York). The volume of fluid was measured immediately with the aid of Periotron (Oraflow,\n      Smithtown, New York) and conditioned at 400uL of PBS buffer + 0.05% Tween and then frozen at\n      -80\u00b0C.\n\n      The levels of the peri-implant osteogenic markers (OPG, OCN, OPN, TGF-\u03b1, and PTH) were\n      determined using the LUMINEX/Magpix system (HBN1A-51K and HCCBP1MAG-58K, Millipore\n      Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA). The samples were analyzed individually and the levels were\n      estimated using a 5-parameter polynomial curve in the Xponent\u00ae software (Millipore\n      Corporation, Billerica, MA). The concentration values were expressed in pg/ml.\n\n      Statistical Analysis The null hypothesis considered in the study was the absence of\n      difference in the peri-implant osteogenic markers concentration between the different\n      loading protocols. For data analysis, the statistical program was used (SAS release 9.1,\n      2003, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA). The demographic and clinical data were compared\n      between the groups using Student's t-test (age), and Fisher's Exact test (gender and site of\n      implants). The data on the levels of osteogenic markers were first analyzed for homogeneity\n      using the Shapiro-Wilk test, which indicated non-normal distribution. Thus, the\n      nonparametric tests - Friedman for intragroup and Mann-Whitney for intergroup analysis, were\n      performed. All the analysis considered \u03b1=5%."
