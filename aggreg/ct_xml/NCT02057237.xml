      1. The primary objective of this study is to assess the feasibility of treating patients
           with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer with mitotane. Secondary
           objectives are to assess safety and tolerability as well as response rate of therapy

        2. To assess the toxicity of Mitotane in men with HRPC

        3. To assess the relationship between baseline serum adrenal androgens and their response
           to Mitotane

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will undergo pre-study assessment for symptoms, performance status, ECG, CT
      abdomen/pelvis, Bone scan, Complete blood count tests(hematology) , Biochemistry tests like
      serum electrolytes, liver function tests, coagulation profile,  testosterone and PSA tests.

      Mitotane will be administered 1.5g daily escalation to maximum of 5 g daily then adjusted
      according to serum levels and tolerability

      Physical examinations, hematology, biochemistry tests, and toxicity evaluations will be
      measured throughout patients on protocol treatment

      Mitotane serum level will be analyzed every second cycle

      Research bloods include; ACTH, cortisol, deoxycorticosterone, aldosterone, corticosterone,
      and testosterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrostenedione (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S)
      and estradiol will be collected only in cycle 1,3 and 5

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The primary endpoint is the proportion of patients maintained on Mitotane after 12 consecutive weeks of therapy. A positive outcome would be seeing 50% or more patients maintained on therapy. Secondary endpoint include proportion of adverse events</measure>
    <time_frame>maintain 50% of the patients on Mitotane at the 12 week mark</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Prostate Specific Antigen (PSA) Response Rate</measure>
    <time_frame>PSA progression free survival and excessive toxicity. Plan to keep the patients on Mitotane for atleast 8 weeks, despite increasing level of PSA as other trials shown early increase in PSA followed by a subsequent decline.</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Continue increase of serum PSA beyond 8 weeks indicate PSA progression. Response and progression will be primarily evaluated in this study using PSA response criteria from the Prostate Cancer Working Group 2. Criteria used to define response include: at least a 50% decline in PSA, confirmed by a second measurement ≥4 weeks later. PSA progression is defined by a &gt;25% increase from baseline in patients whose PSA did not decrease, and of 50% from the nadir value in patients whose PSA decreased. This increase in PSA must be &gt;5 ng/ml, and confirmed by a second measurement, at least 1 week later; PSA nadir is defined as the minimum PSA value that was confirmed by a second measurement.
PSA progression free survival is defined as the time between the randomization date and the date of PSA progression or the date of death due to prostate cancer, whichever occurs first.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Biopsy-proven prostate cancer OR a clinical picture consistent with metastatic
             prostate cancer with high levels of serum PSA (&gt;20ng/ml)

          -  Progressed on docetaxel chemotherapy after a minimum of 3 cycles and/or stopped
             treatment because of toxicity.  Patients may have had previous mitoxantrone, either
             before or after docetaxel treatment

          -  Response to a minimum of a 50% fall in PSA maintained for 4 weeks and then progressed
             through abiraterone treatment

          -  At least 2 consecutive rising PSAs measured at least 1 week apart . Patients must
             have ceased abiraterone at least 1 week prior.
