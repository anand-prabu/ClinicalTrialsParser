Standard anti-emetics will be used as follows:\n5HT3 (5-Hydroxytryptamine 3) antagonists (ondansetron, granisetron or tropisetron) used as the local institutional standard of care will be permitted, although the preferential use of ondansetron or granisetron will be encouraged.\nDexamethasone will not to be used as patients receive hydrocortisone and oral prednisolone in R-CHOP. In this study, the use of oral prednisolone on day 1 will be regarded as equivalent to dexamethasone. Prednisolone will be given PRIOR to the chemotherapy with the 5HT3 antagonist.\nAnti-emetics (metoclopramide, prochlorperazine and lorazepam) may be prescribed to be used 'as needed' for breakthrough emesis.\nPatients 'failing' the standard Chemotherapy Induced Nausea and Vomiting prophylactic regimen will be eligible to receive aprepitant (Days 1 to 3) for subsequent cycles."

Analysis will\n      also determine if the control and incidence of CINV is a significant problem in defined\n      subgroups of patients receiving R-CHOP and could inform the design of future research (or an\n      extension of the current protocol) in this area. Sub groups for investigation will include\n      patients with advanced disease, those with abdominal involvement, those receiving R-CHOP\n      every 14 days versus every 21 days (R-CHOP14 versus R-CHOP21), those receiving 6 or 8\n      treatment cycles of R-CHOP, older patients, younger females etc. A potential randomised\n      study evaluating the role of aprepitant could be contemplated in high risk groups."
