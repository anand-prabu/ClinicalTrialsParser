Especially for high risk group of\n      patients for PONV, the ideal regimen for sufficient analgesia with minimal adverse effect\n      needs to be sought. Propacetamol is known for its effective, rapid analgesia, opioid-sparing\n      effect, and is used widely for post operative pain management. This study aims to see the\n      opioid-sparing effect and the degree of PONV when propacetamol is added to PCA for high risk\n      PONV patients."
