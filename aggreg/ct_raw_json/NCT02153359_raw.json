They will receive\n      either true air cleaners or sham cleaners in a blinded, randomized manner for one month, and\n      then, after a washout period, they will cross over and receive the other intervention (sham\n      or true cleaner). All participants will have environmental monitoring (personal and in-home)\n      to determine their particulate matter exposure, and be followed repeatedly during the 3\n      month study period for markers of asthma disease, including respiratory symptoms, medication\n      and health care utilization, pulmonary function, airway hyperresponsiveness, systemic\n      markers of inflammation, and bronchoscopic evidence of airway inflammation or epithelial\n      cell dysfunction. Modifying factors or factors influencing susceptibility, such as diet and\n      nutritional status, will also be explored."
