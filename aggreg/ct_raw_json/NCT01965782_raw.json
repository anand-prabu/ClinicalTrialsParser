[14C] is a naturally\n      occurring radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help understand how the\n      drug appears in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered to healthy men.\n      Information about any side effects that may occur will also be collected.  This study will\n      last up to 15 days for each participant, not including screening.  Screening is required\n      within 28 days prior to the start of the study."
