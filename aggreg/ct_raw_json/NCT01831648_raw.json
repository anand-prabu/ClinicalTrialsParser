As IGF-I also varies with age, it\n      is necessary to establish a broad population reference values of IGF1 concentration for each\n      of the IGF1 assays used in clinical practice, taking into account individual variation\n      factors such as age, nutritional status and possible treatments.\n\n      The objective of this study is to establish normative data based on a large random selection\n      from the general population, including representation from all age groups (around 100\n      subjects for each decade age range). This will be performed for all the available assay\n      kits. Subjects with medical conditions and medications that may affect the outcome will be\n      excluded. Normative data will include the range (2.5 to 97.5 percentiles) in mass units and\n      results will be reported as mass units but also as SD scores in order to be able, in a given\n      patient, to compare its IGF-I concentration along time, even if using different assays."

IGF-I level will be measured with all the\n      assay methods available (sera kept in bank will be used in the future when new methods will\n      be available) For each assay method and each age group (Four 3-years groups between 18 and\n      30 years and six decade age groups between 30 and 89 years) IGF-I will be measured.\n\n      Results will be expressed as mean, median, standard deviation, 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles,\n      in mass units.
