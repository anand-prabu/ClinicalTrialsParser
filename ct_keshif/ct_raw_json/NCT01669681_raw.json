            "textblock": "The severe asthma is a major source of expenses in term of public health, while it concerns\n      no more than 5 % of the asthmatics. The expenses is direct (medicines, hospitalizations,\n      care) but especially indirect (absenteeisms, etc.). The forward-looking follow-up of cohort\n      of more than 500 severe asthmatic patients multicentrique in an already widely established\n      cohort (COBRA, at present in Visit 9 (one every 6 months) is an once-in-a-lifetime\n      opportunity, coupled with the data of the CPAM, to identify well the evolution in time of a\n      real medical economic variable. The possibility of dynamic follow-up of the expenses\n      compared to the medical data offers perspectives of evaluation cost-efficiency of the\n      informed therapeutic procedures. It is possible to couple in a forward-looking and dynamic\n      way the data of health stemming from a cohort with the economic data stemming from the CPAM.\n      This variable included in a Cluster's algorithm has to allow to identify the interventions\n      the more and the less cost effective. The main objective of this study is to realize a cost\n      estimate of care of the severe asthma. The variation of the costs will be also studied. The\n      recruited patients are patients already included in the cohort COBRA in the centers of\n      Marseille, Montpelier or Nice, classified GINA 4 and agreeing to participate."
