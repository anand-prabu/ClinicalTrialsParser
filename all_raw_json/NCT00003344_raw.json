Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of radiation therapy plus irinotecan in\n      treating patients with colon cancer that is recurrent or that cannot be removed surgically."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of weekly irinotecan that will\n      result in an acceptable level of toxicity when given in combination with concurrent external\n      beam radiation therapy. II. Determine the objective response rate of these patients at the\n      dose level below the MTD.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes beginning within 24 hours of\n      radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. External beam radiotherapy is administered 5 days per\n      week for 5.5-6 weeks starting on day 1 concurrent with chemotherapy. Cohorts of 3-6 patients\n      are treated until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) has been determined. The MTD is defined\n      as the dose level at which the incidence of dose limiting toxicity is no greater than\n      one-third of the patients treated at that dose level. Once the MTD has been determined,\n      additional patients receive irinotecan at the dose level below the MTD with external beam\n      radiation therapy on the same treatment schedule as above. Patients are followed at 4 weeks\n      after treatment, then every 3 months for 2 years, and then every 6 months for 3 additional\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-24 patients will be accrued into the Phase I portion of\n      this study. Approximately 15-25 patients will be accrued into the Phase II portion of this\n      study."
