The starting dose level of PLX3397 will be 800 mg/day, using a twice daily (BID) dosing regimen. If that dose level is tolerated, the next dose level to be tested will be 1000 mg/day, which is the RP2D for single agent PLX3397 in solid tumors. Lower doses may be explored, if required. These lower doses are planned to be 600 mg/day (if PLX3397 is not tolerated at 800 mg/day) and 400 mg/day (if PLX3397 is not tolerated at 600 mg/day). Conversely, if the dose level of 1000 mg/day is tolerated, higher dose levels of PLX3397 may be investigated, at up to 50% increments, depending on the observed pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicities.",
