      This is a study to evaluate how the body handles and metabolizes (PK) the various doses of
      the drug Tolvaptan, and what the effect (PD) of the various doses of Tolvaptan are on the
      content of &quot;salt&quot; in blood and urine

             period, a second at check-in on Day -1, a third on Day 0 (12-24 hours prior to
             dosing), which will serve as the baseline value for efficacy endpoints

          -  Subjects with relatively intact renal function, ie, estimated glomerular filtration
             rate using the CKD-EPI formula of greater than or equal to 60 mL/min/1.73m2.

          -  Sexually active males who are practicing a highly effective method of birth control
             during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of trial medication or who will
             remain abstinent during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose, or sexually
             active females of childbearing potential who are practicing a highly effective method
             of birth control during the trial and for 30 days after the last dose of trial
             medication or who will remain abstinent during the trial and for 30 days after the
             last dose, or female subjects of nonchildbearing potential (surgically sterile or
             postmenopausal [1 year post menses]). If employing birth control, 1 of the following
             highly effective methods (failure rate &lt;1%) must be used: vasectomy, tubal ligation,

             minutes, outside the range of 40 to 90 bpm. The sponsor may allow exceptions
