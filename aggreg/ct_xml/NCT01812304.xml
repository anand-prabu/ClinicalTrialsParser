  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial aims to assess the hypothesis that hands-on training of vaginal breech delivery
      on a pelvic model is significantly better in terms of a technical skills scoring system
      compared to frontal teaching.

      Primary endpoint is a score describing technical proficiency, ie the OSATS score, consisting
      of 25 items. Each item, if done correctly, is awarded one point. The maximum OSATS score is
      25.

      Secondary endpoints are performance time in seconds, cinfidence using a scale from 1-5 with
      one being very confident and 5 having no confidence when performing the procedures, and
      self-assessment using a scale of 1-5 with 1 being the optimal grade.

      This is a two-arm study. The experimental arm uses a hands-on training and the control arm a
      frontal teaching approach. The allocation is randomized and single-blinded.
