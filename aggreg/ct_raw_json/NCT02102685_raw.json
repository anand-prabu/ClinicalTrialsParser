In this study investigators\n      propose the use of vacuum Assisted Closure (VAC) that has been used satisfactorily to reduce\n      edema, promote granulation, and ameliorate the tissue to afterwards reconstruct the defect,\n      increase vascularity and diminish the bacterial load."

Wound cleaning will performed with irrigating solution and\n      replacement of the sponges every 72 hours according to evolution, photographs will be taken\n      to assess the percentage of viable tissue and granulation. A Sample to culture will be taken\n      prior to placement of VAC therapy , during the use of it and at the time of removal of the\n      system. When the wound presents clinical signs of improvement (elimination of purulent\n      discharge and granulation tissue ) VAC therapy will be withdrawn , and follow by delayed\n      primary closure.\n\n      Patients will be assign to group B: 14 patients on admission, after surgical drainage, a\n      culture will be taken, photographs every three days (during hospital stay ) and secretion\n      culture; daily cleaning stipulated by the service will be perform. The control of the\n      patients will be made until wound closure (presence of epithelialization tissue) .\n\n      Statistical Analysis Nominal variables will be analyzed using percentage frequencies, X2\n      test or Fisher exact test. Numeric variables using Student's t test for independent samples\n      and ANOVA with post hoc Scheffe test. U Mann Whitney and Kruskal Wallis tests will be used\n      as long as data do not conform to normal distribution. All values of p <0.05 will be\n      considered statistically significant. The analysis will be perform with  statistical program\n      SPSS v. 18 for Windows program."
