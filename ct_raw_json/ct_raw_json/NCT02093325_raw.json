A\n      difference of 40% in clinical response is considered of clinically meaningful difference\n      between the two treatment arms (75% for eltombopag vs. 35% for placebo). It requires a total\n      sample of 83 subjects (55 for eltombopag and 28 for placebo). According to the 10% loss of\n      screening failure, 90-100 subjects (60-67 for eltombopag and 30-33 for placebo) will be\n      recruited."
