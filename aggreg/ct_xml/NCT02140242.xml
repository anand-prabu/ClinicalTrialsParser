  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed trial will address two clinically important questions for younger patients with
      newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia (AML): the optimal dose of daunorubicin in induction
      therapy and the necessity of a second induction cycle in patients with a good response after
      the first induction. In the first part of the trial, patients will be randomly assigned to
      receive either 90 mg/m2 or 60 mg/m2 daunorubicin in the first induction cycle in addition to
      standard dosed cytarabine. The primary endpoint is the rate of good responders. Assuming a
      superiority of 90 mg/m2, 436 patients will be recruited. In the second part of the trial,
      good responders will be randomized to receive either a second or no further induction cycle.
      Assuming a non-inferiority of the single induction regarding the rate of complete
      remissions, a number of 360 patients will be included in the second part. Secondary outcomes
      will be relapse-free survival, overall survival and minimal residual disease kinetics.
      Patients will be recruited in about 40 treatment centers of the Study Alliance Leukemia
      study group over a period of 40 months. The results will be of great clinical relevance:
      First, the study could facilitate the establishment or confirmation of the optimal
      daunorubicin dose. Furthermore, in case of a non-inferiority of single versus double
      induction in good responders, about half of all younger AML patients could be spared a
      second induction cycle, leading to a reduction in treatment-related mortality, fewer days
      spent in hospital and improved quality of life.
