Musculoskeletal causes are common, but frequently overlooked. No studies\n      about treatment of chest pain from the intercostal muscles were found by search in medical\n      literature databases. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of two different\n      physical therapy interventions on intercostal pain in patients with stable heart disease.\n\n      The hypothesis was that deep friction massage combined with heat-pack is more effective than\n      heat-pack only."
