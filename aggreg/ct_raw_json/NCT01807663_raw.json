            "textblock": "Context:\n\n      Mechanical ventilation transformed the prognosis of neuromuscular diseases whether for acute\n      or chronic diseases. The available tools to estimate the severity of respiratory\n      insufficiency and indicate or follow the efficiency of mechanical ventilation are based on\n      blood gazes explorations, tests respiratory function and sleep evaluation.\n\n      These tools give either limited information, or are with difficulty applicable to patients\n      heavily handicapped except during hospitalization.\n\n      In patients under mechanical ventilation, it is sometimes difficult to know the daily\n      optimal time of ventilation. The respiratory events are not generally recognized and are\n      unspecific (headaches, drowsiness, dyspnoea, etc.) or are identified by blood gazes\n      abnormalities (hypercapnia. In acute setting, treble is going to raise the problem of the\n      weaning of the mechanical ventilation and the optimal moment of the extubation without\n      risking a reintubation.\n\n      These problems are identical and concern the evaluation of the degree of ventilatory\n      autonomy for home care. The development of methods estimating this autonomy is thus\n      fundamental.\n\n      Objectives: the objective of this project is to validate a non-invasive system for measure\n      and acquisition of respiratory parameters, incorporating a transmission system working by a\n      \"wireless\" technology allowing the remote monitoring of these patients.\n\n      The secondary objectives are to determine the parameters of success of weaning by using the\n      device in neuromuscular patients intubated for respiratory failure in acute setting and to\n      determine the optimal time of free breathing possibilities in patients ventilated in a\n      chronic way at home.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      After validation of the device on 10 healthy subjects, continuous acquisition of the\n      ventilatory data by means of the Teleresp system compared with measure of the transcutaneous\n      PCO2, of SaO2 and arterial gazometry at the end of free breath trial in 40 acute and chronic\n      neuromuscular patients.\n\n      Selection criteria:\n\n      Healthy volunteers Patients affected by acute neuromuscular pathology and starting weaning\n      from invasive ventilation (Guillain Barr\u00e9 and myasthenia).\n\n      Patients affected by neuromuscular pathology and home ventilated in a diurnal and night-way\n      by invasive interface or not (respiratory autonomy of at least 1:00 am).\n\n      Number of patients, center:\n\n      10 healthy volunteers and 40 patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit or in the home\n      of ventilation unit of the Raymond Poincar\u00e9 hospital.\n\n      Total duration of the study: 19 months"
