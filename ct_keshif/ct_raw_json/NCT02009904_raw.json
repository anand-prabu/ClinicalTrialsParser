            "textblock": "Phenylketonuria(PKU)is a rare condition caused by the body's inability to properly breakdown\n      an amino acid called phenylalanine(PHE), due to a missing enzyme, phenylalanine\n      hydroxylase(PAH). When the enzyme is missing  and/or not functioning properly, it increases\n      the level of PHE in the body. High levels of PHE can cause severe brain damage or nerve\n      damage unless the children are on a strict low PHE diet. A low PHE diet restricts the intake\n      of protein rich foods and can pose a significant burden to both the patient and the family.\n\n      Investigators at the University of British Columbia and British Columbia Children's Hospital\n       will examine the phenylalanine metabolism in children with PKU using a simple breath test.\n\n      Patients (5-18y) receiving standard clinical care at the BC Children's Hospital's\n      Biochemical Diseases Clinic will be enrolled.The study will be conducted twice on each\n      patient. Baseline measurements will be performed at the beginning of each study for each\n      patient.The Physician in charge will then prescribe the standard dose of sapropterin\n      dihydrochloride (Kuvan\u00ae) (20mg/kg/d) or otherwise as deemed appropriate by the\n      physician-in-charge.  The test will be repeated a week (minimum) after the beginning of\n      treatment with the prescribed dose.\n\n      The investigators propose that children who are responsive to sapropterin dihydrochloride\n      (Kuvan\u00ae) will have increased 13CO2 in breath after treatment, and those who do not respond\n      will have no change in the 13CO2 in the breath before and after treatment.\n\n      As a comparison to the experimental group, age and gender matched healthy controls will also\n      be studied. The test in healthy controls will be performed once without any intervention,\n      and is only used as a comparative value."
