  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different techniques of placing dental implants:
      1) removing the tooth and placing the implant immediately and 2) removing the tooth and
      placing both the implant and a temporary crown immediately.  Both procedures currently are
      accepted methods for replacing missing teeth but direct comparisons of the two procedures
      are lacking. The results of this study should aid clinicians in selecting the best implant
      placement technique for their patients.

      To qualify, patients must be between 18 to 79 years old, in good health, have a tooth in the
      upper jaw (except molars) that needs to be extracted, and able and willing to return to the
      University of Michigan Dental School for all follow-up appointments (8 follow-up visits over
      a period of 12 months).  Sufficient number of natural teeth and/or replacements to provide a
      stable occlusion as determined by the investigator

      Patients will be excluded for any of the following conditions: Women who are pregnant or
      plan to become pregnant, an existing implant adjacent to the area of study, current smoker
      or quit smoking less than one year ago, antibiotic therapy for more than two weeks within 3
      months of baseline, need for antibiotics prior to dental treatment (due to prosthetic joint
      replacement or other medical condition), chronic use of medications known to affect the gum
      tissues (calcium channel blocker (less than 6 months, or over 6 months and have experienced
      overgrowth of your gums), anticonvulsants, immunosuppressive drugs, nonsteroidal
      anti-inflammatory medications...), current orthodontic treatment, or active periodontal
      treatment. Participants must inform the investigators if they are enrolled in any other
      studies because it may becloud them from participation in this study.
