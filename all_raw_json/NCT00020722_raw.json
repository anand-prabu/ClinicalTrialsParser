Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation plus biological therapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of\n      chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well chemotherapy followed by peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation plus biological therapy works in treating women with stage IV breast\n      cancer."

The PBMC are treated ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form ATC. The ATC\n      are expanded for 12-14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\n      Patients then receive high-dose chemotherapy. Patients with chemosensitive disease receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour, thiotepa IV over 1 hour, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on\n      days -4, -3, and -2. Patients with chemoresistant disease receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour,\n      etoposide IV twice daily, and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days -8 to -3. Patients undergo\n      autologous PBSC transplantation on day 0 or on both day 0 and day 1.\n\n      Patients then receive ATC IV over 15-20 minutes three times per week starting approximately\n      on day +1 for three weeks and then once weekly for at least 6 doses.\n\n      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically for up to 2 years\n      after PBSC."
