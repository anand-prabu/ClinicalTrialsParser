  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to see if there is a change in tear osmolarity over time when
      moderate to severe dry eye subjects are treated with TheraTears® lubricating drops.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the measured tear osmolarity from study participants decrease with
      sustained use of a over-the-counter artificial tears, TheraTears® lubricating drops, over an
      eight week period. Participant's dry eye symptoms would also improve with sustained use of
      TheraTears® lubricating drops.

          3. Is willing and able to follow instructions and maintain the appointment schedule;

          4. Is diagnosed with dry eye syndrome (in at least one eye), indicated by current ocular
             examination, prior history (self-reported history of dry eye is acceptable) and
             current use of treatments for dry eye;

          5. Has a minimum osmolarity reading of 316 mosm/kg at the baseline visit in at least one
             eye.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Has taken part in another research study within the last 30 days;

          2. Planned contact lens wear during the course of the study;

          3. Staff at the investigational site or family member of site staff or family member of
             currently enrolled participant;

          4. Any subject that violates the washout period by using eye drops during the 72hrs
             washout period;

          5. Has any known ocular disease including active ocular infection, inflammation or
             allergy, especially Salzmann's nodular degeneration, symptomatic conjunctivochalasis,
             and fixation disparity syndrome;

          6. Used Restasis (or similar topical medication) within the last 6 months;

          7. Has a systemic condition that in the opinion of the investigator may affect the dry
             eye status of the subject, especially those newly diagnosed, newly prescribed and/or
             unstable;

          8. Is pregnant, lactating or planning a pregnancy at the time of enrolment (verbal
             confirmation necessary);

             Claritin®, Dimetapp®, Unisom®, Zyrtec®, etc.),  Isotretinoin (e.g., Accutane®,
             Roaccutane®, Amnesteem®, Claravis®, Isotroin®, Sotret®) or similar medications;

         10. Has known sensitivity to the diagnostic pharmaceuticals to be used in the study;

         11. Has undergone ocular surgery(LASIK, Cataract, etc)within the last year.
