  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate the effects of a school breakfast
      policy initiative (SBPI) on the incidence of overweight and obesity as well as breakfast
      patterns (both inside and outside of school) among 4th-6th grade children. The study
      integrates research, education and extension to promote healthy breakfast consumption among
      low-income children in urban schools and will leverage ongoing SNAP-Ed and the School
      Breakfast Program efforts.
