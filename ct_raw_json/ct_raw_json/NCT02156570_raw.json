In particular,\n      this study will investigate whether treatment of acute or early chronic HCV can be\n      shortened.  The study will assess efficacy by looking at the proportion of people who clear\n      the virus (have no virus detectable in their blood) at the end of treatment, and 1, 3 and 6\n      months after treatment.\n\n      The hypothesis is that short course (6 weeks) dual therapy using sofosbuvir and RBV will\n      result in successful virological eradication in the majority (\u226580%) of subjects treated for\n      recently acquired HCV."
