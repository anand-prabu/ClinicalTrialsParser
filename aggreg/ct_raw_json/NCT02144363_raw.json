Limiting prolonged invasive\n      ventilation remains an important strategy to decrease lung injury and prevent chronic lung\n      disease. Currently, there is no objective measure available to predict readiness for removal\n      of the endotracheal tube (\"extubation\") and discontinuing mechanical ventilation in this\n      fragile population.\n\n      The investigators propose to predict extubation success by evaluating the electrical\n      activity of the diaphragm (Edi), which provides important information about the \"drive\" to\n      breathing coming from the brain and the function of the diaphragm, two essential factors\n      determining extubation readiness and success."

A size appropriate\n      nasogastric tube with multiple array of electrodes (Edi catheter) will be inserted in each\n      eligible infant.  The average EdI (Edi_avg) and maximum Edi with breath occlusion (Edi_max)\n      will be measured during mechanical ventilation just before extubation and then up to 3 days\n      after extubation. All infants will be extubated to non-invasive positive pressure\n      ventilation (NIPPV or CPAP) delivered through nasal cannula\n\n      The specific aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between measures of Edi\n      (Edi_avg and Edi_max with breath occlusion) taken just before extubation and the extubation\n      success in a sample of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We\n      hypothesize that  Edi-avg and Edi-max of infants with successful extubation will be\n      significantly different from the infants who fail extubation"
