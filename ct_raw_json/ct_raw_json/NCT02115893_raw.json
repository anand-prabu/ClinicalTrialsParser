However, there has been no consensus on the optimal supplementation protocols, in\n      terms of duration of supplementation to see these metabolic effects. Furthermore, a positive\n      exercise performance effect of nitrate ingestion has primarily been observed in recreational\n      athletes. The potentially ergogenic effects of nitrate in well-trained or elite athletes\n      therefore remain to be fully established. Based on the gaps in current literature, our main\n      goal will be to gain further insight into different aspects of nitrate supplementation to\n      enhance (elite) sports performance. This will be investigated in this study by assessing the\n      effect of an acute vs. chronic supplementation period of sodium nitrate (NaNO3-) on exercise\n      performance."
