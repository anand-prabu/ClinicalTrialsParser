  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tertiary Health Research Intervention Via Email (THRIVE; Kypri et al., 2009), originally
      utilized with Australian students, is unique in that it contains efficacious components
      derived from motivational interviewing (e.g., personalized feedback) and cognitive
      behavioral therapy (protective behavioral strategies), yet is very brief and has established
      efficacy. This study aims to test versions of THRIVE tailored to American college students.
      In addition to replicating original results with THRIVE, we will also test versions
      containing unique subsets of protective behavioral strategies to reduce alcohol consumption.
      The primary hypothesis is that versions of THRIVE will be associated with lower overall
      alcohol consumption than an assessment and brief brochure control condition.
