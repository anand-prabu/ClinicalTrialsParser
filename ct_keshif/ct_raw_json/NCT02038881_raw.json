All\n      participants in this trial will be randomly and evenly assigned to one of three groups to\n      receive two, three or four injections. Group 1 will receive the standard regime consisting\n      of one dose at each vaccination time point, Group 2 will receive two doses at each\n      vaccination time point and Group 3 will receive a booster vaccination 12 weeks after the\n      first dose of the standard vaccination schedule with MVA-BN\u00ae smallpox vaccine.
