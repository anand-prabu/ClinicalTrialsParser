            "textblock": "In light of declining autopsy rates around the world, post-mortem MR imaging is a promising\n      alternative to conventional autopsy in the investigation of infant death. A major drawback\n      of this non-invasive autopsy approach is the fact that histopathological and microbiological\n      examination of the tissue is not possible. The objective of this prospective study is to\n      compare the performance of minimally invasive, virtual autopsy, including CT-guided biopsy,\n      with conventional autopsy procedures in a paediatric population.\n\n      Foetuses, newborns, infants and children that are referred for autopsy at three different\n      institutions associated with the University of Zurich will be eligible for recruitment. All\n      bodies will be examined with a commercial CT and a 3 Tesla MRI scanner, and investigators\n      will be blinded to the results of conventional autopsy. After cross-sectional imaging,\n      CT-guided tissue sampling will be performed by a multifunctional robotic system (Virtobot)\n      allowing for automated post-mortem biopsies. Virtual autopsy results will be classified with\n      regards to the likely final diagnosis and major pathological findings and compared to the\n      results of conventional autopsy, which remains the diagnostic gold standard. This\n      interdisciplinary study will determine whether virtual autopsy will narrow the gap in\n      information between non-invasive and traditional autopsy procedures."
