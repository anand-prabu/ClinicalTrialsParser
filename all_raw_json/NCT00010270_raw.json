Patients with stable or\n      responding disease after completion of the first course receive additional courses every 4-5\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of LMB-9 immunotoxin until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which\n      at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks and then every 2 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-50 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
