The\n      development of new instruments for the non-invasive measurement of oxygen tension in retinal\n      vessels now allows for the more precise investigation of these physiological processes. The\n      current study seeks to evaluate the retinal oxygen saturation in healthy subjects while\n      breathing different oxygen mixtures to achieve a hypoxic and a hyperoxic state."
