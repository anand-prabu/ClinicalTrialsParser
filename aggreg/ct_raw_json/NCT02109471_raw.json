These scans will be used to assess opacity depth and\n      measure corneal thickness (pachymetry), corneal topography (anterior and posterior), and\n      epithelial thickness maps. The ultrahigh-speed MIT OCT prototypes will also be used when\n      they become available. A comprehensive eye examination, Placido-ring corneal topography,\n      ultrasound pachymetry, and Scheimpflug camera imaging, will be performed for comparison"
