Dose escalation is\n      continued until toxic effects or disease progression is observed in these patients.\n      Carmustine is administered over 1 hour every 6 weeks, on the same day as the first topotecan\n      dose for that week.\n\n      Three patients will be treated at an initial dose level of topotecan, and if one of these\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity (DLT), an additional\n\n      3 patients must be treated at this dose level without further DLT in order for dose\n      escalation to proceed. The MTD is the highest dose at which DLT occurs in no more than 1 of\n      6 patients.\n\n      Patients are evaluated after every 6 week cycle.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: An estimated 18-36 patients will be entered."
