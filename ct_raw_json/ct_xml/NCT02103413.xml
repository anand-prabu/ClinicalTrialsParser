  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although ERCP is almost always successful in patients with malignant biliary obstruction,
      selective biliary cannulation fails in some cases and conventional ERCP may not be possible
      in patients with tumor invasion of the duodenum or major papilla, surgically altered anatomy
      (e.g., Roux-en-Y anastomosis), or complex hilar biliary strictures. In such cases,
      percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) is an useful alternative. However, PTBD
      had various complications and the presence of an external drainage catheter would also have
      a cosmetic problem related to the external drainage and an adverse impact on quality of life
      (QOL) of terminally ill patients.

      Since endoscopic ultrasound-guided bile duct puncture was described in 1996, sporadic case
      reports of EUS-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) suggested that it was a feasible and
      effective alternative in patients with failed conventional ERCP stenting. The potential
      benefits of EUS-BD include one-stage procedure in ERCP unit, and internal drainage for
      avoiding long-term external drainage in cases where external PTBD drainage catheters cannot
      be internalized, thus significantly improving the QOL of terminally ill patients, and
      possibly lower morbidity than PTBD or surgery.

      Up to date, only a few case series of EUS-BD with small numbers of patients have been
      published, and known the feasibility and safety in terms of the incidence of
      procedure-related clinical outcomes.10-21 There has been no comparative study between the
      outcomes of PTBD and EUS-BD focusing on the QOL, cost-effectiveness, and complications.

      The researchers investigated the technical success of EUS-BD and PTBD in patients with
      malignant biliary obstruction after failed conventional ERCP as a prospective randomized
      comparative study in multicenters. Secondary endpoints were the cost-effectiveness and
      complications rates between EUS-BD and PTBD.

Because EUS-guided rendezvous technique can be attempted only in patients in whom the papilla is endoscopically accessible. Following bile duct puncture using a 19-gauge fine needle, one-step or graded tract dilatation will be performed. Then, finally we insert a partially or fully covered metallic stent.</description>
