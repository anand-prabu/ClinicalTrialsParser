Doctors and researchers have tests which determine the level of\n      function and sensation, this test was developed by the American Spinal Cord Injury\n      Association (ASIA) and has been modified over the years to improve use and sensitivity.\n      Most recently, the ASIA Injury classification Scale (AIS) was modified in 2011, but this\n      test does not include the evaluation of autonomic nervous system (ANS) impairment.  However,\n      people with SCI do have impairment of the ANS and this may adversely affect how organ\n      systems in the body function.  Specifically, ANS impairment tends to result in changes in\n      heart rate and blood pressure that may relate to the level of the SCI, but this is not fully\n      understood.  In this investigation we hope to develop simple tests which will allow doctors\n      and scientist the ability to measure the amount of ANS impairment to the cardiovascular\n      system, specifically the heart.  The first part of the study will be to determine the heart\n      rate response to several tests (administration of drugs and physical challenges) which will\n      change heart rate.  These tests will be given to people with and without SCI and the heart\n      rate response will be compared between people with and without SCI.  The bigger the\n      difference in the heart rate response to these test between people with and without SCI the\n      greater degree of ANS impairment in the people with SCI.  Once this heart rate difference is\n      determined, several simple tests (deep breathing, saliva test, Valsalva) will be performed\n      in people with and without SCI to again compare the heart rate response.  The second part of\n      this study will be to determine if the heart rate responses to the first set of tests\n      (administration of drugs and physical challenges) can predict the heart rate response to\n      these simple tests (deep breathing, saliva test, Valsalva).  The aim of this study is to\n      develop a simple battery of tests which can be easily used by doctors and scientists to\n      determine the degree of ANS impairment to the heart in persons with SCI."
