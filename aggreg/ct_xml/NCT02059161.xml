  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of MK-1293 to Lantus™ in
      participants with T1DM.  The primary hypothesis is that after 24 weeks, the mean change in
      hemoglobin A1c (A1C) from baseline is non-inferior in participants treated with MK-1293
      compared with participants treated with Lantus™.
