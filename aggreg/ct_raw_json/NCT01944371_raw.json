            "textblock": "Combination antiretroviral therapy for HIV-1 infection can suppress viremia to below the\n      detection limit in the vast majority of motivated individuals with access to these drugs.\n      However, HIV-1 persists in a small pool of latently infected resting memory CD4+ T cells\n      carrying integrated viral genomes.  Although other reservoirs for HIV-1 exist, the general\n      consensus among experts is that latent virus (HIV DNA in resting memory CD4+ T cells) is the\n      primary barrier to HIV-1 eradication. A widely discussed approach for eliminating this viral\n      reservoir requires reactivation of latent HIV-1.  Disulfiram, an FDA-approved drug used to\n      treat alcoholism was shown to activate HIV-1 gene expression in vitro, suggesting that\n      activation of latently infected cells in vivo may occur.  Our primary hypothesis is that the\n      addition of disulfiram to a stable effective antiretroviral drug regimen will result in a\n      dose dependent increase in HIV transcription in CD4+ T-cells in HIV-1 in patients on highly\n      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART)."
