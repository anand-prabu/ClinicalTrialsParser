Describe the\n      toxicities of this regimen in this patient population at each dose level studied. III.\n      Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of docetaxel. Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1\n      hour followed by oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 every 3 weeks. Treatment continues in\n      the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting\n      toxicities. Patients are followed for disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
