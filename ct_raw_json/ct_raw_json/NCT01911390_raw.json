Participants will follow this dietary intervention by\n      being provided a study snack, such as a banana nut muffin and strawberry-pineapple smoothie.\n       Participants will consume one snack on a daily basis for a total of four weeks (28 days).\n      The snack options were developed by a professional chef and research dietitian to fit a set\n      of requirements for calorie and macronutrient content based on USDA food guide\n      recommendations.  The placebo group will be provided the same snacks without the inclusion\n      of rice bran or bean powder.\n\n      Randomization of subjects to the dietary intervention groups will be done during the study\n      enrollment period.  Randomization will be based on sex of the subject to include equal\n      numbers of both genders across all 4 groups.\n\n      All participants will consume the allocated foods daily for a total of four weeks (28 days)\n      and will not be required to alter the rest of their diets in any other way.  They will also\n      complete a 3-day food and activity log each week, starting the week prior to the study\n      intervention (Week 0) and ending the week of their final visit (Week 4)."
