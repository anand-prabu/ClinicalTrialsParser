      One week dispensing, investigator-masked, randomized, contralateral study comparing the test
      lens against the control lens. Each subject will be randomized to wear the test lens in one
      eye and the control lens int the other eye.

                  schedule;

               4. Is correctable to a visual acuity of 20/30 or better (in each eye) with their
                  habitual correction and the assigned study lenses;

               5. Has astigmatism less than or equal to -1.00D;

               6. Is an adapted soft contact lens wearer;

               7. Demonstrates an acceptable fit with the study lenses;

               8. Has no active anterior segment disease or known ocular disease.

                  Exclusion Criteria:

        A person will be excluded from the study if he/she:

          3. Is using any systemic or topical medications that will affect ocular health;

          4. Has any ocular pathology or severe insufficiency of lacrimal secretion (moderate to
             severe dry eyes) that would affect the wearing of contact lenses;

          5. Has persistent, clinically significant corneal or conjunctival staining using sodium
             fluorescein dye;

          6. Has any clinically significant lid or conjunctival abnormalities, neovascularization,
