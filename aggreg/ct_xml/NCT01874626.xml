  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-dose,
      parallel-group study.  Approximately 300 subjects (150 per group) 16 years of age and older
      with a current (within 24 hours from Visit 1) Grade I or II ankle sprain, and who meet all
      eligibility criteria, will be randomized into the study and will receive either the active
      treatment (SST-0225 ibuprofen cream), or matching placebo.  Subjects will apply an amount
      equivalent to a 4 inch line of investigational product to the affected ankle approximately
      every 4-6 hours.  At Visit 1 two doses will be applied at the site.  All subsequent doses of
      the investigational product will be applied every 4 to 6 hours with a total of 4 doses in a
      24 hour period.  Duration of treatment with the investigational product is 7 days.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male and female subjects ≥16 years of age

          2. Grade I or II acute ankle sprain injury within 24 hours prior to first use of
             investigational product.

               1. Grade I: when the ligament is stretched but not torn and the anterior
                  talofibular ligament is usually involved. The anterior drawer test is negative

               2. Grade II: moderate sprain, which usually results in partial tears of the
                  ligaments, primarily the anterior talofibular and possibly the calcaneofibular
                  ligament. Ligamentous laxity may be present and there is moderate swelling

          3. At screening (Visit 1), subject reported pain intensity score upon movement of ≥ 5 on
             a 0-10 Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)

          4. Subject's Assessment of Normal Function/Activity (must be &gt; 2) at screening

          5. Able to comply with the visit schedule

          6. Able to apply the investigational product as directed

          7. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an approved method of birth
             control during study participation.  Subjects currently using any of the below
             mentioned contraception methods, must have used the method for a minimum of three
             months prior to study enrollment, and must be willing to continue its use (at the
             same dose) throughout the study.

               1. Effective methods of birth control: e.g. prescription oral, vaginal or
                  transdermal contraceptives; contraceptive implants or injections; intrauterine
                  device; diaphragm/cervical cap/condom with spermicide

               2. Other acceptable methods of birth control include: Postmenopausal or amenorrhea
                  for one year, Surgically sterile (hysterectomy, tubal ligation, or
                  oopherectomy), Premenarcheal

          8. Able to speak, read and comprehend English and record requested measurements as
             outlined in the protocol

          9. Subject must be able to read, understand, sign and date the informed consent document
             (and the subject assent form, if necessary) indicating that the subject (or a legally
             acceptable representative) has been informed of all pertinent aspects of the trial

             -

          3. Requirements for bed rest, hospitalization, or surgical intervention for the ankle
             injury

          4. Evidence of fractures or non-removable full cast of any type

          5. Presence of bilateral occurrence of ankle injury or ipsilateral ankle and/or knee
             injury

             disorders or hematologic disease; history of seizures; or known, significant,
