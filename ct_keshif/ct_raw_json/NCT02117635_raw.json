Eligible patients will have no useful function of the paretic arm a\n      minimum of 28 days after the ischaemic stroke (a modified NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) Motor Arm\n      Score of 2 or 3 for the affected arm)."

The trial will be overseen by an\n      independent DSMB. The DSMB will adjudicate whether a patient has satisfied the primary\n      response criterion and whether the ongoing safety profile justifies continuation or\n      modification of the study.\n\n      In stage 1, up to 21 patients will be enrolled to receive CTX DP (20 million cells) by\n      stereotaxic intra-striatal injection ipsilateral to the location of the MCA ischaemic\n      stroke. If 2 or more patients satisfy the primary response criterion 6 months after\n      treatment with CTX DP, the study will progress to Stage 2 and, subject to the agreement of\n      the DSMB, enrolment will be increased to a maximum total of 41 patients.\n\n      Pre-treatment selection of patients:  Men and women, aged 40 to 89 inclusive, subcortical or\n      cortical ischaemic stroke or a stroke with elements of both in an area perfused by the MCA\n      (i.e. stroke due to ischaemia resulting in infarct located in the basal ganglia, internal\n      capsule, or corona radiata or a stroke due to ischaemia resulting in infarction of part of\n      the cerebral cortex). Treatment will be offered to eligible women with a history of surgical\n      sterilisation or who are greater than 2 years but less than 4 years since their last\n      menstrual period.\n\n      Patients with a first stroke within the past 4 weeks (at time of consent) satisfying the\n      following criteria: Modified NIHSS Motor Arm Score of 2 (some effort against gravity) or 3\n      for affected arm (no movement against gravity) on day 28 and day 56 post-stroke; Clinical\n      diagnosis of stroke confirmed by physician using neuro-imaging (computerised tomography or\n      magnetic resonance imaging).  A Score of 0 or 1 for test 2 of the ARAT on day 28 and day 56\n      post-stroke using the affected arm.\n\n      Treatment: One patient will be treated at one time. A single dose (20 million) of CTX cells\n      will be administered intracranially via stereotaxic neurosurgery.\n\n      Post-treatment follow-up:  Patients will be followed for 12 months post-implantation.\n\n      End-points:  The primary endpoint of the trial is efficacy, using ARAT.  Secondary endpoints\n      are efficacy and safety.  Outcome measures for efficacy include NIHSS, BI and RFA.  Safety\n      will be assessed by incidence of relevant adverse events monitoring patient's general\n      physical condition and clinical measures (temperature, pulse rate and rhythm, ECG, blood\n      pressure, full blood count, liver function tests, serum urea and electrolytes),\n      immunological response and concomitant medications at the 7 follow-up visits to the clinic\n      in the first year after treatment.\n\n      Post-trial follow-up:  Annual correspondence with family practitioners;  Life-long follow-up\n      for new diagnosis of cancer, site of primary tumour, and survival via National Cancer\n      Registry."
