  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache is a common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department
      (ED), accounting for approximately 3 million ED visits per year. Headache treatment is often
      a source of frustration for both patients and providers. By the time patients with benign
      headaches arrive in the emergency department, they have often failed non-invasive
      therapeutic attempts and providers are often left with few therapeutic options. Treatment of
      benign headache varies between providers, often including systemic medications with a
      multitude of possible side effects. In recent years, there has been preliminary
      investigation into anesthetic injections for the undifferentiated headache patient
      presenting to the emergency department. It has been proposed that these patients presenting
      with benign headache might benefit from this novel treatment.

      Patients that present to the Emergency Department with a diagnosis of benign or primary
      headache with serious or life-threatening causes of headache will be offered enrollment into
      the study.

      Following consent, subjects will receive either 0.5% bupivacaine injected bilaterally in the
      paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine or the standard treatment with intravenous
      Prochlorperazine. The subjects will complete a validated pain scale before, and 20 minutes
      after injection. At twenty minutes post-injection, the subject will be reevaluated for
      symptoms. The subject will then be eligible for discharge or standard treatment at the
      discretion of the treating physician.

      Subjects will be followed for 72 hours after enrollment for headache recurrence. Subjects
      will be monitored for immediate and post-discharge complications.

      Headache is a common chief complaint of patients presenting to the emergency department
      (ED), accounting for approximately 3 million ED visits per year. Headache treatment is often
      a source of frustration for both patients and providers. By the time patients with benign
      headaches arrive in the emergency department, they have often failed non-invasive
      therapeutic attempts and providers are often left with few therapeutic options. Treatment of
      benign headache varies between providers, often including systemic medications with a
      multitude of possible side effects. Additionally, most headache cocktails require prolonged
      duration of treatment, occupying valuable bed space in increasingly busy emergency
      departments.

      In recent years, there has been preliminary investigation into anesthetic injections for the
      undifferentiated headache patient presenting to the emergency department. It has been
      proposed that these patients presenting with benign headache might benefit from this novel
      treatment. Since 2003, paraspinal muscle injections of bupivacaine have been used in
      emergency department patients with encouraging results. The mechanism of action is not
      clearly understood; however, it has been proposed that these injections affect the
      trigeminocervical complex hypothesized to play an integral role in headache physiology,
      similar to the same mechanism behind greater occipital nerve blocks used by neurologists.

      To the best of the investigators knowledge, there has never been a prospective
      double-blinded randomized control trial addressing this novel approach to headache
      management. Even so, the topic of using bupivacaine to inject the paraspinal musculature of
      the cervical spine has gained wider recognition over the past year. The topic has been
      discussed heavily on emergency medicine blogs and podcasts. Additionally, online videos have
      been posted to educate emergency medicine providers on the injection technique. According to
      retrospective literature, clinical efficacy was observed with a significant proportion of
      the patients receiving therapeutic effect. These studies, along with anecdotal experience
      with the procedure at the investigators institution, have led to great excitement concerning
      the possibility of a new approach to emergency department headache management. However, the
      topic still needs investigation with a well-designed prospective clinical trial to determine
      true clinical utility.

    <description>The injection site will be prepared using common sterile technique with 2% chlorhexidine. 1.5 mL of 0.5% bupivacaine will be  will be injected bilaterally in the paraspinal musculature of the cervical spine. Location would be approximately 1 cm superior to spinous process of C7 and approximately 2-3 cm laterally.  The needle is inserted 1 to 1.5 inches into the paraspinous musculature at this level. A 27-gauge needle would be used to minimize tissue trauma and pain to the patient. Our method of injection is followed quite closely with the technique depicted in multiple retrospective studies. We chose to follow previous reported technique secondary to good clinical efficacy and impressive documented safety profile. Additionally, before injection, aspiration would be performed to lesson chance of intravascular injection.</description>
