      This is an exploratory study using a strategy that has not been previously employed to
      investigate the effects of age and vaccine type on specific kinds of immune responses to
      licensed, 2009- 2010  influenza vaccine in children and adults.

      This study is being conducted in healthy male and female volunteers.  8-17 years old
      identical twins will be randomly assigned to receive a single administration of the
      2009-2010 formulation of either trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV) or 2009-2010
      formulation of live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV). Twins with in a pair will receive
      different vaccines. 18-30 years old and  70-100 years old subjects will receive a single
      administration of 2009-2010 formulation of trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine (TIV).
      Blood samples to conduct the assays will be taken at pre-immunization, Day 7-8 and Day 28
      post immunization.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Otherwise healthy, ambulatory children 8-17 year old twins , adults 18-30 year old
             (non-twin) or 70-100 year old elderly non-twin adults .

          -  Willing to complete the informed consent process.

          -  Availability for follow-up for the planned duration of the study at least 28 days
             after immunization.

          -  Acceptable medical history by medical history and vital signs.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior off-study vaccination with the current seasonal TIV or LAIV in Fall 2009

          -  Allergy to egg or egg products, or to vaccine components, including gentamicin,
             gelatin, arginine or MSG (for LAIV only), or thimerosal (TIV multidose vials only).

          -  Autoimmune disease (including rheumatoid arthritis treated with immunosuppressive
             medication such as Plaquenil, methotrexate, prednisone, Enbrel) which, in the opinion
             of the investigator, might jeopardize volunteer safety or compliance with the
             protocol.

          -  History of blood dyscrasias, renal disease, or hemoglobinopathies requiring regular
             medical follow up or hospitalization during the preceding year

          -  Use of any anti-coagulation medication such as Coumadin or Lovenox, or anti-platelet
             agents such as aspirin (except up to 325 mg. per day), Plavix, or Aggrenox must be
             reviewed by investigator to determine if this would affect the volunteer's safety.

          -  Receipt of blood or blood products within the past 6 months

          -  Medical or psychiatric condition or occupational responsibilities that preclude
             participant compliance with the protocol

          -  Inactivated vaccine 14 days prior to vaccination

          -  Live, attenuated vaccine within 60 days of vaccination

          -  History of Guillain-Barré Syndrome

          -  Pregnant or lactating woman

          -  Use of investigational agents within 30 days prior to enrollment

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with
             volunteer safety, study objectives or the ability of the participant to understand or
             comply with the study protocol.
