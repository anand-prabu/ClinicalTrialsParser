Determine the effectiveness of this\n      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the toxicity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive oral ZD 1839 once daily on days 1-28.\n      Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 22-46 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
