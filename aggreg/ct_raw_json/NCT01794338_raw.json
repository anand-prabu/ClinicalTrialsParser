The purpose of this study\n      is to collect information and evaluate the outcome of your surgery. Synthetic (man made)\n      mesh has been shown to provide durable long-term outcomes; however, this type of mesh should\n      not be used in patients at risk of developing an infection. Therefore, to address the\n      challenge of finding an artificial strengthening material to repair complicated hernias in\n      patients that could potentially develop surgical infection, two types of non-permanent\n      materials have been developed, including biologics and bioabsorbables. Biologic mesh is made\n      of living tissue and bioabsorbable mesh is made of synthetic material that is gradually\n      absorbed by the body over time. The purpose of this study is to allow surgeons to compare\n      the postoperative course of patients associated with these two mesh types to decide which\n      material will improve the outcomes of their patients with complicated abdominal wall\n      defects. To date there is no evidence to suggest that either mesh type is superior or safer\n      than the other."
