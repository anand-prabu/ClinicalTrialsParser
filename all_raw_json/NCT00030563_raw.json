Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Giving a chemotherapy drug after surgery and radiofrequency ablation may kill any\n      remaining tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to determine the effectiveness of surgery with or without\n      radiofrequency ablation followed by irinotecan in treating patients who have colorectal\n      cancer that is metastatic to the liver."

Patients are stratified according to treatment with\n      radiofrequency ablation in addition to resection (yes vs no).\n\n      Patients undergo surgical resection with or without radiofrequency ablation. Beginning 4-8\n      weeks after surgery, patients receive irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1. Chemotherapy\n      repeats every 3 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years,\n      and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study."
