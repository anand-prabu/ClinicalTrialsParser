  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Natural course of intermediate coronary artery disease (CAD) is very important to predict
      the prognosis of the patient with such disease.

      Several studies have well demonstrated the beneficial effect of lipid-lowering therapy on
      the progression of CAD with the modification of lipid profiles.

      This effect can be also explained by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) or optical coherence
      tomography. However, the effect of plaque modification on coronary physiology has been
      rarely evaluated.

      This research is to evaluate the change of intermediate or nonculprit coronary lesion on
      lipid-lowering therapy via IVUS and FFR.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patients who have intermediate CAD (30-80% diameter stenosis by visual estimation) with
      FFR≥0.80, or nonculprit coronary artery disease with FFR≥0.8 after culprit coronary artery
      disease intervention will be enrolled. FFR, IVUS and index of microcirculatory resistance
      (IMR) should be performed simultaneously. Atorvastatin 20mg is a starting dose, then
      up-titration will be done twice within each 4±2weeks until LDL target goal (① LDL&lt;70mg/dl,
      or ② statin naive: &gt;50% reduction from baseline LDL, current statin user: &gt;30% reduction
      from baseline LDL). First titration will be atorvastatin 40mg, second will be atorvastatin
      80mg. If patients have any adverse effect on atorvastatin, the dose of atorvastatin can be
      adjusted by investigator's decision. Official clinical follow-up except visit for statin
      dose titration will occur at 1, 12 months after index procedure. Follow-up coronary
      angiography, FFR,IMR,and IVUS will be performed 12 months after index procedure.
