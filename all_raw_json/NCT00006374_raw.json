Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which combination chemotherapy regimen is more effective for treating\n      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of combining topotecan and\n      paclitaxel with that of combining etoposide and cisplatin in treating patients who have\n      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer."

Compare the response rates in patients with extensive stage small cell lung\n      cancer treated with topotecan and paclitaxel versus etoposide and cisplatin. II. Compare\n      time to response, response duration, time to progression, and survival in these patients\n      treated with these regimens. III. Determine the toxicity profiles of these regimens in these\n      patients. IV. Compare the effects of these regimens on symptoms of disease in these\n      patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to gender, ECOG performance status (0-1 vs 2), and elevated LDH (absent vs\n      present). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive\n      paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1 and topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-5. Patients\n      also receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning on day 6 and continuing until blood\n      counts recover. Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 3 hours on day 1 and etoposide IV\n      over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment continues every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed every 3\n      months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
