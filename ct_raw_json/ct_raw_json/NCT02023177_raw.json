            "textblock": "Malnutrition is a frequent complication of cirrhosis, and it has been associated with a more\n      severe disease and decompensating events. Despite its relevance, there is no gold standard\n      for nutritional assessment in cirrhosis, and intrinsic pathophysiologic changes make\n      biochemical markers and traditional methods used to evaluate malnutrition unreliable. Phase\n      angle (PhA) obtained from bioelectrical impedance has been successfully used as a\n      nutritional marker in several diseases such as chronic renal failure, cancer, and HIV, where\n      it has been associated with prolonged in-hospital stay and mortality. In cirrhosis, research\n      linking malnutrition to increased mortality has yielded conflicting results, likely due to\n      the lack of a gold standard. A few PhA cut-off points have been proposed to define\n      malnutrition in cirrhosis, and they have proven to be useful in prognosticating severity of\n      the disease and mortality. However, PhA needs specific validation in different ethnic\n      groups. The aim of this study was to evaluate the PhA cut-off value that would best define\n      malnutrition and predict mortality in patients with liver cirrhosis."
