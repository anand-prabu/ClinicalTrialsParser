There are to our knowledge no randomized controlled trials comparing\n      splinting and surgical treatment with extension block technique.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare splinting and surgical extension block fixation of\n      mallet finger fractures in a randomized controlled trial.Our hypothesis is that conservative\n      treatment with splinting is comparable to surgical treatment concerning functional outcome,\n      and may even reduce the complication rates."
