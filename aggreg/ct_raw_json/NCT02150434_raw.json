The investigators hypothesized that\n      continuous automatic adjustment of the oxygen flows during exercise would better maintain\n      patients within the oxygenation target, reduce episodes of desaturation and hyperoxia and\n      would improve walking exercise tolerance in comparison with fixed levels of low-flow oxygen\n      and with compressed air breathing."
