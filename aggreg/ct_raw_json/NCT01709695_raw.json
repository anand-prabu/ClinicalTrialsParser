Children will be comprehensively assessed using a variety of clinical and\n      neuropsychological measures. They will be scanned at baseline while performing both the\n      go/no-go task (a well validated task for measuring inhibitory control (Durston et al., 2002,\n      2003)) and the Stay Alert task - a new task designed to measure the arousal component of\n      attention, which was used successfully in a recent fMRI study of guanfacine in healthy\n      adults (Clerkin et al., 2009). They will then be treated with GXR or placebo for 6 - 8 weeks\n      in accordance with titration and dosing strategies used in recent Phase III dose\n      optimization trials (e.g., up to 4 mg/day), and re-scanned while performing the same two\n      tasks. The fMRI scans will be conducted using a dedicated research 3.0 T Siemens scanner."
