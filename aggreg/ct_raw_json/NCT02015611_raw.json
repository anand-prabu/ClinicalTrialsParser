Lower extremity muscle strength and power, physical\n      performance, and postural sway will be assessed at baseline, 4 months and 12 months and\n      falls assessed monthly. Muscle biopsies of the vastus lateralis will be taken at baseline\n      and 4 months to assess muscle fiber type, contractility, and denervation, and number and\n      differentiation stage of satellite cells."
