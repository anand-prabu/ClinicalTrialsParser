    <textblock>
      An open-label, dose-escalation trial of the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK),
      biological, and clinical activity of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered to patients with CD20
      (B-lymphocyte antigen CD20) positive Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) that have failed standard
      rituximab-containing therapy. Following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab (if
      needed) each patient will receive DI-Leu16-IL2 administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection
      for three consecutive days every three weeks (21 day cycle).  Three to six (3-6) patients
      will be enrolled in each cohort.  Patients may receive 6 cycles of DI-Leu16-IL2
      approximately thrice weekly for 3 weeks for a total of 18 doses.

      1. Primary Endpoints

             1. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 administered      SC
                following peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell
                NHL.

             2. To investigate the optimal biologic dose (OBD) of DI-Leu16-IL2 following
                peripheral blood B cell depletion with rituximab in patients with B-cell NHL,
                which may differ from the MTD.

             3. To describe the toxicities associated with the proposed DI-Leu16-IL2 regimen.

        2. Secondary Endpoints

             1. To evaluate the immunogenicity as measured by the induction of
                DI-Leu16-IL2-specific antibodies.

             2. To evaluate the PK of DI-Leu16-IL2.

             3. To measure the response rate at the MTD (and/or OBD) associated with the proposed
                therapy and survival endpoints of the enrolled patients.
