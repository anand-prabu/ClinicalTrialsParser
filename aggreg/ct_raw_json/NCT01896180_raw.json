Subject rating of study medication comfort will be collected\n      at each visit.\n\n      Primary efficacy endpoint is the between-group comparison of the mean IOP at the 10 am time\n      point at visit 5 (Day 28). Secondary endpoints include the between-group comparisons of the\n      mean change from baseline in IOP at all time-points, between group comparison of the mean\n      change from baseline in diurnal IOP at all post-baseline visits and the proportion of\n      subjects with IOP \u2264 18 mm Hg at all time points at all post-baseline visits."
