Researchers have found that monocytes taken from the blood of healthy people can\n      kill tumor cells. Now they want to know if monocytes taken from the blood of people with\n      ovarian cancer can kill tumor cells.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To see if monocytes taken from the blood of people with ovarian cancer can kill tumor\n      cells.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Women 18 years and older with ovarian cancer.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with:\n\n        -  Medical history and physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood tests.\n\n        -  CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis and/or an MRI. For these scans, they will lie\n           in a machine that takes pictures of their body.\n\n        -  A small amount of blood (two tubes) will be collected by needle during one visit."

We have shown that monocytes\n      isolated through elutriation at the NIH blood bank and monocytes isolated from\n      anticoagulated peripheral blood from healthy women from the NIH blood bank are equally\n      capable of killing tumor cells. No data have been collected as to whether monocytes from\n      patients with Ovarian Cancer have tumorcidal properties. The goal of this protocol is to\n      measure the tumorcidal properties of monocytes from patients with Ovarian Cancer.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      To obtain blood samples from patients with ovarian cancer.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Females greater than or equal to 18 years of age with a prior diagnosis of ovarian cancer\n      seen in the Women   s Cancer Clinic of the NCI. Patients must be able and willing to provide\n      informed consent.\n\n      Design:\n\n      We will collect approximately 20 ml of peripheral blood at a single time point from patients\n      with ovarian cancer who are not currently on therapy and are screening for trials, being\n      seen in consultation, or presenting for enrollment on a clinical trial."
