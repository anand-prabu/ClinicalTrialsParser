            "textblock": "Elastic stable intramedullary nailing (ESIN) is the standard treatment for displaced\n      diaphyseal femoral fractures in children. However, some literature report high complication\n      rates (10-50%) in complex fractures. Data of our own patients with special emphasis on\n      complications showed also mediocre results. Thus,  a biomechanical study was conducted to\n      search for modifications. In this study the stiffness with a 3rd nail implanted was compared\n      to the classical 2 C-shaped configuration. For each of the 3 configurations of retrograde\n      ESIN (titanium nails) eight composite femoral grafts (Sawbones\u00ae) with an identical spiral\n      fracture were used: 2C configuration (2 C-shaped nails, 2x3.5 mm), 3CM configuration (3rd\n      from antero-medial, + 1x2.5 mm) and 3CL configuration (3rd from antero-lateral, + 1x2.5 mm).\n      Each group underwent biomechanical testing in 4-point bending, IRO/ERO and axial compression\n      (0\u00b0/9\u00b0). Due to a significantly higher stiffness of 3CL in the anterior-posterior, internal\n      rotation and 9\u00b0 compression directions implantation of 3 nails became standard treatment for\n      all dislocated femoral fractures at our department.\n\n      All patients were followed prospectively. The following data was collected: Type of\n      osteosynthesis, any kind of complication (additional procedures like cast or external\n      fixateur, Re-Do operations, misalignment, pseudarthrosis, skin irritation, infection), time\n      until full weight bearing and time until implant removal. At follow-up the legs were\n      controlled for a possible length discrepancy and a possible deviation of axis. Patients`\n      satisfaction was controlled by CSQ (clients satisfaction score, Larsen et al 2002). Further\n      on the Harris Hip Score was used. X-ray controls were done as standard care protocol after 1\n      and 3-4 months (dependend on age).\n\n      Level of Evidence IV Keywords: Elastic stable intramedullary nailing, biomechanical testing,\n      fracture, femur, treatment, children, adolescents."
