  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One important issue in older adults with cognitive problems is the higher risk of fall due
      to decreased motor function and balance. The objective of this study is to evaluate the
      repercussions of mild cognitive impairment in balance in elderly.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment is described as a transitional stage between normal ageing and
      dementia, and reflects the clinical situation where a person has memory complaints and
      objective evidence of cognitive impairment but no evidence of dementia. Mild cognitive  is
      important in older people and it is also important to evaluate its repercussion in balance.

    <description>The cognitive impairment will be measured using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment and the Mini-Mental State Examination. The Montreal Cognitive Assessment is a test designed as a rapid screening instrument for mild cognitive dysfunction. It assesses different cognitive domains: attention and concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructional skills, conceptual thinking, calculations, and orientation. The Mini Mental State Examination is a 10-minute bedside measure of impaired thinking in undeveloped, uneducated, diseased, or very old populations.</description>
