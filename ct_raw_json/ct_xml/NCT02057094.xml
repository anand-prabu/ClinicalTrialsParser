  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the physiological consequences of extreme military
      training and determine whether protein supplementation enhances recovery by promoting gains
      in lean body mass.  This study will be conducted at the US Marine Survive, Evade, Resist,
      Escape (SERE) school at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.

      SERE school may be an ideal setting to assess nutritional interventions that promote
      recovery from severe military operational stress, and identify innate or experiential
      variables that may lead to increased levels of resilience in Warfighters.  Our laboratory
      has recently demonstrated the detrimental effects and stressful nature of SERE.  Heart rates
      and stress-related hormones increased dramatically, with concomitant reductions in
      circulating anabolic hormones. Additionally, SERE causes significant weight loss (15-20
      lbs), which probably included lean body mass.  The effects of severe operational stress
      induced by SERE, particularly the loss of lean mass, may degrade physical performance,
      increase injury risk, and compromise military readiness.  Under controlled laboratory
      conditions, consuming high protein diets or supplemental high-quality protein promotes
      muscle protein retention, enhances muscle protein synthesis, and protects lean body mass in
      response to stress.  Whether consuming supplemental protein promotes lean mass recovery and
      physiological resilience following a 'real-world' military stress has not been determined.
      Further, the level of supplemental protein necessary to optimize recovery from extreme
      military operational stress has not been elucidated.

      Up to 90 US Marines will be enrolled in a 46-day double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.
      Using complex body composition measurements, kinetic modeling of human metabolism, blood
      sampling and cognitive and nutrition questionnaires, the consequences of SERE and the
      efficacy of protein recovery nutrition on lean mass accretion and Warfighter resilience will
      be assessed.

      We hypothesize that consuming a specially formulated, high-quality supplemental protein
      ration item will speed recovery of lean body mass, physiological, and psychological
      resilience following extreme military operational stress.
