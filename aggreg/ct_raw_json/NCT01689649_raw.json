Treatment naive patients (patients who\n      have never received the treatment before) and patients who failed on their first AED in\n      monotherapy are allowed. Failure is defined as a lack of efficacy and/or tolerability of\n      that AED and the reason for failure is recorded by the physician.  A lack of efficacy is\n      characterized when the patient has been treated with AED at target dose but the  patient\n      still has seizure.  Topiramate will first be titrated up to an initial target dose that will\n      be reached after 4-6 weeks. Further dose titration is guided by the clinical response of the\n      individual patient, but the dose may not exceed a maximum of 400mg/day [9mg/kg/day for\n      children]. If the patient uses an AED at entry, the AED will be fully tapered off over a\n      period of 3 weeks, starting at the beginning of week 2, in order to have all patients on\n      topiramate monotherapy at visit 3. Tapering the AED off may, however, extend this 3-week\n      period if clinically indicated. Visits will be performed at baseline and after 2, 4, 8, 12,\n      16 weeks. The total duration for each patient in the study will be 4 months."
