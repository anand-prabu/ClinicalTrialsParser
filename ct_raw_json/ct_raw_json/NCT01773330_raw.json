The investigator wants to learn how the different positions of the body, in a lying\n      position, semi-recumbent, sitting position or standing up, and the amount of liquid affects\n      the outcome of the test.  This will help the investigator to determine a standardized\n      protocol for patients with trouble swallowing."

All participants will be starting in the\n      supine position followed by semi-recumbent,sitting, then standing up.
