The aim of the study is to determine the effect of\n      polyphenol-rich dark chocolate on insulin sensitivity in normal weight and overweight\n      adults. Seventy four volunteers with no history of hypertension, cardiovascular diseases or\n      diabetes will be recruited. Participants will randomly receive 20g daily of one of the two\n      different types of DC: Placebo DC (low in polyphenols) or DC rich in polyphenols (500mg) for\n      a period of four weeks. Participants will be asked to make two appointments to the\n      university clinical lab. Anthropometric measurements (height, weight, waist circumference),\n      blood and saliva samples will be taken during each of the 2 visits. Compliance will be\n      tested by the measure of total polyphenols in a 24-hour urine sample in some random samples\n      before and at the end of the intervention. To monitor any fluctuations in the participants'\n      diet or physical activity during the study period, a three-day diet diary and a physical\n      activity questionnaire will be collected before the start of the study and after four weeks.\n      Data will be analysed with an ANCOVA with time (pre- and post-) and treatment (DC and\n      placebo) as between-subject factor."
