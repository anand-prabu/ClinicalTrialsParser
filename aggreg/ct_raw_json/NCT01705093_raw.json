Epidemiological and clinical studies\n      suggest that foods and ingredients rich in select flavonoids, such as cocoa, red grape\n      products, tea, citrus fruits, and strawberries are protective against the development of\n      cardiovascular disease.  Strawberries are rich in flavonoids, particularly anthocyanins,\n      flavanols, flavonols, ellagic acid and its glucose ester, ellagitanin.  A number of in vitro\n      studies have observed that these isolated compounds, as well as strawberry extracts have the\n      potential to affect outcomes of cardiovascular health, including vascular reactivity,\n      cellular signaling and oxidant defense6,7. We hypothesize that strawberry intake will lead\n      to improvements in select measures of cardiovascular function in overweight and obese\n      adolescent males."
