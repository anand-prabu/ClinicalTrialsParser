            "textblock": "Peritoneal infection is still a frequent complication in  peritoneal dialysis patients . In\n      France, It contributes to the technique failure, responsible for about 20% of cases of\n      transfer in hemodialysis. The risk of direct mortality is estimated at 1 to 6% according to\n      studies. Peritoneal infection is involved in the dysfunction of the peritoneal membrane.\n\n      Based on the recommendations of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, the\n      intraperitoneal route is preferentially recommended. For many antibiotics, pharmacokinetics\n      (intravenous and intraperitoneal) was studied and protocols for IP administration were\n      validated.\n\n      Daptomycin, is a cyclic lipopeptide natural, active only on Gram-positive bacteria. It is\n      presented as an alternative to vancomycin in infections resistant pathogens. The stability\n      of daptomycin in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDF) has been tested, and antimicrobial\n      activity as well.\n\n      Seven patients were treated with daptomycin intraperitoneally successfully. But no study has\n      reported pharmacokinetics of daptomycin via the IP route. We propose a pharmacokinetic study\n      of daptomycin administered intraperitoneally in 12 patients on CAPD and with Gram-positive\n      peritoneal infection."

Daptomycin will be given IP\n      in the CAPD fluid (200mg in 2L Nutrineal) once daily, in a 6 hours-dwell time. The process\n      of dialysis is done four times per day : three during the day (6,6,and 4 h) and one time at\n      night (8h). Duration of treatment depends on bacteria identified (14 or 21 days).\n\n      Analyses will be performed on data from all patients meeting the criteria for inclusion and\n      exclusion.\n\n      For each patient,  plasma, dialysate and urine kinetics will be studied.\n\n      For each parameter, mean and standard deviation are calculated.\n\n      Number of centers & patients:\n\n      One center, twelve patients.\n\n      Sample size justification:\n\n      This is an observational pharmacokinetic study of consecutive PD patients presenting to Caen\n      University Hospital with peritoneal infection and who meet inclusion criterias over one\n      year.\n\n      Population: CAPD  patients with a Gram positive peritoneal infection"
