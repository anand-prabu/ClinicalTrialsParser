However, from Lin's (Lin JC, 2004)\n      study, locally advanced NPC with high risk factors can not benefit from conventional\n      concurrent chemoradiation. Failure pattern analysis revealed that local and distant failure\n      accounted for 50% respectively. Large-scale data has demonstrated that with IMRT, local\n      control can achieve 90%. Previous studies showed inductive chemotherapy can decrease distant\n      metastasis. We need more effective and stronger chemotherapy, and we still need to testify\n      concurrent chemotherapy combined with inductive chemotherapy.\n\n      A prospective trial would thus provide valuable information to help physicians and patients\n      more precisely identify the feasibility and effectiveness of inductive + concurrent\n      chemotherapy combined with IMRT for high-risk locally advanced NPC."
