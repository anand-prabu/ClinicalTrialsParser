Central 24-h blood pressure (BP) monitoring hedges day fluctuations in blood pressure\n           more accurately than peripheral 24-h BP monitoring, because the measurement is painless\n           and does not interfere with the patient / subject's activities during the daytime or\n           nighttime sleep.\n\n        2. Blood pressure is elevated in patients with OSA and falls during treatment with CPAP.\n\n      3. The renal  treatment of salt and water is abnormal in OSA, improved during treatment with\n      CPAP.\n\n      4. Quality of life  improves during treatment with CPAP"
