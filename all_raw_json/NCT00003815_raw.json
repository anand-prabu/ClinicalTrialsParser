Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy\n      drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation\n      therapy plus bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have aggressive\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients are\n      stratified according to risk group (good vs intermediate vs poor).\n\n      Patients undergo harvest of autologous bone marrow stem cells after priming chemotherapy and\n      before transplantation.\n\n      Patients receive induction chemotherapy comprising the CHOP or VAPEC-B regimen. The CHOP\n      regimen consists of vincristine (VCR) IV, cyclophosphamide (CTX) IV, and doxorubicin (DOX)\n      IV on day 1 and oral prednisolone (PRDL) on days 1-5. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for\n      six courses. The VAPEC-B regimen consists of DOX IV on days 1, 15, 29, 43, 57, and 71; CTX\n      IV on days 1, 29, and 57; VCR IV on days 8, 22, 36, 50, and 64; bleomycin IV on days 8, 36,\n      64; oral etoposide (VP-16) on days 15-19, 43-47, and 71-75; and oral PRDL daily for 13\n      weeks.\n\n      Patients then may undergo radiotherapy for 2-3 weeks to areas of original bulk or residual\n      disease.\n\n        -  Good-risk group: Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm I: Patients receive no further treatment.\n\n             -  Arm II: Patients receive melphalan (L-PAM) before or after total body irradiation\n                (TBI), which is delivered in 3 fractions over 24 hours. After completion of\n                radiotherapy, patients undergo autologous bone marrow transplantation (AuBMT).\n\n        -  Intermediate- or poor-risk group: Patients are randomized one of three treatment arms.\n\n             -  Arm III: Patients receive L-PAM IV on day -2 and AuBMT on day 0.\n\n             -  Arm IV: Patients receive treatment as in arm II.\n\n             -  Arm V: Patients receive carmustine IV on day -6, VP-16 IV once daily and\n                cytarabine IV twice daily on days -5 to -2, and L-PAM IV on day -1. Radiotherapy\n                to bulk disease begins after completion of chemotherapy. Patients undergo AuBMT on\n                day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 3 months, every 2 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 2\n      years, and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
