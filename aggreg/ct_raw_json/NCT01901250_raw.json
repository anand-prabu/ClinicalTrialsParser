All gummy bears were formulated to be similar in\n      size, consistency, color, and sweetness.  They were in six bright colors attractive to\n      children, and in strawberry and cherry flavors which are popular among children. Children\n      were encouraged to chew the gummy bears slowly to maximize the xylitol exposure time in the\n      mouth. The children received xylitol or placebo gummy bears throughout the 9 month\n      kindergarten year, 3 times/day within the supervised school environment.\n\n      In addition to gummy bears, all participating children received oral health education, tooth\n      brushing and fluoridated toothpaste, topical fluoride varnish treatment, and dental sealants\n      when the first permanent molars have completely erupted. This design allows for the\n      comparison between the current best recommended public heath practices and the addition of\n      the new strategy, xylitol gummy bear snacks. Children were enrolled in kindergarten and\n      followed until the middle of 2nd grade."
