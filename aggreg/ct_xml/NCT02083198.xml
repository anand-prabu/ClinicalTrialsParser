  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study evaluates the impact of high and low chloride containing IV fluids
      on administrative and clinical outcomes. The study uses a large electronic health dataset
      and examines patients receiving fluid replacement and resuscitation. The hypothesis is that
      high chloride solutions are associated with adverse outcomes as measured by administrative
      data and by clinical parameters.
