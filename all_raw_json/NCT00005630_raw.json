Patients receive mutant K-ras peptide\n      vaccine (limited to the specific K-ras mutation in their tumors) ID on day 7. Treatment\n      repeats every 4 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 and 12 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 18\n      months."
