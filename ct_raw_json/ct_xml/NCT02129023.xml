  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether exergame use can improve user health, in
      terms of physical fitness, self-rated mental health and physical health, and favorable
      attitude, strong intention, and actual behavior of future exercise. Moreover, this study
      also examines whether past exercise moderates the impact of exergame use on user health.

      The main hypotheses are:

      H1: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in physical fitness. The difference
      between these two groups in the amount of change is negatively related to past exercise.

      H2: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in  (a) mental health and (b)
      physical health after the intervention. The difference between these two groups in the
      amount of change is negatively related to past exercise.

      H3: Compared with the control group participants (who do not use exergame) the experimental
      group participants (who use exergame) have better change in (a) attitude, (b) intention and
      (c) behavior of doing another exercise in the future. The difference between these two
      groups in the amount of change is negatively related to past exercise.
