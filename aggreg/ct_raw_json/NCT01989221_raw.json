This will be a prospective open-label study using Sancuso\u00ae to treat symptoms\n      of nausea and/or vomiting in patients diagnosed with gastroparesis.  Symptomatic patients\n      with diabetic or idiopathic gastroparesis with nausea and/or vomiting will be enrolled.  The\n      Gastroparesis Cardinal Symptom Index Daily Diary (GCSI-DD) will be used to capture the\n      severity of symptoms, including nausea and vomiting, at baseline for one week.  Patients\n      will then be treated with Sancuso\u00ae.  Patients will continue to fill out the GCSI-DD on a\n      daily basis while undergoing treatment with Sancuso\u00ae for two weeks.  To determine if\n      Sancuso\u00ae treatment helps improve symptoms of nausea and vomiting, the symptoms at baseline\n      will be compared to symptoms after the first week and the second week of treatment. Thirty\n      patients diagnosed with gastroparesis (approximately 15 with diabetic and 15 with idiopathic\n      gastroparesis) will be treated on an open label basis with Sancuso\u00ae.  The goal of this study\n      is to demonstrate the efficacy of Sancuso\u00ae in treating nausea and/or vomiting in\n      gastroparesis patients.  Safety information will also be collected regarding any adverse\n      effects.  If the results are encouraging, as we expect them to be based on personal\n      experience, a larger double blind study would be appropriate."

Determine the treatment response of Sancuso\u00ae in gastroparetic patients with nausea\n           and/or vomiting.\n\n        2. Determine which specific symptoms of gastroparesis improve - nausea, vomiting, early\n           satiety, abdominal distension, abdominal pain\n\n        3. To determine symptomatic responses in both diabetic and idiopathic gastroparesis\n\n        4. To determine the time course of symptom improvement (with Sancuso\u00ae for symptoms of\n           gastroparesis;\n\n      The hypotheses to be tested include:\n\n        1. Sancuso\u00ae improves symptoms of gastroparesis.\n\n        2. Symptoms of nausea and vomiting improve to a greater degree than abdominal pain.\n\n        3. The beneficial response of Sancuso\u00ae is seen in both diabetic and idiopathic\n           gastroparesis.\n\n        4. The symptom reduction occurs on days 3 after starting treatment and continues\n           throughout the treatment course."
