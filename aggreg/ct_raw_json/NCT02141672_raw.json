Two doses of\n      voclosporin will be studied and compared in a placebo controlled trial on a background of\n      MMF and corticosteroids.  Patients with active, flaring LN will be eligible to enter the\n      study. They are required to have a diagnosis of LN according to established diagnostic\n      criteria (American College of Rheumatology) and clinical and biopsy features suggestive of\n      active nephritis. Efficacy will be assessed by the ability of the drug combination to reduce\n      the level of proteinuria while demonstrating an acceptable safety profile."
