Ninety-four eligible\n      and consenting patients will be randomized to one of the two treatment arms. Patients\n      randomized to the experimental arm will receive Metformin (2000 mg/day) for a period of 12\n      months. Patients will be continuously evaluated for toxicity, will be assessed weekly at\n      clinic visits during concurrent CRT treatment and at follow up clinic visits at 3, 6, 9 and\n      12 months (from the date of randomization). Disease progression will be evaluated every 3\n      months for up to 12 months. All patients will be followed for up to 24 months (2 years) for\n      survival.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of Metformin on the\n      proportion of patients free of disease progression at 12 months after initiation of drug\n      treatment."
