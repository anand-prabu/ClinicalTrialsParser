TXA is FDA-approved in patients with hemophilia\n      for short-term use to reduce hemorrhage and the need for replacement blood during tooth\n      extraction. However, it has also been used extensively in severely injured patients after\n      major trauma and during elective hip and knee replacements. Previous studies indicate TXA\n      may reduce blood loss and the need for blood transfusions while being safe for use in most\n      patients. TXA is fairly inexpensive and easy to obtain.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine if TXA will make surgery in patients with pelvis\n      and/or hip socket fractures safer and more cost efficient."
