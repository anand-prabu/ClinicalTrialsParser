(2) Evaluate the interobserver reliability\n      and intraobserver reproducibility of measurement of FO, LLD, acetabular cup inclination and\n      anteversion.\n\n      90 patients with primary unilateral osteoarthritis (OA) were included in this prospective\n      study. On postoperative radiographs FO by the Sundsvall method, FO by a standard method,\n      LLD, acetabular cup inclination and anteversion were measured. The interobserver reliability\n      and intraobserver reproducibility were made by three independent observers. The validity and\n      degree of prediction of Sundsvall method are measured by comparing its results with the\n      standard method."
