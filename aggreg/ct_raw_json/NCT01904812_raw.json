To date, the effect of systemic lupus on\n      quality of life has only been described using generic questionnaires. Among the specific\n      questionnaires for systemic lupus, the LupusQol, which has been validated in French, shows\n      interesting psychometric properties. The determinants of quality of life specifically\n      related to the disease are still unknown  and could be studied using a longitudinal cohort\n      thanks to the French version of the LupusQol."
