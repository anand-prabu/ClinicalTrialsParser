  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Through a grant funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) the Center for
      Multicultural Mental Health Research at Cambridge Health Alliance is testing a screening and
      intervention project designed to improve the quality of care for Latino patients with
      comorbid mental health and substance use problems. We will first test a screening of
      comorbid problems with patients identified in mental health as well as primary health care.
      Building on that work, we will test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the
      &quot;Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action&quot; (IIDEA) intervention addressing
      mental health, substance use, and prevention of HIV, as well as a smoking cessation
      supplement. The project is being conducted in Massachusetts as well as at two sites in
      Spain. As such, the proposed ILRP multi-site international project is a critical step
      towards developing models of integrated care for the large and diverse Latino migrant
      population and more broadly towards understanding how best to integrate evidence-based
      assessment and treatments for co-occurring substance and mental health problems and HIV
      risks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our study aims to conduct behavioral health services research focused on rapid screening and
      referral; as well as testing the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of integrated
      behavioral health services in primary care clinics for migrant Latinos with co-occurring
      substance use and mental health problems, and increased risk of HIV.

      A key activity for the first phase, the screening project, is administering a screener to at
      least 450 Latino migrant patients across the 3 sites (n=150 each in Boston, Madrid, and
      Barcelona) from primary care and behavioral health (substance abuse and mental health)
      services. We intend to test the referral process for screened participants in need of
      treatment to identify barriers and streamline the process. We will analyze data to optimize
      the screening battery and protocol to use in Phase 2, the IIDEA intervention.

      In Phase 2, we intend to enroll, randomize and collect data on 360 total patients across the
      3 sites - 180 in the intervention condition and 180 in the control condition (120 in each
      site, 60 in the intervention condition and 60 in the control condition). 8-10 session IIDEA
      intervention will be offered to Latino patients by trained clinicians with at least a
      Masters level of training. The intervention is designed to help patients to address and
      prevent mental health and substance use problems and will be culturally adapted to Latino
      populations in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona. Usual care - the control group - receives
      treatment as usual, for patients in primary care identified with a mental health or
      substance use problem. 4 Research interviews will be conducted to assess outcomes, for
      patients in both the intervention and usual care arms.
