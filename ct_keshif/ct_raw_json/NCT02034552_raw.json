All patients involved in the study will be randomized (assigned by chance)\n      into one of three arms: radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks;\n      radium-223 dichloride 50 kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks together with abiraterone acetate\n      1000 mg orally daily plus prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily; and radium-223 dichloride 50\n      kBq/kg administered every 4 weeks together with enzalutamide 160 mg orally daily. The study\n      will be conducted in the United States. The study will consist of screening, treatment, and\n      follow-up. Study treatment will continue until disease progression as determined by\n      investigator or when the patient meets criteria for withdrawal from study. Follow-up will\n      continue until patient dies, is lost to follow-up, or withdraws informed consent. Active\n      followup will continue up to 2 years following last dose of radium-223 dichloride. Long-term\n      follow-up for survival and treatment-related safety events will continue up to 7 years\n      following last dose of radium-223 dichloride."
