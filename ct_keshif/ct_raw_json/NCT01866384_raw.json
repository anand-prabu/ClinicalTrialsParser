In this\n      sense, we believe that the initiation of an ultra-early protocol of active temperature\n      modulation or Targeted Temperature Management (TTM) to mild induced hypothermia (MIH,\n      32-34\u00b0C) may be associated with good safety and tolerability profile, less HG and cerebral\n      edema after IPH by modulation of systemic and local inflammatory responses, so we\n      hypothesize that TTM to MIH will be a safe/tolerable and effective therapy to limit HG and\n      cerebral edema after IPH."
