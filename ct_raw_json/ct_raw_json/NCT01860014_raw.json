Formerly,the risk factors\n      associated with PH included the severity of the associated illness, intrauterine growth\n      restriction, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), coagulopathy, and the need for assisted\n      ventilation. Currently, PH occurs mainly in preterm ventilated infants with severe\n      respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) who often have a PDA and have received surfactant.\n      Currently, PH complicates the hospital course of 3-5% of preterm infants with RDS. The cause\n      of PH is thought to be due to a rapid lowering of intrapulmonary pressure, which facilitates\n      left to right shunting across a patent ductus arteriosus and an increase in pulmonary blood\n      flow.
