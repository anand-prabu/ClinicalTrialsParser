      This phase II clinical trial studies how well soy isoflavones work in preventing head and
      neck cancer in patients with stage I-IV head and neck cancer undergoing surgery.
      Chemoprevention is the use of certain drugs to keep cancer from forming. The use of soy
      isoflavones may prevent head and neck cancer recurrence.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if short term, preoperative (300 mg/day x 14 treatment days) soy isoflavone
      supplementation modulates p16 methylation (% CpG sites methylated) and expression of p16,
      cyclooxygenase 2 [COX-2], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor [VEGF], epidermal
      growth factor receptor [EGFR], interleukin-6 [IL6], p53 and B-cell lymphoma-extra large
      [Bcl-xL] in tumor and non-tumor adjacent mucosa of patients with head and neck squamous
      carcinoma undergoing curative tumor resection.

      II. To estimate correlations of tumor p16 methylation (% CpG sites methylated) with
      expression of p16 and levels of, IL6, VEGF, and 15-F2t-isoprostane in serum and saliva.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Describe the toxicity of short-term, preoperative treatment with soy isoflavone.

      II. To determine overall and relapse-free survival.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive soy isoflavones orally (PO) for approximately 14 days before undergoing
      surgery.

      After completion of treatment, patients are followed up, within the routine cancer
      management schedule, at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months.

    <description>The change in the endpoints (p16 methylation and expression of p16, COX-2, VEGF, EGFR, IL6, p53 and Bcl-xL) will be analyzed in parallel using a linear repeated measures model. The fixed effects will be time (pre-treatment versus post-treatment), current smoking status (yes or no), their interaction, and tissue type (tumor or not). Satterthwaite's adjustment to the degrees of freedom will be applied to account for heteroscedasticity. The differential effect of soy isoflavone on tumor and non-tumor tissues between smokers and non-smokers will be assessed using linear contrasts.</description>

    <description>Each of the tumor and mucosal markers will be dependent variables in repeated measures models that include serum and saliva markers as predictors. Graphical analyses will be used to characterize possible nonlinear relationships between variables. Linear or nonlinear regression, as appropriate, will be used to characterize the relationship between the putative predictors and outcomes. Subset analyses, considering, for example, differences in relationships between tumor markers and serum and saliva markers between smokers and non-smokers will be performed by means of indicator variables.</description>

    <description>Survival and relapse-free survival functions will be estimated using the product-limit (Kaplan-Meier) method, with appropriate confidence intervals, for the entire sample and for subsets defined by demographic and baseline clinical variables. In addition, proportional hazards (Cox) regression will be used to assess the potential of biomarker response to treatment as a predictor of survival and relapse-free survival. These analyses are strictly exploratory and hypothesis-generating.</description>
