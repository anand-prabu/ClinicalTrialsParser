It is hypothesized that the grazing condition will produce lower\n      consumption during an evening ad libitum meal, lower daily energy intake, and a lower ratio\n      of energy intake to energy expenditure than the meal condition."

The complete study design\n      will be a 2 x 2 mixed factorial design, with the between-subject factor of order and a\n      within-subject factor of eating condition (meal or grazing). Depending upon the eating\n      condition, participants will be provided with a morning meal and an afternoon meal (meal) or\n      two small meals and three snacks to be consumed every 2-3 hours (grazing).   The types of\n      foods and amount of foods provided to participants will be identical in each condition; the\n      only difference in the conditions is the time spacing during the day when the foods are\n      consumed.  The primary dependent variable will be amount, both grams and energy, of food\n      consumed during an ad libitum meal consumed in the evening at the completion of the meal\n      condition, overall daily energy intake, and ratio of daily energy intake to energy\n      expenditure. It is hypothesized that the grazing condition will produce lower consumption\n      during an evening ad libitum meal, lower daily energy intake, and a lower ratio of energy\n      intake to energy expenditure than the meal condition."
