The limited scientific evidence has determined that their use\n      is controversial and not routinely recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Current\n      clinical guidelines in the treatment of COPD are unable to rule on the application of\n      respiratory therapy during exacerbations, since there is little scientific evidence of its\n      benefits in the short and long term."

Vibropercussion is applied by the use of a mechanical system following rib movement during expiration to enhance clearance of secretions.\nIntervention group received 30-minute-sessions twice a day, 7 days per week, during hospitalization period.",
