  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that a magnetic field applied to the front part of the
      brain of children suffering from Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) can improve function and
      ameliorate symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Primary diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder by DSM-IV-TR rendered by the
             examination and sufficient CARS-2 score to qualify as autism.

          -  CARS score between 36 and 47 inclusively

          -  Age between 4 and 12 years (at day of informed consent)

          -  Child must suffer disrupted sleep patterns defined as a minimum of 3 nights per week
             of delayed onset of sleep or night-time awakenings. If these are medicated with mild
             sedatives or melatonin and corrected, the requirement for medication or melatonin
             will qualify as evidence of a sleep disorder.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of Asperger's Disorder, Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise
             specified

          -  History of clinically significant traumatic brain injury

          -  Any condition associated with increased intracranial pressure

          -  Cerebral Aneurysm

          -  Down's Syndrome or other chromosomal abnormality

          -  EEG abnormalities that indicate seizure risk

          -  Intracranial implant

          -  Unstable medical condition not otherwise specified

          -  Clinically significant organic disease unrelated to autism
