Subject rating of study medication comfort and\n      assessment of ongoing tolerability will also be obtained.\n\n      Primary efficacy endpoint is the mean increase from baseline in points seen on the HVF\n      36-point ptosis protocol test at various timepoints according to a hierarchical analysis.\n\n      Analysis of exploratory endpoints will provide characterization of the efficacy and duration\n      of effect of RVL-1201 with a variety of efficacy measures, as well as the potential\n      additional effect of BID over QD dosing and safety profile of BID administration of\n      RVL-1201. Exploratory endpoints will be analyzed by each regimen against placebo and between\n      regimens and will include:\n\n        -  The change from baseline in HVF, MRD, PFD, VA, and CS.\n\n        -  The change from baseline in BP/HR"
