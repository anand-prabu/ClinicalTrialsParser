  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Median overall-survival (OS) after surgery in curative intent for non-metastasized pancreas
      cancer ranges under study conditions from 17.9 months to 23.6 months. Tumor recurrence
      occurs locally, at distant sites (liver, peritoneum, lungs), or both. Observational and
      autopsy series report local recurrence rates of up to 87% even after potentially &quot;curative&quot;
      R0 resection. To achieve better local control, neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) has
      been suggested for preoperative tumour downsizing, to elevate the likelihood of curative,
      margin-negative R0 resection and to increase the OS rate. However, controlled, randomized
      trials addressing the impact of neoadjuvant CRT survival do not exist. The underlying
      hypothesis of this randomized, two-armed, open-label, multicenter, phase III trial is that
      neoadjuvant CRT increases the three-year overall survival by 12% (30% to 42%) compared to
      patients undergoing upfront surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer. Overall, 410 patients
      (n=205 in each study arm) will be enrolled in the trial, taking into regard an expected drop
      out rate of 7% and allocated either to receive neoadjuvant CRT prior to surgery or to
      undergo surgery alone. Circumferential resection margin status, i.e. R0 and R1 rates,
      respectively, surgical resectability rate, local and distant disease-free and global
      survival, and first site of tumor recurrence constitute further essential endpoints of the
      trial.

    <description>Primary outcome measure is the efficacy of neoadjuvant CRT in improving 3-year survival probability from 30% in the control arm undergoing upfront surgery without neoadjuvant CRT to 42% (relative increase of 40%) in the study arm undergoing CRT. The underlying guess of a 30% 3-year survival probability in the control group derives from an assumed median overall survival (MOS) of 20.7 months which corresponds with a MOS of 17.9 months to 23.6 months reported in several randomized trials.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histology-proven adenocarcinoma of the pancreatic head/uncinate process with a tumor
             size greater 2 cm (≥cT2) and/or close contact to the superior mesenteric vessels (≤3
             mm in preoperative staging).

          -  No evidence of metastasis to distant organs (liver, peritoneum, lung, others).

          -  For determination of resectability, a multi-detector CT (MDCT) with at least 16 rows
             applying both oral and intravenous contrast media is performed. MDCT-based imaging
             focuses on the upper abdomen with native, arterial, and parenchyma phase, where the
             parenchyma phase should include the pelvis. Imaging criteria derived from the recent
             consensus definition of the Society of Surgical Oncology, the American Society of
             Clinical Oncology and the American Hepato-Pancreatico-Biliary Association [1] are
             applied for preoperative assessment of local resectability.

          -  Potential Resectability: visualizable fat plane around celiac and superior mesenteric
             arteries, and patent superior mesenteric/portal vein (SMV/PV).

          -  Borderline Resectability: substantial superior mesenteric/portal vein impingement,
             tumor abutment on the SMA &lt; 180°, GDA encasement up to the origin of the hepatic
             artery, or colonic/mesenteric root invasion.

          -  Karnofsky performance status ≥ 80%

          -  Serum creatinine level ≤ 3.0 mg/dl

          -  Serum total bilirubin level ≤ 3.0 mg/dl in the absence of biliary obstruction (In the
             event of biliary obstruction, patients allocated to the CRT group must undergo
             interventional endoscopy or percutaneous drainage for biliary decompression.
             Post-interventionally, bilirubin levels should be ≤ 3.0 mg/dl before patients are
             subjected to CRT. In control patients undergoing upfront surgery, serum total
             bilirubin levels ≤ 10.0 mg/dl are tolerated, unless clinical and laboratory signs of
             severe cholangitis take place. Patients with serum total bilirubin level &gt; 10.0 mg/dl
             undergo preoperative biliary decompression, preferentially by interventional
             endoscopy)

          -  White blood cell count ≥ 3.5 x 109/ml, platelet count ≥ 100 x 109/ml

          -  Ability to understand and willingness to consent to formal requirements for study
             participation

          -  Gastric outlet obstruction, especially in the event of endoscopically evidenced tumor
             invasion into the gastroduodenal mucosa.

          -  Tumor specific pre-treatment

          -  History of gastrointestinal perforation, e.g. perforated colonic diverticulitis,
             abdominal abscess or intestinal fistula within 6 months prior to potential study
             participation

          -  Radiographic evidence of severe portal hypertension/cavernomatous transformation that
             may, at the discretion of the participating investigators, hamper surgery

          -  Other concurrent malignancies except for basal cell cancer of the skin and in-situ
             cervical cancer

             INR &gt; 1.5; other severe diseases that might prevent completion of the treatment
             regimen)

          -  Chronic infectious diseases, especially immune deficiency syndromes, e.g. HIV
             infection, active tuberculosis within 12 months prior to potential study
             participation

          -  History of severe neurologic disorders, e.g. cerebrovascular ischemia

          -  History of prior deep venous thrombosis or pulmonary embolism

          -  Pregnant or nursing women are ineligible and patients of reproductive potential must
             agree to use an effective contraceptive method during participation in this trial and
             for 6 months following the trial

          -  Serious medical, psychological, familial, sociological or geographical conditions or
             circumstances potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up
             Participation in other clinical trials during the last 6 months before allocation to
