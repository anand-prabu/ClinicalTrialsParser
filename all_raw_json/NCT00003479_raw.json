After 12 months, patients with stable disease may continue treatment.\n\n      Tumors are measured at least every 8 weeks during the first 2 years, every 3 months during\n      the third and fourth years, every 6 months during the fifth and sixth years, and yearly\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
