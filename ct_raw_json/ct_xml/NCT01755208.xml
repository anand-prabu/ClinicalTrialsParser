    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies light-scattering spectroscopy in finding disease in
      patients with stage II-III breast cancer. Diagnostic procedures, such as light-scattering
      spectroscopy, may help find and diagnose breast cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES: I. To evaluate whether light-scattering spectroscopy can reliably
      distinguish between two subject groups: those with clinical stage II or stage III breast
      cancer and those without breast cancer.

      OUTLINE:  Patients undergo light-scattering spectroscopy of the breast in addition to
      standard of care as it relates to screening for breast cancer or treatment of breast cancer.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants who are breast cancer free (mammogram &quot;negative&quot; within 1 month of
             testing) with the absence of clinical suspicion of breast cancer on physical exam or
             with clinical stage II or stage III breast cancer. PLEASE NOTE: Recruitment for this
             study is only limited to patients who are scheduled for a mammogram at USC. There is
             no compensation to participants.
