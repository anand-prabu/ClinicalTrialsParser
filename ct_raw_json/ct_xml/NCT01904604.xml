  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy happens when the immune system reacts against foods.  The immune system is the
      part of the body that protects us from illness and germs, but it can also cause allergies.
      Peanut allergy occurs in 1 - 2% of people in the United States and other Western countries.
      There is proof that allergy to peanut is increasing.  Allergic reactions to peanut can be
      severe and life threatening. The only way that you can prevent an allergic reaction is to
      avoid exposure to peanuts.  However, peanut proteins are found in a variety of foods and
      people can be accidently exposed to peanut proteins.  Treatment for accidental exposure
      include antihistamines (medications like Benadryl), and injectable epinephrine (adrenalin)
      which must be carried at all times. DBV Technologies has developed an epicutaneous delivery
      system, a patch that puts the peanut protein on the skin. The study will try to find out if
      peanut epicutaneous immunotherapy can protect people who are allergic to peanuts from having
      severe allergic reactions, when accidentally exposed to peanuts. The study also looks at the
      safety of the treatment and the effects it has on the immune system.

Subjects demonstrating sustained unresponsiveness will have follow up for 6 months. Active subjects who fail the 5044 mg peanut protein OFC at the following time points: 130 weeks, 138 weeks or at 150 weeks will be given dietary advice and will have follow-up for 3 months.</description>
