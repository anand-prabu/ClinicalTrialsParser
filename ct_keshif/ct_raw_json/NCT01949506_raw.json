Patients will be followed for three years.\n\n      The usual treatment for sarcomas that spread to the lungs is to remove the cancer with\n      surgery. Patients who cannot have surgery or prefer not to have surgery, can receive\n      radiation therapy. Standard radiation therapy involves several weeks of daily treatment\n      sessions, although it is not as effective as surgery and may seriously damage normal\n      surrounding lung tissue.  Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a radiation\n      treatment that gives fewer but higher doses of radiation than standard radiation. SBRT is\n      used to treat metastases to the lung from many types of cancer but has not been used very\n      often with patients who have metastatic disease to their lungs from sarcomas.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to test the possibility of SBRT to the lung for metastatic\n      disease to the lung. This information will be used to find out if there are factors that can\n      predict recovery or outcome of patients with metastatic disease to the lung from sarcoma.\n      SBRT will consist of 1 to 3 treatments per week for a total of 3 to 5 treatments to each\n      tumor until therapy is complete. After SBRT is completed, follow-up exams will occur 4-6\n      weeks from the completion of radiation treatment, every 3 months in year 1 and every 6\n      months for 2 years."
