This study will also see how a combination of\n      stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) affects these\n      levels.\n\n      Current findings in anti-HIV drug treatment have led to a greater understanding of the\n      background of HIV. To find the best anti-HIV treatment to eliminate all HIV viruses, cells\n      and tissues infected with the HIV virus are examined after combination anti-HIV treatment,\n      when the level of HIV infection is low. The ERADICATE study will examine the idea that HIV\n      viruses can be eliminated at any stage of infection over time."

To calculate the degree and\n      duration of antiretroviral effect necessary to eliminate infection, characterization of\n      residual cellular and tissue HIV reservoirs following high-level viral suppression is\n      necessary. The ERADICATE study will evaluate the hypothesis that complete viral inhibition\n      is possible, regardless of HIV disease stage, and leads to HIV eradication from tissues over\n      time.\n\n      Patients are divided into 1 of 5 groups based on the stage of HIV infection. Patients\n      receive oral stavudine (d4T), lamivudine (3TC), indinavir (IDV), and nelfinavir (NFV) twice\n      daily for 24 weeks. All patients undergo basic blood sampling to follow HIV-1 RNA levels and\n      absolute T cell subset numbers daily for 5 days; then 3 times a week for 3 weeks; 2 times a\n      week for 4 weeks; every 2 weeks for 12 weeks; and monthly thereafter for a total of 3 years.\n      In addition, the following tissues are sampled at baseline and after 2 weeks and 6 months on\n      therapy: 1) lymph node; 2) tonsillar; 3) perirectal lymphoid; 4) cerebrospinal fluid; 5) and\n      semen."
