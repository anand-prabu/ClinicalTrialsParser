            "textblock": "Introduction:\n\n      Lung aspiration is an inherent complication of the loss of protective upper airway reflexes\n      during general anesthesia. Its incidence is low in elective surgery, when preoperative\n      fasting rules have been complied and in absence of risk factors for regurgitation of gastric\n      contents. In emergency conditions, non-compliance with preoperative fasting rules and\n      delayed gastric emptying increase the risk of regurgitation and therefore lung aspiration of\n      gastric contents. In this context, a rapid sequence induction of anaesthesia is recommended\n      to minimize the risk of regurgitation which combines the use of short delay and short\n      duration of action anesthetics agents associated with the application of a Sellick maneuver.\n      The goal of this maneuver is to collapse the esophagus by compressing it between the cricoid\n      cartilage and the fifth cervical vertebra. Because of the low level of evidence supporting\n      the Sellick maneuver in the literature, this maneuver, remains controversial although\n      recommended.\n\n      Hypothesis: The aim of this study is to assess  the Sellick maneuver during rapid sequence\n      induction in adults (pregnant women excluded) by comparing the incidence of lung aspiration\n      whether this maneuver is applied or sham, in  a noninferiority trial.\n\n      Primary endpoint: Incidence of lung aspiration\n\n      Secondary endpoints: Cormack and Lehane Grade , frequency of difficult intubation, frequency\n      of impossible intubation, effect of releasing the Sellick maneuver on these three criteria,\n      frequency of aspiration pneumonia within  24 hours, frequency of complications due to the\n      Sellick maneuver (esophageal rupture and cricoid cartilage fracture rates) and mortality at\n      day 28 or at hospital discharge.\n\n      Methods: This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, non-inferiority trial. We compare\n      a group of patients benefiting from a rapid sequence induction without achieving the Sellick\n      maneuver, where the movement is fake (sham group) with a group of patients undergoing a\n      rapid sequence induction with effective execution of this maneuver (Sellick group). The two\n      patient groups differ only by the effective or sham application of the Sellick maneuver .\n\n      In both arms, the Sellick maneuver , whether real or fake , can be released at the request\n      of the person performing orotracheal intubation in particular to improve intubating\n      conditions or in case of active vomiting. However, it should be kept in case of need for\n      ventilation facemask.\n\n      Number of patients: The number of patients is estimated at 1 750 patients per group and so\n      3500 patients.\n\n      Inclusion criteria: patients older than 18 yr undergoing general anesthesia requiring rapid\n      sequence induction (full stomach or presence of at least one risk factor for regurgitation\n      of stomach content) are eligible.\n\n      Exclusion criteria:  patients non consenting, pregnancy, contraindication to Sellick\n      maneuver or succinylcholine, patients with predictive signs of bronchopneumonia during the\n      preanesthetic consultation, patients with pulmonary contusion, upper respiratory tract\n      abnormalities, laryngeal trauma, patients requiring an alternative to direct laryngoscopy,\n      patients with troubles of consciousness, use of plastic single used laryngoscopic blade, use\n      of rocuronium as neuromuscular blockade agent."
