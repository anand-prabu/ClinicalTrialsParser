Quantitative data will be obtained via two surveys: a patient survey to assess patients' feedback on the effectiveness of the communication during their hospital stay and their understanding of their medical care, and a provider survey to assess the handset's impact on the effectiveness of the communication. From this data we will be able to assess patient and provider communication effectiveness with both the current various practices at MSKCC and the new intervention."

            "textblock": "During the first 5-6 weeks of the study there will be no intervention and standard of care\n      will be conducted as usual practice by the medicine teams at MSKCC. It is expected that\n      during that time they will care for at least 20 LEP patients who meet our inclusion\n      criteria. There are no specific target numbers for any of the included languages. During the\n      following 5-6 weeks, the phones will be installed by the 10 house-staff teams and\n      approximately an additional 20 LEP patients who meet the protocol inclusion criteria will be\n      enrolled. Therefore, in the first half of this study about 20 LEP patients and 40\n      practitioners (two practitioners per LEP patient) will provide data and the same numbers\n      will account for the second half of the study after the intervention is instituted. There\n      will be no randomization of patients or physicians. The only data that will be analyzed are\n      those questions from the surveys to assess communication effectiveness with LEP patients.\n      The number of patients who are interviewed will depend on MSKCC inpatient census at the time\n      of study."
