The number of regions will vary with tumour volume in each patient, given the mean size of lesions in patients studied in a pilot set, it is envisaged that we will analyse 1-5 regions of interest in each tumour. The data will be analysed separately by 2 observers who will be blinded to the histopathological characteristics and assuming good inter-observer agreement, an average of their results will be used for data analysis. The difference in mean centile ADC values of the distribution and the skewness, kurtosis and entropy values between squamous vs. adenocarcinoma, well/moderately differentiated vs. poorly differentiated tumour regions and the absence vs. the presence of lymphovascular space invasion in that region will be determined.",
