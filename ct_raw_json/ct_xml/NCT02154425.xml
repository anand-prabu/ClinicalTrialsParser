  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess whether there is transfer of Certolizumab
      Pegol (CZP) into breast milk of lactating mothers who are receiving an established dosing
      regimen of CZP by evaluating the concentration of CZP in mature breast milk, and to
      calculate the infant daily dose of maternal CZP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will only include women who are receiving treatment with Certolizumab Pegol (CZP)
      for an approved indication in accordance with their treating physician, although this study
      is non-interventional regarding treatment with CZP, it is considered interventional due to
      the collection of breast milk from the lactating mothers.

    <description>Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be taken from  breast milk of lactating mothers on an established dosing regimen of CZP on Day 0 of the Sampling Period, just prior to next scheduled dose of CZP, and on Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 14, relative to CZP administration on Day 0. In addition, in mothers on a CZP Q4W dosing regimen, the concentration of CZP in breast milk will also be evaluated on or about Day 28 (ie, prior to and on the same day of the next scheduled administration of CZP).
Included are mothers who decided to continue on, or to start treatment with, Certolizumab Pegol (CZP) for an approved indication with their treating physician prior to participation into this study. The mother is responsible for procuring her own supply of commercial CZP. The CZP dose and administration schedule will be as per the locally approved label.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  An IRB/IEC approved written Informed Consent form for participation of the maternal
             subject and her infant (for collection of infant demographic and AE data) is signed
             and dated by the subject. Where applicable, the written Informed Consent form with
             respect to the infant is also signed and dated by the holder of parental rights as
             designated by the maternal subject

          -  Subject is considered reliable and capable of adhering to the protocol and visit
             schedule according to the judgment of the Investigator

             use during the Sampling Period as described per protocol

          -  Subject is at least 6 weeks postpartum

          -  Subject is on an established dosing regimen of CZP (at least the third dose of CZP
             since starting/restarting CZP)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is taking a prohibited medication or has taken a prohibited medication Note:

          -  Subject has history of breast implants, breast augmentation, or breast reduction
             surgery

          -  Subject has previously participated in this study

          -  Subject has participated in a study of an investigational medicinal product (IMP) (or
             a medical device) within the previous 30 days or 5 half-lives (whichever is longer)
             prior to Screening or is currently participating in another study of an IMP (or a
             medical device) unless the study is UCB UP0017 [NCT02019602]  or a registry study

          -  Subject has received treatment with any biological therapeutic agent, or other
             anti-TNF agents with the exception of CZP, within 5 half-lives prior to obtaining the
             first sample

          -  Subject has a positive or indeterminate QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD In Tube test at
             Screening. In case of indeterminate result, a retest is allowed if time permits; 2
             results of indeterminate require exclusion of the subject. Tuberculosis (TB) test
             results that have been obtained within the previous 60 days prior to Screening are
             acceptable (QuantiFERON®-TB GOLD or purified protein derivative [PPD] test)
