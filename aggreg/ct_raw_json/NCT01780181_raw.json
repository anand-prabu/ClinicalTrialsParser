            "textblock": "Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for approximately 80% of all lung cancer\n      diagnoses and more than 75% of the patients are diagnosed with an advanced stage. ASCO\n      guidelines recommended that elderly patients with advanced NSCLC use single-agent\n      chemotherapy. Nearly a decade of clinical trials showed that:the median survival time (MST)\n      of Vinorelbine is 5-10months,1-year survival rate is 32%;the MST of Gemcitabine is\n      6.8-9months,the MST of Taxol is 6.8-10.3months.Research had shown that TCM can prolong\n      long-term survival and improve QOL, but high-level evidence is desperately needed to support\n      this finding.\n\n      The investigators perform a multi-center, randomized, double-blind controlled, prospective\n      study in elderly patients with advanced NSCLC. Patients are randomized over observational\n      group (TCM granules plus single-agent chemotherapy), and control group (TCM placebo plus\n      single-agent chemotherapy). The investigators will observe 4 cycles and after that regular\n      follow-up will be arranged. The primary end point is: PFS (progression-free survival); the\n      secondary end points are: (1) OS(overall survival); (2) Objective response rate; (3)\n      TTP(Time-to-Progression); (4) QOL (EORTC QLQ-L43, TCM syndrome score); (5) other end points\n      are: Toxicity, side effects and security of the treatments will be assessed at the same\n      time. The investigators expect that integrated TCM combined with chemotherapy has a better\n      efficacy on prolonging PFS, OS, improving QOL, reducing the adverse reaction of patients\n      than that of chemotherapy.Therefore our study can provide evidences for optimizing and\n      promoting integrated TCM combined with Western Medicine treatment."
