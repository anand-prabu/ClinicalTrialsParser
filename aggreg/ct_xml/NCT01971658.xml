  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III, multicenter, prospective with a clinical benefit, open-label and
      randomized study to compare two different treatments : Velcade (Bortezomib) Thalidomide
      Dexamethasone (VTD) versus Velcade (Bortezomib) Cyclophosphamide Dexamethasone (VCD) as an
      Induction Treatment prior to Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation in patients with Newly
      Diagnosed Multiple Myeloma.

      Eligible patients will be randomized into 2 treatment arms. Each patient will receive 4
      consecutive 21 day cycles of an induction treatment with either VTD or VCD.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The patient population will consist of adult men and women who have a confirmed diagnosis of
      Multiple Myeloma and who meet eligibility criteria. They will be recruited from among the
      patients consulting in an investigating centre's haematology service for newly diagnosed,
      symptomatic, untreated multiple myeloma.

      in each treatment arm there will be :

        1. Induction therapy : 4 cycles of VTD (21 days)or VCD

        2. Systematic stem cell harvest after cycle 3
