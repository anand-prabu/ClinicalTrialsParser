It is not known whether they intervene with surgical\n      stress response increasing the rate of postoperative complications.\n\n      Method: Un-blinded prospective, non-interventional cohort single centre study including all\n      the patients with Crohn's disease and Ulcerative Colitis undergoing abdominal surgery.\n      Immunological and endocrinological  parameters will measured in blood samples taken from\n      these patients before and after surgery. Power calculations showed that 17 patients in each\n      arm are needed."
