            "textblock": "Early detection of rejection is a major focus of organ transplant care. The use of\n      aggressive immunosuppressive therapy has been shown to alter the prognosis of heart\n      transplant patients who have acute rejection. There are many modalities utilized in the\n      routine surveillance of cardiac transplant patients, each with limitations. Screening\n      transthoracic echocardiography focusing on indices of systolic and diastolic dysfunction,\n      along with regional wall abnormalities, has been shown to have poor sensitivity and does not\n      effectively discriminate between patients with and without rejection. Newer\n      echocardiographic parameters including myocardial performance or diastolic velocity indices\n      may be a better means of detecting subtle changes in cardiac function in the setting of\n      heart transplant, but these tools are most helpful after the insult caused by rejection has\n      already occurred. Hemodynamic changes measured during cardiac catheterization have also been\n      evaluated as a means of detecting rejection. Rosenthal et al found that although there were\n      statistically significant differences between patients with higher or lower grades of\n      rejection scores, cardiac catheterization did not permit effective discrimination of\n      patients with moderate to severe rejection. Cardiac biomarkers, including c-reactive\n      protein, brain natriuretic peptides, and troponin, have been studied as non-invasive\n      measures of determining cardiac dysfunction or rejection. These surrogates are weakly\n      associated with different rejection grades on biopsy and have a poor predictive capacity for\n      biopsy-detected rejection. Recently, Microarray technology has been used to screen for genes\n      expressed in cardiac allograft rejection using peripheral leukocytes from blood samples\n      obtained at the time of endomyocardial biopsy. This technique was shown to have a high\n      negative predictive value for the diagnosis of acute cellular rejection but it is unable to\n      detect low grades of rejection. Overall, these technologies are limited in the ability to\n      consistently and accurately predict the presence of rejection and have low positive\n      predictive values when compared to biopsy.\n\n      The current gold standard in detection of rejection is the use of endomyocardial biopsy.\n      Attaining these samples is invasive and long term repeated central venous access can be\n      difficult. Risk of endomyocardial biopsy includes perforation leading to cardiac tamponade,\n      arrhythmias including atrial fibrillation, pneumothorax, hemothorax, and valvular\n      regurgitation secondary to rupture of chordae or damage to valve leaflets themselves. There\n      is variability in pathological interpretation of histologic grades, especially at higher\n      grades of rejection due to the difficulty in interpretation of nodular infiltrates. The\n      revised International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) grading system has\n      simplified the grading system of cellular rejection and now includes assessment of antibody\n      mediated rejection. This may improve the utility of endomyocardial biopsy, but much\n      controversy still exists on the method of grading rejection and its clinical implications.\n      Thus, the development of a noninvasive, relatively inexpensive method that accurately\n      predicts the presence of rejection is critical.\n\n      Detection of donor deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) after transplantation has been proposed as a\n      means of detecting acute rejection in solid organ transplant patients, however there are\n      significant barriers to detection and quantification on the sub-1 % level. Lo et al found\n      that donor-specific DNA sequences were present in the plasma of liver and kidney transplant\n      patients. Gadi et al detected soluble donor-specific DNA in patients who received\n      pancreas-kidney transplants. In addition, in a single pancreas-kidney transplant recipient\n      they demonstrated increased levels of donor specific DNA during a rejection episode. Garcia\n      Moreira et al identified donor-specific cell free DNA in the serum and urine sample of renal\n      transplant patients. They reported analysis by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\n      with marked increases of total cell-free DNA during episodes of acute rejection. Hubacek et\n      al established the presence of donor DNA in recipient plasma in small concentrations in\n      cardiac transplant patients. However, at their levels of detection, they observed\n      significant background problems. They postulated the need for multiple markers to avoid this\n      contamination.\n\n      Pediatric liver transplantation has advanced significantly over the last 20 years. One year\n      patient and graft survival following liver transplant in pediatric recipients is\n      approximately 95% due to advances in surgical technique, anesthesia, critical care, and\n      immunosuppression. Despite these advancements, rejection remains a significant problem and\n      will occur in up to 30% of recipients during their first year after transplant. The current\n      gold standard for diagnosing rejection is a liver biopsy. Although multiple serum markers of\n      liver function are followed after transplantation, none have been definitively associated\n      with rejection. Liver biopsy is an invasive procedure, often requiring general anesthesia in\n      infants and small children, and is associated with multiple potential complications\n      including bleeding, pneumothorax, bowel perforation and even death. The frequency of these\n      complications varies from 10 - 20% depending on the publication. Consequently, the\n      development of a serum marker for rejection after pediatric liver transplant is critical and\n      could lead to a significant improvement in patient safety as well as quality of care.\n\n      Donor specific cell free DNA (dsCFDNA) has been demonstrated in the serum of both liver and\n      kidney recipients following transplantation. These investigators originally speculated that\n      the concentration of donor DNA in the recipient's plasma may be a marker for rejection.\n\n      Recent data has suggested that cell-free DNA increases with rejection in renal transplant\n      recipients. No data exists to our knowledge regarding dsCFDNA following liver\n      transplantation.\n\n      As in other transplanted organs biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosing rejection\n      following renal transplant. Although renal biopsy is a safe procedure, it is costly and is\n      not without risk. Development of a noninvasive biomarker of allograft status is an important\n      objective in transplantation."
