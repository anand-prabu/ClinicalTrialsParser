      This randomized trial, nicknamed the COMFORT (Cognitive therapy or Mindfulness FOR Treatment
      of pvd) study, will compare the effects of an 8-session group Mindfulness-based Cognitive
      Therapy (MBCT) to an 8-session group Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) for women with
      provoked vestibulodynia (PVD).  Women with PVD will be randomly assigned to attend either
      eight sessions of group MBCT or CBT. Each session is 2.25 hours long and spaced 1 week
      apart. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the 8-session MBCT intervention for
      PVD is more efficacious than an 8-session CBT intervention for decreasing women's pain
      intensity, sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain.

      PURPOSE:

      The purpose of this study is to determine whether an 8-session MBCT intervention for PVD is
      more efficacious than an 8-session CBT intervention for improving women's pain intensity and
      reducing their sexual distress, catastrophizing and hypervigilance towards pain. The
      investigators will also examine whether pain improvements at follow-up are mediated by
      changes in self-compassion and mindfulness (in the MBCT arm only) and moderated by
      pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety sensitivity.

      HYPOTHESES:

        1. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in vestibular pain intensity
           compared to women in the CBT arm.

        2. At follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment), women in the MBCT arm
           will experience a greater decline (vs. pre-treatment) in sex-related distress, pain
           catastrophizing, hypervigilance, and self-reported pain during intercourse/other
           penetrative sex compared to women in the CBT arm.

        3. The investigators hypothesize that improvements in pain intensity during vestibular
           touch will be mediated by changes in self-compassion and mindfulness in the MBCT arm
           only at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        4. The investigators hypothesize that pre-treatment credibility, personality, and anxiety
           sensitivity will significantly moderate improvements in pain intensity during
           vestibular touch at 6 and 12 months follow-up.

        5. The investigators hypothesize improvements in both arms on the &quot;Patient Global
           Impression of Change Scale&quot; and significantly greater improvements in the MBCT arm
           relative to the CBT arm at follow-up (4 weeks, 6 months and 12 months post-treatment).

    <description>The investigators have selected pain intensity during a controlled examination as the primary endpoint in this study. Specifically, pain intensity at the vulvar vestibule will be assessed  using a vulvalgesiometer (Pukall et al., 2004, 2007). The vulvalgesiometer is an instrument that provides a measure of pain/sensitivity that can be standardized across time points. The vulvalgesiometer is calibrated to exert a fixed amount of pressure. In this study, 30 grams of pressure at the 1, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, and 11 o'clock positions (randomly) around the vestibule will be applied using the vulvalgestiometer. Women will also report their pain at each site using a numeric rating scale from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain ever).</description>
