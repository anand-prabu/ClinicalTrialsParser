The overall goal of the study is to examine the extent to which the\n      comprehensive, systematic intervention reduces childhood obesity among underserved children.\n\n      The clinical intervention implements evidence-based interventions each city's\n      federally-qualified community health center. Intervention components aim to improve primary\n      and secondary prevention of childhood obesity and implement changes at four levels:\n      clinician; parent-family; organizational; and environmental. We additionally provide\n      training and educational materials to other pediatric clinicians in the two communities.
