The effects of Intralipid in\n      suppressing natural killer cell activity (NKa) were found to be comparable to intravenous\n      immunoglobulin (IVIG) by laboratory experiments.We will study the effect of intralipid\n      infusion on the pregnancy outcome of women aged 35-40 years with history of repeated\n      implantation failure of miscarriage and who have positive peripheral blood natural killer\n      cells"
