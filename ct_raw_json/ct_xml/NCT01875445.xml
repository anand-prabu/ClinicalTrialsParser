  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of inositol for the
      treatment of compulsive hair pulling, also known as trichotillomania. Inositol is used for
      diabetic nerve pain, panic disorder, high cholesterol, insomnia, cancer, depression,
      schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism,
      promoting hair growth, a skin disorder called psoriasis, and treating side effects of
      medical treatment with some medications, including lithium. The hypothesis to be tested is
      that Inositol will be effective and well tolerated in patients with trichotillomania
      compared to placebo. The proposed study will provide needed data on the treatment of the
      disabling disorder that currently lacks a clearly effective treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pathological hair-pulling, trichotillomania, has been defined as repetitive, intentionally
      performed pulling that causes noticeable hair loss and results in clinically significant
      distress or functional impairment (1). Trichotillomania appears relatively common with an
      estimated prevalence between 1-3% (2). Data on the pharmacological treatment of
      trichotillomania is limited to case reports and conflicting double-blind studies of
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (3).

      Inositol is used for diabetic nerve pain, panic disorder, high cholesterol, insomnia,
      cancer, depression, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, attention deficit-hyperactivity
      disorder (ADHD), autism, promoting hair growth, a skin disorder called psoriasis, and
      treating side effects of medical treatment with some medications, including lithium. A small
      study (n=3) found that subject's showed improvement while taking Inositol in both
      trichotillomania and pathological skin picking (4). This suggests that Inositol might be
      effective in treating a large sample of subjects with trichotillomania and it also suggests
      that it may be effective for impulse control disorders in general. Inositol has also been
      shown to be effective in treating obsessive compulsive disorder  and showed significantly
      lower scores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (5). Both studies indicate the
      effectiveness of Inositol in treating impulsivity and compulsivity in subjects. There is no
      medication approved by the Food and Drug Administration for trichotillomania. Inositol
      represents a potentially safe and effective treatment.
