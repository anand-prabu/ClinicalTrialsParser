             RoActemra/Actemra treatment in monotherapy in accordance with the local label and the
             reimbursement criteria indicating that RoActemra/Actemra can be given in monotherapy
             in case of methotrexate intolerance or where continued treatment with methotrexate is
             inappropriate; this can include patients who have received RoActemra/Actemra

             compassionate use

          -  Patients receiving concomitant DMARD treatment for rheumatoid arthritis at baseline
             (e.g. hydroxychloroquine, sulfasalazine, methotrexate, leflunomide, gold compounds,

          -  Patients who have received treatment with an investigational agent within 4 weeks (or
             5 half-lives of the investigational agent, whichever is longer) before starting
             treatment with RoActemra/Actemra
