The investigators will study the feasibility of a novel treatment for women\n      with Provoked Localized Vulvodynia (PLV) with acupuncture and 5% lidocaine cream. Lidocaine\n      is a numbing agent and common first treatment for this disorder. Acupuncture is a treatment\n      commonly used for other pain disorders. The investigators will compare two types of\n      acupuncture (classical and non-classical) as a treatment for PLV, in addition to 5%\n      lidocaine cream. Researchers want to determine if acupuncture is acceptable and convenient\n      to women with PLV. The investigators hypothesize that classical acupuncture and 5% lidocaine\n      cream will be better than non-classical acupuncture and 5% lidocaine cream to decrease PLV\n      pain."
