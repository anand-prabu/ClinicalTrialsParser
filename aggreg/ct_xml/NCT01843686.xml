  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will demonstrate the safety of the application of autologous platelet rich plasma
      (PRP) gel following excision and autologous skin grafting of acute deep 2nd and 3rd degree
      burns. The study will be a randomized, double-blinded controlled safety study. Investigators
      expect that the PRP will deliver improved hemostasis and growth factors at the wound site
      thus increasing the effectiveness of treatment at the wound site. This will lead to rapid
      production and delivery of an autologous therapy that should minimize additional morbidity
      to the patient.

      The goal of this study is to demonstrate the safety of the application of autologous
      platelet rich plasma (PRP) gel following excision and autologous skin grafting of acute deep
      2nd and 3rd degree burns. This treatment is intended to stimulate rapid healing and improve
      the outcome of standard of care treatments for burns common to active duty military
      personnel, and more broadly for treatment of all acute burns. The care is specific to
      excision and split thickness skin grafting in the context of this burn study. The study will
      enroll 42 patients receiving surgical management of acute 2nd and 3rd degree burns requiring
      excision and skin grafting. The patient's total body surface area burn injury should not
      exceed 20%. The study will be conducted for 12 months. This study will provide further
      information for the development of enhanced treatment of wound-deployable cellular therapy
      for advanced trauma care of burned warriors.
