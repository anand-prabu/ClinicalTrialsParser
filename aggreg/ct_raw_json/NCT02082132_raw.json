By doing this we hope to identify cases of MODY\n      (maturity onset diabetes of the young), which is a rare genetic cause of diabetes that is\n      frequently misdiagnosed. Identifying MODY cases is important, as the treatment may differ to\n      conventional treatment for type 1 or type 2 diabetes."
