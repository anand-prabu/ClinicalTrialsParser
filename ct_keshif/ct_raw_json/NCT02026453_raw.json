The interventions will target elderly and chronically ill patients prone\n      to erroneous medication histories and resultant medication errors. For targeted patients, we\n      will test the effect of using pharmacists and pharmacy technicians to obtain an initial\n      medication history. This will be studied using a randomized controlled trial of usual care\n      (which involves nurses and physicians) vs usual care + pharmacists vs usual care + pharmacy\n      technicians to obtain an admission medication history.\n\n      Our overarching hypothesis is that by leveraging pharmacists and pharmacy technicians we can\n      minimize admission medication history errors and related downstream events."
