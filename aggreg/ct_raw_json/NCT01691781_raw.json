The principal investigator, and other investigators, have previously shown\n      that inhibiting the RAAS may lower PTH.  The current study will focus on:\n\n        1. Normal Physiology: Does an ACEi (which lowers angiotensin II and aldosterone) reduce\n           PTH in normal individuals?\n\n        2. Pathophysiology: Does an ACEi reduce PTH in individuals with primary\n           hyperparathyroidism?\n\n      The results of this study may have important implications for cardiovascular and skeletal\n      health, as both the RAAS and PTH have been implicated as mediators of these conditions."
