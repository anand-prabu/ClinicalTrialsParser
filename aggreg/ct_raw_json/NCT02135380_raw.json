            "textblock": "Despite intense research efforts and clinical trials, there is still no effective treatment\n      that can prolong the survival of patients with IPF. Conventional therapeutic approach\n      includes combination of corticosteroids, anti-oxidants, immunodepressants and immune\n      modulatory anti-fibrotic agents to be discontinued 20 days before screening. The only, so\n      far, therapeutic approach that has been proven effective in terms of prolonging patient's\n      survival is lung transplantation. Nonetheless, not all the patients with IPF are eligible\n      for lung transplantation; there is a significant proportion of these patients that finally\n      succumb while waiting in a lung transplantation list. Therefore, there is critical need for\n      more effective and reliable therapeutic modalities5. Adult Stem Cells (ASCs) seem to\n      represent one of these. Therefore, it is conceivable to assume that adult-stem cells can be\n      easily and safely be applied as a novel therapeutic agent in chronic and fatal lung\n      diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and IPF.\n\n      Therefore, there is an urgent need to provide a safe, effective and affordable treatment\n      option for IPF patients. New diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic strategies need to be\n      developed to reduce the burden of IPF. Given the present lack of appropriate treatment\n      adjunctive in the therapy of IPF, adipose derived stromal vascular fraction provides new\n      opportunities for development of the same.\n\n      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary\n      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic\n      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules\n      involved with cell attachment to neighbouring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This\n      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to\n      mesenchymal tissue.14\n\n      As limited clinical information is available about use of SVF and MSC in the IPF patients\n      hence this Open Label, Prospective, Randomized multi center comparative study has been\n      undertaken to explore the tolerability & effectiveness of SVF in one treatment arm and MSC\n      in second treatment arm in IPF patients.\n\n      Adipose derived stromal vascular fraction and Mesenchymal Stem Cells has been found in\n      preclinical studies to be safe and effective"

            "textblock": "Adipose Derived Stromal Vascular Fraction (ADSVF) Stromal Vascular Fraction (SVF) obtained\n      from tumescent liposuction. The SVF contains a variety of cells such as pre-adipocytes,\n      endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, pericytes, fibroblasts, and adult stem cells (ASCs).\n      In addition, the SVF also contains blood cells from the capillaries supplying the fat cells.\n      These include erythrocytes or red blood cells, B and T cells, macrophages, monocytes, mast\n      cells, natural killer (NK) cells, hematopoietic stem cells  and endothelial progenitor\n      cells, to name a few. It also contains growth factors such as transforming growth factor\n      beta (TGF-\u03b2), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and fibroblast growth factor (FGF),\n      among others. This is consistent with the secretions of cells in the presence of an\n      extracellular matrix. The SVF also contains the various proteins present in the adipose\n      tissue extracellular matrix of which laminin is of interest due to its ability to help in\n      neural regeneration.Entire procedure for SVF preparation and isolation of SVF cells will be\n      carried out in cGMP compliance clean room.\n\n      Pure stromal vascular fraction to the tune of 99% will be isolated for this clinical trial\n      eliminating other unnecessary cells such as RBC and leukocytes.\n\n      Adipose Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells (ADMSC) Human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are\n      present as a rare population of cells in adipose tissue which is almost 30-40% of the\n      nucleated cells, but they can rapidly grow in culture without losing their stemness. MSCs\n      can be expanded in vitro \u2265 2 million -fold and retain their ability to differentiate into\n      several mesenchymal lineages. MSCs have several characteristics such as Ease of isolation,\n      High expansion potential,Genetic stability,Reproducible attributes from isolate to\n      isolate,Reproducible characteristics, Compatibility with tissue engineering principles,\n      Potential to enhance repair in many vital tissues, Uniform dose and Better quality control\n      and release criteria.\n\n      Beside autologous use MSC can also be used for allogenic therapy. Several studies have used\n      allo-MSC in vivo and experience suggests that the allo-MSCs are not rejected and many have\n      positive effects on engraftment.MSC's can be isolated from various tissues, cultured ex\n      vivo, and expanded many fold.18 Cultured-expanded MSC's appear to represent a homogeneous\n      population by flow cytometric measures of cell-surface markers. These cell retain the\n      ability to undergo in vitro differentiation to osteogenic, adipogenic and chondrogenic\n      lineages, even when clonally expanded.19 Human adipose tissue derived MSCs are capable of\n      differentiating into endothelial cells in vitro and later form capillary-like structures in\n      semisolid medium and suggest differentiation potential of MSCs is not restricted to\n      mesodermal lineages but also transdifferentiation of MSCs into other lineages like\n      endothelial could be realized in vitro and in vivo8 MSCs are known to give rise to limb-bud\n      mesoderm (osteoblasts,  chondrocytes, adipocytes, stroma cells, and skeletal myoblasts) and\n      can also differentiate into cells of visceral mesoderm (endothelial cells).9 MSCs can\n      facilitate  vasculogenesis by increasing vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels.\n      After MSCs are intramyocardially injected into the infarct zone, local VEGF levels rise,\n      vascular density and regional blood flow increases, and contractility improves.\n\n      MSCs are having anti-fibrotic activity and hence may be excellent source to tackle pulmonary\n      fibrosis and hence could be explored for their therapeutic potential for treating Idiopathic\n      pulmonary fibrosis. MSC's also display membrane-bound and insoluble secreted molecules\n      involved with cell attachment to neighboring cells and to the extra cellular matrix.18 This\n      cell surface configuration may enable mesenchymal stem cells to home from bloodstream to\n      mesenchymal tissue."
