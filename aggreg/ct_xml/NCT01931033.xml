      This study is an 8-week open-label trial testing oxytocin nasal spray (Syntocinon) as a
      treatment for social impairment in adolescents with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We
      hypothesize that oxytocin nasal spray will be safe, tolerable, and effective in improving
      the core symptoms of autism spectrum disorders in adolescents ages 11-17.
