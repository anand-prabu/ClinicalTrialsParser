            "textblock": "Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) affects 151,000 children and adolescents in the United\n      States. Youth with T1DM are at a high risk for multiple psychosocial co-morbidities\n      including poor health related quality of life (HRQoL) which is linked to medication\n      non-compliance and increased risk for diabetes-related complications. Any reduction in the\n      psychosocial adjustment difficulties related to T1DM could improve the medical outcome of\n      children with T1DM.\n\n      Current standards for diabetes management reflect the need to maintain glucose control\n      within a normal range. However, numerous reports indicate that normalization of blood\n      glucose levels is seldom attainable in children and adolescents. Family cohesion, positive\n      coping strategies, younger age of onset, social support and adequate self-regulatory\n      behavior are found to favorably influence glycemic control. One may conclude that the\n      presence of a companion animal, capable of enhancing the positive factors named above, would\n      augment the array of tools available for the successful management of chronic illnesses such\n      as T1DM.\n\n      There is a lack of studies assessing the impact of pet ownership on the health and\n      well-being of adolescents. The process of caring for, loving and being loved by a companion\n      animal could offer direct and/or indirect benefits to the HRQoL in children with T1DM. To\n      the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies examining the impact of pet ownership on\n      glycemic control and HRQoL in youth with T1DM."
