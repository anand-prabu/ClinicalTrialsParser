  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if MEDI4736 will be adequately tolerated in
      combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation, and dose expansion study of MEDI4736 in
      combination with tremelimumab to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetic (PK),
      immunogenicity, and antitumor activity of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in adult
      subjects with advanced NSCLC.

    <description>To determine the maximum tolerated dose of MEDI4736 in combination with tremelimumab in subjects with advanced NSCLC. The primary endpoint is the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) which is the highest dose within a cohort where no more than 1 out of 6 subjects experience dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) or the highest protocol-defined dose for each agent in the absence of exceeding the MTD. The primary endpoints for safety assessment include adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), laboratory evaluations, vital signs, physical examinations, and electrocardiogram (ECG) results.</description>

    <description>The endpoints for assessment of immunogenicity of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab include the number and percentage of subjects who develop detectable anti-drug antibodies (ADAs).</description>

    <description>The endpoints for assessment of antitumor activity include objective response (OR) and disease control (DC), based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guidelines v1.1 with modifications, duration of response (DoR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).</description>

    <description>The endpoints for assessment of PK of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab include individual MEDI4736 and tremelimumab concentrations in serum, and PK parameters including peak concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve (AUC), clearance (CL), and half-life (t½).</description>

    <description>To evaluate the effect of MEDI4736 and tremelimumab on patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in the dose-expansion phase. Patient-reported outcomes as measured by the pain questionnaire, EORTC QLQ-C30, and NSCLC-specific modules will be summarized descriptively; the change from baseline for domain, subscale scores, and individual items by treatment cohort at each time point and change from baseline will be explored.</description>
