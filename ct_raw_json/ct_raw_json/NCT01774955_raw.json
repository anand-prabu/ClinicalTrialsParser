Data concerning patients' demographic, clinical/procedural\n      characteristics and contraindications/special warnings and precautions to P2Y12 inhibitors\n      are collected during initial hospitalization. Study involves 3 follow-up visits after\n      hospital discharge(Day 30, at 6 months and at 12 months) where data on major adverse cardiac\n      events (death, myocardial infarction, stroke, urgent revascularization procedure with PCI or\n      CABG), bleeding events(according to Bleeding Academic Research Consortium criteria)and\n      adherence to antiplatelet treatment are collected.\n\n      In patients under ticagrelor or prasugrel treatment, platelet reactivity measurement with\n      VerifyNow assay will be performed at Day 30"
