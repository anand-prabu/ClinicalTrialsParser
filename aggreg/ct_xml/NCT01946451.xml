  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of selected genes both in
      epiretinal membranes (ERMs) and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from patients
      with primary and secondary epiretinal membranes in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.
      Possible correlations between messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) levels of these genes were
      also identified.

        Study population description:

        The blood and ERM samples were obtained from patients treated in the Department of
        Ophthalmology, University Hospital No. 5, Medical University of Silesia, Katowice, Poland.

        All subjects underwent a complete ophthalmic examination: best corrected visual acuity
        (BCVA), tonometry, slit lamp examination of anterior and posterior segment, optical
        coherence tomography (OCT) of the central retina.
