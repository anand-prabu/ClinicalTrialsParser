Placental samples were collected from a subset (n=132) of these pregnant\n      teens and these tissues will be analyzed using genome wide microarray of messenger\n      ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) related to inflammatory processes. A separate\n      group of pregnant adolescents (n=140) will be recruited at entry into prenatal care for a\n      vitamin D supplementation trial. Teens will be randomly assigned to one of two supplements\n      (200 IU D3/d vs. 2000 IU D3/d). Similar to the retrospective analysis, maternal calciotropic\n      hormones and inflammatory cytokines will be assessed at entry into the study, mid-gestation\n      (23-28 weeks) and at delivery. Inflammatory processes and infections reported across\n      pregnancy will be evaluated in relation to vitamin D status and inflammatory markers."
