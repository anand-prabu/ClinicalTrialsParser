  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At Saint-Antoine's hospital, in CETD a multidisciplinary team takes care of patients with
      chronic pain. Free-drug techniques are available to reduce their consumption of analgesics.
      This study is to assess the relief obtained by the simultaneous combination of these two
      techniques: transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation and hypnosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pain management centers, patients with chronic pain are supported by a
      multidisciplinary team. To optimize and reduce drug intake of analgesics, additional
      techniques (hypnosis, relaxation, cognitive behavioral therapy) and non-drug practices
      (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) are offered to patients.

      These techniques are most frequently performed by nurses and are used either separately or
      successively. The time interval during what the patient could expect pain relief is not
      known.

      The hypothesis of the study is that simultaneous practice of two complementary therapies
      (transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) + hypnosis) decreases the intensity of
      pain in patients with chronic no cancer pain, nociceptive and/or neuropathic pain compared
      to practice of only one complementary therapy (TENS).

      This study is an open randomized trial, comparative in two parallel groups (TENS versus TENS
      and hypnosis).

      Trial design will be explained by the pain management center doctor. Inclusion and
      randomization performed by the nurse: group with TENS/group with TENS and hypnosis.

      The patients will be followed up 8 times between day 0 and day180. Patients benefit from
      eight visits from day 0th to day 180th. Evaluations are EVA at each visit, SF36
      questionnaires and score PGIC at one month, three and six months after the beginning of the
      strategy.

    <description>The pain assessment is processed using a Visual Analog Scale (VAS), graduated from 0 to 100mm.
The patient is asked to move a cursor on a line to reflect the severity of his/her pain. The left end indicates &quot;no pain&quot;, the right one shows &quot;the most intense pain you can imagine&quot;.
On the other side, graduations are only seen by the caregiver. The pain intensity is read on this side, rated in millimetres.</description>

    <description>These two scales are self-assessment, exploring physical, emotional and social health.
They allow pain impact assessment or professional activities, leisure activities and everyday life.
The final aim is to identify if patients could recover their usual activity faster in one arm of the study versus the other one.</description>
