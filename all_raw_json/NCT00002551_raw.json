Compare the overall and relapse free survival of patients with stage II or\n      III rectal cancer treated with one of the following three regimens: bolus injections of\n      fluorouracil (5-FU) prior to and following pelvic irradiation plus protracted venous\n      infusion (PVI) 5-FU radiosensitization vs PVI 5-FU prior to and following pelvic irradiation\n      plus PVI 5-FU radiosensitization vs bolus 5-FU with leucovorin calcium and levamisole prior\n      to and following pelvic irradiation. II. Describe relapse patterns and tolerance associated\n      with these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to type\n      of prior surgery (abdominoperineal resection vs anterior resection), nodal status (N0 vs N1\n      vs N2-3), depth of tumor invasion (T1-2 vs T3 vs T4a vs T4b), time from surgery to study\n      entry (20-45 days vs 46-70 days), participating center, and performance status (0-1 vs 2).\n      Patients are randomized to one of three treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive fluorouracil\n      (5-FU) IV on days 1-5 and 29-33. 5-FU is then given as a continuous infusion beginning on\n      day 57 and continuing concurrently with radiotherapy for 5 weeks. Following a 28 day break\n      from treatment patients receive 5-FU IV on days 1-5 of a 28 day course. Postradiotherapy\n      treatment repeats for a total of 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive 5-FU IV continuously on days 1-42. 5-FU and\n      radiotherapy are then administered as in arm II. Arm III: Patients receive leucovorin\n      calcium (CF) IV followed by 5-FU IV on days 1-5 and 29-33. Patients also receive oral\n      levamisole twice daily on days 1-3, 15-17, 29-31, and 43-45. CF IV and 5-FU IV are then\n      given on days 57-60 and 85-88 concurrently with radiotherapy. Following a 28 day break from\n      treatment patients receive CF IV and 5-FU IV on days 1-5 and 29-33 and oral levamisole twice\n      daily on days 1-3, 15-17, 29-31, and 43-45 in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. All patients receive radiotherapy 5 days per week for 5 weeks\n      starting on day 57. Patients are followed every 4 months for 2 years, then every 6 months\n      for 4 years, and then annually until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1,800 patients (600 per arm) will be accrued for this study."
