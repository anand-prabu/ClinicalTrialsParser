It has important\n      physical and psychological consequences/impact in those patients.\n\n      Premature ovarian failure (POF) is currently managed by non-physiological sex steroid\n      regimens which are inadequate at optimizing uterine characteristics.\n\n      Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) and human cord blood mononuclear cells\n      (hCBMNCs) have been shown to have the ability to modulate the immune response and enhance\n      angiogenesis, suggesting the novel and promising therapeutic strategy for POF.\n\n      In this study, the safety and efficacy of hUCMSCs and hCBMNCs transplantation combined with\n      Hormone Replacement Therapy will be evaluated in patients with Premature Ovarian Failure.\n      Participants will be followed for an expected average of 48 weeks."
