  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine the effectiveness of a drug called Vidaza (azacitidine) giving in
      inhalation form. To be eligible for the study, patients must have advanced stage non-small
      cell lung cancer, and must have received at least one prior chemotherapy or targeted therapy
      for their cancer.

      Potential patients will go through screening process. Routine laboratory tests, CT scans,
      pulmonary function tests and a bronchoscopy will be performed.

      Eligible patients will take inhaled vidaza in the clinic daily, Monday to Friday, every
      other week. After first cycle of treatment patients will get repeated bronchoscopy. Patients
      will continue on study treatment until disease progression.

      A total of 36 patients will take part in this study.
