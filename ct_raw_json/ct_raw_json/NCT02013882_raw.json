The current wash-in protocols are\n      complicated and time consuming. We propose a new 1-1-12 desflurane wash-in protocol which is\n      more simple and predictable.\n\n      The objective of this study is to identify time to achieve alveolar concentration of\n      desflurane at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6% with 1-1-12 wash-in protocol.\n\n      All patients will receive iv propofol 2 mg/kg as induction agent and succinyl choline 1.5\n      mg/kg for intubation. Then the ventilation will be controlled to achieve end-tidal CO2 30-35\n      mmHg with O2:N2O 1:1 L/min with desflurane 12%. Time to achieve alveolar concentration of\n      desflurane at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6% will be recorded and analyzed. After that, the\n      concentration of desflurane and anesthetic technique will be adjusted to requirement of\n      anesthesiologist."
