  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether noninvasive electrical stimulation at
      acupuncture points (NESAP) and/or 24% sucrose is effective in reducing pain in infants
      during invasive procedures.

      The investigators hypothesize that:

        -  Gentle noninvasive electrical stimulation at selected acupuncture points and/or oral
           use of 24% sucrose with pacifier will reduce the newborn infant's responses to
           heelstick pain, as measured by the Premature Infant Pain Profile (PIPP), heart rate
           variability, duration of crying, and salivary cortisol levels.

        -  The effects of combined therapies will be additive.

        -  The analgesic effects of NESAP and/or sucrose will continue for the duration of the
           heelstick, reflected by the first two minutes of heelstick and the first two minutes of
           recovery.

      A collaborative prospective, double-blind, randomized trial will be performed at the
      University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences Hospital (Little Rock, AR), and Lucille Packard
      Children's Hospital (Palo Alto, CA).  After obtaining IRB approval at both sites and
      parental consent, newborn infants less than 3 days of age who require heelsticks for
      clinical blood sampling will be randomized in a 2 × 2 factorial trial design to four groups:
      standard pain management with pacifier and water, Non−invasive Electrical Stimulation of
      Acupuncture Points (NESAP) with pacifier and water, 24% oral sucrose solution with pacifier,
      or NESAP plus oral sucrose solution and pacifier prior to their heelstick.

      We will study the pain response to the heelstick routinely used to obtain blood for term
      neonatal infants by enrolling up to 192 infants, 96 from University of Arkansas for Medical
      Sciences and 96 from Lucille Packard Children's Hospital. This number will allow for screen
      failures and withdrawals. A minimum of 164 infants collectively from both sites is required
      to complete the study.  Infants will be divided into 4 experimental groups:

        1. Group A: Sham (fake electrical stimulation) plus sugar water with pacifier before
           heelstick.

        2. Group B: Electrical stimulation plus water with pacifier before heelstick.

        3. Group C: Electrical stimulation plus sugar water with pacifier before heelstick.

        4. Group D: Sham (fake electrical stimulation) plus water with pacifier before heelstick.

      Electrical stimulation will be applied at appropriate acupuncture points using a very low
      current for 10 minutes, routine for procedural pain.  The response to pain will be assessed
      using a pain scale, heart rate, heart rate variability and oxygen saturation changes,
      duration of crying, and changes in salivary cortisol levels.

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>The PIPP score includes assessment of contextual, physiological, and behavioral parameters and has been extensively validated for pain assessment in preterm and term infants. PIPP scores will be given at baseline before initiation of the TENS unit, every 30 seconds for two minutes after the TENS unit is turned on, every 30 seconds for the first two minutes of the heel stick and heel squeeze and every 30 seconds for two minutes following the procedure during the recovery phase.
Behavioral portion of PIPP score: facial expressions are videotaped and analyzed throughout the process to give a score for the behavioral portion of the PIPP. Physiologic portion of PIPP score: Oxygen saturation levels and heart rates are recorded at baseline and then continuously throughout initiation of the TENS unit and the heel stick procedure.</description>

    <description>Salivary cortisol will be obtained prior to initiation of heelstick procedure, and at 5±0.5 minutes after procedure by gentle insertion in the mouth of a soft applicator (Salimetrics Infant Swab).

    <description>Electrical stimulation will be administered via the Empi Select, a  standard TENS  unit.  To produce analgesia, small electrodes will be placed in treatment groups on the baby's legs at specific acupuncture points: ZuSanLi (ST36), SanYinJiao (SP6), Shen Mai (Bl60), and Shui Quan (KI3)46.  StimCare electrodes with a gel base will be applied to the skin ; the skin will not be punctured by these procedures.  A low continuous current will be provided with minimal voltage of 3.5 mA. The frequency will be delivered using a stimulation of 10 Hz for 10±1 minutes prior to the heelstick, with continued stimulation during and for 2 minutes after the heel stick. The display will be hidden from view to prevent the rater from being able to observe whether the unit is on.</description>
