The components in both CTMI and MI are parallel, but the focus within them is different and the CTMI augmented some of the components with culturally relevant material, including discussion about acculturation stress.  The CTMI components, which are MI structured strategies, are culturally tailored to address relevant concerns and issues.  There are also culturally tailored feedback elements in the CTMI, such as ethnic normative feedback about drinking.  To control for time across conditions, interventionists are instructed to select CTMI components based on participant interests, not the entire array of components."

Pilot data from the PI's (New Investigator) K award (AA014905), which will serve as\n      the basis for the current proposed larger-scale study, demonstrated that culturally tailored\n      motivational interviewing (CTMI) outperformed motivational interviewing (MI) that was not\n      tailored to the needs of Latino heavy drinkers. The public health impact of this study will\n      be to develop a program of early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous\n      drinking among Latinos, to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that\n      disproportionately affect Latino communities."

            "textblock": "The proposed R01 research, in response to PA 10-100, \"Alcohol Use Disorders: Treatment,\n      Services Research, and Recovery\", addresses the PA priority: Treatment for Health\n      Disparities/Special Populations.   Latinos, the largest and fastest growing ethnic group in\n      the United States (U.S.), representing 14% of the population (1), are expected to grow to\n      nearly 29% of the population by 2050 (2-3).   Like many immigrant groups adapting to U.S.\n      culture, Latinos adopt the health behaviors of the mainstream population, such as hazardous\n      drinking (4-6).  Hazardous drinking is a pattern of drinking associated with increased\n      alcohol related problems: injuries, violence, sexually transmitted diseases (7-15), and\n      increased risk for developing an alcohol use disorder (abuse or dependence) (7, 10, 16).\n      Latinos report a disproportionately greater burden of illness, injuries, workplace and legal\n      problems (17-21) as a result of their alcohol consumption than other racial ethnic groups,\n      including an elevated risk for alcohol-involved motor vehicle crashes and fatalities (20,\n      22).\n\n      Early intervention prevents the need for more costly and complex alcohol treatment (23).\n      According to the National Academy of Sciences, dissemination of empirically-based\n      interventions that are culturally tailored is particularly needed among Latinos (23-24)\n      because they suffer alcohol-related health disparities (18-20, 25-26) and because alcohol\n      treatment utilization rates are lower among Latinos than among other minority racial/ethnic\n      groups or Whites (27-29).  Although evidence suggests that culturally tailored addiction\n      treatment improves retention and treatment outcomes (30-31), progress in the field has been\n      limited by the lack of prospective clinical trials comparing tailored to non-tailored\n      treatment (23).   The PI's (New Investigator)  funded K award (AA014905) provided important\n      pilot data demonstrating that culturally tailored motivational interviewing (CTMI)\n      outperformed un-tailored motivational interviewing (MI).  This study will be the basis for\n      the current proposed study, which is a larger scale version of the pilot.  The culturally\n      tailored MI maintained MI components.  The key modification in our Social Contextual Model\n      of Cultural Tailoring was to tailor the MI to incorporate important acculturation stressors\n      (32-33): limited financial resources and opportunities, loss of social networks,\n      discrimination (34-38), and changing cultural values. The proposed study will investigate\n      acculturation stress (39) as an influence on the relationship between acculturation and\n      alcohol consumption behavior and treatment outcomes.  Efforts will help build a\n      comprehensive model of how acculturation stressors influence drinking behavior among Latinos\n      (40).  The CTMI is also a needed effort to tailor treatment to drinkers who experience the\n      burden of multiple social contextual sources of disadvantage, including poverty,\n      discrimination, and acculturation stress (40).\n\n      Because the original pilot study goal was to isolate and test the effects of tailoring\n      treatment, it was delivered in English.  The current proposal extends the tailored treatment\n      to Spanish-speaking Latinos.  Providing the tailored treatment in Spanish addresses a major\n      clinical need and increases external generalizability. The study's public health impact will\n      be to provide early screening and brief intervention to reduce hazardous drinking among\n      Latinos in communities that lack such services. By providing early screening and\n      intervention, we hope to minimize the burden of illness and social consequences that\n      disproportionately affect Latino communities.  Impact on field: will be to contribute to an\n      understanding of whether culturally tailored motivational intervention enhances treatment\n      efficacy for Latinos compared to un-tailored treatment.  Another contribution will be to\n      explore the effects of translating and of tailoring MI.  Short term goals are to compare the\n      efficacy of an evidenced-based treatment, MI, against a culturally adapted version of MI\n      among Latinos. Long term goals are to disseminate an easily trainable, conceptual model of\n      culturally tailored empirically-based substance abuse treatment, understand how\n      acculturation processes confer risk for increased hazardous drinking among Latinos, and to\n      inform further tailoring of treatments for multiple stressors, including acculturation\n      stress.\n\n      Research Hypotheses:\n\n      Primary Aim 1: Treatment Main Effect.  Determine the efficacy of standard motivational\n      interviewing (MI) compared to culturally tailored MI (CTMI) at two, six, and twelve month\n      follow-up. We hypothesize that CTMI participants will report fewer alcohol-related negative\n      consequences and fewer heavy drinking days at follow-up vs. MI participants.\n\n      Primary Aim 2:  Explore acculturation stress as a moderator of alcohol treatment outcomes\n      for Latinos. We hypothesize that among participants with high acculturation stress, those in\n      CTMI will improve more over time than those in MI (at 6 months). We also hypothesize that\n      among those who receive CTMI, those with high acculturation stress may show greater\n      improvement over time (at six months) than those with low acculturation stress."
