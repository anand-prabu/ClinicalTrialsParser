The investigators propose a set of 3\n      cluster-randomized trials comparing communities randomized to oral azithromycin with those\n      randomized to placebo. To assess the generalizability of the intervention, investigators\n      will monitor for antibiotic resistance, which could potentially limit adoption of mass\n      antibiotic treatments. The investigators will also assess several measures of infectious\n      diseases. The investigators hypothesize that mass azithromycin treatments will reduce\n      childhood morbidity and will be accompanied by an acceptable level of antibiotic resistance."
