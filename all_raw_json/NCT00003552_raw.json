Peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow doctors to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy plus peripheral stem\n      cell transplantation in treating patients with metastatic melanoma."

Evaluate the safety and toxicity of a nonmyeloablative, low intensity, preparative\n      regimen followed by an HLA-matched allogeneic PBSCT in these patients.\n\n      III.  Monitor engraftment by measuring donor-recipient chimerism in lymphoid and myeloid\n      lineages in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Investigate the relationship between donor-host chimerism and the incidence of acute\n      and chronic graft-versus-host disease in this patient population.\n\n      V.  Investigate the effect of lymphocyte infusions on donor-host chimerism in this patient\n      population.\n\n      VI.  Determine disease-free survival, overall survival, and mortality from the procedure or\n      tumor progression in this patient population.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of a conditioning regimen. Patients\n      receive 1 of 3 dose levels of chemotherapy prior to peripheral blood progenitor cell (PBPC)\n      transplantation.  Patients at dose level 1 receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days\n      -7 and -6 and fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1.  Patients at dose level\n      2 receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -7 and -6, fludarabine IV over 30 minutes\n      daily on days -5 to -1, and antithymocyte globulin daily on days -5 to -2.  Patients at dose\n      level 3 receive cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour daily on days -8 to -6, fludarabine IV over\n      30 minutes daily on days -5 to -1, and antithymocyte globulin daily on days -5 to -2.\n\n      Patients undergo mobilized CD34+ PBPC transplantation on day 0.   PBPC transplantation may\n      be repeated on days 1 and 2 if deemed necessary.\n\n      Patients with progressive disease on days 15-30, day 60, or day 100, without\n      graft-versus-host disease, receive infusion(s) of donor lymphocytes.  Further donor\n      lymphocyte infusions after day 100 may be given at the discretion of the attending\n      physician.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 6 months, every 3 months for the next 2 years, and\n      then every 6 months until year 5 posttransplantation.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
