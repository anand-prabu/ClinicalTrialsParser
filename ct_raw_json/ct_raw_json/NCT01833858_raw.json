            "textblock": "A novel gonadotropin protocol for ovarian stimulation adds low-dose hCG (50- 200 IU) as a\n      source of LH (luteinizing hormone)  in the late follicular phase .\n\n      This regimen reduces the number of small pre-ovulatory follicles which could reduce the risk\n      of OHSS(ovarian hyper stimulation syndrome). Adequate ovarian hormonal levels , oocyte\n      maturation, avoidance of a premature LH surge, and increased pregnancy rate are the other\n      benefits of this regimen.\n\n      HCG might also affect endometrial function, stimulate endometrial growth and maturation and\n      enhance the endometrial angiogenesis. These effects could extend the angiogenesis. These\n      results could lengthen the implantation Window.\n\n      Inhibin A is a heterodimer protein and does not begin to increase until just after the\n      increase in oestradiol in the late follicular phase, suggesting secretion by the dominant\n      follicle. Inhibin A secretion is regulated by LH and is associated with paracrine/autocrine\n      action on oocyte maturation. Moreover, it is related to follicular development and size,\n      serving as a marker of follicular maturation after IVF cycles .However, the role of hCG\n      supplementation during COH (controlled ovarian hyperstimulation)is still a matter of debate\n      and more studies is needed. Thus, the objective of this trial was to investigate whether LH\n      activity in the form of low dose hCG in GnRH (Gonadotropin releasing hormone)antagonist\n      cycles would improve the quality of oocytes, level of inhibin A and endometrial vascularity."
