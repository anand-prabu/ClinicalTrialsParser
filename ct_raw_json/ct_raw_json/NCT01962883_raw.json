Scores 0-30 is indicative of a mild handicap; 31-60 indicates a moderate handicap; 61-100 indicates a severe handicap (Treleaven, 2006). Jacobson & Newman (1990) found a difference of at least 18 points from pre-treatment to post-treatment findings to suggest significant change in a patient's subjective perception on dizziness handicap.
