This all-ceramic bridge will be compared to a\n      metal-ceramic bridge. The investigators are conducting this study so we can make bridges\n      which can withstand forces in the mouth which tend to break them.\n\n      The overall objective of this research is to analyze how properties of ceramic materials and\n      different forces in the mouth interact with each other to affect the longevity of these\n      bridges. These include fracture toughness, elastic modulus of ceramic layers and supporting\n      substrate, core thickness, connector height, wear, loading orientation, and maximum\n      clenching force."

The first group is a metal-ceramic group where patients will receive\n      a bridge with a metal substructure underneath. The second group is an all-ceramic group\n      where patients will receive a bridge which is made of hard ceramic material. All patients\n      will receive two dental implants which will bond to bone for a period of 4-6 months. An\n      impression or mold of the implants will then be made and a bridge will be fabricated based\n      on the randomization of the patient. Patients will be asked to return at 6 months and yearly\n      thereafter up to 5 years. During these recall appointments, photographs will be taken and\n      impressions of the bridge and other teeth will be made. This will allow us to measure the\n      amount of wear happening with the bridge and the other teeth. The investigators can also\n      examine the amount of bone around the implants as well as the integrity of the bridge."
