  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging modifies the metabolic pathway of the neurotransmitter serotonin by reducing the
      synthesis rate and increasing the breakdown rate of serotonin, possibly related to the
      observed enhanced sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway. Since serotonin plays a prominent
      role in neuropsychological functions such as anxiety, mood and memory, the enhanced
      sensitivity of the serotonergic pathway in aging can probably explain the fact that elderly
      are more vulnerable to develop cognitive deficits and depressive symptoms.

      Serotonin synthesis in brain is regulated by its precursor tryptophan (TRP). Because
      tryptophan is an essential amino acid, modifying the availability of tryptophan through
      dietary intake, can directly influence central serotonin metabolism and consequently
      affective and cognitive processes.

      The aim of this study is to test the hypothesis that an acute intake of whey protein with
      high levels of TRP such as alpha-lactalbumin can stabilize the metabolism of serotonin and
      subsequently enhance metabolic and cognitive functions in healthy older adults. The acute
      effects of this dietary protein will be investigated in subjects with mild cognitive
      impairment (MCI) and compared to control subjects in order to examine whether healthy older
      subject with MCI benefit more from the intake of alpha-lactalbumin. The investigators will
      investigate if this meal can optimize serotonin metabolism by elevating plasma TRP levels
      and plasma TRP appearance and enhance splanchnic TRP extraction. In addition, the effects on
      mood and cognitive functions will be examined.

      The study involves for all subjects 1 test day (approximately 8 hours). On this test day the
      investigators will examine the acute effects of a protein meal. Subjects will receive a
      mixture of alpha-lactalbumin, carbohydrates and amino acid stable isotopes to investigate
      protein and amino acid kinetics. The subjects will receive these stable isotopes by infusion
      in their blood and by oral intake (e.g. simultaneously with protein meal). For study
      purposes, blood will be drawn approx. 25 times during 8 hours on the test day, altogether
      about 100-120 ml of blood will be drawn on the test day.
