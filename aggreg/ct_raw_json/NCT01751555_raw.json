            "textblock": "HIV/HBV co-infections are frequently observed due to shared routes of transmission. TDF and\n      3TC are nucleotide analogues that can inhibit both HIV and HBV DNA polymerases.  There is\n      higher risk to cause drug resistance in treating HBV or HIV infection with 3TC or TDF\n      monotherapy than combination trerapy. Combination tharapy could decreases drug resistance.\n      China's HIV epidemic remains one of low prevalence overall, but with pockets of high\n      infection among specific sub-populations and in some localities. China has a very high\n      endemicity for hepatitis B too. A substantial proportion of HIV-infected individuals are\n      co-infected with HBV. TDF + 3TC + EFV will be a common regimen for HIV/HBV co-infected\n      Chinese individuals.\n\n      The purpose of this study of this study is to determine whether TDF will be safe for\n      patients with HIV and HBV co-infection and the combination of TDF+3TC+EFV will suppress HIV\n      and HBV viral load below LDL at week 48 of treatment in patients with HIV and HBV\n      co-infeciton.This study will enroll 100 adult subjects and follow these patients for 48\n      weekes.There will be one enrollment visit(baseline) and visits at 2,4,8,12,24,36,48 weeks\n      after initiation of the study regimen."
