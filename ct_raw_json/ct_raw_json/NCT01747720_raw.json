            "textblock": "There is some evidence that vitamin D could be used to reduce breast cancer risk. Randomized\n      controlled trials would provide definitive evidence about this effect. However, trials with\n      breast cancer as outcome are expensive and time-consuming. Use of surrogate outcomes has\n      been advocated to accelerate progress in the identification of interventions that could\n      prevent breast cancer. Mammographic breast density is one of the strongest breast cancer\n      risk indicators and is already used as a surrogate outcome in several breast cancer\n      prevention trials. The aim of this double-blind randomized controlled trial is to determine\n      whether daily oral supplementation with vitamin D3 (1,000, 2,000 or 3,000 IU) over a period\n      of 1 year reduces breast density in premenopausal women compared to placebo. A total of 376\n      women (94 per arm) who live in Quebec City will be recruited. Showing that vitamin D reduces\n      breast density would provide strong support for the idea that vitamin D can be a safe and\n      inexpensive approach for the prevention of breast cancer."

There are four arms in the trial:\n\n        -  Arm 1: 1,000 IU vitamin D3/d (1 tablet vitamin D 1000 IU + 2 tablets placebo);\n\n        -  Arm 2: 2,000 IU vitamin D3/d (2 tablets vitamin D 1000 IU + 1 tablet placebo);\n\n        -  Arm 3: 3,000 IU vitamin D3/d (3 tablets vitamin D 1000 IU);\n\n        -  Arm 4: placebo (3 tablets placebo/d).\n\n      Vitamin D tablets (1000 IU tablets) and the placebo tablets are undistinguishable in size,\n      shape, color and taste, and are manufactured by the same company."
