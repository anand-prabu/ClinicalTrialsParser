All the\n      subjects were Caucasian from European ancestry. Patients were randomized after the screening\n      visit to one of two sequences: 1) Sequence 1 to receive fish consumption first and then no\n      fish. The individuals randomized to this arm continued with their previous alimentary\n      habits, avoiding any significant nutritional imbalance, and with an ingestion of 7 serves of\n      hake (each serve consisted of 100g of frozen Namibia hake, Pescanova S.A., Pontevedra,\n      Spain) per week for a period of 8 weeks. Afterwards they continued for another 8 weeks with\n      the same diet except for the avoidance of fish and any other seafood; 2) Sequence 2 for\n      which they started with their previous alimentary habits, avoiding any significant\n      nutritional imbalance, as well as any fish or seafood for the first 8 weeks. Afterwards they\n      were changed to the same diet but with 7 serves of hake per week."
