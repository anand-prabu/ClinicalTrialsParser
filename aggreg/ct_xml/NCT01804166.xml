  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to collect tissue samples from the biopsy specimen that was used to
      diagnose HSTCL and, if possible, to obtain a single blood sample, a buccal swab sample and a
      bowel tissue sample. Samples obtained will be stored by the sponsor for future testing. In
      addition, demographic and clinical patient information will be collected. The study will be
      conducted in North America. The study population will include IBD patients in North America
      with HSTCL who are identified through the sponsor's adverse event reporting systems. Cases
      of HSTCL will be identified through postmarketing adverse event reporting (eg, spontaneous
      reports, reports from late phase clinical trials, reports from patient registries) or from
      the sponsor's new or ongoing clinical trials. Eligible for enrollment are male or female
      patients of any age who have a confirmed diagnosis of HSTCL. There is no study-related
      therapeutic intervention and this protocol will not restrict or introduce any therapeutic
      interventions, including medications. All patients will continue to be managed by their
      personal physicians. No healthy subjects will be enrolled in this study.
