Second, more initiations and/or involvement of infants in interaction will be\n      associated with better maternal attunement to the infant. Third, more initiations and/or\n      involvement of infants in interaction will be associated with better quality of spontaneous\n      movements and better achievements in developmental milestone. All hypotheses will be\n      examined while controlling for maternal use of SSC method during hospitalization after birth\n      and family demographic backgrounds."
