      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the effect of 6 weeks of treatment with
      once daily administration of AQX-1125 compared to placebo on average daily pain in subjects
      with interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS), during and after treatment, using
      a standardized 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS) pain score recorded by electronic diary
