            "textblock": "Mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) is a prevalent and costly public health problem with\n      disabling consequences. More than one million civilians with mTBI are treated in US\n      hospitals and emergency departments each year (Faul, et al., 2010). While the exact number\n      is debated, approximately 10-15% of individuals with mTBI will experience prolonged and\n      disabling post-concussive symptoms (Stranjalis, et al., 2008; Ruff and Weyer Jamora, 2009),\n      and 34% will experience a psychiatric illness in the first year after injury (Fann, et al.,\n      2004). In addition, at least 188,270 military service members sustained a TBI from 2000 to\n      mid August 2010, and nearly 77% of these injuries were mild (Defense and Veterans Brain\n      Injury Center, 2010). Many individuals require treatment for resulting mTBI symptoms.\n\n      The proposed study builds on preliminary research conducted by the investigators to develop\n      and test the effectiveness of a social work delivered education and reassurance intervention\n      for adults with mTBI (SWIFT-Acute) against usual care. The proposed study will assess\n      acceptability and obtain preliminary effectiveness data for an enhanced social work\n      assessment and intervention for adults with mTBI (SWIFT) discharged from the Emergency\n      Department (ED). SWIFT includes early education, reassurance, coping strategies, resources\n      and a brief alcohol use intervention in the ED plus follow up telephone counseling, needs\n      assessment and case management referral to necessary services. The intervention targets\n      cognitive, physical, psychiatric and functional outcomes; specifically, post-concussive\n      symptoms, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder, alcohol use, community\n      functioning and successful linkage to community resources.\n\n      It is hypothesized that SWIFT will be acceptable to patients and that participants in the\n      SWIFT group will report superior outcomes on measures of post-concussive symptoms,\n      depression and anxiety, alcohol use and community functioning and will report increased\n      successful linkages to needed resources when compared to the SWIFT-Acute group.\n\n      The specific aims of the study are:\n\n        1. Implement an innovative social work intervention for adults with mTBI (SWIFT).\n\n        2. Assess acceptability of SWIFT using qualitative interviews with participants.\n\n        3. Assess preliminary effectiveness of SWIFT compared to SWIFT-Acute alone on reduction or\n           prevention of post-concussive symptoms, depression, anxiety, posttraumatic stress\n           disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and alcohol use, and on improvement of community functioning\n           and successful linkage to community resources.  80 participants will be randomized to\n           receive SWIFT or SWIFT-Acute.  Preliminary intervention effectiveness will be assessed\n           using standard measures of post-concussive symptoms, the primary outcome, depression,\n           anxiety, PTSD, alcohol use, and community functioning. A structured survey will be used\n           to assess linkage to community resources."
