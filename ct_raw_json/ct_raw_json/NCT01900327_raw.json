Tumor recurrence\n      occurs locally, at distant sites (liver, peritoneum, lungs), or both. Observational and\n      autopsy series report local recurrence rates of up to 87% even after potentially \"curative\"\n      R0 resection. To achieve better local control, neoadjuvant chemo-radiation therapy (CRT) has\n      been suggested for preoperative tumour downsizing, to elevate the likelihood of curative,\n      margin-negative R0 resection and to increase the OS rate. However, controlled, randomized\n      trials addressing the impact of neoadjuvant CRT survival do not exist. The underlying\n      hypothesis of this randomized, two-armed, open-label, multicenter, phase III trial is that\n      neoadjuvant CRT increases the three-year overall survival by 12% (30% to 42%) compared to\n      patients undergoing upfront surgery for resectable pancreatic cancer. Overall, 410 patients\n      (n=205 in each study arm) will be enrolled in the trial, taking into regard an expected drop\n      out rate of 7% and allocated either to receive neoadjuvant CRT prior to surgery or to\n      undergo surgery alone. Circumferential resection margin status, i.e. R0 and R1 rates,\n      respectively, surgical resectability rate, local and distant disease-free and global\n      survival, and first site of tumor recurrence constitute further essential endpoints of the\n      trial."
