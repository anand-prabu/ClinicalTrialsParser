Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, performance status (0-1 vs 2), visceral disease (yes vs no), available\n      lesions for biopsy (yes vs no), prior adjuvant anthracyclines (yes vs no), and prior\n      chemotherapy for advanced disease (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over 1 hour every 6 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive doxorubicin HCL liposome IV over 1 hour every 4 weeks.\n           Treatment continues for at least 36 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n           unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 64-100 patients (32-50 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
