    <textblock>
      This single-center, prospective, single blind, randomized study will enroll 50 subjects who
      are scheduled for elective hydrocelectomy and/or hernia repair. At Beaumont Health System,
      post-operative pain management in children is managed either via oral/parenteral opiates and
      opiate adjuncts, surgeon-administered field blocks (instillation of local anesthetics in the
      general area of incision), or via regional techniques (spinal, epidural, or peripheral nerve
      blocks).  We have designed this study to determine if there is improved qualitative and
      quantitative post-operative pain control in patients receiving TAP block versus
      intraoperative peri-incisional, surgeon administered field block. Once informed consent has
      been given, each patient will be randomized (like flip of the coin) to either Transverse
      Abdominis Plane Block (TAP Block)or surgeon administered anesthesia.
