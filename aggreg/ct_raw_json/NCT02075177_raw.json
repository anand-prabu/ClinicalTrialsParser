            "textblock": "Currently there is no known effective treatment for recurrent/resistant neuroblastoma.\n\n      Fenretinide is an anticancer agent that may work differently than standard chemotherapy\n      medicines.  It may cause the buildup of wax-like substances in neuroblastoma cancer cells,\n      called \"ceramides\" or other chemicals, called 'reactive oxygen species'.  In laboratory\n      studies it was found that if too much ceramide or reactive oxygen species build up in\n      neuroblastoma cells, they may die.\n\n      In addition, researchers are testing to see if a drug called ketoconazole, commonly used to\n      treat fungus infections, can increase fenretinide levels in the body by interfering with the\n      body's ability to break down fenretinide.\n\n      This study is being done: 1) to allow patients with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma\n      patients who would otherwise not be able to access fenretinide/LXS oral powder for treatment\n      to do so; 2) to further describe the side effects of fenretinide and ketoconazole when given\n      by mouth for seven days every three weeks; 3) to measure blood levels of fenretinide and\n      certain other chemicals during treatment with ketoconazole; 4) to determine if a patient's\n      tumor gets smaller after treatment with fenretinide oral powder plus ketoconazole or\n      fenretinide oral powder alone."

Contact Study Chair if there are questions regarding\n             the suitability of any medication.\n\n          -  As corticosteroids may impact sphingolipid metabolism, systemic corticosteroids\n             should NOT be used for emesis control during the course of the study.  Systemic\n             corticosteroids for asthma control are permissible but should be minimized.  Inhaled\n             corticosteroids for asthma control are allowed.  Steroids for routine metabolic\n             deficiency states are allowed. Steroids for CNS lesions are allowed.\n\n          -  Because gastric acidity is necessary for the maximal dissolution and absorption of\n             ketoconazole, when actively taking ketoconazole, patients should avoid/minimize\n             concurrent medications that decrease gastric acid output (such as ranitidine) or\n             increase gastric pH (such as Tums).\n\n          -  Concomitant medication that may prolong cardiac QT interval, especially those with\n             known interaction with ketoconazole (See Appendices IV, V and VI).      A LIST OF\n             THESE MEDICATIONS SHOULD BE PROVIDED TO THE PATIENT AND FAMILY - PLEASE SEE\n             APPENDICES IV, V and VI FOR A LIST OF MEDICATIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE USED WITH\n             CONCURRENT KETOCONAZOLE OR THAT SHOULD BE USED WITH CAUTION.  Please SEE APPENDIX IV\n             for a partial list of medications potentially prolonging QT interval.  Patients may\n             NOT receive therapy with the medications listed as PROHIBITED in Appendix IV and V.\n             Medications in Appendix VI may be used with cautions as noted.\n\n        Regulatory:\n\n          -  Patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed consent\n             (or assent.)\n\n          -  All institutional, FDA, and NCI requirements for human studies must be met."
