      The aim of this Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group
      study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of denosumab (DMAb) in Chinese postmenopausal
      women with osteoporosis at increased risk of fracture.  The study design consists of two
      phases: Screening and 12-month Double-Blind treatment phase.  Following the Screening phase,
      all eligible subjects will be randomized to receive Double-Blind DMAb (60 mg) or Placebo
      study medication in a 3:1 ratio.  DMAb 60 mg and placebo will be administered as a single
      subcutaneous (SC) injection at the beginning of the Double-Blind phase and at 6 months
      following the initial dose.  All subjects will receive daily supplementation of oral
      elemental calcium (at least 600 mg) and vitamin D (at least 400 IU).  The primary objective
      is to determine the effects of DMAb compared to placebo with respect to mean percent change
      in BMD at the lumbar spine, as measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), from
      Baseline to Month 12.  Secondary objectives include the evaluation between the DMAb and
      placebo treatment groups: change in BMD: at the lumbar spine (Month 6), total hip (Months 6
      and 12), femoral neck (Months 6 and 12) and trochanter (Months 6 and 12); and serum
      biomarkers of bone formation and resorption (Months 6 and 12).  Clinical safety of denosumab
      will also be assessed in this population.
