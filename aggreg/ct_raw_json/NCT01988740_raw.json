Experimental studies have shown\n      that pregnancies normally develop in a relatively hypoxic intrauterine environment, and the\n      subsequent reperfusion and oxidative stress is important for physiological trophoblast\n      development. The finding that maternal serum IMA levels are raised so early in pregnancy\n      provides further support for IMA as a potential marker for abnormal placental development\n      that may be related to early pregnancy loss. In this study, we aimed to evaluate maternal\n      circulating IMA levels in women with RPL by comparing them with healthy controls."
