This device generates acoustic (sound) pressure waves designed to act\n      on the cells in your body to generate proteins that may lead to wound closure. The\n      dermaPACE\u00ae device has not been approved for the treatment of diabetic foot ulcers; therefore\n      its use in this study is investigational.\n\n      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the ability of the dermaPACE\u00ae device to help\n      diabetic foot ulcers heal more quickly. The active study device, the dermaPACE\u00ae, will be\n      compared to an inactive look-alike device (called a \"Sham\") in this study. The sham device\n      will not provide any treatment to your diabetic foot ulcer."
