  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this multicenter trial is to assess the efficacy and safety of MK-7622
      compared with placebo as adjunctive therapy to donepezil for the symptomatic treatment of
      participants with mild to moderate Alzheimer's Disease (AD). The trial consists of two
      stages: Stage 1 and Stage 2. Participants in Stage 1 will be randomized to receive either
      placebo or MK-7622 45 mg once daily. In Stage 2, participants will be randomized to receive
      either placebo, or MK-7622 5, 15 or 45 mg once daily. Participants will be enrolled in only
      one stage. Interim analyses will be performed in both Stage 1 and Stage 2 to determine
      whether the trial should continue. Duration of each stage is approximately 26 weeks; all
      participants receive placebo at some time during the trial. The primary study hypotheses are
      the following: Stage 1 - MK-7622 45 mg once daily is superior to placebo in improving
      cognition in participants with mild to moderate AD as assessed by mean change from baseline
      in the 11-item Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale-Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog11) at Week
      12; Stage 2 - At least one of the top two doses of MK-7622 (15 mg once daily, 45 mg once
      daily) is superior to placebo in improving cognition in participants with mild to moderate
      AD as assessed by mean change from baseline in ADAS-Cog11 at Week 12.

      If double-blind treatment dose is not tolerated during first 2 weeks, participant will be
      discontinued. After first 2 weeks, if dose is not tolerated regimen may be modified
      according to defined algorithm, beginning with administration of reduced dose for 2 weeks,
      then rechallenge at original dose, if tolerability issues diminish at reduced dose.
