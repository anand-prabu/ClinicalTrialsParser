Chimmitecan\uff0ca novel CPT derivative, exhibited potent antitumor activities both\n      in vitro and in vivo by inhibiting topoisomerase I. Also exerted comparable effects on\n      topoisomerase I compared with topotecan and SN38 and possessed improved anticancer potency\n      and pharmacologic profiles, compared with the clinically available CPT analogues.\n\n      PURPOSE: to determine the maximum tolerated dose, the safety profile and pharmacokinetics of\n      Simmitecan."
