  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized parallel control trial to evaluate whether radical loco-regional
      Radiotherapy can prolong survival time of initial untreated metastatic nasopharyngeal
      carcinoma.

    <time_frame>2 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Progress-free survival is calculated from the date of randomization to the date of the first progress at any site.</description>

    <measure>Determine the toxic effects, both quantitatively and qualitatively, and quality of life (QoL) of these regimens in these patients.</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Administration and Monitoring Patients will be evaluated in the clinic and eligibility and informed consent obtained. Patients will be monitored for clinical toxicity by standard NIH criteria. QoL was assessed using the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTCQLQ-C30) and EORTC QLQ Head and Neck. A time period of 4 weeks will constitute the time for clinical safety monitoring.</description>

    <description>CR assessed by independent reviewers, according to the Modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) from the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Disease response evaluated after the completion of the chemoradiotherapy treatment. Complete response defined as the complete disappearance of the target and non-target lesion(s) identified at baseline after radiological evaluation by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) only.</description>

    <description>The determination of cost, including direct cost drug fees, inspection fees, expenses and nursing cost; cost-effectiveness analysis, such as cost-effectiveness ratio (ratio of the direct cost and short - and long-term curative effect) and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (i.e., increasing costs and increase short or long-term efficacy ratio).</description>
