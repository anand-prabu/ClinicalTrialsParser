      Primary objective of this study was to evaluate the diagnostic capability of keratoconus
      match index (KMI) and keratoconus match probability (KMP) indexes in forme fruste
      keratoconus (FFK), and their association with a series of Pentacam-derived keratconus (KC)
      indexes. KMI and KMP parameters are KC-specifc indexes that are measured by Ocular Response
      Analyzer (ORA), based on the distinct ORA-derived waveform characteristics of KC eyes.

      Study participants were recruited from the Cornea Outpatient service in a consecutive if
      eligible basis. Two study groups were formed: a) FFK group (FFKG) that included patients
      diagnosed with FFK, and, b) Control group (CG) was formed by refractive surgery candidates.

      All ORA (Reichert Ophthalmic Instrument, Buffalo, NY, USA, software version: 3.01)and
      Pentacam (Pentacam HR, Oculus Optikgerate GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany)measurements  were
      performed by the same experienced operator in a consistent way

    <description>KMI is the outcome of a neural network calculation of seven ORA-derived waveform scores and represents the similarity of the waveform of the examined eye against the same average waveform scores of the keratoconus eyes in the machine's database.
Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were applied to determine the overall predictive accuracy of KMI parameter,as described by the area under the curve (AUC), in  differentiating FFK cases from normal ones. The impact of Pentacam-derived KC related indexes on KMI was assessed with stepwise forward multivariate regression analysis.</description>
