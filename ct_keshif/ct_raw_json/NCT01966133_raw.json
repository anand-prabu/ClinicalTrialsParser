Transarterial chemoembolisation (TACE)\n      is an effective palliative treatment for HCC. It involves the infusion of chemotherapeutic\n      agent admixed with iodised oil followed by embolisation of the hepatic arterial flow using\n      small particles. This procedures allows application of smaller dose of chemotherapy\n      concentrated to the liver and thus is well tolerated with minimal side effects. We conduct a\n      randomised controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of using TACE after hepatectomy in HCC\n      patients with high risk factors for residual tumor (tumors with a diameter more than 5 cm,\n      multiple nodules, and microvascular invasion)."
