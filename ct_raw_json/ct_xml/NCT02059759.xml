  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the regulatory T cell response in Amyotrophic Lateral
      Sclerosis (ALS) patients to three low-dose interleukin-2 (ld-IL-2) posologies (0.5, 1 and 2
      MIU per day for 5 consecutive days and the beginning of three consecutive months).

      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the acute and short-term safety and
      tolerability of this therapy.  Co-occuring functional changes will also be described, as
      well as effects on T-cells and pNFH serum levels for exploratory purposes.

      This is a phase II study on ld-IL-2 as a therapeutic agent for ALS which aims at defining
      the activity and safety of a range a doses for subsequent use of the best dose in a phase
      II/III trial. For ethical reasons, ld-IL-2 must be tested as an add-on therapy to riluzole
      hence all patients will need to be treated with riluzole for at least three months prior to
      entry. A randomized (1:1:1:1), placebo-controlled, double-blind, parallel group trial will
      be carried out to assess ld-IL-2 activity on regulatory T cells and immuno-inflammatory
      markers in ALS patients treated for 3 months (5 days per month).

      Follow-up will last for 6 months. Blood will be drawn for laboratory analyses regularly
      throughout the trial. Safety will be assessed via the recording of all adverse events .
      Certain adverse events commonly found in the scientific literature will be queried directly
      by participating investigators at follow-up visits. Patients will also be asked to maintain
      an adverse event journal throughout the study.

      &quot;Day 1&quot; refers to the day of the first injection.
