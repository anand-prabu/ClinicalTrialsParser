            "textblock": "Lid retraction is a difficult problem encountered in oculofacial plastic surgery. It can\n      result from previous surgery, radiotherapy or cicatrizing disease or it may be idiopathic.\n      Whatever the aetiology, the cosmetic appearance is troublesome to patients and, can be\n      damaging to the cornea.  The definitive therapy for lid retraction is surgical, and often\n      involves complicated procedures including tissue grafting.\n\n      Hyaluronic acid gels (HAG) have been FDA approved for the treatment of facial rhytids by\n      subcutaneous injection and volume addition.  These gels have gained wide popularity in for\n      cosmetic applications in filling volume deficit areas.  Functional applications in the\n      periorbital area have also been described including the filling of volume deficit\n      anophthalmic orbits, ectropion and loagophthalmos.  Additionally, pilot studies have found\n      HAG to be useful in correcting both upper and lower eyelid retraction, with good effect.\n\n      The purpose of this investigation is to define the clinical utility of HAG correction of\n      lower eyelid retraction in terms of anatomic (lid position), quantitative (dry eye signs on\n      cornea) and qualitative effects (symptom severity).\n\n      Our hypothesis is that HAG correction of lower eyelid retraction will improve patient\n      comfort, clinical signs of dry eye and aesthetic self image."

Age less than 21 years: due to lack of data on safety for HAG fillers in pediatric\n             population\n\n          2. Age over 65 years of age: as HAG filler effect may be different in this population\n\n          3. Are pregnant or nursing: as there is little safety data on potential teratogenicity\n             of HAG fillers\n\n          4. Have a demonstrated allergy to HAG fillers or lidocaine\n\n          5. Have a current infection, skin sore, pimple, rash, hive or cyst over the injection\n             site: to avoid worsening the infection or transmitting it\n\n          6. Have a bleeding disorder or currently taking blood-thinning medications such as\n             Coumadin or heparin on a daily basis.\n\n          7. Currently active stage Thyroid Eye Disease"
