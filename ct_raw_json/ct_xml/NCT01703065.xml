    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies cabozantinib in treating men with castration-resistant
      prostate cancer. Cabozantinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the
      enzymes needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the impact of cabozantinib on markers of bone turnover and microenvironment in
      men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer and to compare the findings in
      men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the associated changes in dynamic histomorphometry at baseline and after 6
      weeks of cabozantinib therapy in men with non-metastatic castration-resistant prostate
      cancer.

      II. To characterize, describe, and compare the effects of cabozantinib in men with
      non-metastatic and metastatic bone disease with respect to the following measurements at
      baseline and on therapy: markers of bone metabolism in blood including bone specific
      alkaline phosphatase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH); changes in markers
      of apoptosis, proliferation, and angiogenesis in biopsy specimens from both bone and soft
      tissue during therapy with cabozantinib.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Radiographic disease responses and toxicities will be monitored for all patients.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabozantinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.
