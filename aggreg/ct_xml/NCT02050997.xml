  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, translational, non-interventional and multi-centre clinical study.
      The aim of the study is to identify predictive plasma biomarkers of response to chemotherapy
      in PDAC.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve two cohort groups, all patients involved will have PDAC.

      Cohort A will involve resectable PDAC patients who will receive standard treatment of CT
      (with/without radiotherapy).

      Cohort B will comprise of unresectable advanced PDAC patients and metastatic PDAC patients,
      both of whom will receive standard treatment of CT (with/without radiotherapy).

      Blood samples will be taken at the following time points:

        -  prior to resection, whenever feasible for cohort A

        -  prior to CT, for both cohort A and B

        -  during CT, for both cohort A and B

        -  follow-up, approximately every 3 to 6 months for two years for cohort A
