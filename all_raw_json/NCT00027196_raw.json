These conditions\n      are responsible for many heart related deaths and illnesses.\n\n      Researchers are interested in learning more about the specific genetic abnormalities causing\n      heart diseases.  In addition, they would like to find out how these abnormal genes can\n      contribute to the development of other medical problems.\n\n      In order to do this, researchers plan to study patients and family members of patients\n      diagnosed with genetically inherited heart disease.  Those people participating in the study\n      will undergo a variety of tests including blood tests, echocardiograms, and magnetic\n      resonance imaging studies (MRI).  These tests will be used to help researchers find the\n      genetic problem causing the familial cardiopathy.\n\n      Researchers hope that the information gathered from this study can be used to develop better\n      medical care through early diagnosis, management, and treatment plans."
