            "textblock": "The human body houses a huge microbial ecosystem, including the intestinal and oral\n      microbiota. Both these ecosystems, and, in particular, the intestinal one, are responsible\n      for maintaining human health. The response of the organism to the diet and the relative\n      alteration of the susceptibility to disease are worth of investigation to comprehend the\n      role of the microbiota to maintain the state of well being in humans. This concept, which is\n      the overall scientific basis of the entire project, perfectly fits with the declared scopes\n      of Horizon 2020. Understanding the impact of omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets on human\n      intestinal microbiota is aligned to the Grand Societal Challenge of the Horizon 2020 scheme,\n      which is addressing the human nutritional needs and the impact of food on human\n      physiological functions. In particular, studying the link between dietary habits and the\n      intestinal microbiota activity will be pivotal to improve the food-based promotion of health\n      and well being. The project aims at studying how the omnivore, vegetarian and vegan diets\n      may affect the oral intake of microorganims, and the composition of the oral and fecal\n      microbiota. With the aim to build up a permanent European platform for such type of studies,\n      ten Research Units (RUs) are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National\n      and, especially, foreign Institutions, covering 12 different countries. About 50 omnivore,\n      vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be recruited. Volunteers\n      will be asked to fill in diaries, describing their dietary habits, and to collect biological\n      samples (saliva, feces and urine), once a week for three weeks. For obvious ethical\n      constraints, biopsies will be not available in this study. RUs will share their tasks,\n      mainly depending on the nature of the samples to be studied, namely foods and biological\n      samples. Based on the different dietary habits, the presumptive intake of microorganims will\n      be estimated using literature data and, especially, culture-dependent methods. Typing and\n      antibiotic resistance of some food related microbial communities or foods will be also\n      investigated. The microbial diversity of foods, whose microbiota has never been studied in\n      depth, will be characterized by PCR-DGGE and deep sequencing. The metabolome\n      characterization will complete the overview on foods. After collecting and preparing\n      biological samples from the three diet groups, the oral and fecal microbiota will be\n      studied. The viable cell number of several microbial groups will be estimated in fecal\n      samples, before freezing. Preliminarily, the microbial diversity of saliva and fecal\n      ecosystems will be analyzed through PCR-DGGE. PCR assessment of genetic basis of antibiotic\n      resistance will be also carried out. Selected numbers of biological samples will be further\n      subjected to next generation sequencing, aiming at determining representative\n      individuals/samples of the three types of diet. Only for feces, representative samples\n      (e.g., 4/5 for each diet) will be subjected to meta-omics analyses based on meta-genomic,\n      meta-transcriptomic and meta-proteomic approaches. An integrated and iterative workflow will\n      be also developed, by assembling an in house synthetic meta-genome. The functionality of\n      fecal samples and/or of isolates from feces will be characterized based on fecal genotoxic\n      and anti-genotoxic activities, and modulation of the immune response. In agreement with an\n      holistic approach, the metabolome analysis of saliva, feces and urine will complete the\n      characterization of biological samples. All data available from the different RUs will merge\n      into a common database, whose structure will be developed during the project. Based on the\n      literature data (ISI Web of Knowledge), this is the first study that aims at correlating the\n      effect of the main dietary habits on the oral and fecal microbiota through integrated\n      meta-omics analyses."

            "textblock": "The overall objective of this project is to find the relationship between diet and saliva\n      and fecal microbiota, through high-throughput and integrated meta-omics (genomic,\n      transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic) analyses. Several questions are still debated\n      within this context. For instance, what is the daily intake of microbes and their role on\n      the balance of the intestinal microbiota? How is the intestinal microbiota affected by the\n      main types of diet (omnivore, vegetarian and vegan)? Which are the prevailing microbial\n      groups at intestinal level, depending on the type of diet? What is the presumptive\n      contribution of each microbial group in maintaining the host health? The quantitative and\n      qualitative determination of the main microbial groups harboured in foods, depending on\n      dietary habits, responds to an earlier question and coincides with one of the objectives of\n      this project. The estimation of the diversity (genomics), functional activity\n      (transcriptomics and proteomics) and metabolites (metabolomics) of, especially, the fecal\n      microbiota coincide with the holistic approach of this project and responds to several of\n      the earlier questions. Considering the close correlation between the balance of different\n      microbial populations in various niches of the human body and the onset of metabolic\n      pathologies, this project shall furnish novel knowledge that may highlight possible\n      relationships between diet and dismetabolisms. Diet has to be considered as the most\n      appropriate and inexpensive tool to determine a stable and favourable oral and intestinal\n      microbiota, which prevents diseases and guarantees human longevity. These overall objectives\n      of the project shall be reached on the basis of specific targets, such as: (i) the\n      identification of biological, molecular and metabolic markers specific to the type of diet;\n      (ii) the estimation of the differences in the microbiota and metabolome of saliva and feces,\n      both among individuals and between types of diet; (iii) the estimation of the qualitative\n      and quantitative differences on the microbial intake connected to the type of diet; and (iv)\n      the identification of the functional features of fecal samples related to the type of diet,\n      which can be regarded as indicators of disease susceptibility.\n\n      With the aim to reach the overall objective of this project, ten Research Units (RUs;\n      RU1-10) are involved in the proposal, with the partnership of 16 National and, especially,\n      foreign Institutions, covering 12 different countries.

The cascade approach used will make each research activity and each\n           RU indispensable to achieve the main objectives of the project.\n\n      This study will composed by different activity (AI-VI) described below:\n\n        -  ACTIVITY I. Recruitment of individuals, administration of diaries, handling,\n           preparation and storage of biological samples, and microbiological analyses of fecal\n           samples.\n\n        -  AI.1. Recruitment of individuals and administration of diaries (RU1, 4, 6, 8) About 50\n           omnivore, vegetarian and vegan volunteers, for a total of 150 subjects will be\n           recruited.Vegetarian and vegan individuals will be recruited with the cooperation of\n           the Italian Scientific Society of Vegetarian Nutrition. Omnivore individuals will be\n           recruited through advertisements published at the Universities. About 50 healthy\n           volunteers will be recruited including an approximately equal number of omnivores,\n           vegetarians and vegans (age 18-59 years, male/female ratio ca. 1:1). Recruited\n           volunteers will be asked to sign a consensus document, to record their dietary habits.\n           The diaries will be elaborate to get detailed information on food characteristics,\n           allowing an easy identification of the products on the market and an estimation of the\n           presumptive microbial load ingested. The Ethics Committee of the Universities will be\n           informed before the project will start.\n\n        -  AI.2. Handling, preparation and storage of biological samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). Each\n           individual will supply samples of saliva, feces and urine weekly, for a time span of\n           three weeks. Triplicate samples will be pooled before analyses in order to limit the\n           intra-individual variability. Handling will be carried out differently depending on the\n           type of biological samples (saliva, feces, urine) and subsequent analyses (e.g., DNA,\n           RNA, proteome). Simultaneously with the recruitment of individuals and collection of\n           biological samples, most of the RUs will be involved in setting up the\n           techniques/methods.\n\n        -  AI.3. Microbiological analyses of fecal samples (RU1, 4, 6, 8). In the first time the\n           viable counts will be performed by plating fresh fecal material on different selective\n           culture media, to enumerate the most common fecal microbial groups.\n\n        -  AI.4. Set up of techniques/methods (RU1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10). Simultaneously with\n           the recruitment of individuals and collection of biological samples, most of the RUs\n           will be involved in setting up the techniques/methods. In order to establish an\n           independent and competitive platform for meta-omics analyses, RU3 will purchase\n           equipment for high throughput sequencing, which is a main economic investment in this\n           project.\n\n        -  ACTIVITY II. Food microbiota and metabolome. Based on the information from dietary\n           diaries, the most representative foods of the 3 diets will be split in 3 categories:\n           (i) low (TBC, 10^3 cfu/g); (ii) intermediate (TBC 10^3 - 10^6 cfu/g); and (iii) high\n           (TBC \u00b3 10^6 cfu/g) microbial load. For foods of group (i) the microbial number will be\n           estimated based on literature data. For foods of groups (ii) and (iii) the microbial\n           number will be determined based on literature data in the case of well known products\n           with low market differentiation (e.g., Parmigiano Reggiano cheese), whereas appropriate\n           analyses will be done in the case of products with large market variability (e.g.,\n           Mozzarella cheese). In the latter case, the analyses will involve a large number of\n           products available in the market. The microbial diversity of foods will be studied more\n           in depth first by PCR-DGGE (Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel\n           electrophoresis) and when needed by deep sequencing on the basis of level of complexity\n           and current knowledge of the microbiota of the specific foods.\n\n        -  AII.1 Quantitative determination of microorganisms in foods (RU 4, 5; 7). The analysis\n           of foods will be shared between RU4 and 5, and some samples will be analysed by both RU\n           to reciprocally validate the results. Subsequently, RU4 will characterize selected\n           foods by LH-PCR (Length Heterogeneity Polymerase Chain Reaction) analysis, and the\n           results will be compared with those obtained by RU7 using PCR-DGGE. RU5 will identify a\n           large collection of isolates from foods, aiming at finding possible relationships with\n           a reduced anti-genotoxic activity of the fecal waters and presence of specific\n           microorgansims in the ingested foods.\n\n        -  AII.2 Microbial diversity in foods (RU 2, 3). First, this activity will consider poorly\n           characterized foods that are specifically eaten by veregetarians and vegans based on\n           records from diaries. Both micro- and mico-biota will be investigated. PCR-DGGE\n           analyses for yeasts and filamentous fungi will be based on the amplification of parts\n           of the D1/D2 domain encoding for the subunit LSU or 26S of the rRNA, and the ITS\n           (Internal transcribed spacer) regions. The V3 region of the 16S rRNA gene will be\n           targeted to detect bacteria. After DGGE analysis, the resulting gels will be\n           digitalised and analysed by the software Bionumerics. Dendrograms will be subjected to\n           cluster analysis to exclude from the further sequencing those samples having a\n           coefficient of similarity 85%; such selection will save costs of the next generation\n           sequencing, and will assure to get a manageable quantity of data to be analyzed via\n           bio-informatics. RU3 will perform the deep sequencing using libraries of amplicons of\n           variable genes of taxonomic interest and using specific procedures according to the\n           type of sequencing platform that will be purchased. The sequencing results will be\n           elaborated on a bioinformatic basis by the RU2.\n\n        -  AII.3 Food metabolome (RU 10). Based on the information on dietary habits, the\n           fermented foods most represented in the three diets, will be analysed to find a\n           possible relationship between chemical compounds ingested (e.g., salycilic acid) and\n           presumptively recovered in biological samples. The metabolome analyses will be carried\n           out by GC-MS/SPME (Gas Chromatography-mass Spectrometry /solid-phase microextraction)\n           and FTIR (Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy.\n\n        -  ACTIVITY III. The microbiota of feces and saliva. Preliminarily, all saliva and fecal\n           samples from all the ca. 150 volunteers will be subjected to PCR-DGGE analyses to get\n           an overview of the microbial diversity. RT-PCR-DGGE (Real Time- Polymerase Chain\n           Reaction- Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis) will be also considered to estimate\n           viable populations in feces. Based on these analyses, representative samples of each\n           dietary habit will be subjected to next generation sequencing. The output of all these\n           results should allow, step by step, the selection of 4/5 fecal samples for each of the\n           three diets to be subjected to meta-omics analyses.\n\n        -  ACTIVITY III.1. Study of the biodiversity.\n\n        -  AIII.1.1. PCR-DGGE Profiling (RU 2, 3, 8) PCR-DGGE analyses for yeasts and filamentous\n           fungi will target 26S rRNA and ITS regions, while V3 and/or V6-V8 regions of the 16S\n           rRNA will be studied for bacteria. Both DNA and RNA (after RT-PCR) will be used as\n           target to investigate total and viable populations, respectively. Under the same\n           experimental conditions, RU3 will characterize the bacterial diversity of saliva\n           samples. After DGGE, image and cluster analyses from DNA and RNA samples it will be\n           possible to define a difference between the global and viable population. The\n           dendrograms of similarity will be used to exclude from the further sequencing activity\n           those samples having a coefficient of similarity \u00b3 85%; such selection will save costs\n           of the next generation sequencing analyses, and will assure to get a manageable\n           quantity of data to be analyzed via bio-informatics.\n\n        -  AIII.1.2. Next Generation Sequencing (RU 3, 8) Deep sequencing on selected saliva and\n           fecal samples will be done using libraries of amplicons of variable genes of taxonomic\n           interest. All sequencing results obtained both for bacteria and fungi will be\n           elaborated on a bioinformatic basis by the RU2.\n\n        -  AIII.1.3. Antibiotic resistance (RU 7) DNA extracted directly from saliva and fecals\n           samples will be screened for the occurrence of genes encoding for resistances to\n           several antibiotics using PCR assays. Samples, resulted to be positive for antibiotic\n           resistance (AR) genes, will be used to isolate antibiotic-resistant lactobacilli,\n           lactococci and enterococci. After identification, isolates showing values of minimum\n           inhibitory concentration (MIC) higher than the corresponding breakpoints will be\n           confirmed by PCR amplification of the corresponding AR genes. The possibility of\n           transferring AR genes localized on genetic mobile elements from isolates to bacteria of\n           clinical interest will be evaluated by conjugation trials.\n\n        -  AIII.2. Meta-omics analyses of selected fecal samples According to the cascade\n           approach, the results from the study of the microbial diversity of fecal samples will\n           select 4/5 individuals representative of each of the 3 types of diet (4/5 x 3 = 12/15)\n           to be subjected to meta-omics analyses. The meta-omics approaches will provide an in\n           house database, consisting of the DNA and RNA sequences from the fecal microbiomes of\n           the 12/15 individuals, which will allow a complete view of the synthesized proteins.\n\n        -  AIII.2.1. Meta-genomics (RU3, 8) Fecal DNA will be quantified and a shotgun sequencing\n           protocol will be applied for meta-genomic analysis. This task should be performed by\n           the RU3, depending on performance and availability of the sequencing platform, which\n           will be engaged full time in the analysis of DNA and cDNA amplicons of feces and\n           saliva. Alternatively, specialized companies will carry out this task as a service.\n\n        -  AIII.2.2. Meta-transcriptomics (RU 6) The overall microbial gene expression profile\n           will be characterized using an innovative Illumina-based Metatranscriptomic approach\n           and the protocol set up during first months of the project. cDNA will be sinthetised\n           from RNA according to optimized procedures. Random amplification of the cDNA will be\n           performed and the cDNA will be sequenced by using the Illumina HiSeq platform. The\n           sequenced meta-transcriptomes will be assembled together using Velvet/MetaVelvet or\n           SOAPdenovo packages to achieve the largest possible consensus sequence. The transcripts\n           sequences will be annotated using well-established pipelines and transcripts will be\n           searched using RPS-BLAST (Reversed Position Specific- Basic Local Alignment Search\n           Tool)  against KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes), COG (Clusters of\n           Orthologous Groups) and the Genbank databases. Bacteria-like reads identified by nr\n           BLASTX will be further searched against the COG database. The functional roles of the\n           sequences will be assigned based on the KEGG and COG searches.\n\n        -  AIII.2.3. Meta-proteomics (RU1) Based on the workflow designed within the first months\n           of activity, proteins will be extracted from each fecal sample and analysed by gel-free\n           and/or gel-based proteomics. The identification of peptides will be performed using the\n           mass spectrometer Finnigan LCQ Deca XP MAX. Differential proteomic analysis will be\n           carried out. For peptide identification, the Open Mass Spectra Search Algorithm will be\n           used to search MS/MS spectra against the available databases. To retrieve further\n           functional information, the proteins based on COG classification will be annotated. The\n           identified COGs will be mapped on KEGG metabolic pathways database and visualized by\n           the online application of iPath. After FDR correction, all identified peptides will be\n           searched against UniProtKB and then mapped. To address the highest functional level of\n           all the identified proteins, the identified COGs onto KEGG pathways will be mapped.\n           Besides the common microbial core, inter-individual and inter-diet differences will be\n           determined in terms of metabolic function.\n\n        -  ACTIVITY IV. Functional characterization. The characterization of some functional\n           features of fecal samples and of microbial isolates from fecal samples will strengthen\n           the link between diet and intestinal microbiota.\n\n        -  AIV.1 Fecal genotoxic and anti-genotoxic activities (RU 5) Samples of fecal water (FW)\n           will be prepared and the genotoxicity will be determined by Comet assay. The HT29\n           enterocytes (10^6 cells/assay) co-exposed to FW and incorporated into LMA slide will be\n           subjected to Single-Cell Gel-Electrophoresis (SCGE) and analysed by epifluorescence.\n           Several microbial isolates from foods will be investigated for the inhibitory activity\n           towards genotoxic and mutagenic compounds, which are potentially present in the\n           intestine. The effect of the microorganism-genotoxin co-incubation will be assayed\n           through the evaluation of the residual genotoxic activity of the compounds using the\n           SOS-Chromotest (target Escherichia coli PQ37 sfiA:lacZ) and, in parallel, the Comet\n           assay (target enterocytes HT29).\n\n        -  AIV.2. Fecal microorganisms and modulation of the immune response (RU 9) The conditions\n           for growth and differentiation of dendritic cells (DC) and Caco-2 cells will be set up\n           within the first months of activity. Lactobacilli and bifidobacteria will be isolated\n           from all fecal samples and used as irradiated bacteria to detect the expression of\n           immune mediators in enterocytes. Transcript and cognate protein secretion levels of\n           IL-8 and tolerogenic TGF-beta (Transforming growth factor beta) and TSLP (Thymic\n           Stromal Lymphopoietin) will be determined. Irradiated bacteria will be also used to\n           stimulate surface markers in DC cells. Total RNA will be extracted from the Caco-2 and\n           DC cells, and cDNA will be prepared to look at the relative gene expression of IL-8,\n           TGF-beta, TSLP, TNF-alpha, IL-12p40 and IL-10; the concentration of the corresponding\n           gene products will be determined by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay).\n\n        -  ATTIVITY V. Saliva, fecal and urine metabolome (RU10). To complete the \"omics\"\n           approach, the metabolome of samples of feces, urine and saliva will be analysed with\n           three techniques (GC-MS/SPME, FTIR/ATR (Fourier Transform Infrared/Attenuated Total\n           Reflectance) and NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) according to the protocols previously\n           set up. Chemical compounds will be identified using mass spectra databases as well as\n           mass spectra data in the literature and/or data from pure chemical compounds. Upon\n           thawing of urine and saliva samples, the NMR analysis will be performed within 2 h.\n           Fecal samples will be prepared giving the maximum importance to the complete recovery\n           of water-soluble molecules. The NMR spectra will be prepared for statistical analysis\n           by correcting the little peaks misalignments through iCoshift algorithm.\n\n        -  ATTIVITY VI. Statistical elaboration of the results (all RUs). During project\n           development, RU2 will take care of the maintenance of the website in collaboration with\n           the partner CBS (Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, NL), the site will\n           collect all the results from the different research activities. This database will be\n           used for analysis in \"R mode\" to assess the impact of various descriptors in\n           determining the diversity of the three diets, and in \"Q mode\" to determine difference\n           between the three diets. During the same time, the most relevant results will be\n           disseminated through scientific publications into peer-reviewed journals.\n\n      Taking into account the topic to be studied, this project has undoubtedly applied potential\n      aspects. For instance, the knowledge of the effect of diet on human microbiota could result\n      in the preparation of appropriate guidelines to be distributed in campaigns of integrated\n      care promotion. Consumer preferences, attitudes, needs, behaviour, lifestyle and education\n      will be taken care of, and communication between consumers and the food chain research\n      community will be enhanced in order to improve informed choice and its impact on quality of\n      life. Empowering individuals to improve and manage their health through correct dietary\n      habits will result in cost savings to healthcare systems."
