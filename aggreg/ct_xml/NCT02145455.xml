  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will compare two different surgical methods used in total knee replacement with
      the Unity Total Knee Replacement System.  The study will evaluate these two methods based on
      patients' ability to perform various tasks prior to surgery and at 4 time points during the
      first 12 months after surgery.  The study will also compare the results of this study with
      the results of patients who previously received a Triathlon Total Knee Replacement which
      uses a third surgical method.

      This study will be conducted at a single centre.  The study has two treatment groups.  One
      group of 50 knees (approximately 50 subjects) will have a surgical method that uses
      mechanical alignment (alignment based on how the leg and knee joint move) to determine the
      proper position of the knee replacement device.  The other group of 50 knees (approximately
      50 subjects) will have a surgical method that uses anatomical alignment (alignment based on
      how the anatomy/structure of the leg and knee joint) determine the proper position of the
      knee replacement device.  Subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the two groups.
      Tests to determine knee function will be conducted pre-operatively and at 6 weeks, 3 months,
      6 months and 12 months.  In addition, a CT scan will be completed pre-operatively and at 6
      weeks to assess changes in alignment.
