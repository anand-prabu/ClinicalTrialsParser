      Aim-1:  Evaluate opt-out versus opt-in testing for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) at
      the Cook County jail and the Illinois Department of Corrections Northern Intake facilities.
      Outcomes of interest include a) uptake of each HIV testing strategy, b) comparative
      effectiveness of identifying HIV-positive cases, new cases and undisclosed cases, and c)
      predictors of HIV testing.

      Aim-2: Evaluate two case management strategies - &quot;correctional case management&quot; and
      &quot;transitional case management&quot; - designed to improve linkage and adherence to appropriate
      medical care after release from incarceration.  Correctional case management is a
      longer-term, more intense approach while transitional case management seeks to meet the
      clients' immediate needs, link them to Ryan White case management, and then support the Ryan
      White case manager in assisting these clients.  Correctional case management will be
      compared to the standard of care for jail detainees, and to transitional case management for
      persons leaving prison.  Outcomes of interest include, (a) HIV viral load and CD4 cell
      counts over time, (b) adherence to medication, and (c) visits to medical providers.

      Aim-3:  Evaluate the impact of an incentive for HIV-positive detainees released from jail to
      visit an HIV service organization where they can be linked to medical care and case
      management.  Outcomes of interest are essentially the same as Aim-2.

      Aim-4:  Assess university-based telemedicine as means to improve care of state prison
      inmates living with HIV.  Outcomes of interest include medication regimens, HIV viral load
      and CD4 cell counts, and associated health conditions.

      Aim-5:  Assess the uptake of partner notification and social network HIV counseling and
      testing involving HIV-positive persons released from jail and prison as a means to extend
      the reach of the 'seek, test, treat and retain' (STTR) model into the community.

      Aim-6:  Assess the impact of this STTR model on community viral load in the six Chicago
      community areas with the largest number of incarcerated persons.  Two outcome measures will
      be used: mean and total HIV viral load.

    <description>For all jail detainees, we will observe the uptake of opt-out and opt-in HIV testing.  For HIV-positive jail detainees leaving jail, we will observe 1) health outcomes for corrections case management versus the standard of care, 2) the impact of an incentive to visit an HIV service organization after release from jail, and 3) the uptake of partner notification and social network HIV counseling and testing after release from jail.</description>

For HIV-positive prisoners released from prison and returning to Chicago, we will observe health outcomes for corrections case management versus transition case management.</description>

    <description>Correctional case management is a long-term (18-24 months) program that seeks to improve the linkage of HIV-positive persons recently released from jail or prison to community-based HIV care, retain them in care, and reduce recidivism.  Compared to the long-standing Ryan White case management program, corrections case management has greater access to housing and a greater emphasis on employment.  Clients completing the program are then linked to the Ryan White case management program.</description>
