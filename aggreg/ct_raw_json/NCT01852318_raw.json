Although some studies suggested pruritus is\n      being decreased recently by use of better dialysis techniques, accumulating studies have\n      shown the still high prevalence of UP. Because of its long duration, frequency and high\n      intensity, UP has been reported to have a negative impact upon the patients' quality of life\n      (QoL). However, the therapies in use, including antihistamines, ultraviolets, opioid\n      antagonists and topical agents, are generally of insufficient efficacy, failing to provide\n      adequate and long-lasting relief. Based on the neuropathic hypothesis and frequent\n      co-occurrence of chronic pruritus and peripheral neuropathy in the patients undergoing\n      hemodialysis, gabapentin, a medication widely used for a spectrum of neuropathic pain\n      syndromes, has recently been suggested to be effective in the treatment of UP.Pregabalin,\n      another gabaergic drug structurally related to gabapentin, have an advantage over gabapentin\n      in terms of its more rapid response to stressful symptoms. Only two very recently\n      small-scaled studies evaluate the effect of pregabalin for UP. However, both these studies\n      were not randomized, placebo-controlled trails.As UP is still one of the most vexing and\n      disabling symptoms in patients with ESRD, we decided to do this multicenter, randomized\n      double-blind placebo-controlled trial (RCT) with a larger sample size and a longer duration."

The changes in QoL measures, including Skindex-10, Brief Itching Inventory\n      and Itch Medical Outcomes Study, are also assessed before, during and after therapy.
