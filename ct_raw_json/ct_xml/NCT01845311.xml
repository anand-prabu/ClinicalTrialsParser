        Primary Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient has evidence of myocardial ischemia or a positive functional study

          -  Patient has a normal CK-MB

          -  Target lesion has a visually estimated stenosis of ≥50% and &lt;100%

          -  Target lesion is located in a native coronary artery with average reference vessel
             diameter ≥ 2.75mm and ≤ 3.3mm

          -  Target lesion length must be ≤ 14mm

        Primary Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The target vessel is totally occluded (TIMI Flow 0 or 1)

          -  Target lesion involves a bifurcation (a lesion with a side branch ≥ 2.0 mm in
             diameter containing a ≥ 50% stenosis).

          -  Target lesion is located within a bypass graft

          -  Target lesion has possible or definite thrombus
