These effects\n      depended on the stimulus intensity of both conditioning and test pulse and also the ISI). A\n      characteristical sequence of inhibition (short interval cortical inhibition [SICI],\n      GABA-Aerg), facilitation (intracortical facilitation [ICF]), and inhibition again (long\n      interval cortical inhibition [LICI], GABA-Berg) is thought to be physiologically involved in\n      motor control. Previous studies have also shown that neuronal inhibitory motor circuits are\n      also disturbed in ADHD which will be restored by using methylphenidate. In this study the\n      investigators sought to investigate if methamphetamine abuse (from the same chemical class\n      of medications) will alter such effects of methylphenidate."
