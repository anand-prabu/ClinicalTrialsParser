These tests, referred to as \"batteries\" will evaluate attention,\n      executive functions, general intellectual functioning, language, memory, motor functions,\n      orientation, personality, selected sensory and perceptual functions, vigilance (alertness),\n      and visual-spatial functions.  Children and adult patient will receive different test\n      batteries.\n\n      The goals of this research study are to;\n\n        1. Create descriptions based on the performance of each patient on the test batteries.\n           Then use this information to relate patient behavior to their neurophysiological,\n           neuroradiological, and biochemical descriptions.\n\n        2. Define subgroups of patients based on their neurobehavior in order to decrease the\n           variability of psychiatric diagnoses, treatments, and prognoses."
