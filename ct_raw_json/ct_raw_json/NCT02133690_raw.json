The hypothesis is that a three dose series of BRV-PV administered\n      orally to healthy Indian infants, with the initial dose given at 6-8 weeks of age and\n      followed by vaccinations at monthly intervals, will significantly reduce the incidence of\n      severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (SRVGE). Duration of follow-up is until aged 2 years of\n      each enrolled child. The study is powered to detect vaccine efficacy significantly greater\n      than 10% (95% confidence interval lower bound > 10%) if the true vaccine efficacy is 50% or\n      higher."
