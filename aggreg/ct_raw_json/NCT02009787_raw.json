Vitamin D can also be obtained through fortified foods and oral\n      supplements. Lipid abnormalities are common in the general population, and are regarded as a\n      modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Recently low vitamin D status has been\n      shown to be associated with increased risk of developing hyperlipidemia. Statins are\n      normally the first-line therapy for hypercholesterolemia. It is also reported that vitamin D\n      can improve serum lipid levels. However, its effects on hypercholesterolemia patients remain\n      unclear. The investigators planned to determine the efficacy of combination therapy with\n      statins and vitamin D in a cohort of hypercholesterolemia patients. This study may shed\n      light as to whether oral vitamin D supplementation can be an adjunct therapy in\n      hypercholesterolemia patients."
