It is\n      unknown if such an intervention would be successful in attending, staff level of physicians.\n      The investigators hypothesize that an educational and feedback intervention will reduce the\n      rate of inappropriate outpatient transthoracic echocardiograms ordered by staff\n      cardiologists and internal medicine physicians."
