An ID infusion of LCFA will allow the investigators to determine if LCFA can alter nutrient absorption and glucose and amino acid metabolism. Benzocaine will be added to the ID infusion of LCFA to inhibit nerve terminals in the duodenum thereby preventing gut-brain communication. Plasma levels of glucose and amino acid tracers, glucose oxidation (13CO2 breath test), gut hormones (CCK, GIP, PYY, GLP-1, ghrelin), and bioactive lipids (N-acyl phosphatidylethanolamines, NAPEs) will be measured during all infusion periods."
