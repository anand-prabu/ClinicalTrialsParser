Postprandial hypertriglyceridaemia, which is associated with an increased\n      risk of cardiovascular disease, is a feature of type 2 diabetes. Hypertriglyceridaemia is\n      due to excess triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) which consist of very low-density\n      lipoproteins, (VLDL) synthesised by the liver which contain the higher molecular weight form\n      of apolipoproteinB (apoB), apoB-100, and chylomicrons which are synthesised in the intestine\n      in response to an intake of dietary fat and contain the lower molecular weight form of apoB,\n      apoB-48. A recent study has shown that GLP-1 receptor signalling is required for the control\n      of postprandial lipoprotein synthesis and secretion in hamsters and mice. GLP-1 was shown to\n      reduce apoB-48 TRL production while a GLP-1 receptor antagonist increased apoB-48 TRL\n      production.\n\n      This study will investigate the effect of the GLP-1 analogue lixisenatide compared with\n      placebo, in a double blind crossover study, on postprandial triglyceride metabolism in 12\n      patients with type 2 diabetes. Chylomicron and VLDL production and clearance rates will be\n      measured in a repeated meal study by labelling apoB-100 and apoB-48 and by labelling\n      triglycerides using stable isotope methodology. Glucose flux in response to a mixed fluid\n      meal will also be investigated using stable isotope methodology. Gastric emptying and post\n      heparin LPL activity will be measured.\n\n      The hypothesis is that i] lixisenatide will lower postprandial glycaemia due to a decrease\n      in endogenous glucose output and an increase in glucose clearance by peripheral tissues as a\n      result of an improvement in insulin sensitivity."
