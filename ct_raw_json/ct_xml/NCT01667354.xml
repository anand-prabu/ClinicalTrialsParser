      The primary aim of this trial is to test the effectiveness of an intervention to train
      primary care physicians to determine if it leads to decreased parental vaccine hesitancy.
      The investigators will train primary care teams with an initial training followed by
      telephone coaching and follow-up visits, and assess the outcomes of parental vaccine
      hesitancy (primary) and physician self-efficacy (secondary) at baseline and 6 months.

    <description>The investigators will contact mothers of newborns in study practices and conduct a telephone survey at two time points: baseline and 6 months. Surveys will assess parental hesitancy, parental trust in provider, and other covariates such as perceived social norms, other sources of information about vaccines, and demographic information.</description>
