Short Daily Hemodialysis - 5\n      or 6 treatments per week for approximately 2-4 hours per treatment- will be performed in the\n      patient's home, using any hemodialysis machine. Partecipants randomized to SDHD will undergo\n      an intensive home hemodialysis training program expected to take 2-6 weeks to complete.\n      Qualified healthcare professionals will train each SDHD subject's partner to perform\n      dialysis using any hemodialysis machine as chosen by clinicians.  At baseline visit, before\n      the first study treatment in either the SDHD or CHD arm, the following data will be\n      collected: demographic information, ESRD history, EuroQol EQ-5D-5L questionnaire, vital\n      sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed urine collection test\n      results, comorbid conditions, vascular access type, current medications. After hemodialysis\n      start, patients will be followed up to 12 months with data collection at 1, 3,6 and 12\n      months. At each visit, the following data will be collected:  EuroQol EQ-5D-5L\n      questionnaire, vital sign, blood laboratory test results, KT/V parameters, 24 hour timed\n      urine collection test results, adverse events, vascular access type, current medications.\n      During this study, the following parameters will be strictly monitored: treatment costs,\n      medications, number of hospitalization admissions, number of days in hospital and reasons\n      for hospitalizations, additional costs informations.\n\n      Home hemodialysis could be an integrated therapeutic option favoring the de-hospitalization\n      of patients requiring hemodialysis. Aim of this study is to offer the patient a better\n      quality of life, to create the conditions for an improvement in blood pressure, phosphate\n      control, of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and to reduce costs for the National\n      Health Service."
