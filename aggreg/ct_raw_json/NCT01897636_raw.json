            "textblock": "Pancreatic cancer is the second most frequent gastrointestinal malignancy. The overall\n      survival is dismal. Especially for advanced pancreatic cancer, the conventional approaches\n      are typically not curative and provide only minor increases in survivals in most cases.\n      Dendritic cells (DCs) are powerful antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that play a pivotal role\n      in the initiation, programming, and regulation of tumor-specific immune responses. Isolated\n      DCs loaded with tumor antigen ex vivo and administered as a cellular vaccine have been found\n      to induce protective and therapeutic anti-tumor immunity in experimental animals. Some\n      clinical trials of DC vaccination for cancer patients have shown the induction of anti-tumor\n      immune responses and tumor regression. Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) is an established\n      technique for the diagnosis and staging of pancreatic cancer. Endoscopic ultrasound guided\n      fine-needle direct injection of dendritic cells vaccination into pancreatic tumors may be a\n      promising treatment modality.Therefore, The purpose of the study is to evaluate the efficacy\n      and safety of endoscopic ultrasound guided fine-needle injection of DCs vaccination into\n      advanced pancreatic cancer"
