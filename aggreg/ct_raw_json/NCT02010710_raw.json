This\n      study is not introducing a new form of labour monitoring; it is evaluating the addition of\n      decision-support to CTGs displayed on the Guardian\u2122 system. Specifically comparing: \"No\n      decision-support\" - CTGs with no additional interpretation (UK standard care), compared\n      with: \"Decision-support\" - CTGs with the decision support software running that will alert\n      clinicians to the presence of abnormalities in the CTG in real time. How the labour is\n      managed is entirely up to the recruiting unit and the woman; however the allocation of\n      decision-support or no decision-support is determined randomly by the Guardian\u2122 system."
