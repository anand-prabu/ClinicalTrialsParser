    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to collect urine samples from patients with fibrodysplasia
      ossificans progressiva (FOP) for the assessment of biomarkers related to disease, disease
      progression and for prediction of flare-ups of the disease. Disease related biomarkers in
      these patients are currently unknown. This study aims to support the development of novel
      therapy/ies for this disease.
