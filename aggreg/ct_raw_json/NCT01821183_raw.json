Two samples of Athletes will be compared: Soccer Players (N15) and\n      Non-soccer players (N15) matched in sex, age and level of physical activity to investigate\n      hip rotator force in 3 different angles of hip flexion (0\u00b0/45\u00b0/90\u00b0). The measurement will be\n      made with a handheld dynamometer."
