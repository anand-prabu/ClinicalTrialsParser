Stress-associated mechanisms introduced by acute illness and chronic\n      disease decrease LH and Te secretion further.   A major unresolved issue is whether the\n      aging process heightens the negative effects of a stressor (whether physical or metabolic)\n      upon LH and Te secretion.  This study will assess LH and Te secretion in response to a\n      physical stressor (maximal exercise) and a common metabolic stressor (hyperglycemia) as a\n      function of age in healthy men ages 18-80 yr."
