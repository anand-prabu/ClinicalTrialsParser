Patients who are eligible but die prior to enrollment will\n      also be included to minimize bias resulting from non-inclusion of advanced stage patients.\n      The prospective recruitment parts will be three years.

Follow-up will be conducted by research study staff at each\n      institution via medical record review, under the direction of the Principal Investigator at\n      that site.
