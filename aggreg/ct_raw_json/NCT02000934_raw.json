Male or female patients 18 years or older\n\n          2. To be enrolled to the dose escalation cohorts, (Part A), patients must have\n             histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of metastatic and/or advanced\n             solid tumor malignancy or lymphoma, for which no effective standard treatment is\n             available.\n\n          3. To be enrolled to the CLL expansion cohort (Part B) or DLBCL expansion cohort (Part\n             B), patients must have relapsed or refractory diseases after \u2265 1 prior therapy that\n             meet the criteria described in the protocol.\n\n          4.

Male or female patient with reproductive potential who agrees to use effective\n             method(s) of contraception during the study treatment period through 6 months after\n             the last dose of study drug. The definition of \"effective method of contraception\"\n             will be based on the investigator's judgment and local regulation.\n\n          7. Patients must have recovered from the reversible effects of prior anticancer therapy\n             (to Grade \u2264 1).\n\n          8. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related\n             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may\n             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the\n        study.\n\n          1. Patients with brain metastasis, or patients with active secondary malignancy that\n             requires treatment, with exceptions as described in the protocol\n\n          2.

Life-threatening illness unrelated to cancer;  major surgery, systemic infection\n             requiring intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy or other serious infection within 14\n             days before the first dose of study drug.\n\n          4. Female patients who are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          5. Any immunotherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or investigational therapy within 2-4\n             weeks before the first dose of study treatment, as detailed in the protocol\n\n          6. Autologous stem cell transplant within 6 months before Day 1 of Cycle 1, or prior\n             allogeneic stem cell transplant at any time.\n\n          7. Treatment with high dose corticosteroids (> daily dose equivalent to 10 mg oral\n             prednisone) for anticancer purposes within 7 days before the first dose of TAK-659.\n\n          8. Known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) positive; known hepatitis B surface\n             antigen-positive; or known or suspected active hepatitis C infection (testing not\n             required).\n\n          9. Evidence of currently uncontrolled cardiovascular conditions as listed in the\n             protocol; acute myocardial infarction with 6 months before starting study drug;\n             baseline QT interval (QTcF) > 475 milliseconds (msec) (males) or > 450 msec\n             (females); or abnormalities on baseline 12-lead ECG that are considered clinically\n             significant per investigator.\n\n         10. Patients who are receiving treatment with prohibited medications (inhibitor or\n             inducer of P-gp or strong inhibitors or inducers of CYP3A) as listed in the protocol."
