  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the UK(1) . Detection of
      cancer at an early stage, as well as detection and removal of polyps through gold standard
      colonoscopy examination decreases mortality from the disease. However colonoscopy has a well
      documented miss rate, with some areas of the bowel difficult to visualise and neoplastic
      lesions potentially hidden behind folds in the colon.

      The Endocuff© is a disposable polymer sleeve with hinged lateral arms. The arms flatten
      mucosal folds and fix the colonoscope centrally in the bowel lumen allowing controlled
      withdrawal and improving mucosal visualization. The cap easily attaches to the tip of
      current colonoscopes without modification. In this single centre, randomised controlled
      trial, the investigators aim to assess the performance of the current gold standard
      colonoscopic examination against the current gold standard colonoscopic examination with the
      Endocuff© attached to the colonoscope.

      The investigators aim to recruit 300 patients (150 in each group) who have previously been
      identified to have colonic polyps or cancers undergoing surveillance colonoscopy following
      NICE guidelines(2). Colonoscopy will be performed by Joint Advisory Group on
      gastro-intestinal endoscopy (JAG) certified colonoscopists following quality indicator
      guidance. All patients undertaking follow up surveillance colonoscopy for previous polyps or
      cancer will be invited to participate and those agreeing will be randomly allocated to one
      or other technique.
