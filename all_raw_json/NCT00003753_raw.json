Hepatic\n      arterial infusion uses a catheter to deliver chemotherapy directly to the liver. Combining\n      more than one drug and giving them in different ways may kill any tumor cells remaining\n      after surgery.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of irinotecan combined with hepatic\n      arterial infusion with floxuridine and dexamethasone after surgery in treating patients who\n      have liver metastases from colorectal cancer."

(The MTDs of irinotecan and\n           floxuridine have been reached as of 10/15/03; phase I closed to accrual as of\n           10/15/03.)\n\n        -  Determine the efficacy of this combination chemotherapy after liver resection, in terms\n           of 2-year survival and 2-year recurrence rates, in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the pharmacokinetic effects of intrahepatic FUDR and liver resection on the\n           metabolism of irinotecan to its active metabolite, SN-38 in these patients.\n\n        -  Determine the safety and efficacy of the pump used in delivering intra-arterial\n           chemotherapy to the liver in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation* study of floxuridine and irinotecan.\n\n      Patients undergo hepatic resection and pump placement into the abdomen. About 4 weeks after\n      surgery, patients receive irinotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also\n      receive floxuridine and dexamethasone intra-arterially via an implanted pump continuously on\n      days 1-14. Treatment repeats every 28 days for 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of irinotecan is followed by sequential dose escalation of\n      floxuridine. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of irinotecan and floxuridine\n      until the maximum tolerated doses (MTDs) are determined. The MTD* (phase II dose) is defined\n      as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      NOTE: *The MTDs of irinotecan and floxuridine have been reached as of 10/15/03; phase I\n      closed to accrual as of 10/15/03\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 2-4 years, and then\n      every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2-24 patients will be accrued for the phase I portion of this\n      study within 1 year (phase I closed to accrual as of 10/15/03). A total of 50 additional\n      patients will be accrued for this study at the phase II dose level."
