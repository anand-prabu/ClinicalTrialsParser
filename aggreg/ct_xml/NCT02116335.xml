  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our bodies respond differently to stress.  Animal studies by the investigators have found
      that ET-1 plays a role in regulating blood pressure in response to stress.  This study is an
      extension of the investigators previous animal work to evaluate the role of ET-1 during
      stress in humans.

    <textblock>
      Using a salt sensitive animal model of prehypertension, the Dahl S rat,the investigators
      have previously published that acute stress elicits a pressor response that is accompanied
      by an increase in 8 isoprostane and ET-1. However, the pressor response is suppressed by
      ETA/B receptor antagonism. Moreover, the investigators have identified that the increase in
      8-isoprostane occurs downstream of ET receptor activation. These data indicate that ET
      receptor acfivafion is a main player In the pressor response to acute stress in
      pre-hypertensive animals; however, this phenomenon has yet to be elucidated in humans.
