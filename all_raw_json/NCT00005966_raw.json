Patients are stratified according to prior\n      nephrectomy (yes vs no), disease-free interval (no more than 1 year vs more than 1 year),\n      and ECOG performance status (0 vs 1 or 2). Patients are randomized to one of two treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) twice daily beginning on\n           day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b as in arm I and oral thalidomide once daily\n           beginning on day 1.\n\n      Treatment in both arms continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients who achieve complete response (CR) continue treatment for 24 weeks past\n      CR.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed prior to randomization and then every 4 weeks through week 24.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 346 patients (173 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2 years."
