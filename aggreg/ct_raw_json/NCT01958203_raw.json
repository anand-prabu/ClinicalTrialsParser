Patients aged 18 and above.\n\n        2. Patients admitted to any of the critical care units, or the general or orthopaedic\n           surgical wards.\n\n        3. Patients who have been in hospital more than 24 hours.\n\n        4. Caprini score > 1 (see procedure)\n\n      Exclusion criteria\n\n      Patients with any of the following criteria will be excluded:\n\n        1. Patients who have been admitted to a critical care unit and transferred out to a non\n           surgical unit within 24 hours of admission.\n\n        2. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy for indications other than VTE\n           prophylaxis or treatment, such as atrial fibrillation and prosthetic heart valves.\n\n      Study Outcome Measurements:\n\n      The main outcome measure of interest is to determine the proportion of patients who have\n      received inappropriate or inadequate VTE prophylaxis considering their calculated risk\n      factor compared to the recommended prophylactic measures for that risk.\n\n      Secondary outcome measures are to identify whether there is inadequate VTE prophylaxis\n      because of medication errors such as missed doses or wrong doses given.\n\n      Study Duration: 4 months\n\n      Statistical Analysis Data was entered into Microsoft Excel\u00ae and subsequently checked to\n      ensure accurate data entry and correct any errors. It was subsequently exported into SPSS\n      version 20 where it will be analysed.Quantitative data such as age was expressed mean (\u00b1\n      standard deviation). Categorical data such as gender, risk factors for bleeding, type of\n      mechanical and pharmacologic prophylaxis, missed doses and wrong doses were expressed as\n      number and percentage of population.The student's t-test was used to analyse parametric\n      data. The Pearson Chi-Square Test and Wilcoxon Rank sum test were used to analyse non\n      parametric data. Simple and multiple logistic regression analysis was done to identify\n      factors that are associated with inappropriate VTE prophylaxis. Factors that were included\n      in the analysis included: age, type of admission (medical or surgical), area of admission\n      (critical care, general surgery, orthopaedic surgery), Caprini score, and inappropriate VTE\n      prophylaxis as the outcome. A p-value of less than 0.05 was be considered statistically\n      significant."
