      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis:

      Primary hypothesis: Participants in the DBT group have greater reductions in the frequency
      and severity of suicidal and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors compared to participants
      in the alternative treatment group.

      Secondary Hypotheses: Participants in DBT group have improved treatment outcomes compared to
      participants in alternative treatment, including mental health service utilization, symptoms
      of borderline personality and depression symptoms, suicidal ideation and hopelessness,
      disability, and quality of life.
