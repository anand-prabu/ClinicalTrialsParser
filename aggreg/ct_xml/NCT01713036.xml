    <description>Unlabeled pimasertib, 60 milligram (mg), will be administered as oral capsules in the morning of Day 1 of Part A of the study (21-day treatment period). After 1 hour, the intravenous tracer dose of [14C] pimasertib (2 microgram [mcg] equaling 9 kilobecquerel [kBq]) will be administered as a bolus injection on Day 1. From Days 3-21, 60 mg unlabeled pimasertib oral capsules will be administered twice a day except on Day 8, on which 60 mg unlabeled pimasertib capsules spiked with 2.6  megabecquerel (MBq) of [14C] pimasertib will be administered orally in morning followed by an evening dose of  60 mg pimasertib as unlabeled pimasertib oral capsules. Unlabeled pimasertib, 60 mg will be administered as oral capsule twice a day in Part B of the study, that is, cycles of 21 days duration until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal by subject, lost to follow up, or death.</description>

             Participation in a trial involving administration of [14C] labeled compound(s) within
             last 6 months prior to start of trial medication
