Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells. It is not yet\n      known whether giving radiation therapy with chemotherapy after surgery is more effective\n      than radiation therapy alone after surgery in treating cervical cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without chemotherapy after surgery in treating patients with stage IB or stage IIA\n      cervical cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Compare relapse free and overall survival after radiation therapy with or\n      without the sequential use of chemotherapy in patients with node positive stage IB or IIA\n      cervical cancer. II. Compare the toxic effects of these two treatments in this patient\n      population. III. Study the effect of the addition of chemotherapy on the pattern of relapse\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      institution, stage, site of lymph node involvement, parametrial invasion, resection margin\n      status, diameter of the primary lesion, and preoperative brachtherapy. Patients are assigned\n      to one of two treatment arms and begin therapy within 6 weeks of surgery. Arm I: Patients\n      receive radiation therapy to the pelvis with or without brachytherapy and/or para-aortic\n      irradiation for 4-5 weeks. Arm II: Patients receive radiation therapy as in arm I plus 1 of\n      5 different cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy regimens. The patients preferably\n      receive chemotherapy before radiation therapy, unless doubtful or positive margins are\n      present, then radiation therapy is given first. Regimen I: Cisplatin and fluorouracil are\n      administered on days 1 and 2 of a 21 day cycle. Patients receive 4 cycles of therapy.\n      Regimen II: Bleomycin is administered on day 1 and cisplatin and ifosfamide are administered\n      on day 2 of a 21 day cycle. Patients receive 4 cycles of therapy. The regimen may also be\n      given without bleomycin. Regimen III: Patients receive vindesine on days 1 and 8, cisplatin\n      on day 1, bleomycin on days 2-4, and mitomycin on day 5 (cycles 1 and 3 only). Each cycle\n      lasts 21 days and patients receive 4 cycles of therapy. Regimen IV: Cisplatin and\n      vinblastine are administered on day 1 and bleomycin is administered on days 1, 8, and 15 of\n      a 21 day cycle. Each patient receives 4 cycles of therapy. Regimen V: Patients receive\n      cisplatin and methotrexate on day 1 of each 14 day cycle. Patients receive 6 cycles of\n      therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first 2 years, every 6 months for the\n      next 3 years, then annually for the next 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 700 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
