  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, interventional, study in which patients with a history of habitual
      snoring to determine whether low pressure nasal continuous airway pressure can reduce the
      frequency, duration or intensity of snoring in subjects with mild to moderate snoring who do
      not have Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this a prospective, interventional, study, each patient will be studied four times.
      Subjects without OSA will undergo an initial observational control study to establish the
      presence of snoring (session 1); a single CPAP titration night to determine the minimally
      effective CPAP level (session 2) to alleviate snoring; a subsequent full night of CPAP
      treatment at this CPAP level (CPAP not to exceed 6 cm H2O) using the Cloud9™ low-pressure
      CPAP device (session 3); and a final control night of study conducted off CPAP to assess
      whether the patient's snoring remained stable over time (session 4).  In this study, each
      subject shall serve as his/her own control.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that minimally effective nasal CPAP (≤ 6 cm H2O) delivered by the Cloud9™ device reduces the number of snoring events and reduces snoring intensity in habitual, simple snorers in treatment session 3. We will test the hypothesis that the Cloud9™ device will decrease the number of loud snores by 50% or decrease the overall number of snores by 50%.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is &gt; 18 years of age.

          -  Subject is willing and able to provide written Informed Consent using a  Patient
             Information and Consent form that has been reviewed and approved by a governing
             Institutional Review Board (IRB).

          -  Subject has a history of habitual snoring (almost every night or every night for at
             least 30% of the night) as determined by the subject or a bed-partner.

          -  Subject has been pre-screened and demonstrates no excess daytime sleepiness on an
             Epworth Questionnaire (an assessment of daytime sleepiness; high number = greater
             sleepiness) score of less than 11, no history of witnessed apneas or nocturnal
             gasping/choking episodes and a body mass index (BMI) ≤ 35.

        Inclusion Criteria for treatment trials (Nights 2 and 3):

          -  Subject meets Inclusion Criteria for the Baseline Trial (criteria a-d above)

          -  The subject has snoring intensity that exceeds 40 dBA during ≥30% of the respiratory
             efforts during sleep time on the baseline study night.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), such as
             asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis.

          -  Subject has a history of heart disease, heart attack or stroke.

          -  Subject has uncontrolled or poorly controlled hypertension.

          -  Subject has been diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA), defined as an apnea
             hypopnea index (AHI) ≥ 5/hr in the presence of excessive sleepiness (an Epworth score
             ≥ 11) or AHI ≥15/hr when there is no evidence of excessive daytime sleepiness (an
             Epworth score ≤ 10).

          -  Subject is currently participating in another clinical study for which follow-up is
             ongoing.
