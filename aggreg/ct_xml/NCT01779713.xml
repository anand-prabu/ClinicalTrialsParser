  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rational: The main danger with intracranial aneurism is its rupture conjugated with
      subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) occurrence. SAH is a severe pathology leading not only to
      neurological but also extra cerebral disorders. The major cause of morbidity and mortality
      when developing a SAH is the secondary development of a delayed cerebral ischemia
      consecutive to a prolonged vasospasm of cerebral arteries. The understanding of the
      pathophysiological mechanisms of SAH complication, such as vasospasm which is the more
      frequent, is essential.

      Vasospasm is defined as a reversible shrinking of an artery lumen diameter in the
      subarachnoid space, beginning generally between 4 and 12 days after the hemorrhage. Such a
      vasospasm could have a huge clinical impact leading to delayed neurological ischemic
      deficiency in 17 to 40 % of cases. Up to day, mechanisms involved in vasospasm occurrence
      are not well described.

      Disposing of well-established genetics and transcriptomics databases along with cerebral
      ischemia and inflammation is essential to unravel the mechanisms leading to vasospasm
      occurrence on SAH patients. It will enable researchers to better comprehend SAH pathology
      and elaborate an efficient and individualized therapeutic strategy to SAH acute phase in
      order to reduce the risk of vasospasm occurrence.

      Aims: 1) Constitute DNA and RNA Biobank via blood proofing oh SAH patients 2) Constitute a
      database grouping clinical and biological data 3) Look for genetic and transcriptomic early
      markers via genomic approaches 4) Correlate these different markers with vasospasm
      occurrence and clinical evolution of the patients

      Study: Patients inclusion will be done following their admission (D1) in the &quot; unité de
      réanimation neurochirurgicale&quot; of Pitié-Salpètrière Hospital. After obtaining of the
      informed consent, blood proofing will be realized daily during 12 days: one daily 2.5ml tube
      for the transcriptomic study and a single 10ml EDTA tube for genetic analyses. Clinical and
      biological follow-up will be performed as usual.

      200 patients will be initially included during 2 to 3 years for the transcriptomic study of
      which 1/3 will develop vasospastic complication. The transcriptomic study will thus be
      performed by comparing patients developing or not developing this complication

      Expected Results: Unravel vasospasm early genetic markers.
