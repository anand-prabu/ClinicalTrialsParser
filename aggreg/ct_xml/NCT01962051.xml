             (ECG), Holter, or event recorder)

          -  Subject must have a LAA closure procedure that has already been planned or scheduled
             by his/her attending physician before entry in the study

          -  Subject must be  greater than or equal to 18 years of age

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject with an implanted atrial septal defect (ASD) device or patent foramen ovale
             (PFO) device

          -  Subject underwent LAA closure procedure prior to study entry (i.e. before signing
             informed consent

          -  Subject who has a history of surgical ASD or PFO repair

          -  Subject with a history of stroke and unrepaired PFO

          -  Subject who has moderate to severe aortic or mitral valve stenosis or regurgitation
             requiring surgical or percutaneous intervention as assessed by the Investigator

          -  Subject who has a mitral or aortic prosthetic valve

          -  Subject with NYHA grade 4

          -  Subject with evidence of moderate pericardial effusion at baseline evaluation

          -  Subject who has complex atheroma with mobile plaque of the descending aorta and/or
             aortic arch

          -  Subject who has an intracardiac thrombus

          -  Subject who has carotid disease as assessed by the Investigator, requiring treatment,
             which includes revascularization and/or medical treatment

          -  Subject with active infection or active endocarditis

          -  Subject who has an acute or recent myocardial infarction (MI) or unstable angina
             (recent is defined as within 3 months of implant date)

          -  Subject who has had recent major cardiac surgical procedure (recent is defined as

          -  Subject with malignancy or other illness where life expectancy is less than one year

          -  Subject who is pregnant, breastfeeding, or desires to become pregnant during their
             first six months of follow-up

          -  Subject who will not be able to be followed for the duration of the clinical study

          -  Subject with any medical disorder or severe disability that would interfere with
             completion or evaluation of clinical study results (for example uncontrolled
             hypertension, uncontrolled diabetes, blood disorder, renal failure, in situ IVC
             filter)
