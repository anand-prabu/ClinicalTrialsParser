However, there is a consensus that an anesthetic lubricating gel should be\n      routinely used in women as well.\n\n      Urethral lubrication can be performed in two different techniques: instillation of the gel\n      directly into the urethra or pouring the gel on the catheter's tip. In this study, we will\n      evaluate the pain level during female urethral catheterization in each technique.\n\n      Our hypothesis is that the level of pain will be much less if the lubrication agent will be\n      instilled directely to the urethra."

The randomization technique will be employed by a computerized\n      random number generator.\n\n      A 12F Nelaton urethral catheter will be introduced in order to measure post-void residual\n      volumes. Subsequently, multichannel Urodynamic testing (Duet Encompass System - Mediwatch\n      Group Plc) will be performed using a dual lumen 6F urethral and 9F rectal catheters. Filling\n      will be carried out using room temperature saline at a filling rate of 50 ml/min.\n\n      Patients will be requested to fill out a 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) visual\n      analog pain scale (VAS) in different time points: prior to gel instillation (baseline),\n      immediately after gel instillation (only in group 1), immediately after the introduction of\n      the Nelaton catheter, 5 and 30 minutes after the catheter will be taken out.\n\n      Time frame of the study: 30 minutes before the test and 1 hour after the test. Since the\n      study evaluates pain during the procedure the time frame of the study and assessment is very\n      short. longer follow-up is not needed."
