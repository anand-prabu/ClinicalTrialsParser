Use of rocker\n      soles has been based on theoretical considerations and empirical observations with minimal\n      scientific study and validation. With the passage of the therapeutic shoe bill (PL-100-203,\n      section 4072) authorizing Medicare coverage of shoes and shoe modifications for diabetics,\n      it is important to have objective data regarding the effect of rocker soles. This cross-over\n      study will randomize 46 subjects (40 sensate and 6 insensate) to a combination of 3 rocker\n      soles.  Patients will be evaluated at baseline and after 20 minutes wearing each rocker sole\n      shoe design to determine the effect of the type of rocker sole on plantar pressure and gait."
