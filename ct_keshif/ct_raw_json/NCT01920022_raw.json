            "textblock": "Women having abortions are at high risk for subsequent unintended pregnancy and repeat\n      abortion. Clearly, encouraging contraceptive use after abortion is a high priority. Long\n      acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs, Implants and intrauterine contraception) are the\n      most effective methods to help women avoid a repeat unwanted pregnancy and abortion. Studies\n      in surgical abortion patients, show that \"quickstart\" of a LARC - i.e., inserting it during\n      the surgical procedure - is associated with substantially greater use of that method six\n      months later than requiring women to return later to get the device. However, today a\n      majority of women chose medical abortion. The clinical routine is to insert LARCs at the\n      follow up 2 to 3 weeks after the abortion treatment. Frequently women choose to do part of\n      the abortion treatment at home and do not return for a follow up. Thus, the possibility to\n      quick start a contraceptive method in medical abortion would be a major advantage especially\n      if this could be done at the time of administration of mifepristone."
