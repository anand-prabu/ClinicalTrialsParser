    <textblock>
      This is an open label, exploratory study of simtuzumab (GS-6624) in adults infected with
      HIV, hepatitis C virus (HCV), or co-HIV/HCV with histological evidence of liver fibrosis.
      Participants will receive simtuzumab 700 mg intravenously every 2 weeks for a total of 24
      weeks (12 infusions) while continuing on standard therapy for HIV (HIV-infected subjects
      only).

             400 copies/mL

          -  HCV-infected subjects must have:

               -  Chronic HCV infection with HCV RNA ≥ 2000 IU/ml AND at least 1 of the following:

               -  Failed to achieve sustained virologic response (SVR) on a regimen containing a
                  direct-acting antiviral (DAA) in addition to pegylated interferon and ribavirin
                  OR

               -  Are unwilling to receive or have contraindications to interferon therapy for HCV

             required visits

          -  Presence of contraindications to magnetic resonance imaging (e.g., presence of any
             metal in the body, cardiac or neural pacemaker, aneurysm clip, cochlear implant,
             claustrophobia)
