      We designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to test:

        -  The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke
           (within 48 hours of onset) on the primary outcome, a combination of death within 14
           days after randomization and dependency (modified Rankin scale ≥3) at 14 day or at the
           time of discharge, if that occurred before 14 days.

        -  The effectiveness of blood pressure reduction among patients with acute ischemic stroke
           (within 48-hours of onset) on secondary outcomes:

             -  Combination of all-cause mortality and dependency over 3, 12, and 24 months of
                follow-up

             -  Combined vascular disease events over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up (vascular
                deaths, non-fatal stroke, non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary
                revascularization, hospitalized or treated angina, hospitalized or treated
                congestive heart failure, and hospitalized or treated peripheral arterial disease)

             -  Recurrent fatal and non-fatal stroke over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up

             -  Neurological functional status measured by NIH Stroke Score and modified Rankin
                scale at 14 day or discharge after randomization, and over 3, 12, and 24 months of
                follow-up

             -  All-cause mortality over 3, 12, and 24 months of follow-up

             -  Duration of initial hospitalization

             -  Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure within 24 hours and over 7 days,
                and 14 days

Based on patients' baseline BP level, the first-line medication (intravenous Enalapril) can be used alone, or in combination with second-line medication (calcium channel blocker), and third-line medication (diuretics) to achieve the target systolic BP lowering by 10% to 25% within the first 24 hours after randomization and to achieve systolic BP below 140 mm Hg and diastolic BP below 90 mm Hg and maintain this BP level afterwards during the hospitalization.</description>
