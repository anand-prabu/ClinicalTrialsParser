    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the amount of tooth movement achieved over time
      between subjects undergoing aligner treatment using a pulsation device known as AcceleDent®
      Aura with those not using the device.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are many variables that can affect the rate of tooth movement.  Preliminary data
      showed that the rate of tooth movement may be affected by variables such as age, sex, as
      well as alveolar bone levels, tooth root length and alveolar bone quality. The purpose of
      this study is to examine the amount of tooth movement achieved over time between subjects
      undergoing aligner treatment using a pulsation device known as AcceleDent® Aura with those
      not using the device.

      A preliminary validation pilot study will be done to calibrate all staff on study
      procedures.  The pilot will consist of 3 subjects using the active AcceleDent® Aura device
      and 3 using the sham control AcceleDent® Aura device for 4 weeks. Study staff will be
      calibrated for all study procedures.

      The primary study will be a prospective, single-center, randomized crossover clinical trial
      comparing two groups of subjects with 40 participants.  Subjects will be randomized to
      groups that will receive aligner treatment while using either an active AcceleDent® Aura
      device or a sham control AcceleDent® Aura device for the first 6 weeks of the study.  After
      6 weeks, groups will cross-over and switch devices, and tooth movement will be followed for
      another 6 weeks. Patients will be blinded as to which device they are using.  Amount of
      tooth movement per week, pain perception, and change in gingival crevicular fluid biomarkers
      will be outcomes assessed.   Device safety evaluation to be performed will include adverse
      events and clinical examination findings including pulp vitality testing and periodontal
      probe results.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Males or females between and including the ages of 18 and 40 yo desiring orthodontic
             treatment that could be completed within two years of treatment with either fixed
             appliances or aligner treatment.  Subjects may have had previous orthodontic
             procedures.

          -  Adult dentition with all upper front teeth present and any premolar and molar
             combination in the upper posterior of two teeth on each side.

          -  At least one upper maxillary central incisor that is positioned to allow
             anterio-posterior (AP) movement (crown tipping only) of 1.98 mm.

          -  Normal pulp vitality and healthy periodontal tissues as determined by intraoral exam.

          -  Good health as determined by medical history.

          -  Willingness and ability to comply with study procedures, attend study visits, and
             complete the study.

          -  The ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which must be
             signed prior to initiation of study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Severe malocclusions that would take longer than 2 years of treatment or require
             surgical intervention.

          -  Significant periodontal disease (&gt; 3mm pocket depth or &gt;1 mm of recession on upper
             anterior teeth).

          -  Active caries not under care of either a dentist or periodontist.

          -  Chronic daily use of any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, estrogen,
             calcitonin, or corticosteroids.

          -  History of use or current use of any bisphosphonate medication or other medication
             for treatment of osteoporosis.

          -  Current smoker (must not have smoked in the last 6 months).

          -  Women may not be pregnant.  Negative urine pregnancy tests prior to exposure to cone
             beam imaging is required to verify pregnancy status.

          -  Any condition or use of medication which in the opinion of the investigator
             interferes with the biology of tooth movement.

          -  Any condition which in the opinion of the investigator results in increased risk to
             the subject.
