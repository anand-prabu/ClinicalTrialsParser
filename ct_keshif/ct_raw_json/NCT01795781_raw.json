The aims of this reversal research strategy is to provide a means\n      whereby patients who present with serious bleeding or who need rapid reversal for surgery,\n      for example, can be offered such treatment to allow rapid normalisation of their coagulation\n      system.\n\n      As part of this developmental programme, we wish to obtain samples from patients receiving\n      Rivaroxaban or Dabigatran for therapeutic reasons, to test the effect of the respective drug\n      on the relevant coagulation factors and to test in vitro reversibility.\n\n      The only requirement for the patient is to have an extra 20ml of blood taken at a time when\n      the patient is having other blood tests.  There are no risks or experimental procedures\n      planned to be carried out on patients."
