Part 1 of the study is a dose escalation phase to select the recommended Part 2 dose\n      (RP2D) based on the safety, PK, and PD profiles observed after oral administration of\n      GSK525762. Eligible subjects with relapsed refractory hematological malignancies will be\n      enrolled in the dosing cohorts until a MTD is established. Subjects may continue treatment\n      in the study until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or\n      commercial supply of GSK525762 becomes available to the subject. An expansion cohort (Part\n      2) is planned in subjects with acute leukemias to further explore clinical activity at the\n      MTD. This is the first study of this agent to be conducted in subjects with these relapsed\n      and/or refractory hematological malignancies for which no standard therapies are anticipated\n      to result in a durable remission."
