            "textblock": "Low socioeconomic status (low SES), as defined by educational attainment and income, has\n      been associated with obesity in industrialized nations. Low SES has been related to\n      impulsive decision-making characterized by steep devaluation of future outcomes (delay\n      discounting, DD) and a greater motivation to obtain food (food reinforcement, FR). DD and FR\n      have been shown to interactively predict ad libitum energy intake in laboratory studies,\n      such that participants exhibiting high FR as well as high DD consume the most food. Obesity\n      often results from energy intake in excess of physiologic needs, and thus a plausible\n      mechanism is that low SES environments increase FR and DD, leading to overeating and\n      obesity. The primary aims of this study are to determine whether FR and DD interact to\n      predict BMI, and whether differences in FR and DD mediate the relationship between low SES\n      and obesity, in a large sample of US adults of varying BMI. In addition, whether high FR and\n      high DD are related to unhealthy food purchasing and eating behaviors will be assessed. It\n      is anticipated that high FR and DD will be related to unhealthy food purchasing and eating\n      behaviors."
