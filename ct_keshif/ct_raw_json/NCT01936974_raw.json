Disease progression during or within 6 months of previous platinum-based chemotherapy\n             including the following 4 categories:\n\n               1. Primary platinum-refractory: Previously untreated patients who do not achieve at\n                  least a partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy\n\n               2. Primary platinum-resistant: Previously untreated patients who have achieved at\n                  least a partial response to platinum-based chemotherapy but experience a relapse\n                  within a period of 6 months of its conclusion\n\n               3. Secondary platinum-refractory: Previously treated patients have a relapse 6\n                  months after the conclusion of chemotherapy, but fail to achieve at least a\n                  partial response\n\n               4. Secondary platinum-resistant: Previously treated patients have a relapse 6\n                  months after the conclusion of chemotherapy, achieve at least a partial response\n                  with platinum-based therapy as 2nd-line therapy, but experience relapse within 6\n                  months\n\n          3.

Serious non-healing wound, ulcer, or bone fracture\n\n         11. clinical signs or symptoms of GI obstruction and/or requirement for parenteral\n             hydration or nutrition\n\n         12. Known CNS disease except for treated brain metastasis\n\n         13. Known platinum drug allergy\n\n         14. Major surgery, open biopsy or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks of first\n             study drug\n\n         15. Inability to complete informed consent process and adhere to the protocol treatment\n             plan and follow-up requirements\n\n         16.
