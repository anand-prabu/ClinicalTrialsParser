      The purpose of this study is to determine if electrical stimulation of the foot is effective
      in the treatment of overactive bladder conditions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Foot neuromodulation is designed to treat OAB conditions by electrically stimulating the
      somatic afferent nerves in the foot using skin surface electrodes. The foot stimulation is
      non-invasive, can be performed at home, and has no adverse effects. Foot neuromodulation
      therapy will likely be accepted by more patients and have the potential to make a broader
      impact on the improvement of OAB conditions.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 year old men and women and older

          2. Currently having overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms, i.e. urgency, frequency, or
             incontinence

          3. No evidence of neurological disorder or urinary tract infection, i.e. clinically
             diagnosed as idiopathic OAB

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant women in their late pregnancy phase will be excluded because the increasing
             size of the baby/uterus may cause overactive bladder.

          2. Patients with implanted electrical stimulators such as pacemaker will be excluded for
             potential interference with the TENS stimulator.

          3. Patients who are allergic to Cipro or Bactrim will be excluded from the CMG study.
