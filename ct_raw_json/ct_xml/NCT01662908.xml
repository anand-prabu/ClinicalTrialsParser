  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Assess the relative change in thrombus volume as determined by two assessments (Baseline and
      Day 14-21) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in subjects with deep-vein thrombosis (DVT)
      treated with either an edoxaban monotherapy regimen or a low molecular weight (LMW)
      heparin/warfarin regimen.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The classical management of patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) consists of an
      initial treatment of at least five days of a (LMW) heparin followed by long-term treatment
      with a vitamin K antagonist (VKA), such as warfarin.     The eTRIS study will address the
      clinically important question of whether edoxaban monotherapy, without concomitant (LMW)
      heparin at the time of treatment initiation is comparable to or better than standard
      treatment with (LMW) heparin/warfarin therapy in subjects with acute symptomatic DVT as
      assessed by the relative change from baseline in thrombus volume (measured by MRI) at Day
      14-21.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female subjects older than the minimum legal adult age (country specific)

          -  Acute symptomatic proximal DVT involving the popliteal, femoral or iliac veins
             confirmed by compression ultrasonography (CUS) or other appropriate imaging
             techniques (such as venography or spiral/contrast CT) with symptom onset &lt; or =
             1week prior to randomization

          -  Able to provide signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concomitant pulmonary embolism known to the investigator at the time of randomization

          -  Thrombectomy, insertion of a caval filter, or use of a fibrinolytic agent to treat
             the  current episode of DVT

          -  Indication for warfarin other than DVT
