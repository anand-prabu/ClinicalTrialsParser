Three doses of abiraterone acetate will be administered with a 7-day\n      washout period between each dose. The total study duration for each participant will be 21\n      days. Participants will be randomized to one of six treatment sequences (ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA,\n      CAB, CBA):  Treatment A = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a high-fat meal;\n      Treatment B = abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered after a low-fat meal; Treatment C =\n      abiraterone acetate 1000 mg administered in the fasted state. No food will be ingested for 4\n      hours post-dose. Participants will be confined at the clinical research unit from the day\n      prior to dosing until clinic discharge on the day following dosing in each treatment period.\n      Serial pharmacokinetic samples will be collected and safety will be monitored throughout the\n      study."
