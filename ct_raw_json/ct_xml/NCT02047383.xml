    <textblock>

      elderly people. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the repercussion of hospital stay
      in hospitalized patients with a respiratory infection.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infection is a serious infection that prevents normal breathing function.
      It refers to any of a number of infectious diseases involving the respiratory tract. Health
      conditions that increase the risk of a respiratory infection include: another lung
      condition, a heart condition, a kidney or liver condition and a lowered immune system. The
      hospital stay of this patients is approximately 7-10 days and it is important to study the
      effects of this stay in the physical and psycho-emotional characteristics of patients.

    <description>The quadriceps and the hand-grip strength is assessed using a dynamometer with a standard protocol allowing three attempts on each side. During each measurement, patients were sitting with their shoulder adducted and elbow flexed to 90°. The maximum value achieved was used in the analyses. This is important in order to quantify the increase of strength Kg/cm2 The test 2-minute step in place is also going to be used for this purpose, counting the times the patients go up the right knees in two minutes.</description>
