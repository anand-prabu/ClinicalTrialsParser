            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Giving low doses of chemotherapy, such as cyclophosphamide and fludarabine,\n      before a donor peripheral blood stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of tumor cells.\n      It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. The\n      donated stem cells may replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining\n      tumor cells (graft-versus-tumor effect). Giving an infusion of the donor's T cells (donor\n      lymphocyte infusion) after the transplant may help increase this effect. Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells from a donor can also make an immune response against the body's normal\n      cells. Giving cyclosporine with or without mycophenolate mofetil or methotrexate after the\n      transplant may stop this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well peripheral stem cell transplant works in\n      treating patients with metastatic kidney cancer."
