Medications that increase dopamine are often effective in\n      treating ADHD in adults.  Since naltrexone is a kappa opioid receptor antagonist, it\n      increases dopamine in the brain.\n\n      We predict that naltrexone as a monotherapy will be effective for ADHD symptoms in adults\n      with ADHD.  We also plan to assess the effects of naltrexone on dopamine as measured by\n      changes in serum prolactin.  We predict that naltrexone will increase dopamine as indexed by\n      decreases in serum prolactin."
