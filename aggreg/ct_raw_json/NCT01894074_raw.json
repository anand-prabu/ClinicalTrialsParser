            "textblock": "More than 33% of U.S. adults over the age of 20 are obese (BMI \u226530 kg/m2), and 6% are\n      severely obese (BMI \u226540 kg/m2).  As the prevalence and severity of obesity has increased, so\n      has the number of women who have obesity-related abnormalities in reproductive function,\n      including anovulation and infertility. Specifically, obesity contributes to ovulatory\n      problems and compromises ovarian response to ovulation induction agents such as clomiphene.\n\n      Women seeking assistance from specialists for reproductive concerns are both anxious to\n      achieve pregnancy and highly motivated. We propose to assess the relative efficacy of very\n      low energy diet (VLED) using liquid meal replacement vs. standard of care dietary counseling\n      and education (DCE) on the metabolic effects of weight reduction in the obese, subfertile\n      population and assess ovulation and time to conception in these women.  We hypothesize that\n      use of a very low energy diet with resultant rapid and profound weight loss and marked\n      improvement in metabolic state, will increase the rate of spontaneous cycling, improve\n      unassisted and clomiphene-assisted ovulation and significantly improve conception and\n      pregnancy rates.  Because of the direct relationship between obesity and anovulation, we\n      will test whether evaluation of both habitual dietary intake and plasma metabolomic profiles\n      can be used to identify specific dietary components and metabolites that predict successful\n      or unsuccessful induction of ovulation and pregnancy in response to weight loss with or\n      without clomiphene citrate.\n\n      32 reproductive age women with a BMI \u226535\u226445 kg/m2 will be randomized to 12 weeks of VLED or\n      DCE and ovulation rates and time to conception between groups will be assessed over a 6\n      month period.  We will also evaluate between group differences in rate of weight loss,\n      absolute weight lost, BMI, waist and hip circumferences as well as reproductive and\n      metabolic hormone levels.  Luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH),\n      androgens, leptin, glucose and insulin (HOMA), and \u03b2-cell function (Matsuda Index).\n\n      We will assess if clinical, hormonal, dietary or metabolomic profiles, can predict response\n      to weight loss or clomiphene citrate in improving ovulation.  Women will be assessed for\n      clinical and molecular phenotypes, including plasma metabolomic profiles. Metabolomic\n      profiles will be adjusted for chronic dietary intake.  An initial assessment of the levels\n      of dietary components, metabolites or metabolic pathways that predict response will be\n      investigated.\n\n      We will determine program acceptability and differences in the change in co-morbid health\n      conditions, quality-of-life, and psychological well-being in standard of care and VLED-based\n      weight loss participants. Important physiological benefits arise from weight loss and the\n      magnitude of these changes will be assessed in the group of patients seeking reproductive\n      assistance.\n\n      This pilot study will provide the first information on the relative success of aggressive,\n      short-term weight loss in the treatment of infertility as defined by improvement in\n      ovulation and conception and provide data for larger, definitive trials of this approach.\n      The study will allow assessment of the feasibility and acceptability of translating VLED\n      treatment-based clinical care and research developed by the University of Michigan\n      Investigational Weight Management Clinic to a specialized population seeking reproductive\n      assistance.  Finally, this study will provide important preliminary data for a larger trial\n      to assess the health effects on the mother and the offspring as a result of aggressive\n      intervention to alter the pre-pregnancy metabolic environment in reproductive age women."
