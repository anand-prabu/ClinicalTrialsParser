            "textblock": "Atypical femur (thigh bone) fractures (AFFs) are uncommon low-trauma fractures which often\n      occur without warning, are highly debilitating, and are slow to heal. As physicians learn\n      more about them, AFFs are increasingly being identified prior to a total break. However,\n      there's no evidence on the best way to treat these non-displaced AFFs. One option is\n      teriparatide, an osteoporosis medication that can build new bone. Investigators will conduct\n      a double blind randomized placebo controlled trial to examine whether teriparatide use in\n      AFF patients with an incomplete break will help accelerate fracture healing and prevent\n      surgical intervention. Co-primary outcomes include change in WOMAC scores from baseline to\n      12 months and number of participants requiring surgical intervention at 12 months.\n      Investigators will recruit 60 women and men over the age of 30 who have experienced an\n      incomplete AFF. Participants will be randomly assigned to either teriparatide (20 mcg/day)\n      or placebo (using an identical injection pen) for up to 2 years.  As AFFs are highly\n      debilitating, a trial examining the use of Teriparatide in this population is urgently\n      needed."
