Patients are stratified according to\n      performance status (0 vs 1); disease symptoms, including pain, weight loss, loss of\n      appetite, malaise, and fever of unknown origin (yes vs no); weight loss during the past 6\n      months (more than 5% vs 5% or less); and disease-free interval (more than 6 months vs 6\n      months or less). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1, 8, 15, 22, and 29 and oral\n           capecitabine twice daily on days 1-14 and 22-35.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive irinotecan IV over 1 hour on days 1 and 22 and oral\n           capecitabine as in arm I.\n\n      Treatment in both arms repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, on day 1 of each course, and at the first visit\n      after treatment failure.\n\n      Patients are followed every 12 weeks for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-74 patients (14-37 per treatment arm) will be accrued for\n      this study."
