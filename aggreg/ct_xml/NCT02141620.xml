  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the initial efficacy, safety and tolerability of n-acetylcysteine
      as a pharmacotherapy for cocaine dependence. A rigorous, inpatient human laboratory study
      will be conducted in which the subjective, physiological and reinforcing effects of cocaine
      are evaluated during maintenance on placebo and n-acetylcysteine.
