The DCRS consists of two parts: Five questions on self-care activities in the last three months and a graph with previously measured HbA1c levels. This information is completed at each session, resulting in a graph showing the evolution of glycaemic control related to self-care activities. The DCRS is explained patients, emphasising the relationship between self-care and glycemic control. At the end of the session, patients are given a copy of the DCRS and suggested to show it and discuss it with their relatives.",
