All while maintaining similar\n      results with regard to tumour resection margin and oncological survival. In gastric cancer\n      the role of laparoscopic surgery remains unclear.\n\n      Current recommended treatment for gastric cancer consists of radical resection of the\n      stomach, combined with lymfadenectomy. The extent of lymfadenectomy is considered a marker\n      for radicality of surgery and quality of care. Therefore, It is imperative that a new\n      surgical technique should be non-inferior with regard to radicality and lymph node yield.\n\n      Preliminary studies show promising results for laparoscopic gastrectomy, but the number of\n      studies is small and due to lower incidence of gastric cancer in the West they are often\n      underpowered. A prospective randomised clinical trial is indicated in order to establish the\n      optimal surgical technique in gastric cancer: open versus minimally invasive gastrectomy.\n\n      Results of the STOMACH trial will further aid in determining the optimal surgical technique\n      in patients with gastric cancer."
