A number of educational programs\n      have been utilized to decrease its prevalence especially in disadvantaged communities.\n\n      Dental caries is a complex interplay of a number of risk factors such as demographic\n      (socioeconomic status, race, etc.) behavioral, dietary and cultural factors. Among the\n      dietary intake, the most significant  risk factor has been a high frequency intake of sugary\n      foods and drinks.Patterns of sugar intake are established early in life and sugar intake\n      increases in the first two years of life.\n\n      Early feeding practices and lack of oral hygiene maintenance have been identified as risk\n      factors for caries in subsequent years. Maternal education can prove to be protective\n      against dental caries by way of child's dietary practices.\n\n      Research has also indicated a reduction in prevalence of caries in children whose parents\n      were previously participants of an oral health educational program.\n\n      Educating mothers about oral hygiene and feeding practices before the child transitions from\n      exclusive milk diet to a variety of foods in an important time to exert a positive influence\n      on dietary intake of child and overall oral health."
