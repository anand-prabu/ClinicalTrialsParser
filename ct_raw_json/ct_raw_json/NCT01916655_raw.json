            "textblock": "The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a new mobile health (mHealth) system for\n      patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) that facilitates patient-centered,\n      collaborative management for patients prescribed the first-line treatment, continuous\n      positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP adherence rates are disappointingly low. The mHealth\n      system proposed for use in the study is informed by our group's previous interventional\n      efforts, including that of an interactive website intervention for OSA patients prescribed\n      CPAP. Limitations of that intervention included use of an immobile desktop computer for\n      website access and that it was not based on a previously evaluated protocol. The advantages\n      to the proposed mHealth system are the use of a mobile device to allow for increased\n      patient-provider communications and the incorporation of our Sleep Apnea Self-Management\n      Program protocol. The evaluative aspect of this proposal is designed as a randomized,\n      controlled clinical trial-Usual Care (control; UC); Self-Management Care (intervention 1;\n      SM); Self-Management via mHealth (intervention 2; SM-Mobile). The key feature of the\n      SM-Mobile intervention is the use of a mHealth tool that allows for the provision of the\n      Self-Management Program through the utilization of audio/visual conferencing,\n      self-monitoring, and treatment tracking with the patient remotely (i.e., in the non-clinic\n      environment).\n\n      CPAP adherence patterns are established very early in the treatment initialization process,\n      but previous interventional efforts have only used increased telephone support to bridge\n      this gap. The use of an mHealth tool to facilitate improved communications between patient\n      and provider (audio plus visual) along with content sharing tools (e.g., videos, pictures)\n      to overcome previous limitations and allow patients and providers to engage in more frequent\n      \"productive interactions\" with each other. Further, our protocol is based on an\n      individualized Self-Management intervention that is focused on helping patients become more\n      informed about their OSA and its treatment, and to have a more active role in the treatment\n      process. In particular, SM-Mobile helps with two key issues facing OSA patients: 1)\n      troubleshooting of problems experienced early in treatment that often undermine the CPAP\n      initialization process, and 2) discussion and recognition of treatment benefits to\n      positively reinforce continued, sustained CPAP use. The overarching aim of the present\n      project is to examine the effect of this patient-centered, collaborative care intervention\n      on improving the quality of care, and increasing CPAP adherence to a clinically meaningful\n      level. The central questions that encompass the conceptual and empirical contours of the\n      study: Does the SM-Mobile intervention have an effect on the patient's experience of care,\n      CPAP adherence, and OSA outcomes relative to Usual Care and Self-Management Care? To answer\n      these research questions, and in the process address fundamental intervention efficacy and\n      cost issues in telemedicine, the proposed randomized, controlled trial aims specifically to\n      achieve the following goals:\n\n      This project has the following specific aims:\n\n      Aim 1: To examine the effect of the Self-Management Care delivered by mHealth (SM-Mobile)\n      intervention compared to Usual Care (SM) and Self-Management Care (SM) on level of CPAP\n      adherence. The hypothesis is that participants in SM-Mobile group will exhibit higher levels\n      of CPAP adherence compared to the UC and SM groups over the 2-month intervention period.\n\n      Aim 2: To examine the effect of the SM-Mobile intervention, compared to Usual Care and\n      Self-Management Care, on the patient's experience of the quality of patient-centered,\n      collaborative care (as measured by the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care and the\n      CAHPS Clinician & Group Survey). The hypothesis is that participants in the SM-Mobile group\n      will experience a greater improvement in patient-centered, collaborative care compared to\n      the UC and SM groups over the 2-month follow-up period.\n\n      Aim 3: To examine the effect of SM-Mobile, compared to UC and SM, on OSA apnea outcomes\n      (e.g., OSA symptoms and OSA-specific health-related quality of life [HRQOL]). The hypothesis\n      is that participants in the SM-Mobile group will experience greater improvements in\n      self-reported OSA symptoms and HRQOL from baseline compared to the UC and SM over the\n      2-month follow-up period.\n\n      Aim 4: To perform a basic cost analysis of the SM-Mobile intervention compared to Usual\n      Care, applying a micro-cost methodology of measuring the quantity of inputs used in the\n      production of care and the unit cost of each. This will be a test against the null\n      hypothesis of no significant cost differences between groups."

                "textblock": "Inclusion Criteria:\n\n        The project will have a 4-year timeline. Patients and providers at both the VA Pulmonary\n        Sleep Clinic will participate in this prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients will\n        participate by completing written informed consent, agreeing to be randomized, completing\n        a baseline assessment, participating in the study interventional protocol, and completing\n        follow-up assessments up to one-year post-intervention. Our intent is to recruit a study\n        population that is fairly representative of the overall VASDHS population of patients\n        diagnosed with OSA. To this end, inclusion criteria are designed to be as inclusive as\n        possible and are operationalized as follows:\n\n          -  age > 18 years;\n\n          -  confirmed diagnosis of OSA;\n\n          -  being newly prescribed CPAP therapy; and\n\n          -  having chronic symptoms as noted on screening symptom checklist. OSA diagnosis by the\n             Sleep Clinic has been and is currently consistent with published consensus\n             statements49 that CPAP treatment is indicated when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI,\n             number of apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep) is either (1) greater than or equal\n             to 15, or (2) between 5 and 15 AND accompanied by documented sleep apnea symptoms,\n             including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia,\n             and documented cardiovascular diseases. Because mild OSA symptoms are at best\n             modestly correlated with AHI, the research study will focus on patients with moderate\n             to severe sleep apnea, and therefore inclusion criteria will require AHI > 15.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Exclusion criteria include cognitive impairment sufficient to cause inability to\n             complete the protocol (MMSE < 24/30);\n\n          -  residence in a geographical area outside of San Diego County (which could make some\n             necessary face-to-face contact difficult);\n\n          -  fatal comorbidity (life expectancy less than 6 months as indicated by treating\n             physician);\n\n          -  significant documented substance/chemical abuse; or\n\n          -  other participant circumstances that, in the opinion of a consensus of study team,\n             would interfere with the safety of a prospective participant or their need for\n             treatment (i.e., clinical needs of patient outweighs needs of research study). No\n             exclusion criteria or any other study design elements will be used directly or\n             indirectly to restrict study participation by women, members of minority groups, or\n             primary language. Because men have a greater risk for OSA (and are identified and\n             diagnosed at a greater rate) than women, we anticipate a final sample that reflects\n             the OSA base rate differences on sex. Some minority groups are thought to have higher\n             OSA prevalence rates than Caucasians, so assuming they are being screened/diagnosed\n             at the same rates as Caucasians, we expect minority groups to be included in the\n             study at levels that reflect those rates."
