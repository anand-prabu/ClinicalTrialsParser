Independent evaluators who blinded to subjects'\n      treatment will evaluate whether the wound has healed. Eligible subjects will be randomized\n      to receive either WH-1 ointment or Aquacel\u00ae Hydrofiber\u00ae dressing in a 1:1 allocation. The\n      study treatment will be applied to the selected ulcer for a maximum period of 16 weeks,\n      until the wound/ulcer closure (wound size of 0) for two consecutive visits at least 2 weeks\n      apart, or until the subject exited the study as treatment failure. After that, all subjects\n      regardless of wound healing at the end of comparison period will be followed for 12 weeks to\n      investigate durability. During the follow-up period, Aquacel\u00ae Hydrofiber\u00ae dressing will be\n      applied for subjects who have unhealed or with recurrent wound. Each target ulcer with wound\n      photographs for blind assessment will be monitored at each scheduled visit.\n\n      One interim analysis is planned at around 50% of study information; the final analysis will\n      be conducted at the end of the study."
