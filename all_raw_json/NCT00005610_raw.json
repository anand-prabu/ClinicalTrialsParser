II. Determine the immunomodulatory effects of this\n      treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Assess the quality of life in terms of\n      physical and personal concerns of these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive aerosolized sargramostim (GM-CSF) over 10-15 minutes twice daily\n      for 7 days. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to\n      course 5. Patients are followed every 2 months for at least 1.5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 7-17\n      months."
