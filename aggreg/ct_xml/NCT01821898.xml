  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eosinophilic Esophagitis (EoE) is a disorder in which a type of white blood cell
      (eosinophil) involved in allergic reactions, enter and cover the walls of the esophagus
      (food pipe). As a result, the esophagus becomes swollen and blocked making it difficult to
      swallow, and this leads to heartburn. In severe cases it can lead to food getting stuck in
      the esophagus and poor growth or weight loss in children

      The main purpose of this research study is to compare the effectiveness of two different
      types of treatment for EoE:

        1. Oral viscous budesonide- which is a steroid medication that has been used to treat
           asthma. Recently, it has been used as a therapy to treat the eosinophilic inflammation
           in EoE, and

        2. Specific food elimination.

      The study will also be looking to see if a blood test is useful in following the progression
      of EoE. Currently the only way to follow EoE is by repeating endoscopy, which is a more
      &quot;invasive test.&quot;

      This study is a placebo-controlled, randomized, prospective clinical trial comparing the
      efficacy of a topical steroid preparation to an antigen (food) elimination diet.
      Randomization will be performed using a block randomization method stratified by food
      allergen status. It will produce comparable groups, and eliminate the source of bias in
      treatment assignments.

      A total of 120 participants will be recruited for this study consisting of 60 patients
      positive for food allergens and 60 patients negative for food allergens. Study participants
      will be randomly assigned to treatments as described below, and the duration of each
      treatment phase will be 8 weeks.

      I. The subjects who are positive for food allergens will be randomized to group A and B.

      Group A will receive oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 mg daily or 2 mg daily depending
      on the height, and a sham elimination diet (elimination of some foods the subject is not
      allergic to). For the &quot;sham&quot; diet the study team will randomly pick 2-4 foods, no more than
      5 foods that were negative on patch testing. The sham diet should not contain any of the
      positive foods.

      Group B will receive an elimination diet (elimination of the foods the subject is allergic
      to) and a sham dose of budesonide. Sham budenoside is a placebo and will not contain any
      active medication.

      II. The subjects who were negative for food allergens will be randomized into groups C and D

      Group C will be treated with 6 food elimination diet. It is a dietary therapy consisting of
      elimination of milk, egg, soy, wheat, peanut/tree nuts and fish/shellfish. These are the
      most common food allergies.

      Group D will be treated with oral viscous budesonide at a dose of 1 mg daily or 2 mg daily
      depending on the height.
