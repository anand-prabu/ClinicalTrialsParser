      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that the change of attention measure is
      correlated with the changes of caregiver's burden after treatment with galantamine.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), prospective (in
      which the participants are first identified and then followed forward as time passes),
      observational (study in which the investigators/ physicians observe the patients and measure
      their outcomes), multi-center (study conducted at multiple sites) study. The study mainly
      consists of 2 phases including, the screening phase (14 days before administration of study
      medication) and treatment phase (16 weeks). In the treatment phase, patients will receive
      galantamine 8 mg/day for the first 4 weeks and later on the dose will be increased up to
      24mg (if tolerable). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events. The total
      duration of the study will be 18 weeks.

    <description>AQS evaluates the attention of participants with dementia and is designed for their caregivers to evaluate the participant's attention directly. It has 15 questions devised to be suitable for cultural characteristics of Korea through the standardization study considering education and gender/culture gap. Each question is scored from 0 to 2 (0=never, 1=occasionally, 2=usually). In questions 1 to 8, the lower participant attention ability rated the higher score (AQS1), In questions 9 to 15, the higher participant attention ability rated the higher score (AQS2). The total score is calculated by the formula: 16-AQS1+AQS2 and the range is from 0 to 30. Higher score means better attention ability of participant.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>BI is designed to evaluate subjective stress dementia patients' caregivers experience in relation to caregiving. It has total 22 questions with 4 options each and the calculated scores are from 1 to 88 (0-20 = Little or no burden, 21-40 = Mild to moderate burden, 41-60 = Moderate to severe burden, 61-88 = Severe burden). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

    <description>MMSC is a brief 30-point questionnaire test that is used for the assessment of dementia patients' cognitive impairment. Evaluation of points are as: 24-30 = No cognitive impairment, 18-23 = Mild cognitive impairment, 0-17 = Severe cognitive impairment. Lower scores indicate worsening.</description>

          <title>Severity of symptoms of dementia</title>
          <description>Dementia is a general term for a decline in mental ability severe enough to interfere with daily life. Some of the most common form of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. The severity of dementia is divided as: (1) Suspected dementia (it is also named as Pre-dementia - often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress), (2) Mild dementia, (3) Moderate dementia, (4) Sever dementia, and (5) Late (very severe) dementia.</description>

        <description>BI is designed to evaluate subjective stress dementia patients’ caregivers experience in relation to caregiving. It has total 22 questions with 4 options each and the calculated scores are from 1 to 88 (0-20 = Little or no burden, 21-40 = Mild to moderate burden, 41-60 = Moderate to severe burden, 61-88 = Severe burden). Higher scores indicate worsening.</description>

        <population>FAS was used for the analysis. The FAS population was defined as the participants who satisfied the inclusion/exclusion criteria and received the study drug at least once and whose evaluation visit was performed at least once in addition to the visit at baseline.</population>
