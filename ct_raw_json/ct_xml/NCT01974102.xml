    <textblock>
      The goal of the proposed interdisciplinary study is to pilot test a version of
      mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), an empirically-supported stress-reduction
      intervention, plus nutrition and physical activity counseling  for parents of preschoolers
      (aged 2-5); to reduce parent (and child) stress levels; improve parenting; promote healthy
      eating and physical activity in parent and child; and prevent overweight and obesity in
      preschoolers with an obese parent.

    <measure>To test feasibility and acceptability of Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction + nutritional and physical activity counseling (MBSR + N).</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years from start of study</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Parents in MBSR + N will show high mean attendance rates and satisfaction with groups. There will be high mean levels of group leader fidelity to MBSR, group leader empathy, and group cohesion.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To test initial efficacy and obtain effect sizes for MBSR + N in preventing child overweight.</measure>
    <time_frame>2 years from start of study</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>MBSR + N will prevent excessive increases in BMI percentile scores in at-risk preschoolers through a 1 year follow-up related to Control + N (weekly 2 hour pleasurable reading session + nutrition and physical activity counseling). Effect sizes will be calculated.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>To explore (and obtain effect sizes) for parent stress, parenting, child and parent stress responses, and family food intake and physical activity as mediators of MBSR + N effects on child BMI.</measure>
