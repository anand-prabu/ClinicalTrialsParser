  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following an initial small-scale (phase 1) feasibility study, the aim of this pilot study
      (phase 2) is to investigate whether a community-based, 6-month intervention for overweight
      and obese preschool children 2-5 years of age and their families, referred by their family
      physicians, will be successful in reducing the participants' degree of overweight (BMI
      z-score).

      Participating children will be randomized to either receiving a multidisciplinary lifestyle
      intervention during the first 6 months (treatment arm), or 6 months later (control or wait
      list arm). Participants will receive an additional free 6-month YMCA membership while
      participating in the study.
