Patients\n      with FBSS with additional chronic back pain and an intensity of 5 or more for leg and back\n      pain separately on the visual analogue scale are eligible for the study. About ninety\n      patients will receive a SCS system targeting to relief leg and back pain. The study group\n      consists of patients having a pain reduction of \u226550% in the leg after SCS trial stimulation.\n      If, after trial stimulation, there is less than 50% back pain relief compared with initial\n      values, patients will receive one or two Quad leads subcutaneously at the time of\n      implantation of the pulse generator.\n\n      This group, a total of 56 patients,will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio in which group 1 (n=28)\n      receives SCS plus non-activated SubQ(SubQ OFF) and group 2 (n=28) receives SCS plus\n      activated SubQ (SubQ ON) (phase 1), for a period of 3 months.\n\n      After the controlled phase of the study, all 56 patients will receive maximal effective SCS\n      and SubQ for the rest of the study duration (phase 2).\n\n      Total duration of the study for a patient is12 months. Estimated duration of the study is 18\n      months.\n\n      Comparisons will be made after 3 months between no SubQ OFF and SubQ ON. After 6 and 12\n      months (phase 2) patients will be compared with their baseline values to explore long term\n      effects of SCS and SubQ.\n\n      Type and number of patients The study will include FBSS patients with leg and low back pain,\n      failing to relief back pain with SCS. For the controlled part of the study 56 patients are\n      needed based on a power calculation in which a difference between the two treatments is\n      postulated of about 40%.
