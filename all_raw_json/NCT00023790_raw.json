Treatment repeats in 6 weeks for a total of 2 courses\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Pc 4 and a fixed dose of light until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of Pc 4 is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for Pc 4 is\n      determined, additional patients are treated with a fixed dose of Pc 4 (2 dose levels below\n      the MTD) and escalating doses of light until the MTD is determined. The MTD of light is\n      defined as above.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks (or 8 weeks if treated lesion on lower extremity has not\n      healed) and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25-30 patients will be accrued for this study annually."
