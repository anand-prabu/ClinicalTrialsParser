      The primary objective of this post market clinical follow-up (PMCF) investigation is to
      evaluate performance and safety of fast gelling dressing when used as intended in Diabetic
      Foot Ulcer (DFU).

      The primary endpoint will be Changes from baseline in the condition of the peri-wound skin
      measured by the following variables; maceration, redness/irritation, rash/eczema,
      blistering, dermatitis, skin stripping, trauma to wound edges and product degradation on the
      skin
