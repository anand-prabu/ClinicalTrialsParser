Positive psychology\n      exercises might include imagining a bright future, being grateful for good events, forgiving\n      others, and doing kind acts for others.\n\n      The investigators want to see if practicing positive psychology exercises after leaving the\n      hospital can increase feelings of hope, optimism, and positive thinking. The investigators\n      are asking you to take part in this research study because you are in the hospital for\n      depression or bipolar disorder.\n\n      This research study will compare \"positive psychology exercises\" to \"control condition\n      exercises.\"  During the study, you may take part in control condition exercises instead of\n      positive psychology exercises."
