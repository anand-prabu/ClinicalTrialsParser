The use of isotretinoin may be an effective way to\n      prevent cancer or stop cancer from growing. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of\n      cancer cells. Combining isotretinoin and interferon may be an effective treatment for some\n      recurrent cancers.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of interferon alfa plus isotretinoin in\n      treating patients with recurrent cancer."

II. Determine\n      the toxicities and side effects of this treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Nonrandomized study. Single-agent Chemotherapy with Biological Response Modifier\n      Therapy. Isotretinoin, 13-CRA, NSC-329481; with Interferon alpha (Schering or Hoffmann-La\n      Roche), IFN-A, NSC-377523 or NSC-367982.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 14-50 patients per tumor category (and any other tumor location, if\n      available) will be enrolled. If none of the first 14 patients in any tumor category\n      responds, or if only 1/22, 2/30, 3/37, 4/44, or 5/50 respond, the treatment will be\n      considered ineffective for that tumor type."
