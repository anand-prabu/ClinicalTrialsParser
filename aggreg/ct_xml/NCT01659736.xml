  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are investigating new indications of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation
      (TMS) by conducting a pilot randomized-controlled trial (RCT) comparing structural
      neuronavigation-directed TMS to Sham-TMS Placebo therapy for treatment of Generalized
      Anxiety Disorder  (GAD).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty participants (n = 10 per group) will be recruited. Participants will complete
      structural MRI for neuronavigation. Participants will be randomly assigned to treatment
      condition. TMS or Sham-TMS sessions will occur daily 5 days/week for 6 weeks. Assessments
      will occur at pretreatment, weekly during treatment, post-treatment, 3 month and 6-month
      follow-up.

      5 participants who received  sham &quot;placebo&quot; TMS, and achieved &lt;50% improvement in the HARS
      at the 3 month follow-up will be recruited for an open label substudy.  These participants
      will receive TMS treatment 2 days/week for 5 weeks.  Assessments will occur at pretreatment,
      weekly during treatment, post-treatment, 3 month and 6-month follow-up.

    <description>The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is one of the most commonly used and extensively validated outcome measures for anxiety symptoms.  The SIGH-A allows for a standardized administration of the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS).  Participants will be categorized for some analyses based upon treatment remission status defined as SIGH-A score.</description>
