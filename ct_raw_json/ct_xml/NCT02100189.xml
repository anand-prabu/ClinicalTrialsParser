    <textblock>
      This clinical trial studies whether esophageal cytology plus fluorescence in situ
      hybridization (FISH) is equal to or better than esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) or upper
      endoscopy for the early detection of esophageal cancer. Genes are the units of
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) the chemical structure carrying genetic information that
      determine many human characteristics. Certain genes in cancer cells may determine how the
      tumor grows or spreads and how it may respond to different drugs. Part of this study is to
      test those genes in esophageal cells using FISH.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if sponge cytology with FISH is a reliable screening tool for esophageal
      dysplasia/cancer, and determine its sensitivity and specificity and compare it to the gold
      standard procedure (the upper endoscopy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine if the cytology screening with FISH biomarkers is less expensive and cost
      effective than upper endoscopy for esophageal dysplasia/cancer.

      II. Determine the limitations and future needs to improve this technique.

      OUTLINE:

      Participants swallow the capsule (Oesotest from Actimed) and then wait 10 minutes before the
      sponge is gently pulled out from the esophagus. Cytology samples from the sponge are
      harvested and analyzed by FISH. Participants then undergo standard EGD or upper endoscopy.
