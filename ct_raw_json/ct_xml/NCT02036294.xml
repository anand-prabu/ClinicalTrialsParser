  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves development and testing of a patient and family-centered transitional
      care program for patients who are hospitalized with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease
      (COPD) exacerbations. The intervention offers tailored services to address individual
      patients' biopsychosocial needs, starting early during hospital stay and continuing for 3
      months post hospital discharge. The study hypothesis is that compared to usual care, the
      study intervention will : a) Improve patient health- related quality of life and survival,
      and reduce use of hospital and emergency room visits; b) result in improved patient
      experience, self- confidence, and self-care behaviors; c) result in improved family
      caregivers coping skills, self-confidence, and problem solving skills to address patient
      barriers to care and treatment.
