Participants will continue study treatment\n      until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, consent withdrawal, or participant's\n      refusal of treatment. There will be a screening period of up to 21 days of first dose of\n      momelotinib for the lead-in phase or randomization for the randomized treatment phase.\n      Following treatment, participants will be followed for safety for 30 days and for survival\n      approximately every 6 months for up to 5 years."
