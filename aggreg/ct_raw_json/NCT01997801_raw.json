Ketamine is a non-competitive\n      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker and takes some attractive advantages in terms\n      of pain control. When low dose ketamine is perioperatively administrated, opioid sparing\n      effect during postoperative period is reported in various surgical procedures such as spine,\n      thoracic, and gynecologic surgery. Ketamine's beneficial effect on postoperative pain has\n      not been investigated in patients undergoing robot thyroidectomy. The investigators\n      hypothesized that perioperative ketamine administration can reduce acute postoperative pain\n      after robot thyroidectomy and the incidence of chronic pain hypoesthesia on anterior chest\n      at 3 months after surgery."
