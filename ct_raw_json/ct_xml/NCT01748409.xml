    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>the main objective is to look after associations between :
anatomopathological signs of autonomic nervous system disorders seen on biopsies AND
clinical signs of signs of autonomic nervous system disorders seen through functional tests or through symptoms indicated by the patient on questionaries.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>

    <description>Autonomic failure will be assessed through questionaries on symptoms and through functional tests.
Severity factors  in parkinson disease will refer to various parameters like patient age.</description>
