  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pancreatic cancer often suffer from pain. Because of such a pain, their
      quality of life have seriously deteriorated. Threre have been a few studies that showed an
      effect for pain control by hyperthermia (heating the patient's body). However, there are
      several limitations in conventional hyperthermia. In this study, the investigators tried to
      show the effect of &quot;Oncothermia&quot; which is more selective to malignant tissue than
      conventional hyperthermia for pain control, increasing quality of life, and anti-tumor
      treatment.
