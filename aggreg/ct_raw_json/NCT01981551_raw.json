For this\n        reason and because  >=-secretase inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of\n        childbearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or\n        barrier method of birth control; abstinence) for the duration of study participation and\n        for at least 6 months after dosing with study drugs ceases. Should a woman become pregnant\n        or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she\n        should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol\n        must also agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of study participation, and\n        6 months after completion of study drug administration.\n\n        2.1.1.10 Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent\n        document.\n\n        2.1.1.11 Evidence of measurable disease by CT scan. Measurable lesions are defined as\n        those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be\n        recorded) as greater than or equal 20 mm by chest x-ray, as greater than or equal 10 mm\n        with CT scan, or greater than or equal 10 mm with calipers by clinical exam.\n\n        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:\n\n        2.1.2.1 Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents. Concurrent mediations\n        that the patient is taking will be reviewed by the PI to assess safety and eligibility.\n\n        2.1.2.2 Prior treatment with Gamma-secretase inhibitors or anti-notch antibody therapy.\n\n        2.1.2.3 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, serious\n        infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n        arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n        study requirements.\n\n        2.1.2.4 QTc interval of > 470 msec at study entry; congenital long QT syndrome.\n\n        2.1.2.5 Pregnant women are excluded from this study because PF-03084014 is a\n        Gamma-secretase inhibitor with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.\n        Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants\n        secondary to treatment of the mother with PF-03084014, breastfeeding should be\n        discontinued if the mother is treated with PF-03084014.\n\n        2.1.2.6 Patients with gastrointestinal conditions that might predispose for drug\n        intolerability or poor drug absorption (e.g., inability to take oral medication or a\n        requirement for IV alimentation, prior surgical procedures affecting absorption,\n        malabsorption syndrome, and active peptic ulcer disease) are excluded. Subjects with\n        ulcerative colitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or a partial or complete small bowel\n        obstruction are also excluded, as are any patients who cannot swallow the tablet whole.\n        Tablets must not be crushed or chewed; nasogastric or G-tube administration is not\n        allowed.\n\n        2.1.2.7 HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because\n        of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with PF-03084014.\n\n        2.1.3 Recruitment Strategies\n\n        We have had multiple discussions with the Desmoid Tumor Research Foundation, Inc., who\n        have various outreach efforts including patient meetings and webcasts. Senior executives\n        of the Foundation have indicated strong interest in this trial and willingness to inform\n        their members. We also have a network of referring physicians nationally that refers\n        patients with solid tumors to our clinical program. Given our interest and trials for\n        sarcomas, we have formed connections with centers that treat patients with mesenchymal\n        malignancies. We will be informing all of these of the availability of this trial once it\n        is open."
