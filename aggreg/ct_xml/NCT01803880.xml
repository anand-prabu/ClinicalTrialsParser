      The purpose of this study is to evaluate changes in clinical and imaging outcomes following
      arthroscopic treatment of a single medial femoral chondral lesion plus partial medial
      meniscectomy by Radiofrequency-Based debridement or Mechanical Debridement in subjects ≥
      eighteen (18) years of age.
