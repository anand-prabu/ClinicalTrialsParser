This clinical trial is a dose escalation study in which the safety of this vaccine\n      will be studied.  This is a dose escalation study in which each patient will receive vaccine\n      at one dose level. Patients will be injected with a fragment of Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)\n      containing the sequence of their own immunoglobulin gene. Patients will be required to have\n      their diagnosis of CLL and stage confirmed prior to initiating vaccination. After\n      vaccination patients will receive clinical and immunologic evaluation, including both\n      humoral and cellular responses. The investigator will be assessing the patient's immune\n      response or whether the patient's body recognizes the DNA vaccine. In addition, side effects\n      and reactions to the vaccine will be evaluated."
