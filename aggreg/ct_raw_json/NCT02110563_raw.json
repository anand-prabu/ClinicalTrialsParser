DCR-MYC is a novel synthetic double-stranded RNA in a stable lipid\n      particle suspension that targets the oncogene MYC.  MYC oncogene activation is important to\n      the growth of many hematologic and solid tumor malignancies.  In this study the Sponsor\n      proposes to study DCR-MYC and its ability to inhibit MYC and thereby inhibit cancer cell\n      growth.\n\n      In this first-in human study, DCR-MYC will be administered by 1 hour intravenous (IV)\n      infusion, once weekly for 3 weeks followed by a rest week (4 weeks = 1 cycle), to patients\n      with either solid tumor malignancies, multiple myeloma, or non-Hodgkins lymphoma that have\n      not responded to previous treatment.  The highest safe dose of DCR-MYC that can be\n      administered will be identified.  In addition, the pharmacokinetic (PK) profile, potential\n      pharmacodynamic (PD) effects, as well as the antitumor activity of DCR-MYC will be\n      evaluated."
