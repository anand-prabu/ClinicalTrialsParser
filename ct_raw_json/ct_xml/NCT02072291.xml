  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main factors associated with pregnancy rate in In Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment
      are embryo quality and the uterine ability to accept the embryo for implantation. This
      ability is influenced by uterine contractions (UC), which change in pattern and direction
      during the menstrual cycle. An abnormal uterine contraction pattern can displace the embryo
      from the proper position in the uterine cavity towards the cervix or the fallopian tubes and
      as a result may decrease pregnancy rates and increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. Indeed,
      previous studies demonstrated a negative correlation between uterine contraction rate and
      implantation/pregnancy rates. Suppression of uterine contractions during embryo transfer can
      be achieved by a large array of drugs, such as cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors, Î²2-adrenoreceptor
      agonists, calcium-channel blockers, phosphodiesterase inhibitors and oxytocin antagonists.
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Nifedipine administration in
      reducing uterine contractility during IVF-frozen embryo transfer (FET) treatment.
