There must be an historical OCT available from 1-4 weeks after the last bevacizumab\n             injection with retinal thickness > 300 microns in the central 1mm subfield on\n             Spectral domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to bevacizumab.\n\n          3. At screening, the bevacizumab treated eye must have DMO with retinal thickness > 300\n             microns in the central 1mm subfield on Spectral domain OCT\n\n             Eyes Previously Treated with dexamethasone:\n\n          4. Diabetic macular oedema affecting the fovea that has persisted despite two\n             dexamethasone implants 5 or fewer months apart, the last being 5-8 months prior to\n             the screening visit.\n\n          5. There must be an historical OCT available from 8-14 weeks after the last\n             dexamethasone implant with retinal thickness > 300 microns in the central 1mm\n             subfield on Spectral domain OCT to show the lack of complete response to the\n             dexamethasone implant.\n\n          6.

Age >= 18 years\n\n          8. Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus\n\n          9. Best corrected visual acuity of 20-78 letters (approx 6/120 -6/7.5)\n\n         10.
