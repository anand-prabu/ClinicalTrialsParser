  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Comparable data for bevacizumab and aflibercept are lacking, as are studies comparing the
      systemic levels of ranibizumab, bevacizumab, and aflibercept and their relative effects on
      circulating vascular endothelial growth factor. In the present prospective study, the
      investigators evaluated serum drug levels and plasma free vascular endothelial growth factor
      levels in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration following intravitreal
      injections of ranibizumab, bevacizumab and aflibercept.
