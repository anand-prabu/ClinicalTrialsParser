            "textblock": "Fetal research and clinical practice has been hampered by a lack of suitable investigational\n      techniques.  Currently, ultrasound is the only widely used method of studying fetal anatomy\n      and physiology, but it has significant limitations for assessment of cardiac rhythm. The\n      proposed study will allow us to investigate fetal magnetocardiography (fMCG) as a new tool\n      for the study of normal and abnormal fetal heart rate and rhythm, with a goal of\n      demonstrating probable benefit from use of the device in patients with serious fetal\n      arrhythmia.  We propose a study that will last 1-2 years and will provide data to aid in\n      assessing the safety and effectiveness of fMCG for diagnosis and management of patients with\n      abnormal fetal heart rate and rhythm.  We hope that the data from the study will support a\n      Humanitarian Device Exemption (HDE) application for the subject device.  The safety and\n      efficacy study designs are described below.  High-risk subjects will undergo\n      echocardiography as part of their routine clinical management, and our results will be\n      compared to the echocardiography results, as well as with postnatal ECG, when available.\n      (Since many arrhythmias resolve prior to birth, either due to resolution of disease or due\n      to treatment, only a limited number of diseases allow postnatal comparison).  For rhythms\n      that persist after birth, the diagnostic utility of fMCG and echocardiography will be\n      assessed by computing the sensitivity (Sn) and specificity (Sp) relative to postnatal ECG\n      for the following prenatal modalities: (i) the fMCG, (ii) the original (referral) echo,\n      (iii) if available, the in-lab echocardiogram at the time of the fMCG study.  Secondary\n      endpoints will assess changes in diagnosis and in clinical management due to the additional\n      information provided by fMCG, compared to the information provided by echocardiography\n      alone."

Low heart rate, or\n        bradycardia, and high heart rate, or tachycardia, are based on normative values for\n        gestation (usually below 110 -120 beats/min, or above 160-180 beats/min).  Intermittent\n        bradycardia and tachycardia are also important to detect because these arrhythmias may\n        become incessant over the course of pregnancy and have implications for patient\n        management.  Abnormal repolarization, such as long QT syndrome (LQTS), is another\n        important class of arrhythmia.  Fetuses with a family history of LQTS or a suspicious\n        rhythm (low heart rate, intermittent AV block, or ventricular tachycardia) will also be\n        studied.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        The pregnant women subjects must by aged 18 or older.  They may be excluded if they have a\n        pacemaker or other device that produces large magnetic interference.  Pacemakers in a\n        sensing mode typically do not produce large magnetic interference.  High-risk subjects\n        cannot participate if their physician in consultation with the lead physician of the study\n        does not grant permission for them to participate in the study due to risk of travel or\n        other reason."
