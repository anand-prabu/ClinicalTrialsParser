    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To examine the short-term effects of of simvastatin on the vision on
      males with choroideremia, evaluated by full-field scotopic threshold testing.  The
      investigators hypothesize that they will see a reversible decrease in the dark-adapted
      vision in participants taking simvastatin.
