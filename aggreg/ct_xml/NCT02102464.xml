      The pilot study objective is to evaluate the potential benefits of LipiFlow® System
      treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative dry eye
      by assessing for improvement in meibomian gland function and comfortable contact lens
      wearing time in comparison to an untreated control.

      This is a prospective, non-significant risk, open-label, randomized clinical trial of
      LipiFlow® treatment of contact lens wearers with meibomian gland dysfunction and evaporative
      dry eye.  All subjects undergo examination to determine study eligibility and to capture the
      Baseline status.   Subjects are randomized to receive LipiFlow® treatment (Treatment Group)
      or no LipiFlow® treatment (Untreated Control Group).  Study endpoints are evaluated at 3
      Months by comparing the Treatment Group to the Untreated Group.  To facilitate subject
      recruitment, the Untreated Control group receives Crossover LipiFlow® treatment (Crossover
      Treatment Group) at 3 Months.  Both the Treatment and Crossover Treatment groups are also
      evaluated one month after receiving LipiFlow® treatment.
