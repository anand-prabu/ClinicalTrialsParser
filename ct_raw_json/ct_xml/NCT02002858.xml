    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this research study is to enhance smoking cessation outcome among smokers
      with elevated anxiety and depression. We are comparing two group treatment approaches: (1)
      An educational-supportive psychotherapy and standard smoking cessation treatment, and (2) An
      integrated smoking cessation, and anxiety and depression management treatment program
      (SDAT). Both treatments also utilize nicotine replacement therapy.
