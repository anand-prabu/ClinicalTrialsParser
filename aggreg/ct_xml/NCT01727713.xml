  <brief_summary>

      The goal of the current trial is to determine safety of Once-daily aripiprazole in reducing
      Total Tic Severity in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tourette's Disorder is a neuropsychiatric condition that is characterized by the appearance
      of tics that can be simple or complex in nature. A tic is a sudden, rapid, recurrent,
      non-rhythmic, stereotyped motor movement or vocalization. There are a very limited number of
      medications approved for the treatment of Tourette's Disorder. The goal of the current trial
      is to obtain additional efficacy, safety, and tolerability data in a controlled condition of
      a Once-daily aripiprazole formulation in children and adolescents with Tourette's Disorder.
      The trial is a 52-week extension to the double-blind trial.

      The Once-daily tablet formulation that will be evaluated in this trial represents a daily
      dosage regimen that is intended to be administered to children and adolescents.
