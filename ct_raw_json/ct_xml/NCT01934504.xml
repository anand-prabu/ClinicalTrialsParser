      The goal of the study is to find biological markers (certain proteins or cellular markers
      found in a blood test) that will inform doctors which  AAV patients are most likely to be
      able to stop their medications suppressing their immune systems and remain in remission.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitides (AAV) are small vessel
      vasculitides that typically follow a chronic course and are associated with death and
      serious illness. Three clinical conditions are recognized: microscopic polyangiitis (MPA),
      granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's, GPA) and eosinophilic granulomatosis with
      polyangiitis (EPA, formerly Churg Strauss Syndrome). These have different clinical features
      but can have some overlapping immunological characteristics.

      The precise cause of AAV is not understood, but there are clear genetic associations which,
      in the context of predisposing environmental factors, such as infections, may lead to
      development of disease. There are no diagnostic criteria for AAV, but there are validated
      classification criteria and disease definitions. There is a need to find biological markers
      that define immunological tolerance so that immunotherapy medicines may be correctly changed
      and safely withdrawn in some people.

        Non-tolerant:  Patients who have persistently active disease. Tolerant: Those patients who
        have become ANCA negative, having been ANCA positive at the time of their acute
        presentation but have been in prolonged disease- free remission off all immunotherapy for
        at least two years.
