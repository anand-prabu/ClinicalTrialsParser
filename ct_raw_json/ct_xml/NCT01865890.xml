  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to find out if Clopidogrel (Plavix) is as effective in
      hemodialysis patients as in patients not hemodialysed.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease is very frequent in hemodialysis patients. Lot of hemodialysis
      patients are on Clopidogrel (plavix). Their is some evidence that clopidogrel is not
      effective in hemodialysis as it is effective in patient without kidney problem.

      VerifyNow plavix is a machine that measure the ability of the blood to clot after giving
      plavix.

      We will collect blood from hemodialysis patients on plavix and check the ability of their
      blood to clot and thus indirectly measuring the efficacy of Plavix.

    <description>Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) is very common in dialysis patients.  Treatment of CAD include medical therapy, stent placement and surgery.  Since Plavix is a medication that is commonly used after stent placement, we would like to assess the efficacy of this medication in this patient population.</description>
