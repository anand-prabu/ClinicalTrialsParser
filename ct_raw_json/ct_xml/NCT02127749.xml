      The purpose of this study is to determine whether treatment with antibiotics, which harm the
      gut flora, causes the immune system to be less effective.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Sepsis ranks among the top ten leading causes of death worldwide. Most
      nonsurvivors die in a state of immunosuppression. The gut microbiota exerts numerous
      beneficial functions in the host response against infections. Gut flora components express
      microorganism-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which
      are recognized by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by neutrophils and
      macrophages. MAMPs from the intestinal microbiota constitutively translocate to the
      circulation and prime bone marrow derived neutrophils via PRRs. Antibiotic treatment, which
      is standard of care for all patients with sepsis, depletes the gut microbiota and leads to a
      diminished release of MAMPs and other bacteria derived products. This causes diminished
      priming of systemic immunity, which may attribute to sepsis associated immunosuppression and
      an increased susceptibility to invading bacteria.

      Objective: To investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the systemic priming of immune
      effector cells during human endotoxemia

      Study design: Randomized, between- and within-subject-controlled intervention study in human
      volunteers

      Intervention: All subjects will receive lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin; 2 ng/kg bodyweight)
      intravenously to induce experimental endotoxemia. Eight subjects will be pretreated with
      broad spectrum antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, metronidazole) for seven days
      (washout period of 36 hours before endotoxemia), in order to deplete the gut microbiota.
      Blood and faeces will be sampled before, during and after endotoxemia.
