It is currently being tested in heart\n      failure patients and we would now like to look it its effects on diabetes.\n\n      We therefore plan to enrol 20 participants with type II diabetes into this study.  Half will\n      undergo renal denervation in addition to their standard care and the other half will act as\n      controls and only receive standard care.  Treatment allocation will be randomly assigned.\n\n      All participants will undergo screening (including a physical exam, blood tests, ultrasounds\n      and a muscle biopsy).  All patients will have follow up tests (including physical exams and\n      blood tests) 1, 3 and 6 months later."
