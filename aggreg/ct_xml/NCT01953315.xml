  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the safety of muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) for the
      treatment of urinary incontinence due to incompetent outlet (bladder neck/urethra).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible subjects with a diagnosis of urinary incontinence who give consent to take part
      will undergo a biopsy of the muscle from the inner thigh under anesthesia. The muscle sample
      will be cultured and expanded for approximately 6 weeks. The product, composed of
      autologous, ex vivo-expanded muscle progenitor cells (MPCs) in suspension, will be delivered
      via targeted injection into the bladder neck sphincter region using either an endoscopic
      needle via a cystoscope or periurethral injection under ultrasound guidance.  All subjects
      will be followed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months and 12 months post-injection.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult female patients who are not pregnant or lactating/breast-feeding and must be
             either not sexually active, surgically sterilized, or must be practicing an effective
             method of birth control as determined by the investigator (e.g., oral contraceptives,
             double barrier methods, hormonal injectable or implanted contraceptives, tubal
             ligation, or partner with vasectomy)

          -  Patients between the ages of 18 and 75 years

          -  Patients with positive diagnosis of urinary incontinence due to sphincter
             insufficiency caused by acquired (e.g., stress urinary incontinence) and/or
             congenital (bilateral ectopic ureters with incompetent bladder neck; or female
             epispadias with or without bladder exstrophy) conditions.

          -  Patients with cystometric capacity of bladder &gt; 100 ml

          -  Patients with normal renal function

          -  Patients with a history of primary incontinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a history of hypercontractile bladder, non-compliant bladder,
             hydronephrosis or neurogenic bladder

          -  Patients with an active urinary tract infection as evidenced by positive urine
             culture

          -  Patients who are taking medication that affect urination (e.g. medically necessary,

             supplements, including herbal supplements and those taken with teas

          -  Patients requiring concomitant use of or treatment with immunosuppressive agents

             diabetes and chronic liver disease (including Hepatitis B or C), that the
             Investigator believes may jeopardize the safety of the patient to participate in the
             study

          -  Patients with evidence or diagnosis of any primary muscle disease or coagulation
             disorder (including concomitant anti-coagulation therapy at enrollment)

          -  Patients who have been treated with any other investigational drug or participated in
             any investigational study within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study

          -  Patients with urinary incontinence other than the categories being investigated

             rectocele)

          -  Patients with vaginal prolapse beyond introitus

          -  Patients with neurological disorders (e.g., multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease)

          -  Patients with abnormal bladder capacity (i.e., less than 100 cc)

          -  Patients with abnormal urologic conditions, including post-void residual, urethral
             stricture and bladder neck contracture, spastic bladder, vesicoureteral reflux,
