Recent evidence suggests\n      that extremely low frequency magnetic fields (ELF-MF) could be an alternative approach for\n      acute ischemic stroke therapy because of their effects on the main mechanisms of  brain\n      ischemic damage and regeneration.The main purpose of this open label, one arm, dose\n      escalation study is the validation of ELF-MF stimulation as non-invasive, safe and effective\n      tool to promote recovery in acute ischemic stroke patients Nine patients will be treated\n      daily for 5 consecutive days, starting within 48 h from the onset of stroke. Three dose\n      cohorts of three patients each, will be stimulated with pulsed ELF-MF (75 Hz, 1,8 mT) at\n      increasing daily exposure (45, 120, 240 min).The primary outcome (safety endpoint) will be\n      evaluated by the incidence of adverse events and mortality  throughout the stimulation\n      period and the 1-year follow-up. Secondary outcomes will consist in change from baseline in\n      clinical and radiological scores."
