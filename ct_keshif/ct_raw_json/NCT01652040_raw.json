The proposed method could become a recommended\n      and simple intervention especially for individuals with limited access and poor tolerance to\n      exercise. The rationale is based on the evidence that individuals with SCI experience\n      decline in anabolic hormones which may be responsible for the deterioration in body\n      composition and metabolic profiles and leads to increase obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus,\n      dyslipidemia and subsequently cardiovascular disease. The designed study will provide\n      explanation to the adaptations in the energy source of the muscle cells in response to\n      training."

            "textblock": "Individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) are at a lifelong risk of increasing obesity and\n      several chronic metabolic disorders such as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance and\n      dyslipidemia secondary to deterioration in body composition. Within few weeks of injury,\n      there are significant decrease in whole body fat-free mass (FFM), particularly lower\n      extremity skeletal muscle mass and subsequent increase in fat mass (FM).  Resistance\n      training (RT) is an important type of exercise that has been shown to induce positive\n      physiological adaptations such as increasing lean mass and reducing metabolic disorders in\n      other clinical populations.\n\n      In a pilot work, the investigators provided evidence that evoked RT using surface\n      neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES) for knee extensor muscle group resulted in\n      significant increase skeletal muscle cross-sectional area (CSA), reduction in % leg FM and a\n      trend towards decrease in visceral adipose tissue (VAT) CSA.  The favorable adaptations in\n      body composition were associated with decrease in plasma insulin area under the curve and\n      plasma triglycerides. The investigators attributed the adaptations in body composition and\n      metabolic profile to an associated increase in plasma insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1).\n      The investigators  concluded that twelve weeks of evoked RT targeted towards evoking\n      skeletal muscle hypertrophy could result in significant body composition and metabolic\n      adaptations in individuals with SCI.\n\n      It is unclear if a longer RT program greater than 12 weeks would provide additional benefits\n      to veterans with SCI. It is also unknown whether enhancing the decline anabolic homeostasis\n      by providing testosterone (T) replacement therapy (TRT) would reverse body composition and\n      metabolic profile changes in veterans with SCI.  The major research goal of this proposal is\n      to investigate the effects of 16 weeks of evoked RT+TRT vs. TRT on body composition (muscle\n      CSA, VAT, %FM) and the metabolic profiles (glucose and lipid metabolism) in individuals with\n      motor complete SCI.  To address this goal, surface NMES accompanied with ankle weights will\n      be conducted twice weekly to exercise the knee extensor skeletal muscle groups from sitting\n      position. After 4 weeks of delayed entry approach, participants (n =24) will be randomly\n      assigned into RT+TRT (n =12) or TRT (n =12) groups.  The TRT will be provided via\n      transdermal T patches that will be alternated on both shoulders over the course of the\n      study. We also propose to study the effects of detraining on body composition and metabolic\n      profiles.\n\n      The research plan includes three specific aims\n\n      Specific aim 1 will demonstrate the effects of NMES RT and/or Testosterone patches (Tp) on\n      the CSA of thighs and legs skeletal muscle groups, percentage FFM, and the CSA of VAT,\n      intramuscular fat and percentage FM after 16 weeks of training+Tp and 16 weeks of\n      detraining.\n\n      Specific aim 2 will determine the changes in metabolic milieu (resting energy expenditure,\n      glucose homeostasis, lipid profile, free fatty acids, serum total and free testosterone and\n      IGF-1), and cytokines (c-reactive protein, tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-6 as\n      inflammatory biomarkers) after 16 weeks of training+Tp and detraining.\n\n      Specific aim 3 will determine if 16 weeks of evoked RT and Tp will increase GLUT-4\n      concentration, muscle IGF-1 and peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor-gamma\n      co-activator 1 (PGC-1) expressions, altered fiber type distribution and enhance the\n      mitochondrial enzymatic activities (electron transport chain) compared to Tp only."
