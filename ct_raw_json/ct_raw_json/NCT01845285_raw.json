According to routine practice, the heart team (interventional\n      cardiologist and cardiothoracic surgeon) makes a choice to use the Direct Flow Medical\n      Aortic Valve System, compared to other available TAVR prostheses, on the basis of clinical\n      and surgical considerations. Therefore, the valve is implanted when the heart team decides\n      that this product is best suited to the specific patient.\n\n      In order to be enrolled in this Registry, the patient must be a candidate for the\n      implantation of the Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic Valve System, based on the\n      commercial indications as stated in the Instructions for Use.\n\n      Therefore, candidates for this study must meet the following criteria (Indications for Use):\n\n        1. Age > 70 years old\n\n        2. Severe aortic valve stenosis determined by echocardiogram and Doppler:\n\n             -  mean gradient >40 mmHg or peak jet velocity >4.0 m/s\n\n             -  aortic valve area \u22640.8 cm2 or aortic valve area index \u22640.5 cm2/m2 All the Registry\n                clinical evaluations and tests performed are generally considered standard of care\n                for TAVR patients. When these recommendations conflict with the standard of care\n                at the Registry site, the standard of care should prevail. In addition to the\n                standard of care, the Sponsor recommends one brief additional evaluation (the\n                EQ-5D quality of life measure) be conducted.

This study intends to monitor\n           the clinical condition of the patient for a period of 3 years after the operation. By\n           agreeing to participate, the patient agrees to undergo clinical assessments and\n           specific tests at certain intervals (prior to the procedure; during the implantation;\n           at hospital discharge, at 30 days after the procedure, and at 1 year, 2 and 3 years\n           later); the patient also agrees to the collection of these daThe purpose of this\n           Registry is to monitor outcomes data for the Direct Flow Medical Transcatheter Aortic\n           Valve System in the Post Market phase.
