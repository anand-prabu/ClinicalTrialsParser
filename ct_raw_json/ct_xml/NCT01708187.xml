  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Peroneal tendon tears are a common etiology encountered by foot and ankle surgeons.  Like
      all flexor tendon repairs adhesions are one of the more common challenges after surgery.
      Peroneal tendon gliding is key to their function as effective plantar flexors and evertors
      of the hindfoot.  Scarring and adhesion correlate directly with the amount of inflammatory
      reaction at the wound site (Adzick 1994).  Our goal is to have a surgical technique that
      allows for standard suture repair of the tendon yet allows for smooth gliding of the tendon
      with minimal adhesions. A prospective review on the surgical repair of the peroneal tendons
      utilizing NEOX™1k (Amniox Medical, Marietta, GA), cryopreserved Human Amniotic Membrane
      (C-HAM) graft will be performed.  The investigators hypothesize that the use of
      cryopreserved Human Amniotic Membrane in conjunction with a peroneal tendon repair will
      decrease that amount of inflammation, overall recovery time of surgically repaired peroneal
      tendon tears, and adhesions.
