  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy may be an unpleasant procedure. Sedation and/or analgesics is therefore
      routinely administered in most countries. In Norway, however, routine sedation is rare, and
      medication is normally given on demand, that is, if necessary during the procedure. The
      investigators want to evaluate whether the effect of fentanyl, a synthetic opioid with fast
      onset of action, is better given before the procedure than during the procedure.
