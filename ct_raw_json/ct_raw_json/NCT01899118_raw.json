Nimotuzumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody\n      against epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) has been reported to improve the therapeutic\n      effect of radiotherapy in some cancers. This study is a clinical phase II trial designed to\n      evaluate the efficacy of the combination of Nimotuzumab administered concurrently with\n      neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy in patients with locally advanced rectal cancer, and to\n      further investigate its side-effect and toxicity."
