    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of  nanosilver fluoride for controlling the
      growth of S. mutans present in dental plaque of children.

      The product will be apllied on cervical vestibular surfaces of incisors and canines healthy,
      with a total of 8 teeth, 4 upper and 4 below. Children will be instructed not to ingest any
      liquid or food within two hours after application. After a period of 7 days will be carried
      biofilm colect of cervical dental surfaces of incisors and / or canines upper and lower,
      with the aid of sterile spatulas. This material will be packaged in pre-weighed microfuge
      tubes containing 1.5 ml of buffered saline solution (0.9% sodium chloride), and transported
      under refrigeration immediately to the laboratory where analysis will be performed and the
      S. mutans colonies will be  counted. The biofilm collect and posterior laboratorial analysis
      will be performed weekly.

    <description>This product is a solution composed of: 390 mg / ml 9nm silver nanoparticles ;21 mg / ml chitosan ; 22 mg / ml NaF.The cariostatic agent, nanosilver fluoride, was formulated in a similar way to silver diamine fluoride, so that this new formulation contained 5% nanosilver fluoride, while commercial diamine silver fluoride contains 30% silver fluoride.  It will be applied once with a microbrush on tooth surfaces to check if it prevents the growth of S. mutans biofilms on dental surfaces.</description>

    <description>The product will be applied in the volunteers in the morning, before the first class, in relative isolation, made with cotton rolls and Vaseline to protect the soft tissue. It will apply 30mg of the product with microbrush, previously standardized in a pilot study on cervical vestibular surfaces of incisors and canines healthy, on a total of 8 teeth, 4 upper and 4 lower. After a period of 7 days,the cervical dental biofilms will be collect, third on the buccal surfaces of incisors and / or canines upper and lower, with the aid of sterile spatulas.</description>
