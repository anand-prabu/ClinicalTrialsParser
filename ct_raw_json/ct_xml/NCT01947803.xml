      This study is a single-group, open-label (name of study drug is known to patients),
      multicenter study to evaluate the safety and efficacy/treatment response of paliperidone
      palmitate administered for 25 weeks as once-monthly injections to Chinese patients with
      schizophrenia who previously received treatment with oral antipsychotic medications. A
      target of 353 patients (inpatients or outpatients) with schizophrenia will be enrolled in
      the study and will receive injections of study drug (paliperidone palmitate) on Days 1 and
      8, and thereafter at a monthly flexible dose, based on patients' tolerability and/or
      efficacy. The study will consist of a screening period of up to 1 week before treatment, a
      25-week treatment period, and a follow-up period approximately 30 days after the last
      injection of study drug. Upon meeting the entry criteria for the study, patients will
      receive a total of 8 intramuscular (IM) injections of paliperidone palmitate during the
      treatment period as follows: 150 mg equivalent (eq) on Day 1, 100 mg eq on Day 8, and
      subsequent monthly IM injections with a flexible dose range of 75-150 mg eq. If the patient
      reports any signs or symptoms of worsening of schizophrenia, the investigator may prescribe
      a rescue medication (quick-relief or fast-acting medications that usually work right away to
      relieve symptoms) such as lorazepam (an antianxiety drug) to control agitation,
      irritability, restlessness, and hostility. Safety will be monitored throughout the study.

    <description>PANSS is used for measuring symptom severity of patients with schizophrenia. PANSS includes a total score (sum of 30 items) and 3 subscale scores including positive subscale (7 items), Negative subscale (7 items) and General psychopathology subscale (16 items). The rank of each scale is rated from 1 point (absent) to 7 points (extreme).</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PSP scale is used for evaluation of a patient's personal and social functions. PSP is used for degrees of difficulties on four functioning dimensions during previous 1 month: socially useful activities, personal and social relationships, self-care and disturbing and aggressive behaviors. Every dimension is rated (i. absent to vi. very severe). PSP total scores range from 1-100, which are divided into 10 ratings to assess difficulties degrees. Ratings from 71-100 reflect only mild difficulties; ratings from 31-70 reflect manifest disabilities of various degrees; ratings â‰¤30 reflect functioning so poor that intensive support or supervision is needed.</description>

Monthly doses can be administered in either the deltoid or gluteal muscle alternatively. All the antipsychotics should be discontinued prior to the first dose of study drug. Other antipsychotics are prohibited across this study.</description>
