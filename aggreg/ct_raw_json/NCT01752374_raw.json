Nausea was defined as\n      the subjectively unpleasant sensation associated with awareness of the urge to vomit;\n      vomiting included retching (defined as the laboured spastic, rhythmic contraction of the\n      respiratory muscles without the expulsion of the gastric contents) and vomiting (defined as\n      the forceful expulsion of gastric contents from the mouth) [11]. A complete response was\n      defined as no PONV and no need for rescue anti-emetic drug. If two or more episodes of PONV\n      occurred during the study period, a rescue anti-emetic (metoclopramide 10 mg) was given IV.\n      The primary outcome was the incidence of nausea during the study period."
