PVI was performed from the epicardial side with a bipolar RF ablation clamp (AtriCure). At least 2 overlapping applications around each of the ipsilateral veins were made, and isolation was confirmed by the absence of PV potentials and exit block during pacing. An additional application was made in the interatrial Waterston groove in the right side to isolate the ganglionic plexi from the atria. On the left side, the ligament of Marshal was cut, but no additional ablation of ganglionic plexi was pursued.\nThe RevealXT (implantable loop recorder) was implanted in the parasternal area of the chest. The requirement for defining the exact final position was an R-wave amplitude \u22650.4 mV assessed through the Vector Check."
