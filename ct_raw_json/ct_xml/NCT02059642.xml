      This study is a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2/3 study of
      MG01CI (1400 mg once daily) for 6 weeks compared with placebo in a 1:1 ratio of 300 adults
      with ADHD. The study comprises a Screening Visit at which initial assessment will be made
      and then a Washout Period during which prospective subjects must discontinue ADHD medication
      for 14 days (for psychotropic medications other than fluoxetine) or for 28 days (for
      fluoxetine) before randomization into the study. The Washout Period is 14 days, but may be
      extended to 28 days for a fluoxetine washout. Subjects requiring either a 14-day or a 28-day
      Washout Period will have an Interim Visit (off drug) on or about Day -8 (Day -10 to Day -3)
      for CAARS-Inv assessment after the Washout Period. The Baseline CAARS Inv assessment will be
      conducted on Day 0. If there is a ≥25% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Interim
      Visit (off drug) assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return
      for the Baseline CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. For subjects not
      needing washout, if there is a ≥25% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Screening
      Visit assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return for the
      Baseline CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. Following the Washout
      Period for those requiring a washout, or following the Screening Visit for those subjects
      who do not require a washout, eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments and be
      randomized on Day 0 to MG01CI 1400 mg or to matching placebo and begin the Double-blind
      Treatment Period. The Double-blind Treatment Period will be 6 weeks in duration. There will
      be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early termination.
