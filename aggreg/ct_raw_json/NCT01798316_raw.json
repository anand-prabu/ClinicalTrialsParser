In clinical\n      studies, a significant opioid-sparing effect has been documented with a substantial\n      percentage of patients avoiding the need for opioid rescue medication altogether. This\n      avoidance or delay in the use of opioids has been shown to reduce undesirable side effects.\n      It is proposed that the use of IV acetaminophen as 1st line analgesic regimen in the post\n      anesthesia care unit (PACU) for postoperative analgesia after laparoscopic cholecystectomy\n      will result in decreased incidence of post operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) without\n      compromising patient pain control and satisfaction."
