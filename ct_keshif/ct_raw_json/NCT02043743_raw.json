This condition occurs in approximately 1% of women and it has\n      important physical and psychological consequences/impact in those patients.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to investigate the role of the transplantation of bone marrow\n      derived stem cells into ovarian tissue for treatment of premature ovarian failure and to\n      assess their ability to differentiate into germ cells."

Sixty women with premature ovarian failure will be recruited in this study after a\n      written informed consent. Diagnosis will be based mainly on history taking, physical\n      examination and investigations. Laboratory investigations will include Serum\n      follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), serum estrogen measurement and serum AMH. The anterior\n      pituitary secretes FSH and LH at high levels due to the dysfunction of the ovaries and\n      consequent low estrogen levels. Typical FSH in POF patients is over 40 mlU/ml\n      (post-menopausal range).  Subjects will be enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion\n      criteria and evaluated at regular post transplant intervals.  Human adult bone marrow\n      derived stem cells will be transplanted by a gynecological surgeon through a standard\n      surgical approach (transvaginal U/S guided approach).           Subjects will be monitored\n      frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem cells cell injection.  For\n      safety of participants, Bone Marrow Stem cells will be injected in one ovary only and the\n      other ovary will be spared."
