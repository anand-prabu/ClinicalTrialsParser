Determine the maximum tolerated dose of oxaliplatin when combined with fluorouracil and\n      external beam radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the rectum.\n\n      (Phase I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003). II. Determine the pathological response\n      rate in patients treated with this preoperative regimen and surgical resection.\n\n      III.Determine the late toxicity of this preoperative regimen in these patients. IV.\n      Determine, in a preliminary manner, the progression-free survival, local control, and\n      overall survival in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation, multicenter study of oxaliplatin.\n\n      Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, fluorouracil IV continuously on days\n      1-7, and radiotherapy on days 1-5. Treatment repeats weekly for a maximum of 6 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting  toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients\n      are treated at that dose level in the phase II portion of the study. (Phase I closed to\n      accrual effective 03/27/2003). Patients may undergo radical resection of rectal tumor within\n      4-6 weeks after completion of chemoradiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study (phase\n      I closed to accrual effective 03/27/2003) and a total of 19 patients will be accrued for\n      phase II of the study within 12-18 months."
