      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of two different dosing
      regimens of AP26113 in patients with anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive locally
      advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) whose disease has progressed on
      therapy with crizotinib.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, phase 2, open-label, multicenter, international study to evaluate the
      efficacy and safety of two different dosing regimens of AP26113 in patients with
      ALK-positive, locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC who have previously been treated with
      crizotinib.

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the efficacy of AP26113, as evidenced by
      confirmed objective response rate (ORR).  Two dosing regimens will be tested.  The secondary
      objectives of the study (for each dosing regimen) include overall survival (OS);
      progression-free survival (PFS); safety and tolerability.  It is estimated that accrual will
      be complete within 18 months; the total estimated duration of the study is 3 years.
