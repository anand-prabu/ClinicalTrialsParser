Patients also receive carboplatin IV over 1 hour on day 2 of week 1\n      only. Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-5 patients receive escalating doses of docetaxel until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 5 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
