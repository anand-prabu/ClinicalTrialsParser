In the first cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are randomized 1:2 to\n      either control (standard intraop opioid at anesthesiologists' discretion) or methadone HCl\n      (0.4 mg/kg ideal body weight, IBW). In the second cohort (n=30 evaluable), subjects are\n      randomized 1:2 to either control (standard intraop opioid) or methadone HCl (0.5 mg/kg ideal\n      body weight, IBW). Subjects in the study groups will receive methadone (IV bolus, after\n      induction of anesthesia) as their primary intraoperative opioid, rather than leaving the\n      choice of intraoperative opioid to the anesthesiologist. Intraoperative breakthrough pain\n      will be treated at the discretion of the anesthesiologist with fentanyl. In the control\n      groups, intraoperative opioid administration will be left at the discretion of the\n      anesthesia providers. Patient controlled analgesia as prescribed by the clinical team, using\n      hydromorphone or morphine, will be used to treat postoperative pain relief."
