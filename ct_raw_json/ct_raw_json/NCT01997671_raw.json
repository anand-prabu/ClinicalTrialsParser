This information is updated monthly for 12 consecutive months.Information\n      will be presented in two different and complementary ways to each practitioner: asynchronous\n      information (the patient is not present when the practitioner receives the information) and\n      synchronous information (the patient is present when the practitioner receives the\n      information).\n\n      VARIABLES:\n\n        1. Primary Outcomes are:\n\n             -  Variable RETIRA: new lipid-lowering treatments initiated during the year prior to\n                the intervention, seen as inadequate and withdrawn during the intervention period.\n\n             -  Variable EVITA: New lipid-lowering treatments started during the intervention\n                period and considered as inadequate.\n\n        2. Secondary Outcomes are:\n\n             -  Variable COST: total cost of the inadequate new lipid-lowering treatments.\n\n             -  Variable RECORD: recording of the cardiovascular risk.\n\n      2.Other variables:\n\n        -  Principal: intervention/control group assignment of health professional.\n\n        -  Patient variables: demographic and clinical.\n\n        -  Professional variables: quality of care indicators.\n\n      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive analysis, agreggated at health professional level, will be\n      performed and subsequently multilevel analysis techniques will be used to estimate the\n      effect of intervention according to hierarchic data structure and, in particular, patient\n      variables effect."
