            "textblock": "Sleep disorders (SD) are common in adults with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on dialysis with\n      a reported prevalence of 60-80%. To date three studies have reported on SDs in children with\n      CKD but these have all been based on questionnaire data alone.  The findings were not\n      confirmed with polysomnograms (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SD, or actigraphy, a\n      validated tool to assess the sleep/ wake cycle over a prolonged period in the home. This is\n      highly relevant given the poor sensitivity and specificity of even validated questionnaires\n      alone. The effect of untreated pediatric SD is pervasive. This study will provide the first\n      objective assessment of SDs using PSGs in children with severe CKD, both on and off\n      dialysis. Therefore, we will recognize and when possible treat SD in this severe CKD cohort\n      potentially contributing to their immediate management (eg improved control of hypertension,\n      improved school performance), while improving their Quality of Life (QOL) and helping ensure\n      they achieve their full potential."
