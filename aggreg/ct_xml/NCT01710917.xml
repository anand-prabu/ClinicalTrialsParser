  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-interventional, observational study evaluates the efficacy of Targinact with regard
      to quality of life in daily clinical practice in Belgium compared to the previous analgesic
      treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients are treated with Targinact® according to daily clinical practice during at least 12
      weeks and are monitored during study 3 visits. Parameters assessed are overall health
      assessment of the patient, pain relief, constipation, use of laxatives, use of analgesic
      rescue medication, use of concomitant medication, quality of life and safety of Targinact®
      treatment. These parameters, except for safety assessment, are compared between Targinact®
      treatment and previous analgesic treatment.

    <description>The primary parameter to assess the efficacy of Targinact® treatment with respect to the quality of life (overall health assessment/EQ-VAS) in patients with chronic severe pain compared to previous analgesic treatment is the absolute change in overall health score (0-100) attributed by patients during Targinact® treatment compared to previous analgesic treatment.
During each visit, patients will be asked to score their overall health state between 0 (worst health state imaginable) and 100 (best health state imaginable). The absolute changes in overall health assessment from baseline at V2 and V3 will be used to compare health assessment during Targinact® treatment.</description>
