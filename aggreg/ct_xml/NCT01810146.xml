  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      60 patients scheduled for bariatric surgery will be included into 3 categories (20 patients
      with non complicated obesity, 20 patients with metabolic syndrome and 20 patients with a
      type 2 diabetes or hypertension). 20 volunteers will be enrolled as normal referents. The
      patients and the volunteers will have a classical pre-operative check-up (fibroscopy,
      oesophageal pHmetry and manometry) and extra investigations as isotopic gastric empty exam,
      lactulose oro-caecal transit exam, intestinal permeability test calculated by
      lactulose-manitol ratio urinary excretion. Intestinal and colonic biopsies will be also
      provided for studying permeability. For only patients, samples from the gastric resection
      will be  provided for analysing the enteric nervous system and motricity.
