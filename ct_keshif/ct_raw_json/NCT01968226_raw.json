PET images will be analyzed to determine the standard uptake\n      value (SUV) of [F-18]RGD-K5 uptake by the carotid artery plaque and this will be compared to\n      the SUV of the background (blood pool in the aorta).  This will be expressed as a target to\n      background ratio (TBR).  We expect to find a significant uptake of [F-18]RGD-K5 by carotid\n      artery palque and we therefore expect to find a TBR that is significantly >1.  We also\n      expect to find that plaque from patients who show a TBR >1 will also be enriched for\n      histologic markers for inflammation and angiogenesis."
