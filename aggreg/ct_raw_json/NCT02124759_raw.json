Also we will test\n      the hypothesis that the inflammatory response and insulin resistance caused by high fat\n      ingestion can be ameliorated by administering\n\n        -  a synbiotic (bifidobacterium and oligofructose) which protects the intestinal\n           epithelial barrier and decreases intestinal translocation of LPS; and\n\n        -  sevelamer, an agent which sequesters LPS in the gastrointestinal tract limiting its\n           translocation into the circulation."
