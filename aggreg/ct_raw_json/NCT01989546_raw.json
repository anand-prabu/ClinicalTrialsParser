For this reason and\n        because PARP inhibitors are known to be teratogenic, women of childbearing potential and\n        men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;\n        abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and for 30 days\n        after completing study treatment.
