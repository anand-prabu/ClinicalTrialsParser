When the lower heart chambers (i.e. ventricles) are\n      electrically paced to beat together by the CRT pacemaker, blood may be pumped to the body\n      more efficiently.\n\n      The CRT pacemaker being studied in this clinical trial is approved by the US Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) for patients with moderate to severe heart failure, whose hearts pump\n      blood inefficiently. In the MIRACLE EF study, patients who have heart failure with slightly\n      less inefficient hearts will be observed to see if the electrical pacing treatment is better\n      than not getting the treatment. This study is being conducted to support FDA approval of\n      this type of pacemaker for people whose heart failure is less inefficient."

The purpose of this study is to evaluate market released CRT\n      pacemaker (CRT-P) devices in symptomatic HF patients with less severe left ventricular\n      systolic dysfunction, specifically patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction\n      (LVEF) in the range of 36% to 50%. This study will support expansion of indications for CRT\n      worldwide. The outcome of this study is expected to support modification of existing U.S.\n      and Japanese labeling for Medtronic's implantable CRT-P devices and to provide further\n      evidence to support changes to cardiology practice guidelines (ACC/AHA, ESC guidelines)\n      regarding the use of CRT in patients with mild to moderate HF.\n\n      Following enrollment and the baseline assessment, eligible subjects will be implanted with a\n      CRT-P system and randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either treatment (CRT-P ON) or control\n      (CRT-P OFF) groups. Study subjects will be followed for a minimum of 24 months or until\n      study closure, and will remain in their randomized groups until their 60 month visit or\n      until the study is stopped, whichever comes first. The effectiveness of CRT-P in this\n      population will be assessed using a composite endpoint of time to first event, with event\n      defined as All-cause mortality or HF Event. To assess the safety of CRT-P in this\n      population, the primary safety endpoint will measure freedom from system-related\n      complications at 6 months post-implant."

It then analyzes the heart rhythm based on selectable detection parameters. The device responds to bradyarrhythmias by providing bradycardia pacing therapy.\nSimultaneous or sequential biventricular pacing is used to provide patients with cardiac resynchronization therapy.
