    <description>Samarium tracer infusion of 1 mCi/kg administered. SPECT images wil be used to determine the distribution of dose delivered to the tumor. This information will be used to determine target doses of external beam radiotherapy. The treatment infusion of Samarium, 30 mCi/kg, will be administered and dosimetry will confirm total dose delivered, and information will be used to finalize doses of external beam radiotherapy. Approximately 14 days after treatment infusion, previoulsy harvested autologous peripheral blood or bone marrow stem cells will be infused in order to ameliorate the expected myelosuppression. Radiotherapy will be delivered according to the judgement of the treating radiation oncologist.</description>

    <description>First, patients will receive a &quot;tracer&quot; infusion of Samarium-153 EDTMP at 1 mCi/kg. We will perform 3D dosimetry using SPECT images after administration of the &quot;tracer&quot; activity to determine the distribution of dose delivered to the tumor and surrounding normal tissues. &quot;Tracer&quot; activity will be applied to development of the external beam radiation planning.  Second &quot;treatment&quot; infusion of Samarium will then be implemented. Maximum activity administered will be 30 mCi/kg. After the &quot;treatment&quot; infusion, SPECT scans will again be performed to confirm the total dose delivered and subsequently adjust the external beam portion of the treatment plan, as necessary.</description>
