Increasingly, non-pharmacological treatments for\n      insomnia are showing promise as complementary and alternative medicine treatments. Many of\n      these awareness training programs (ATPs) perform as well as, or even better than,\n      medications. This study will determine whether Mind-Body Bridging (MBB), an ATP that teaches\n      awareness/mindfulness and cognitive skills, is more effective than a common sleep\n      medication, Zolpidem. The study will also determine whether MBB exhibits additional benefits\n      in co-morbid mental health conditions, including, stress, PTSD, depression, etc, compared\n      with that of Zolpidem. This will offer soldiers additional treatment options for insomnia in\n      the hope that it will improve both sleep and other common comorbidities."
