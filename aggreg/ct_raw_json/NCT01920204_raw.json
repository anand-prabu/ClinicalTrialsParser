Almost all patients have fatigue, a compromised quality of life,\n      hampering normal functioning. Because this form of mastocytosis is not considered\n      life-threatening, mast cell eradication has never been applied and patients receive only\n      symptomatic therapy with histamine blockers. Midostaurin, a c-KIT inhibitor has shown\n      activity regarding symptom control and decrease of malignant mast cells in patients with\n      aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM) or mast cell leukemia"

To study whether symptom improvement persists at 6 months, and whether midostaurin can\n           reduce mast cell infiltration in the skin and bone marrow, documented by decrease of\n           serum tryptase, decrease of urticaria pigmentosa and decrease of bone marrow mast\n           cells.\n\n        2. To assess safety and tolerability of midostaurin in the above mentioned settings\n\n      Study design: Single arm, open label pilot phase II study.\n\n      Study population: Adult patients (n=20) with histologically documented systemic\n      mastocytosis, indolent or smoldering subtype, with severe symptoms, not controlled by\n      histamine 1 and 2 blockers.\n\n      Intervention: treatment with Midostaurin, twice daily 100 mg orally for 6 months\n      continuously."
