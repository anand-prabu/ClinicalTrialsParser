  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Solid organ transplant recipients (SOTR) have a 3-5x increased occurrence of cancer in
      contrast to the general population with basal and squamous cell skin cancer. The use of
      immunosuppressant or anti-rejection drugs that are needed after SOTR is known to increase
      the risk of developing certain kinds of cancer. The purpose of this study is to find out how
      well Sirolimus (also known as Rapamune) works at treating squamous cell carcinoma in renal
      transplant patients.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II randomized study to evaluate the effectiveness of Sirolimus in treating
      and preventing squamous cell skin cancer carcinoma using a Simon's 2-stage design. As part
      of the study, after the biopsy results of the skin cancer show squamous cell carcinoma and
      consent  had been obtain, the participant will begin taking  Sirolimus. The  calcineurin
      inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) will be discontinued once the  transplant doctors
      find that the participants Sirolimus is therapeutic by checking blood tests once a week x 3
      weeks. Approximately 5 weeks after starting Sirolimus, the  squamous cell skin cancer  will
      be removed by a surgeon. Participant next follow up  visit for  the study is scheduled one
      year post-operatively. .The study will look at your squamous cell skin cancer under the
      microscope to see if sirolimus had any effect at treating your squamous cell skin cancer.
