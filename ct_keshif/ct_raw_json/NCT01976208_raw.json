Response to Omalizumab will be assessed by the overall improvement in control of\n      asthma.\n\n      Omalizumab is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to human\n      immunoglobulin E(IgE). The antibody has a molecular weight of approximately 150 kilodaltons\n      and produced by Chinese Hamster Ovary cell.\n\n      Omalizumab inhibits the binding of IgE to the high-affinity IgE receptor on the surface of\n      mast cells and basophils. Reduction in surface-bound IgE on cells limits the degree of\n      release of mediators of the allergic response."
