            "textblock": "Testicular hydrocele is a common disorder even though it\u00b4s exact prevalence is unknown. In\n      areas with filariasis it\u00b4s endemic.\n\n      Hydrocele is a benign condition where fluid accumulates in between two layers of tunica\n      vaginalis (embryologically, the peritoneum), surrounding the testicle. The cause is unknown\n      but inflammatory conditions is believed to induce these changes. The pathogenesis of\n      hydrocele is believed to be a nonbalanced secretion and resorption of fluid.\n\n      Diagnosis of hydrocele is easy since the patient presents with an enlarged scrotum and\n      clinical investigation including palpation and transillumination of the scrotum confirms the\n      diagnosis. A scrotal ultrasound might be indicated to rule out a malignancy or if the\n      diagnosis is unclear.\n\n      Treatment for hydrocele is only indicated when the patient has symptoms since all treatment\n      modalities carries risk of complications, such as hematoma, infection, pain and even\n      infertility concerns has been raised.\n\n      Operative management is considered the golden standard of treatment when considering\n      recurrence but less invasive procedures such as sclerotherapy is frequently used, mainly due\n      to cost and complications issues.\n\n      Lord\u00b4s procedure has in several series shown low frequency of complications and excellent\n      recurrence  rates. However, Lord\u00b4s procedure and sclerotherapy has not been tested head to\n      head and the optimal treatment for hydrocele is yet to be determined.\n\n      This study aims to compare these techniques and evaluate the results within 1 year after\n      randomization on cure, complication rates and various secondary descriptive outcomes.\n\n      The investigators aim to adhere to CONSORT."
