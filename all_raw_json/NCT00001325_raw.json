            "textblock": "This study is designed to use positron emission tomography to measure brain energy use.\n      Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a technique used to investigate the functional\n      activity of the brain.  The PET technique allows doctors to study the normal processes of\n      the brain (central nervous system) of normal individuals and patients with neurologic\n      illnesses without physical / structural damage to the brain.\n\n      When a region of the brain is active, it uses more fuel in the form of oxygen and sugar\n      (glucose).  As the brain uses more fuel it produces more waste products, carbon dioxide and\n      water.  Blood carries fuel to the brain and waste products away from the brain.  As brain\n      activity increases blood flow to and from the area of activity increases also.\n\n      Researchers can label a sugar with a small radioactive molecule called FDG\n      (fluorodeoxyglucose).  As areas of the brain use more sugar the PET scan will detect the FDG\n      and show the areas of the brain that are active.  By using this technique researchers hope\n      to answer the following questions;\n\n      4. Are changes in brain energy use (metabolism) present early in the course of epilepsy\n\n      5. Do changes in brain metabolism match the severity of patient's seizures\n\n      6. Do changes in metabolism occur over time or in response to drug therapy"
