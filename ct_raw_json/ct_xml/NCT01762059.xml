  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the hypothesis that a wearable automated bionic pancreas system that
      automatically delivers both insulin and glucagon can improved glycemic control vs. usual in
      the outpatient environment.

    <description>Closed-loop blood glucose control with a bi-hormonal bionic endocrine pancreas designed by Edward Damiano and Firas El-Khatib of Boston University. The device will deliver insulin lispro (Humalog) and glucagon based on blood glucose levels estimated by a continuous glucose monitoring device (Dexcom G4 Platinum) and a proprietary dosing algorithm. Blood glucose control will be automated for 5 days during which volunteers will sleep in a hotel and roam freely in downtown Boston during the day. There will be no restrictions on diet or exercise.</description>
