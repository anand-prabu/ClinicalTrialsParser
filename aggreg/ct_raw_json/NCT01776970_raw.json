There many arguments\n      supporting the use of cannabinoid derivatives in motor neuron diseases. Cannabinoids\n      receptor is expresses both in the brain and in the spinal cord. In animal models\n      cannabinoids have an anti-spasticity effect. Moreover recent studies on ALS animal models\n      demonstrated a neuroprotective effect of  cannabinoids, including  the  preservation of the\n      motor ability and  a survival increase of the treated animals. Recently many clinical trials\n      (some of them performed at the Neurological Division of San Raffaele Hospital) demonstrated\n      cannabinoid efficacy on spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis patients. CAnnabinois would be able\n      to reduce spasticity with no secondary weakness effect on treated patients. The results of\n      these studies led to the drug approval in certain countries and by the European Community\n      for the treatment of spasticity in Multiple Sclerosis.\n\n      The aim of this study is to analyze the safety, tolerability and efficacy profile of a\n      Cannabis Sativa (Sativex) derivative on patients affected by spasticity due to motor neuron\n      disease ( Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Primary Lateral Sclerosis). The study will be\n      performed along 7 weeks. During the first week will be asked patients to note down in the\n      clinical diary elements related to their symptomatology. Afterwards patients will be\n      randomized in two groups: drug-treated and placebo treated. The study will be followed by a\n      6-weeks open-label phase during which all patients will receive the active drug (Phase B)"
