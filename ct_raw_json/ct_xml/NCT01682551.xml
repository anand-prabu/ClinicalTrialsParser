      This trial is aimed to evaluate the effects of &quot;Wu Zhu Yu Tang&quot; on the prevention of Acute
      Mountain Sickness(AMS).

      This study is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. It aims to
      demonstrate that (1) Chinese medicine prescription &quot;Wu Zhu Yu Tang&quot; can prevent Acute
      Mountain Sickness(AMS) (2) &quot;Wu Zhu Yu Tang&quot; can prevent AMS especially for Yang-Xu body
      constitution.

      We will randomize 240 unacclimatized healthy adults. They will be randomized after
      stratification of the Yang-Xu score and the AMS history to receive Chinese medicine during
      one ascent and placebo during the other ascent. We will take them in Hehuan mountain for two
      days hike (24 hours) and an overnight over 3,000m. One month before the study, the subjects
      will fill the &quot;Body Constitution Questionnaire BCQ&quot; in order to evaluate their body
      constitution. Before, during and after the two days hike we will measure their blood
      pressure, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation. The incidence of AMS will be measured
      by the Lake Louise Self Report (Lake Louise Score ≥4 with headache), we will also report the
      Lake Louise Clinical Assessment score and Lake Louise Functional Score.
