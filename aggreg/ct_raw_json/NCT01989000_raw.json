First, to assess reproducibility, patients with pancreatic cancer will undergo\n      MRI twice, once in the AMC and once in the EMC. Next, 40 consecutive patients that will\n      undergo surgery+adjuvant treatment will have MRI and 18F-HX4-PET/CT measurements once to\n      assess the value of the techniques to predict outcome of standard treatment. 40 patients who\n      will undergo preoperative radiochemotherapy will have MRI and 18F-HX4-PET/CT at baseline,\n      and 1 week before surgery. We will assess the relative contribution of each imaging method\n      as well as the integrated use of these methods as predictive markers for survival and\n      pathological response to treatment. Tumor tissue from resected patients will be analyzed for\n      markers of tumor vascularization (CD31, VEGF), hypoxia (HIF1alfa, GLUT1, CA9), and stromal\n      activation (smooth muscle actin, markers for Hedgehog pathway activity). Results will be\n      correlated with imaging parameters, as well as patient outcome."
