  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Metabolic syndrome is a condition involving elevated levels of fat in the blood, a tendency
      towards diabetes, hypertension, and too much fat around the abdomen (an increased
      waistline). Individuals with metabolic syndrome often have impaired glucose tolerance, which
      is a condition where blood sugar is normal when fasting (before eating), but is too high
      after drinking a sugary drink. This is due to an abnormality in the body's sensitivity to
      insulin (insulin resistance), which is due in part to an inability of the muscle to take up
      glucose.

      People with metabolic syndrome have inflammation in their fat tissue and in their blood
      stream, and the changes in the level of inflammatory chemicals produced by cells in your fat
      tissues will be studied.  One possible source of the inflammation may be the bacteria in the
      intestine.  When individuals eat fatty foods, some of the bacterial products become attached
      to the fat in their blood and then get directed to fat tissue.  The investigators wish to
      determine whether individuals have an excessive amount of inflammation in their fat tissues,
      and whether this inflammation comes from the bacteria in their intestines.  To determine
      this, the investigators wish to treat individuals with an antibiotic that reduces the
      bacteria in their intestines and in their blood, and determine whether this reduces their
      overall level of inflammation.

      This is a randomized, placebo controlled proof of concept study that will examine the
      investigational drug Rifaximin Soluble Solid Dispersion (SSD) ability to reduce gut
      microbiota and thereby reduce adipose inflammation and improve insulin resistance.

      Each subject enrolled will undergo a fat tolerance test with a high fat meal, an oral
      glucose tolerance test, a fat biopsy, and a euglycemic clamp.  Following their successful
      completion of those procedures subjects will be randomized to study treatment.  That
      treatment will involve receiving the investigational drug,80 mg per day of  rifaximin
      soluable solid dispersion (SDD), or placebo for 8 weeks.  All procedures will be performed
      on the Clinical Services Core of the CCTS.  The initial visit will involve informed consent,
      and routine labs (comprehensive metabolic panel, lipid panel, TSH, CBC with platelets).
      These routine labs are for safety purposes and to rule out exclusionary disorders.  A stool
      sample will also be collected and frozen for possible future analysis of bacterial
      microflora.

      Subjects will be asked to allow the principal investigator to bank blood and tissue samples
      collected during this study that are not used for other study related tests.  No additional
      blood or tissue samples will be collected.  If the subject agrees to the banking of their
      blood and tissue samples they will be stored in the Principal Investigator's laboratory at
      the University of Kentucky for an indefinite period of time or until they are used up.
      Stored samples will be used for future research testing to learn about how to prevent,
      detect, or treat insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, diabetes or other health problems.

      Each subject will undergo total body composition testing using a total body dual-energy
      x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scan.  The DXA scan measures the subject's bond density and body
      fat.

    <description>We will measure plasma lipopolysaccharide (LPS) both in the fasting state and after a lipid-rich meal in obese MetS subjects.  The subjects will then be treated with the antibiotic rifaximin for 8 weeks to substantially reduce gut bacteria.  The lipid tolerance tests before and after treatment with rifaximin will be assessed to determine whether there is a reduction in post-prandial LPS.</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo a baseline fat biopsy and a euglycemic clamp to measure peripheral and hepatic insulin sensitivity.  They will then be treated with rifaximin and the insulin sensitivity testing and biopsies will be repeated to determine if disruption of the microbiota reduces tissue inflammation and improves insulin sensitivity.</description>

    <description>We hypothesize that a change in the microbial flora with rifaximin will reduce plasma LPS, and this in turn will reduce adipose tissue inflammation, which may lead to improved insulin sensitivity.  Therefore, we will examine, before and after rifaximin/placebo treatment:  1. LPS associated with lipoproteins, 2. insulin sensitivity and hepatic glucose production, 3. plasma inflammatory markers (TNFα, IL-6, MCP-1, adiponectin), 4. adipose inflammatory markers (CD68, MCP1, TNFα, PAI1, IL12, IL10, TLR4 and others).</description>
