  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial aimed at assessing the effectiveness of a patient
      decision aid (PDA) and text message reminder in promoting early intervention referral
      completion when infants and toddlers are identified with a developmental concern in the
      pediatric medical home. Subjects  will be randomized to one of two study arms- (1)
      intervention (2) control condition. Subjects in the intervention arm will watch a video PDA
      and will receive a text message reminder approximately 7 to 14 business days after
      enrollment if they agree to the early intervention referral.

    <description>The primary objective of this study is to determine the effectiveness of a patient decision aid and text message reminder on increasing early intervention referral completion. This will be measured by determining the number of subjects who receive a multi-disciplinary evaluation from the early intervention agency.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>

    <description>Parental knowledge and attitudes will be measured quantitatively using Likert-scale surveys.</description>

    <description>Parental uncertainty about whether to enroll their child in Early Intervention will be evaluated using a survey.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to 7 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The feasibility of the patient decision aid (PDA) will be measured by calculating the number of individuals who refuse to participate, time that it takes to complete the PDA, and the number of patients who complete the Early Intervention referral.</description>

    <measure>Acceptability of the Patient Decision Aid for Early Intervention Referral</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 14 days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The acceptability of using the patient decision aid for early intervention will be assessed by having patients and providers complete surveys on the intervention.</description>
