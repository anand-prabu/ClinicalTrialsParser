Combining\n      chemotherapy and STI571 may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus STI571\n      in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous leukemia or acute lymphocytic leukemia."

Patients who have previously received imatinib mesylate for at least 28 days\n      receive oral imatinib mesylate on days 22-35. All patients receive daunorubicin IV over 2-3\n      minutes on days 1-3, vincristine IV over 1 minute on days 1, 8, 15, and 22, and oral\n      prednisone on days 1-28. Patients with more than 5% residual blasts in bone marrow on day 28\n      receive a second course in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of daunorubicin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, additional patients\n      are treated at the recommended phase II dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 46 patients will be accrued for this study."
