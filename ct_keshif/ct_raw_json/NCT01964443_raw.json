Only data available from routine clinical practice will be collected and all\n      treatment decisions will be made at the discretion of the treating physician. Additionally,\n      where local regulations permit, participating physicians will be asked to obtain\n      Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) data from patients participating in this observational study.\n      A target of 800 adult patients will participate in this study at approximately 80 sites. The\n      enrollment period of this study is expected to continue for approximately 9 months. Each\n      patient will receive treatment as per standard clinical practice and will be followed up for\n      12 months. Therefore, the total duration of this observational study is expected to be\n      approximately 21 months. Overall psoriasis disease severity as assessed by the physician\n      will be documented at baseline (cross-sectional) and in the observational (longitudinal)\n      phase of the study. Several outcomes related to psychosocial comorbidities (eg, alexithymia,\n      anxiety, depression), addiction, and work and activity impairment as measured by PRO\n      questionnaires and scales will also be collected. Information on psoriasis treatment(s)\n      (topical, phototherapy, systemic [non-biologic, biologic]), mental health drugs (including\n      those used for sleep), and concomitant medications given for comorbid medical conditions\n      will also be collected. The data for this study will be analyzed and reported separately for\n      the cross-sectional data (baseline) and for the longitudinal data (from baseline to Month\n      12)."

Each question addresses how much the patient's skin problem has affected their life and is scored as: 3 = very much, 2 = a lot, 1 = a little, 0 = not at all, or 0 = not relevant. The recall period is the past week. The DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more health-related quality of life is impaired: 0 to 1 = no effect at all on patient's life; 2 to 5 = small effect on patient's life; 6 to 10 = moderate effect on patient's life; 11 to 20 = very large effect on patient's life; 21 to 30 = extremely large effect on patient's life.",
