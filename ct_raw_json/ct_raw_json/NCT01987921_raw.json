Currently, understanding of the epidemiology and diagnosis of AKI\n      in children is limited by single center retrospective data and inconsistent diagnostic and\n      stratification criteria. The hypotheses of the AWARE study is that 1) renal angina, a\n      composite of early injury signs and risk of disease, will predict severe subsequent AKI in\n      critically ill children and 2) the incorporation of urinary biomarkers into the renal angina\n      scoring system will improve the prediction of the severe injury. The multi-center,\n      multi-national registry will create the largest ever repository of information available on\n      AKI in children."

            "textblock": "The AWARE study is a multicenter prospective observational study designed to achieve the\n      following three goals:\n\n        1. Establish the first international pediatric AKI registry to describe in detail the\n           epidemiology and outcome of AKI in different pediatric and cardiac ICUs around the\n           world.\n\n        2. Validate the precision of RAI in ruling out AKI in a large, heterogeneous study\n           population.\n\n        3. Evaluate the predictive value of using RAI before and after the incorporation of four\n           different urinary AKI biomarkers used in different combinations.\n\n      To achieve these primary goals, children admitted to PICUs and/or pediatric cardiac ICUs\n      from different US and international centers will be screened for enrollment eligibility.\n      Patients admitted to general PICU and non-surgical patients admitted to cardiac ICUs are\n      considered the target population of AWARE. Patients admitted to neonatal ICUs and\n      post-surgical admissions to cardiac ICUs are not included in AWARE. Both clinical variables\n      and urinary biomarkers would be needed to accomplish the analysis.\n\n      A- Clinical variables: Clinical data of interest at study entry will include age, gender,\n      race, ethnicity, height, weight, date of ICU admission, date of ICU discharge, date of\n      hospital discharge, admission diagnosis(es) and primary co-morbidities. Creatinine clearance\n      (eCrCl) will be estimated by the modified Schwartz formula29. Baseline creatinine will be\n      collected if the patient had a listed value in the medical record in the 90 days prior to\n      admission, with the lowest value selected if multiple measurements are present.  In cases\n      where no baseline data is available, reference eCrCl will be estimated as 120 mL/min/1.73m2.\n      30\n\n      Clinical data will be recorded on admission and on a daily basis for the first seven days of\n      the PICU admission or till discharge from the PICU whatever is earlier. Another set of data\n      will be collected to evaluate the primary and secondary outcomes of the study (see later).\n      The outcomes data will be collected on day 28 after ICU admission when available or by most\n      recent available data before hospital discharge for patients with no available data on day\n      28.\n\n      Clinical parameters of interest include:\n\n        -

RAI >= 8 indicates fulfillment of renal angina ( Basu et al5)\n\n      Urine samples: The collection of urine samples is optional for the participating sites. The\n      urine samples will be collected in the morning between 6 and 10 A.M. and/or in the afternoon\n      between 3 and 7 P.M. for up to four days (day 0 through day 3) on all enrolled patients.\n      Some centers may collect daily urine samples, others may choose to collect samples in both\n      time windows. Urine will be drained only from the collection apparatus of an indwelling\n      urinary drainage system or intermittent catheterization. Patients will not be bagged or\n      catheterized separately/independently for the purposes of this study. Collected urine\n      samples will be kept on ice or in 4\u00b0 C refrigerator until they are processed. During\n      processing, specimens will be centrifuged at 3000 RPM at 4\u00b0C for fifteen minutes. The\n      supernatant will then be divided into up to nine 1-mL cryovials depending on the collected\n      urine volume and stored at minus 80\u00b0C. The stored urine samples from all participating sites\n      will be shipped to the Center for Acute Care Nephrology Biomarker Core Laboratory in the\n      Division of Nephrology and Hypertension at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center\n      when the coordinating site request the samples to be shipped at the time point set forth by\n      the coordinating site. The shipping supplies and instructions will be provided by the\n      coordinating site."
