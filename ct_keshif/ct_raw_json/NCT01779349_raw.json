In this study the\n      investigators plan to evaluate an alternative technology that presumably is able to diagnose\n      bladder outlet obstruction using a Dynamic Urine Vibration \"Holter\" based on a Urine Flow\n      Vibration Analysis technology. The acoustic vibration sensor is a small device that records\n      the vibration due to urine flow. The patient attaches the sensor to the penis using a\n      disposable sensor patch for the duration of approximately one minute during one urination.\n      The analysis is performed off-line and the results are compared to the results of a standard\n      pressure flow study and to the standard free flowmetry test. The innovative technology for\n      the diagnosis of bladder outlet obstruction is noninvasive, rapid and does not involve\n      complex setup."
