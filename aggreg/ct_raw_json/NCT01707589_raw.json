            "textblock": "Monitoring vital signs in neonates is important. This currently is done with multiple\n      standard clinical monitors.  the investigators are developing a very small (coin-sized)\n      sensor that can measure pulse rate, respiratory rate, temperature and body motion.  the\n      investigators propose to test our sensor against standard monitoring techniques in neonates\n      in a neonatal ICU (NICU).\n\n      The monitor, called ELFI-monitor, is based on dynamic light scattering.  A low-power laser\n      beams light into the skin, and the red blood cells in the underlying skin return the light\n      which is recorded in a light sensor.  The movement of the red blood cells is affected by the\n      rhythmic cardiac contractility. in this manner, heart rate and rhythm can be assessed. The\n      ELFI monitor also contains an embedded temperature probe and a miniature 3-D motion sensor,\n      allowing capture of additional parameters.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      the investigators plan to study 100 neonates admitted to the NICU of Meir Hospital Center.\n      These infants are routinely monitored with standard equipment including ECG, oximeter,\n      temperature, and respiratory monitors.  the investigators will simultaneously monitor these\n      children with the ELFI monitor, recording pulse rate, cardiac rhythm, respiratory rate, skin\n      temperature and body motion.  Recordings will be conducted for a one-hour period on each\n      subject.  Data recordings from the ELFI sensor will be compared to the readouts of the\n      conventional monitors used on the patient. It is important to emphasize that the data\n      recordings of the ELFI sensor will not affect clinical decisions in any manner, but will\n      merely be recorded for comparison with conventional sensors."
