There are multimodal postoperative pain management after TKA, including\n      intravenous opioids, epidural analgesia, peripheral nerve blocks or periarticular\n      infiltration with local anesthetics. All of these treatments may lead to side effects such\n      as nausea, headache, hypotension, urinary retention, partial motor block and infection of\n      the knee. Therefore the investigators will compare three methods of postoperative analgesic\n      after TKA by their efficiency and complication."
