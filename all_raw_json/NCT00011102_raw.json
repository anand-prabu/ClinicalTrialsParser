Participants will complete brief questionnaires about\n      their health, eating and exercise habits, and use of weight control strategies. They will\n      then be randomly assigned to 1 of 3 treatment conditions. All 3 treatments receive\n      information on the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight, the components of a\n      healthy diet, and ways to increase activity levels. The 3 treatment differ in how this\n      information is delivered. At 12, 24 and 36 months after enrolling in the study, participants\n      will attend assessment sessions. They will complete questionnaires and have body weight\n      measured."
