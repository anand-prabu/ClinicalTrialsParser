  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study is to examine the feasibility of implementing an internet-based
      treatment for insomnia among veterans with substance use disorders, some with co-morbid
      serious mental illness, and to develop potential methods to support and encourage veterans
      while they self-administer this treatment. Our hypotheses are that the implementation of an
      internet-based therapy will be feasible and that a method of support can be devised, and
      tested in the future.
