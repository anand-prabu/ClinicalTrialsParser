  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This non-drug, single center, 24-week, longitudinal study in ambulant spinal muscular
      atrophy (SMA) patients and in age- and gender-matched healthy volunteers will assess the
      detection of disease progression by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and the Muscle Function
      Measure (MFM) test.

      Each participant will be evaluated in three testing sessions: at baseline, at Week 12 and at
      Week 24. Both patients and volunteers will undergo MRI scans. Patients will additionally
      undergo testing of motor function and have blood samples taken for Survival of the Motor
      Neuron (SMN) genes, proteins and mRNA analysis.
