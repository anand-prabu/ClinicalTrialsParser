  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate whether some patients with excellent responses
      to chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) treatment are being overtreated, and can remain well on
      either a lower dose of treatment or without treatment at all. The dose of imatinib (Glivec),
      nilotinib (Tasigna) or dasatinib (Sprycel) treatment will initially be cut to half the
      standard dose for 12 months, and then treatment will be stopped completely for a further two
      years. The trial information will also help to develop a de-escalation and stopping strategy
      for future newly diagnosed CML patients in the next British national CML study (to be known
      as SPIRIT3).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The next definitive UK phase III trial in chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) will be SPIRIT3,
      which will open in Summer 2014. This will incorporate a de-escalation and stopping strategy
      for patients who achieve excellent responses after at least 3 years of treatment with a
      tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).

      DESTINY is to act as a pilot for this strategy in SPIRIT3, by defining the proportion of
      patients that relapse during 12 months of TKI de-escalation followed by 24 months of
      cessation. DESTINY also includes scientific bolt-on studies, quality of life assessments and
      health economic evaluation.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  CML in first chronic phase.

          -  Demonstration of BCR-ABL1 positivity at/shortly after original diagnosis.

          -  Written Informed Consent

          -  Must have received TKI treatment for at least 3 years.

          -  At least 3 molecular results over the preceding 12 months, that fit either of the
             following groups (results from any UK lab are acceptable):

               -  (MR4 group) all the available BCR-ABL1 molecular results over the preceding 12
                  months are in MR4 (MR4 is defined as a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio of zero, with at
                  least 10,000 ABL1 control transcripts).

               -  (MMR group) some or all BCR-ABL1 molecular results are in major molecular
                  response (MMR, defined here as a BCR-ABL1/ABL1 ratio of 0.1% or less, but not
                  zero, with at least 10,000 ABL1 control transcripts). If the results over the
                  preceding 12 months are a mix of MMR and undetectable BCR-ABL1, then the patient
                  is eligible for the MMR but not the MR4 group.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age under 18

          -  Life expectancy predicted to be less than 37 months because of intercurrent illness
             (e.g. heart, renal, respiratory or active malignant disease) that might preclude
             completion of the study

          -  CML in accelerated phase or blast crisis at any time

          -  Any molecular result during the preceding 12 months that is not in either MMR or MR4.

          -  Treatment with higher than standard TKI doses ('standard' is defined as imatinib
             400mg daily, nilotinib 400mg twice daily or dasatinib 100mg daily)

          -  Patients who switched previous licensed TKI treatment (imatinib, nilotinib or
             dasatinib) twice or more because of intolerance.

          -  Patients who switched previous licensed TKI treatment (imatinib, nilotinib or
             dasatinib) because of resistance.

          -  Patients treated with lower than standard TKI doses (imatinib 400mg daily, nilotinib
             400mg twice daily or dasatinib 100mg daily) for tolerance reasons may be included,
             but will de-escalate to the same doses as for standard dose patients and will be
             analysed separately, as they could be seen as undertreated.

          -  Previous treatment with ponatinib or bosutinib. Patients who received interferon
             prior to commencing TKI (even if resistant to their interferon) are eligible,
             provided their response to TKI fits the entry criteria.

          -  Pregnant or lactating women

          -  Women of childbearing potential (including women whose last menstrual period was less
             than one year prior to screening) who are unable or unwilling to use adequate
             contraception from study start to one year after the last dose of protocol therapy.
             Adequate contraception is defined as hormonal birth control, intrauterine device,
             double barrier method or total abstinence.
