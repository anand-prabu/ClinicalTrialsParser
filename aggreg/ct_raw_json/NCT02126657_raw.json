This chemical peel regime is a high potency peel of\n      70% glycolic acid combined with vitamin C that is purported to provide a good balance\n      between yielding results and patient safety. We aim to evaluate its efficacy and safety\n      profile of a single application. The study design is based on a single group that compares\n      pre- vs post-intervention. 10 patients with atrophic acne scars of skin type I-IV will be\n      recruited. Potential benefits include improvement of post acne scars with a short downtime\n      and risks include post peel hyper pigmentation and scarring. We believe that this treatment\n      will be highly beneficial to patients with post acne scarring.\n\n      This chemical peel regime has good efficacy and safety profile for the treatment of acne\n      scars."
