    <textblock>
      Study 701-301 is a single-arm, open-label, switchover study in patients with late-onset
      Pompe disease who have been receiving treatment with recombinant human acid
      alpha-glucosidase (rhGAA) for 48 weeks or longer.  Ambulatory patients who have mild to
      moderate respiratory impairment will switch directly to receive BMN 701 20mg/kg by IV
      infusion every other week.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Willing and able to provide written informed consent, after the nature of the study
             has been explained, and prior to any study-related procedures.

          -  Diagnosed with late-onset Pompe disease based on 2 currently or previously documented
             GAA gene mutations, and endogenous GAA activity &lt;75% of the lower limit of the normal
             adult range reported by the testing laboratory, as assessed by dried blood spot or
             whole blood assay.

          -  ≥ 18 years of age at the time of enrollment in the study.

          -  Has received prior treatment with commercial rhGAA as defined by ALL of the
             following:

          -  has received treatment with commercial rhGAA for ≥ 48 weeks

          -  has received &gt; 80% of all scheduled treatments in the prior 48 weeks and

               -  4 out of the prior 6 scheduled treatments

          -  has received and completed the last two infusions without a drug-related adverse
             event resulting in dose interruption

          -  has received last treatment of commercial rhGAA ≥ 14 and ≤ 28 days prior to
             anticipated initiation of treatment with BMN 701

          -  Sexually active subjects must be willing to use two known effective methods of

             the last dose of BMN 701.

          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test at Screening
             and Baseline visits and be willing to have additional pregnancy tests during the
             study. Females considered not of childbearing potential include those who have been
             in menopause at least 2 years, or had tubal ligation at least 1 year prior to
             Screening, or who have had total hysterectomy.

          -  Has ≥ 30% predicted upright FVC and &lt; 80% predicted upright FVC

          -  Has ≤60% predicted MIP

          -  Must meet ambulation criteria, as measured on two separate days conducted during the
             Screening and/or Baseline visit (use of assistive devices such as walker, cane, or
             crutches, is permitted with consistent use throughout the study).

          -  Is willing and able to comply with all study procedures

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of any investigational product or investigational medical device within 4 weeks
             prior to Screening, or requirement for any investigational agent other than BMN 701
             prior to completion of all scheduled study assessments

          -  Received any investigational medication for Pompe disease within the prior 12 months.

          -  Has a diagnosis of diabetes and/or is currently being treated with or anticipated to
             require treatment with hypoglycemic agents during the course of the study

          -  Requires noninvasive ventilatory support while awake and in the upright position

          -  Has previously been enrolled to this study

          -  Breastfeeding at Screening or planning to become pregnant (self or partner) at any
             time during the study.

          -  Concurrent disease, medical condition, or extenuating circumstance that, in the
             opinion of the Investigator, might compromise subject safety, study treatment
             compliance and completion of the study, or the integrity of the data collected for
             the study

          -  Has known hypersensitivity to BMN 701 or its excipients.
