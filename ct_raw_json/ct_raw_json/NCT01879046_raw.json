            "textblock": "Articular cartilage can be the seat of many diseases including osteoarthritis and traumatic\n      defaults. The cartilage has no intrinsic ability to repair resulting at long term in\n      function loss in the joints. Currently available treatments are not satisfactory in the long\n      term, the use of mesenchymal stem cells appears to be promising due to their ability to\n      multipotency and immunomodulation properties. This project aims to determine the most\n      appropriate source for regenerative medicine of cartilage stem cells from tissue taken\n      during arthroplasty in patients with osteoarthritis. These cells will be tested for\n      different chondrogenic markers. The success of this project will consider the implementation\n      of a strategy for regenerative medicine in bone and joint diseases."
