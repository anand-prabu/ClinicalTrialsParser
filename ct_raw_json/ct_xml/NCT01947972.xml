  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal nutrition has to face a contradictory and conflicting nutritional regimen like a
      high percentage of amino acids from the first day of life in order to achieve normal
      neurodevelopment versus metabolic complications (insulin resistance, hyperglycemia,
      increased visceral fat) that this type feeding, in conjunction with complexity of
      prematurity, is likely to cause. Current study aims to investigate is whether individualized
      fortification of breast milk protein, based on the mother's milk protein content and
      targeting the recommended daily protein requirements, is associated with better nutrition,
      growth, biochemical and endocrine markers associated with the nutrition of preterm low birth
      weight neonates, compared to the standard fortification of human milk.

      Proteins are of the most importany macromolecules in living organisms participating in
      almost all biological processes. Premature infants are forced to adapt to a new
      (extrauterine) environment where supply of nutrients, including amino acids, from mother
      ceases abruptly.  Consequently, the aim of neonatologist is the appropriate, quantitatively
      and qualitatively nutritional support, to promote brain development, achieve normal
      endocrine and metabolic function, maintain a growth rate similar to the intrauterine one
      avoiding extrauterine growth restriction during postnatal period and at the same time
      encouraging the analogue modulation of body composition (increased muscle mass, decrease
      body fat, hydration).

      Malnutrition or inadequate nutrition of preterm infant which remains undiagnosed and without
      proper treatment could have serious consequences on psychomotor development and metabolic
      activity. Indeed, 75% of low birth weight premature infants exhibit extrauterine growth
      restriction at discharge, even when they have achieved growth equal to the considered
      satisfactory, ie 15g/kg/day.

      Beyond anthropometrics differences between preterm and full-term newborns, body composition
      varies as well. Preterms have higher percentage of body fat and decreased muscle mass at
      term time compared with full term neonates. However, it has not been clarified whether this
      differentiation is harmful predisposing to chronic diseases later in childhood or adult life
      (eg. obesity, metabolic syndrome).
