This is a standard procedure to treat certain blood diseases such as lymphoma\n      and multiple myeloma.  However the use of meloxicam with this procedure is considered\n      investigational.\n\n      Meloxicam is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) which is given to decrease\n      fever, swelling and pain that may come with inflammation. It has been approved by the FDA\n      for the treatment of arthritis however it has not been approved for use in people receiving\n      AHSCT.\n\n      This study will compare the combination of meloxicam with a drug called G-CSF (also called\n      neupogen), to the combination of G-CSF with an agent that has no medicine (placebo).  G-CSF\n      is a substance that causes blood stem cells to change or increase in number when given to\n      people undergoing AHSCT.  The researchers would like to learn if giving meloxicam in\n      combination with G-CSF to people before they undergo AHSCT will increase the number of stem\n      cells available in the blood to collect and make the collection process easier."

It is like\n      flipping a coin.  Neither the participant nor the research doctor will choose what group the\n      participant will be in. The participant will have an equal chance of being placed in any\n      group.\n\n      - Study Drug (meloxicam or placebo): If the participant takes part in this research study,\n      the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary. The study drug will come as a pill\n      that the participant will take by mouth daily for 5 days, starting 6 days (Day -6) before\n      the participant is scheduled to undergo the first apheresis procedure (Day 0) and continuing\n      until 2 days before apheresis (Day -2).  The participant will take meloxicam or placebo for\n      a total of 5 days.  The diary will also include special instructions for taking the study\n      drug(s).\n\n      -G-CSF: All participants receive G-CSF as an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) in the\n      clinic, daily starting 4 days (Day -4) before the first apheresis procedure (Day 0).  The\n      participant will continue to receive G-CSF for 3 days after apheresis.\n\n      - Apheresis: The participant may receive up to 4 apheresis procedures, depending on how\n      their body reacts to the stem cell mobilization.  The participant will receive either\n      meloxicam or placebo in combination with G-CSF on Days -6 to -2 as described above.\n\n      Clinical Exams:  While the participant is receiving this procedure, the participant will\n      have regular physical exams and they will be asked specific questions about any problems\n      that they might be having. The participant will also have blood tests every day to look at\n      how their bone marrow is recovering, to give possible transfusional support, and how to see\n      how their liver and kidneys are functioning.\n\n      Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to keep track of the participant's medical\n      condition for the rest of their life. The investigators would like keep track of the\n      participant's medical condition for 6 months after the study to see how they are doing."
