  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to study the effect of a commonly used antibiotic, doxycycline,
      on the production of ovarian hormones and menstrual cycles in women with Polycystic Ovarian
      Syndrome (PCOS).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is one of the leading causes of female infertility,
      affecting 5-10% of reproductive-age women .  This heterogeneous disorder is characterized by
      anovulatory infertility, androgen excess, an increase in the ratio of LH to FSH, and
      morphologic polycystic changes to the ovaries.  Obesity and insulin resistance are also
      metabolic factors associated with PCOS that further increase the morbidity in these
      patients.  Inducing fertility in patients with PCOS can be a challenge, as it most often
      involves ovulation induction that can lead to ovarian enlargement, hyperstimulation, and
      multiple-birth pregnancies.  This study is designed to determine novel effective strategies
      to promote normal cycling in this patient population.

    <description>Subjects randomized to receive doxycycline for a period of 12 weeks.  A 12-week period thereafter will occur off study medication.  The dose of doxycycline to be used in this study is 200mg/day in divided doses of 100mg twice daily. The dose of doxycycline being used in this study is 100mg because it is the standard approved dose.</description>
