Published results are promising, however only\n      Caucasian patient populations have been studied. This prospective evaluation studies the\n      effectiveness of IL cryotherapy in treating keloids and hypertrophic scars in a  population\n      consisting of all Fitzpatrick skin type patients.\n\n      Multiple devices are available, mostly based on a simple open system. Closed, argon gas\n      based, systems are highly controlled and provide accurate freezing. However, this technique\n      has never been used for IL cryotherapy for the treatment of keloid or hypertrophic scars.\n      All patients with keloid or hypertrophic scars meeting inclusion criteria were treated with\n      a argon based device called Seednet. Scar quality and possible recurrence are assessed pre-\n      and postsurgery (3, 6 and 12 months) with objective devices determine scar color, scar\n      elasticity, scar volume and patient's skin type. In addition, scars are evaluated using the\n      Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale."
