Chemoprotective drugs, such as amifostine, may protect normal\n      cells from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining gemcitabine, cisplatin, and\n      amifostine following surgery in treating patients who have locally advanced bladder cancer."

Treatment continues every 28\n      days for a total of 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-42 patients will be accrued for this study."
