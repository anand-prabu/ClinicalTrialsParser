The\n      coil was designed to stimulate deeper regions of the left DLPFC. The investigators propose\n      that active stimulation with the H1 coil will result in higher remission rates than placebo\n      stimulation but will have a similar tolerability and safety profile."

The study duration is 4-6 weeks in length.  The acute phase is 4 weeks of 5\n      daily treatments followed by 2 weeks of biweekly treatment if remission is achieved at the 4\n      week mark.  Symptom change and remission criteria will be assessed using the HRDS-24 item.\n      Cognition will be assessed using a validated battery."
