Patients with stable disease,\n      complete or partial response will continue treatment until progressive disease, unacceptable\n      toxicity, patient or physician decision. For chemotherapy agents, however, a maximum of 6\n      cycles will be administered. Tivantinib will be continued until progressive disease,\n      unacceptable toxicity, patient or physician decision.\n\n      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria\n      (NCI-CTC) version 3.\n\n      Following the dose-escalation phase of the study, additional patients (in order to reach a\n      total of 13 patients with MPM and 18 patients with NSCLC treated at MTD/recommended dose for\n      phase Ib trials) will be accrued to the expansion stage of this trial, to assess the\n      preliminary anti-tumor activity of Tivantinib in combination with Carboplatin (AUC 5) and\n      Pemetrexed (500 mg/mq) primarily."
