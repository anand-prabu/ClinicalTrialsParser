An expansion cohort will evaluate\n      the RP2D in up to 15 subjects to further determine the safety, tolerability, efficacy, PK\n      and PD in this population.\n\n      The dose escalation will be conducted with an accelerated titration design based on\n      observing each dose level for a period of 21 days before enrolling the next cohort and\n      administering the next dose level."
