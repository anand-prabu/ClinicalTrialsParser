  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer patients receiving hormone treatment (androgen deprivation therapy, or ADT)
      are at increased risk of developing bone loss and osteoporosis as side effects. To prevent
      this, guidelines recommend participation in healthy bone behaviours including weight-bearing
      exercise and adequate calcium/vitamin D intake. However, prior studies have shown that
      patients are not regularly screened or counselled regarding healthy bone behaviours while
      receiving ADT. Maintaining bone health in prostate cancer patients is important because men
      on ADT are at increased risk of fractures. In this study, the investigators will examine
      whether an intervention designed to improve healthy bone behaviours among prostate cancer
      patients on ADT can be implemented. The intervention consists of a written &quot;healthy bones
      prescription&quot;, brief verbal counseling, and printed educational materials for participants.
      Investigators hope to obtain an initial estimate of whether the intervention works. They
      also hope to show that this simple intervention can be implemented in a real, working cancer
      clinic.

      The investigators hypothesize that an intervention to improve bone health in prostate cancer
      patients receiving ADT (healthy bones prescription, verbal counseling, and printed
      educational materials) is effective, implementable, and accepted by clinicians and patients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study has a before-and-after design, to allow comparison of the intervention before its
      implementation and after its implementation. This design permits a reliable assessment of
      baseline characteristics prior to implementation of intervention and over time, particularly
      in situations where randomization is not feasible (e.g. due to contamination of treating
      physicians). The point at which the intervention will start to be delivered for new study
      participants is when 150 patients are accrued to the Before arm.

        1. Before/control arm (Before arm) Usual care by Princess Margaret Cancer Centre (PM)
           oncologist.

        2. After/intervention arm (After arm) Provision of a healthy bones prescription, verbal
           counselling, and written educational materials regarding healthy bone behaviours by PM
           oncologist or delegate (e.g. clinical fellow), in addition to usual care by oncologist.
           The intervention may be delivered again at a subsequent follow-up at the request of the
           patient and/or at the discretion of the oncologist.
