  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the compound lidocaine cream is effective
      in preventing postoperative agitation in patients with endotracheal intubation for general
      anesthesia.

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled study. Some parameters were provided by preliminary test,
      provided theα=0.05,and β=0.20, the sample size can be estimated to be 2000 by the Open Epi
      Version 2.Patients will be recruited on the basis of predefined criterias. A researcher will
      take charge of the recruitment. Participants provide written consent and no financial
      incentives are provided. They are divided into experimental group and control group
      randomly. We need to collect their basic information including ages, genders, heights,
      weights, underlying diseases, surgical procedures and levels classified by ASA. Blood
      pressure, heart rate and other vital signs during the tube drawing process will be recorded.
      All the contents needed to be recorded had been compiled into a watch list with detailed
      instructions for filling in. All the personal information and observation records of
      participants will be kept in secret and only used for research. Developing standard
      operating procedure and training all the researchers. A third party will assess the
      accuracy, completeness and representativeness of registry data. Experimental data will be
      analysed with the help of statisticians.
