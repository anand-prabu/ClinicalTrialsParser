Leads Emla cream as pain relief to children in connection with pneumococcal vaccination\n           at the age of three months to lower pain scores in the use of FLACC as a pain\n           measurement instrument?\n\n           Secondary objectives\n\n        2. Leads Emla cream as pain relief in connection with pneumococcal vaccination to any\n           difference in the child's heart rate response and saturation?\n\n        3. Leads Emla cream as pain relief that it takes longer before the baby starts crying and\n           does the child cry for a shorter time in connection with vaccination?\n\n      Method: The study is randomised and singleblind. The study involves 72 children who are 3\n      months old. 36 children will receive Emla-cream and 36 children will receive placebo-cream.\n\n      This study will lead to new knowledge about Emla cream and pneumococcal vaccination. The\n      study will give new knowledge how painful pneumococcal vaccination is for the children. If\n      the study shows that Emla cream don\u00b4t give enough pain relief during pneumococcal\n      vaccination more studies should be done with other pain relief."
