  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Photoaging is caused by the superposition of chronic ultraviolet (UV)-induced damage on the
      intrinsic aging process, and accounts for the majority of age-associated changes in skin
      appearance. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) likely contribute to this process. Strategies
      utilizing endogenous skin antioxidants as well as plant-derived or synthetic compounds have
      been examined.

      Cocoa beans fresh from the tree are exceptionally rich in polyphenols, such as flavanol, and
      have a higher antioxidant capacity. The present study is designed to investigate the effects
      of long-term intake of a product rich in cocoa flavanols on facial wrinkles, hydration,
      elasticity and photosensitivity.
