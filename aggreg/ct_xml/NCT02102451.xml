  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of rapid scale-up of new hepatitis
      C (HCV) treatments, known as interferon-free Direct Acting Antiviral (DAA) drugs, and impact
      on the proportion of people with HCV within the HIV-HCV coinfected population of Australia.

      It is hypothesised that a rapid scale-up of hepatitis C treatment with interferon-free
      therapies in individuals with HIV-HCV coinfection will assist in controlling HCV infection
      in this population.

      This project has four major components which will occur independently but are linked to the
      central theme of controlling and eradicating hepatitis C from the Australian HIV positive
      population.

      Database of HIV-HCV individuals (CEASE-D):

      Surveillance of HIV-HCV positive individuals will occur through the enrolment into the
      CEASE-D observational study database. The proportion with HCV viraemia in this population
      will be determined through three cross-sectional surveys; at enrolment (2014-2015),
      follow-up 1 (2016) and follow-up 2 (2018).  Participation will involve providing informed
      consent, collection of limited clinic and demographic information, a dried blood spot
      sample, patient completed CEASE questionnaires and FibroScanÂ® (where available).  It is
      estimated that approximately 1000 HIV-HCV coinfected individuals will be enrolled into the
      CEASE-D database.

      Modelling (CEASE-M):

      Mathematical modeling will be undertaken to examine various treatment strategies, including
      HCV treatment scale-up timelines. The data from the first cross-sectional survey of the HCV
      surveillance phase (CEASE-D) will inform components of the modeling.

      HCV Education for HIV prescribers (CEASE-E):

      A comprehensive education program in HCV treatment with interferon-free DAA therapy will be
      conducted with HIV prescribers with high HCV caseloads in preparation for the rapid scale-up
      of HCV treatment.

      HCV Treatment Scale-Up (CEASE-T):

      An initial pilot phase will involve clinics (tertiary care and primary care) with existing
      HCV treatment programs, with early access to interferon-free DAA regimens pre-PBS listing
      through pharma-sponsored early access schemes or clinical trials protocols. This will be
      followed by an expanded phase following PBS listing.
