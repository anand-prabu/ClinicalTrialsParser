The objectives are:\n\n        1. To train Child Care Health consultants (CCHCs) to become specialists in nutrition\n           consultation in child care such that they will increase their daily consultation\n           activities on nutrition, physical activity, and childhood overweight,\n\n        2. To increase child care staff and parental knowledge of and positive attitudes toward\n           providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate levels of\n           physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers.,\n\n        3. To strengthen child care center policies, procedures, practices and behaviors,\n           regarding providing healthy foods, appropriate portions of foods, and appropriate\n           levels of physical activity for young children in out-of-home child care centers, and\n\n        4. To improve dietary intake and levels of physical activity, and to prevent increases in\n           overweight and the risk of overweight as determined by body mass indexes among children\n           in out-of-home child care centers."
