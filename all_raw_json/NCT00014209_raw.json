Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (Hodgkin's disease vs non-Hodgkin's lymphoma).\n\n      Patients receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4, cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1, and\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 3 months, and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 44-88 patients (22-44 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4-10 months."
