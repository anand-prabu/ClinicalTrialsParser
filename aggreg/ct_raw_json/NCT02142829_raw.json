On-Q makes use of\n      an implanted catheter and a continuous infusion pump that the patient carries with them\n      typically for 48-72 hours after surgery.  EXPAREL is a long-acting liposomal delivery\n      vehicle that extends the life of bupivacaine in the surgical site for up to 72 hours.  It\n      can be injected in all trocar sites and offers another potential solution to patient pain\n      control without the need for a catheter and the hardware needed to deliver the local\n      anesthetic.  Patient NRS (numerical rating scale) scores for postoperative pain and total\n      medication consumed were used to assess the differences between the two treatment groups."
