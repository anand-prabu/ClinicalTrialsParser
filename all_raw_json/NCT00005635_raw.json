            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can locate tumor cells and either\n      kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop\n      growing or die. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to study the effectiveness of two different regimens of\n      trastuzumab plus paclitaxel in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer that\n      overexpresses HER2."

Evaluate the safety and tolerability of subcutaneous trastuzumab (Herceptin)\n      plus paclitaxel in women with HER2 overexpressing metastatic breast cancer. II. Assess the\n      activity of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of\n      trastuzumab and paclitaxel in this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open label, multicenter study. Patients are randomized to one\n      of two treatment arms. Patients receive a loading dose of trastuzumab (Herceptin) IV over 90\n      minutes followed by paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 0. Paclitaxel is repeated every 3\n      weeks for 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Arm I:\n      Patients receive trastuzumab subcutaneously (SC) weekly starting day 7. Arm II: Patients\n      receive trastuzumab SC twice weekly starting day 7. Treatment with trastuzumab SC continues\n      for 48 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
