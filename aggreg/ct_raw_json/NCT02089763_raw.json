All subjects will receive\n      PEG-BCT-100 till progressive disease, intolerable toxicity or patients withdraw consent.\n\n      The clinical effects of PEG-BCT-100 on disease response will be evaluated every 6 weeks\n      until disease progression. Disease response evaluation will be based on RECIST 1.1 criteria.\n      The disease response based on modified RECIST criteria will also be evaluated and documented\n      for reference only.\n\n      Safety parameters will be evaluated throughout the study. Adverse event (AE) will be graded\n      according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events\n      version 4.0 (NCI CTC AE v4).\n\n      All subjects will undergo a tumor tissue biopsy at baseline for evaluation of the biomarkers\n      of ornithine transcarbamylase (OTC) and arginine succinate synthetase (ASS) except for those\n      subjects whose tumor tissue blocks have been obtained within 1 year and are available for\n      the biomarkers evaluation. The association between the levels of the 2 biomarkers and\n      disease response to PEG-BCT-100 treatment will be explored in the study.\n\n      The effects on patients' quality of life will be evaluated every 2 cycles of the PEG-BCT-100\n      treatment."
