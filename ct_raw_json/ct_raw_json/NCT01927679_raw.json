The doses will be 20, 40, 80, 160, 320 and 640 J/cm^2. At Day 0,\n      a visual inspection will establish which subjects qualify for the remainder of the study,\n      based on the presence or absence of pigmentation induced by visible light. Subjects who do\n      not exhibit pigmentation at 640 J/cm^2 or lower will not pursue the study.\n\n      Subjects who demonstrate pigmentation will move on to the next step of the study. On this\n      same Day 0 visit, these subjects will be randomized to receive a topical antioxidant\n      preparation on one of two halves of their back and a control on the other side. The\n      antioxidant and control will be applied twice before the exposure to visible light is done\n      on Day 1: 24 hours prior (Day 0) and 30 minutes prior (Day 1) exposure. On Day 1, the skin\n      with antioxidant will be exposed to fluences of 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280 and 1920 J/cm^2\n      whereas that with control will be exposed to the same lower doses as on Day -7. This will be\n      done on a total of 12 different areas of 0.9 cm^2 each, with six on the side with\n      antioxidant preparation, and six on the side with control.\n\n      On Day 7\u00b11, a visual assessment will be done of each exposed area, as well as quantitative\n      colorimetric measurements and a research photograph. The visual assessment will consist in\n      determination of the lowest fluence inducing visible pigmentation on each half back (with\n      antioxidant and with control).  The colorimetric measurements will be done on areas exposed\n      to 320 and 640 J/cm^2 to compare the pigmentation present on skin to which antioxidant was\n      applied and on skin to which control was applied. The colorimetric assessment of adjacent\n      unexposed skin will also be performed. At Day 0, 1 and 7 visits, subjects will also be\n      evaluated for adverse events."
