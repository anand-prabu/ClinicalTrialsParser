Prediction equations for energy expenditure will be tested and\n      validated against a stable isotope method called doubly labeled water for the measurement of\n      free-living total energy expenditure."

CSTS and MARS models for the assessment of PA based on activity\n      energy expenditure (AEE) and for the prediction of minute-by-minute EE will be developed in\n      100 preschool-aged children using 12-h room respiration calorimetry as the criterion method\n      and validated in an independent sample (n=50) against 12-h room respiration calorimetry and\n      the 7-d DLW method. In addition, the investigators will develop algorithms for the\n      classification of PA levels and sleep/awake periods using statistical and machine learning\n      methods and incorporate the results into our prediction models."
