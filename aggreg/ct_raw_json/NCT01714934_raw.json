Looking for an insult\n      to lung parenchyma that generates the pathogenesis of the disease is challenging. Pepsin is\n      a proteolytic enzyme present in the gastric juice. Microaspirations of gastric content were\n      described as a potential factor for injury in many chronic lung disorders. Bronchoalveolar\n      lavage (BAL) is a routine investigation technique in interstitial lung diseases. The\n      presence of pepsin in the BAL fluid recovered from patients with IPF may indicate a possible\n      role for gastric microaspirations in the pathogenesis of the disease."
