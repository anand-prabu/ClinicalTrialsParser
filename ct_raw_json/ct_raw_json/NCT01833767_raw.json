Patients may have\n             received prior systemic therapy or may be previously untreated.\n\n          2. Patients must have measurable disease on physical exam or radiologic studies.\n\n          3. ECOG performance status of 0 or 1 and estimated survival of at least 3 months.\n\n          4. White blood count of > 3500/mm3, platelet count > 100,000/mm3, hemoglobin > 9.0\n             gm/dl; bilirubin, ALT, AST < 3 x upper limit of normal; serum creatinine < 2.0 mg/dl.\n\n          5. Patients must undergo a low-level cardiac stress test as a screen for possible\n             atherosclerotic heart disease.  Patients with a positive stress test would be\n             excluded from this trial.\n\n          6. Patients with elevated temperatures > 100.5 F must have sources of occult infection\n             excluded.\n\n          7. Patients must be felt to have recovered from effects of prior therapy, such as > 2\n             weeks after prior chemotherapy.\n\n          8. Women of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test and adequate\n             precautions to prevent pregnancy during treatment must be taken.\n\n          9. Patient consent must be obtained prior to entrance onto study.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  1. Medical illness requiring corticosteroids or other immunosuppressive agents (such\n             as cyclosporin or methotrexate.\n\n             2. Autoimmune disease such as inflammatory arthritis which could be exacerbated by\n             immune-based therapy.\n\n             3. Prior history of psychiatric disorder which could be exacerbated by interleukin-2.\n\n             4. Lactation or pregnancy.\n\n             5. Evidence of significant cardiovascular disease including history of recent (< 6\n             months prior) myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, primary cardiac\n             arrhythmias (not due to electrolyte disorder or drug toxicity, for example) beyond\n             occasional PVC's, angina, positive low-level stress test, or cerebrovascular\n             accident.\n\n             6.
