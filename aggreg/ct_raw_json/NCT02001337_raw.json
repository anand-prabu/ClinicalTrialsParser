The likelihood of PaC in new-onset\n      DM is further increased in those who have weight loss or elevated CA19-9. In this study\n      patients with newly diagnosed diabetes will be prospectively identified. Those with weight\n      loss and/or elevated pancreatic cancer marker (CA 19-9) will undergo pancreatic imaging. All\n      subjects will be followed up to 24 months.   If successful in identifying surgically\n      removable PaC, this study will fundamentally change our practice and will be a major\n      breakthrough in PaC treament and research."
