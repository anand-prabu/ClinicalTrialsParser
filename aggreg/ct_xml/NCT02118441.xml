  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When a patient undergoes heart surgery, their Anesthesiologist will insert a tiny plastic
      tube, called a catheter, in the artery of the patient's wrist. This is called a radial
      artery catheter. A radial artery catheter allows accurate measurement of the patient's blood
      pressure during surgery. There are two common techniques for placing the radial artery
      catheter. The first is a &quot;blind&quot; technique whereby the Anesthesiologist feels for the pulse
      in the patient's wrist and places the catheter using the location of the pulse as a guide.
      The second technique, less commonly used, is one whereby the Anesthesiologist uses an
      ultrasound machine (painless to the patient) to &quot;see&quot; the artery, and thereby uses the
      ultrasound to guide the catheter placement. Our study will test the hypothesis that
      ultrasound-guided radial artery catheterization will have faster insertion times, with fewer
      complications compared with palpation-guided insertion.

    <description>Radial artery catheter insertion will be conducted by ultrasound guidance. A Sono-site ilook 25 Ultrasound (Sono-site, Inc., Bothell, WA, USA) with a 10-5 MHz linear array ultrasound transducer will be used.
At the discretion on the Anesthesiologist, an out-of-plane (i.e. needle plane at right angles to ultrasound plane) will be used.  Colour flow doppler may also be used to identify the artery if necessary.</description>
