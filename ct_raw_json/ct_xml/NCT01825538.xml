  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To understand current practices of pulmonary physicians in relation to Advanced Care
      Planning (ACP) in order to develop future disease-specific tools that will improve
      patient-physician communication about ACP.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a retrospective, observational study and analysis of charts of patients
      with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) or pulmonary fibrosis treated as
      outpatients at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Lung Center.  Using
      pre-existing data, we will determine if advanced care planning has been discussed with these
      patients and record this information.  For all patients, we will gather data about specific
      demographic and clinical characteristics that may have contributed to the presence or
      absence of these discussions. The study is descriptive in nature and is not powered to
      detect a difference between the two groups. Instead, we aim to describe the characteristics
      most frequently associated with advanced care planning discussion in these two particular
      groups.

      Potential subjects will be identified with assistance from the Information Warehouse. After
      identification, data will be abstracted from pre-existing data in the electronic medical
      record and collected in a coded fashion for each subject.  Each subject will be assigned an
      anonymous subject identification number and all links to identifying information will be
      destroyed prior to analysis.  All study data will be stored on a secure password protected
      data base to which only study personnel will have access.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who are between 18 and 88 years of age who have been diagnosed  with a
             physician diagnosis of COPD based on at least one of the following:

               -  clinical history - a documented history of COPD, emphysema, or chronic
                  bronchitis.

               -  pulmonary function results - defined as an forced expiratory volume in one
                  second to forced vital capacity ratio (FEV1/FVC) less than 0.7

          2. Patients who are between 18 and 88 years of age and  have been diagnosed with
             pulmonary fibrosis based on the following:

               -  Subpleural, basal predominance of parenchymal abnormality on high resolution
                  computed tomography (HRCT)

               -  Reticular abnormality on HRCT

               -  Honeycombing without traction bronchiectasis on HRCT

               -  Absence of features that are inconsistent with usual interstitial pneumonia
                  (UIP) pattern OR

               -  UIP based on surgical lung biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &lt; 18 years or &gt; 88 years
