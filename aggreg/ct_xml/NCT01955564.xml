  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, 8-day, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,
      sequential-cohort study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and MTD of single
      escalating oral doses of NW-3509A in healthy male volunteers. Five independent cohorts of 12
      volunteers each will participate in this study, with the first 9 volunteers in each cohort
      to qualify being randomized to receive study medication and the remaining 3 to be used as
      backups/ alternates. In each cohort, 6 subjects will be randomly assigned to receive
      NW-3509A and 3 subjects will receive placebo.

             Procedural

             Volunteers will meet the following procedural criteria:

          4. They are cooperative, able to take oral medication, willing to complete all aspects
             of the study, and capable of doing so.

          5. They will be able to understand the instructions and fully participate.

          6. They will have provided written informed consent prior to participating in the study.

          7. The  subject  is  in  good  health  with  no  history  of  significant  medical
             disease  as  determined  by  the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        The presence of any of the following will exclude a subject from study enrollment:

        General Medical Status

          1. An advanced, severe, or unstable disease of any type that may interfere with any of
             the study evaluations, including any medical condition that could be expected to
             progress, recur, or change to such an extent that it may bias the assessment of the
             clinical or mental status of the volunteer to a significant degree or put the
             volunteer at special risk (e.g., liver or kidney disease; malignancy);

          2. A disability that may prevent the volunteer from completing all study requirements
             (e.g., blindness, deafness, severe language difficulty);

             baseline that would interfere with the objectives of the study;

         18. Need of any prescription medication within 14 days prior to the administration of the
             study drug, and/or non-prescription medication within 7 days prior to the
             administration of the drug;

         19. Participation in  other  clinical  trials  during  the  last  2  months  in  which an

                  year;

               -  Any prescription drug or OTC product if taken continuously (Medical Monitor from
                  Newron should be contacted if the Investigator wants to include a volunteer who
                  is taking an OTC product);

               -  Alcohol intake should be limited to 2 drinks per day during the 2 weeks prior to
                  dosing; alcohol consumption will be prohibited from 72 hours prior to
