  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-blinded, not placebo controlled, randomized, parallel phase 2 pilot study to
      evaluate the immunological response and the safety of Epstein Barr Virus (EBV)-derived tumor
      antigen, Latent Membrane Protein-2 (LMP2)-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccines alone or
      co-administered with the TLR9 ligand, DUK-CPG-001, in patients with EBV+  lymphoma in the
      setting of autologous stem cell transplant with infusion of mature T cells.  Patients will
      be randomized to receive vaccine alone or vaccine co-administered with the TLR9 ligand,
      DUK-CPG-001.  Randomization will be stratified by 2 disease types: Hodgkin lymphoma and
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

    <description>Immune response will be defined as an increase in number of spots to 25-fold more than at baseline, and at least 200 spots per 105 cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cells, by Day 7 post 2nd vaccination (i.e., a patient with a baseline of 1 spot/105 CD8+ T cells who achieved 25 spots/million would not be counted as a response).
&quot;Spots&quot; are the readout for immune activation measured by the enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay. Each spot is indicative of an activated T cell that secrete interferon (IFN)-gamma, a cytokine produced by activated T cells.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient must have a histologically proven diagnosis of any EBV+ Hodgkin or
             non-Hodgkin lymphoma

          -  EBV positive will be defined as positive if LMP1 or 2 or EBER are positive.  As long
             as EBV positive on a prior biopsy, EBV testing will not be required at the time of
             relapse. However, if EBV testing performed on a more recent biopsy and it is
             negative, that patient will be excluded.

          -  Patients must have had persistent, relapsed, or refractory disease to at least one
             prior regimen with plans to proceed to autologous stem cell transplant

          -  Patients must be in a complete remission at time of initial pheresis for vaccine
             preparation; complete remission will be determined using Cheson Criteria100

          -  There are no limits on the number of prior therapies allowed

          -  Able to give voluntary written informed consent

          -  Female subject is either post-menopausal or surgically sterilized or willing to use
             an acceptable method of birth control (i.e., a hormonal contraceptive, intra-uterine
             device, diaphragm with spermicide, condom with spermicide, or abstinence) for the
             duration of the study therapy and for 3 months after vaccine #2.

          -  Male subject agrees to use an acceptable method for contraception for the duration of
             the study therapy and for 3 months after vaccine #2.

          -  Patients must be 18 years of age or older.

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0-2.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An estimated or measured creatinine clearance of less than 30 ml/min.

          -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), total bilirubin &gt; 3
             times the upper limit of normal

          -  Patients on chronic immunosuppressive therapy for any reason (other than chemotherapy
             for HL)

          -  Chronic systemic steroid therapy at doses greater than 10mg/day of prednisone or its
             equivalent.

          -  Female subject is pregnant or lactating.  Confirmation that the subject is not
             pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin
             (beta hCG) pregnancy test result within 48 hours of enrollment.  Pregnancy testing is
             not required for post-menopausal or surgically sterilized women.

          -  Patient has received other investigational drugs for this disease within 14 days of
             enrollment

          -  Serious medical or psychiatric illness likely to interfere with participation in this
             clinical study.

          -  Patients who are HIV positive AND have a CD4 count &lt;50

          -  Prior solid organ transplant or allogeneic stem cell transplant
