  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the effectiveness of the AnapnoGaurd 100 system relative to
      standard of care (SOC) Control, in the course of mechanical ventilation and intubation. The
      main effectiveness aspect of this trial is the AnapnoGaurd 100's ability to reduce leaks
      between the endotracheal tube and the trachea walls as a result of the cuff pressure
      management. Since the primary outcome can't be measured by any method other than the
      investigational device, the study groups will be treated as follows:

        -  The Treatment group in this study will be treated with the fully functional AnapnoGaurd
           100 device (per its intended use),

        -  The Control group will be treated with the AnapnoGuard device, where the cuff control
           will be disabled (off) and the cuff management will be done according to SOC.

      Effectiveness will be measured by the duration and level of CO2 leakage around the
      entdotracheal tube (ETT) cuff, from the lungs to the subglottic space and safety will be
      measured by adverse events (AEs).
