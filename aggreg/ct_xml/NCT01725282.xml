    <textblock>
      In this study, FK949E or placebo will be administered orally for 6 weeks to major depressive
      disorder patients with lack of response to existing antidepressants, with the aim of
      evaluating the efficacy of FK949E and dose-response in the three FK949E dose groups based on
      changes in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. The safety and
      pharmacokinetics of FK949E will also be evaluated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Diagnosis of major depressive disorder as specified in the DSM-IV-TR with the use of

          -  Documented appropriate treatment history (i.e., lack of response to treatment at
             labeled dosage for at least 4 weeks) for the current major depression episode with an
             antidepressant other than that used concomitantly with the study drug

          -  The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D17) total score of 20 points or more and
             HAM-D17 depressed mood score of 2 points or more

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent or previous history of DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders, except major depressive
             disorder, within the last 6 months before informed consent

             longer than 24 months at informed consent

             values) or more within the past 2 months

          -  Electroconvulsive therapy within the last 62 days before primary registration (within
             the last 90 days before secondary registration)

          -  Treatment with a depot antipsychotic within the last 28 days

          -  Documented or suspected (to be a carrier of) conditions such as renal failure,

             mmHg or more, or a diastolic blood pressure of 110 mmHg or more at primary
             registration) or unstable angina that may worsen with the study or may affect the
             study results based on the clinical judgment of the investigator or subinvestigator

          -  Concurrence of hypotension (defined as a systolic blood pressure of less than 100
             mmHg at primary registration) or orthostatic hypotension

          -  Concurrence of malabsorption syndrome, hepatic disease, or other conditions that may
             affect the absorption and/or metabolism of the study drug

          -  Concurrent or previous history of cerebrovascular disease or transient ischemic
             attack (TIA)

          -  Known hypersensitivity to quetiapine or any component of FK949E tablets
