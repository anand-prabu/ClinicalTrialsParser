Patients are stratified according to\n      concurrent enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs (no vs yes).\n\n      Patients receive SU5416 IV on days 1 and 4 weekly for 4 weeks. Courses repeat every 4 weeks\n      in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD has been determined, additional\n      patients are accrued to the phase II portion of the study. These patients receive SU5416 IV,\n      as in the phase I portion, at the appropriate MTD established in phase I.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: At least 30 patients will be accrued for the phase I dose-escalation\n      portion of this study within 10 months. An additional 48 patients (32 with glioblastoma\n      multiforme and 16 with anaplastic glioma) will be accrued for the phase II portion of this\n      study within 6-8 months."
