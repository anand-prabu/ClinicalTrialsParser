            "textblock": "Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune thyroid disease, and when the disease progresses,\n      thyroid function finally declined to hypothyroidism.\n\n      There was no medical treatment recommended for patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, but\n      currently at euthyroid state. Levothyroxine replacement therapy starts if patients become\n      hypothyroid state.\n\n      Hashimoto's thyroiditis is a T-cell mediated autoimmune thyroid disease. The major\n      auto-antigens include thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin. Anti-TPO antibodies induce\n      antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) and cause destruction of thyroid\n      tissues.\n\n      Antimalarial agents like hydroxychloroquine have several pharmacologic effects which may be\n      involved in the treatment of rheumatic diseases, but the role of each is not known. These\n      include interaction with sulphydryl groups, interference with enzyme activity (including\n      phospholipase, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogen-cytochrome C reductase,\n      cholinesterase, proteases and hydrolases), DNA binding, stabilisation of lysosome membranes,\n      inhibition of prostaglandin formation, inhibition of polymorphonuclear cell chemotaxis and\n      phagocytosis.\n\n      This study is to investigate the treatment effect of hydroxychloroquine on autoantibodies\n      and disease progression of Hashimoto's thyroiditis."
