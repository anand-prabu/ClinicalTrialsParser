The aim of this video is not to limit the doctor patient interaction (as all\n      patients will still be granted their pre-allotted 30 minute visit with the physician\n      regardless of their intervention allocation) but rather to augment the visit with additional\n      educational information in an attempt to optimize the visit.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      A. Primary Aim(s):\n\n      \u2022 To determine if patients feel more prepared for surgery with addition of preoperative\n      patient education video\n\n      B. Secondary Aim(s):\n\n        -  To determine if addition of preoperative patient education video correlates with\n           improved patient satisfaction after surgery\n\n        -  To determine if patients' perception of time spent with healthcare team in preparation\n           for surgery increases with addition of patient educational video\n\n        -  To determine if actual patient-physician time spent counseling differs between groups\n\n        -  To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with objective surgical outcomes\n\n        -  To determine if patient preparedness is correlated with patient symptom improvement\n           scores after surgery\n\n      Hypothesis:\n\n      The addition of a preoperative patient education video enhances patient preparedness for\n      surgery, increases perception of the amount of time patients spend with healthcare team, and\n      improves patient satisfaction."
