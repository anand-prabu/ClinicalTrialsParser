            "textblock": "Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) is a life threatening condition and a serious concern among\n      hospitalized patients, with death occurring in approximately 6% of cases. It involves the\n      formation of a clot where stagnant blood flow occurs, predominantly in the deep veins of the\n      legs. Three mechanisms underlie DVT, venous stasis (slowing or stopping of the blood),\n      hypercoagulability (increased clotting) and damage to blood vessel endothelium (damage to\n      blood vessel wall), collectively known as Virchow's triad.\n\n      Intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC) and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES)\n      have been shown to improve lower limb blood flow. However, few studies have directly\n      compared the two methods and those that have, have used outdated NMES devices.\n\n      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a modern NMES device to\n      intermittent pneumatic compression in terms of blood flow."
