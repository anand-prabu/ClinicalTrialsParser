Previous study showed that bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSCs)\n      the novel and promising therapeutic strategy, BM-MSCs can replace hepatocytes in injured\n      liver, and effectively rescue experimental liver failure and contribute to liver\n      regeneration. Plasma exchange (PE) can improve internal environment by removing endotoxin,\n      it helps the liver regeneration and functional recovery and make UC-MSC differentiation into\n      hepatocyte like cells, and exert immunomodulatory function. In this study, safety and\n      efficacy of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) transplantation combined\n      with plasma exchange (PE) for patients with liver failure caused by hepatitis B Virus will\n      be evaluated."
