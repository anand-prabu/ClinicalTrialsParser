            "textblock": "It has been recently established that brown adipose tissue (BAT) exists in adult humans. BAT\n      is a thermogenic tissue which dissipates energy as heat. The primary objective of this study\n      is to use thermal imaging to assess the effect of capsinoids on BAT activity in adult\n      humans, and whether there is a relationship between the increase in energy expenditure and\n      BAT activity after capsinoids intake. The secondary objective is to investigate whether\n      capsinoids will have an effect on an individual's glycaemic response. Lean, healthy male\n      volunteers will be recruited. There will be two test sessions which are randomized, where\n      subjects will consume either capsinoids or placebo capsules, and a standardized amount of\n      white rice (equivalent to 50g carbohydrates). Indirect calorimetry will be used to assess\n      energy expenditure before and after consumption of the test meal. Thermal imaging of\n      supraclavicular BAT, the primary BAT depot in humans, will be undertaken using an infrared\n      thermal camera to assess changes in BAT temperature. Blood glucose levels will be monitored\n      by finger prick blood sampling method. This study aims to investigate whether capsinoids\n      consumption leads to changes in BAT temperatures detectable by the infrared thermal camera,\n      to confirm the feasibility of using thermal imaging as a rapid, noninvasive, and\n      reproducible way of studying BAT activity thus providing a platform to advance research in\n      this emerging field of human BAT."
