This\n      is usually done in the same plane as the ultrasound beam in America and is known as an\n      in-plane technique. When done correctly, the entire needle is visualized on the ultrasound\n      screen as it approaches the nerves which are also seen on the same screen the entire time.\n      The ultrasound probe can be held perpendicular or parallel to the shoulders of the person\n      performing the in-plane technique. Our hypothesis is that holding the ultrasound probe\n      perpendicular to the shoulder is superior to holding the probe parallel to the shoulder\n      during an in-plane ultrasound guided regional anesthesia technique."
