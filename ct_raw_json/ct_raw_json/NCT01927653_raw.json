            "textblock": "Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) referred to a decline of cognition in elder adults that are\n      not of sufficient magnitude to meet the criteria for dementia. It is usually regarded as a\n      transition state between patients of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) and the age matched healthy\n      adults. It is a heterogeneous syndrome which can be divided into two subtypes: amnestic and\n      dysexecutive. This 3 year proposal continues from a NSc funded project, in which we reported\n      that the amnestic MCI could involve global white matter changes and therefore could be a\n      preclinical status to AD. In contrast, no compromise in white matter status was found in\n      patients of dysexecutive MCI. Therefore we proposed to further investigate the phenomena in\n      this project.\n\n      The subjects will be divided into 3 groups: 30 patients with amnestic MCI, 30 with\n      dysexecutive MCI and 30 healthy age-matched normal controls. Comprehensive\n      neuropsychological examinations will be performed after detailed clinical history and\n      physical screening, including Mini-Mental Status Examination, Clinical Dementia Rating and\n      the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument. Successful candidate will be examined by 3T\n      MRI, including diffusion imaging and high resolution T1 weighted anatomical images.\n\n      The current project proposed to examine the sensitivity and specificity of diffusion\n      Magnetic Resonance Imaging, in the diagnosis of MCI and differential diagnosis of two\n      subtypes. Both the conventional tensor derived indices and diffusion kurtosis will be\n      compared. This is due to the fact that in a recently publication in Radiology, we reported\n      an improved diagnostic performance on neurodegenerative disease from diffusion kurtosis than\n      diffusion tensor. Secondly we will examine the regional changes of diffusion properties and\n      correlated with the white matter involvement in patients. High resolution track density\n      images will be implemented and compared with the susceptibility weighted imaging in an\n      effort to address the underlying changes in pathophysiology. In the third year, the\n      prognostic value of diffusion MRI will be determined. The optimal cutoff value of diffusion\n      MRI in the prediction of conversion to Alzheimer's disease will be reported. The diffusion\n      properties in patients with early conversion (the 2nd year) and late conversion (the 3rd\n      year) will be compared.\n\n      It is expected that changes in diffusion can be used as an image based surrogate marker\n      during the neurodegenerative process. The new insight into the temporal evolution of the\n      diffusion MRI might help to understand the underlying etiology and pathophysiology between\n      the amnestic and dysexecutive MCI patients, which can contribute to an early intervention\n      strategy and might ultimately lead to an effective treatment."
