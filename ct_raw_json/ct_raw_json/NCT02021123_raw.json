            "textblock": "Because anidulafungin is generally well tolerated and appears to have limited interaction\n      with other drugs, it is a potential important agent in the treatment of invasive fungal\n      infections. Although anidulafungin is approved for the treatment of invasive candidiasis in\n      adult non-neutropenic patients, dosing guidelines for anidulafungin in (morbidly) obese\n      patients are not available. Subsequently, the pharmacokinetic profile of anidulafungin (as\n      well as other echinocandins) in this specific patient population is still largely unknown.\n      During endoscopic gastric bypass surgery, patients are more prone to various kinds of\n      infection, justifying the prophylactic use of anidulafungin in this specific cohort of\n      patients.\n\n      To build a valid pharmacokinetic model, obese patients with a BMI \u2265 40 undergoing endoscopic\n      gastric bypass surgery will receive a single dose of 100 mg anidulafungin (besides standard\n      anti-bacterial prophylaxis) and a PK-curve will be drawn. These PK-values can then be\n      compared to the pharmacokinetics in a normal-weight group."
