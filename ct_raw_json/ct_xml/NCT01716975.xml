        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age 18 to 50 years of age, inclusive

          -  Signed informed consent, indicating that the subject understands the purpose of and
             procedures required for the study, before the initiation of any study specific
             procedures.  Subjects who are unable to provide informed consent will not be included
             in the study.

          -  Resides in a stable living situation, according to the investigator's judgment, and
             must have an identified informant who should be consistent throughout the study.  If
             possible, the informant should accompany the subject or be available for in person
             ratings at the screening, baseline (Day 1), and final study visits.  In person
             informant ratings on all relevant study visits are preferred whenever possible.
             However, if the informant is not available for in person ratings, telephone interview
             is acceptable.  The informant must be available for a telephone interview throughout
             the study at all visits.  As long as both the informant visit and subject visit are
             within the study visit windows, it is not necessary that they occur on the same day.
             The informant must interact with the subject at least 2 times a week.

          -  Diagnosis of Schizophrenia of at least 3 years duration.  This diagnosis can be
             established utilizing the SCID-I, direct clinical assessments, family, informants,
             and confirmation of diagnosis from clinical sources.  These may include medical
             records, confirmation of diagnosis by treating clinician through telephone contact,
             or written confirmation from treating clinic.  If the listed sources are not
             available, other sources of diagnostic confirmation may also be acceptable after
             discussion with the medical monitor.

          -  Treated with atypical antipsychotic drug (in any approved dosage form) other than
             Clozapine at a stable dose for at least 8 weeks prior to screening and be clinically
             stable; the subject must remain clinically stable (in the opinion of the principal
             investigator) through randomization.  The use of up to 2 atypical antipsychotic drugs
             is permitted, as long as in the opinion of the investigator, the second medication is
             not required to control treatment-resistant or intractable psychotic symptoms.  No
             subject will be washed off antipsychotic therapy to become eligible for this study.

          -  Schizophrenia clinical symptom burden severity defined by the following: a Brief
             Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) Conceptual Disorganization item score ≤ 4; and a BPRS
             Hallucinatory Behavior item score ≤ 5, or an Unusual Thought Content item score ≤ 5.
             Either Hallucinatory Behavior or Unusual Thought Content, but not both, may have a
             score of 6 (but not &gt; 6).

          -  Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS) total score ≤ 6

          -  Calgary Depression Scale for Schizophrenia (CDSS) total score ≤ 10

          -  General health status acceptable for participation in a 26-week clinical study

          -  Fertile, sexually active subjects (men and women) must use an effective method of
             contraception during the study

          -  Fluency (oral and written) in the language in which the standardized tests will be
             administered

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Hospitalization within 12 weeks before screening or during the screening period, or
             change of antipsychotic medication or dose within 8 weeks before screening or during
             the screening period.

          -  Participation in another therapeutic (medication administration) clinical study
             within the past 2 months.

          -  Psychiatric hospitalization or incarcerations due to breakthrough symptoms or acute
             exacerbations for a period of 3 months before screening.  Subjects with a recent
             &quot;social&quot; hospitalization or incarceration may be entered into screening after
             consultation with the medical monitor

          -  Likelihood, in the opinion of the investigator, that either the subject or informant
             will be unable to complete a 26-week study

          -  Treatment with prohibited antipsychotic drug, and/or treatment with more than 2
             permitted antipsychotic drugs.  Treatment with a first-generation antipsychotic drug

          -  Current treatment with any anticholinergic agent

          -  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition (DSM-IV)

             consciousness within 12 months before screening

          -  Monoamine oxidase inhibitor antidepressants or tricyclic medications used in
             antidepressant doses are excluded.  Other antidepressant medications are allowed if
             the subject has been treated with a stable dose for at least 3 months before
             screening

          -  Immunosuppressants, mood stabilizers, chronic use of a sedative hypnotic drug,
             chronic intake of clinically significant doses of opioid containing analgesics or any
             current methadone treatment all in the judgment of the investigator may be permitted
             depending on the circumstance

          -  Use of Central Nervous System(CNS) stimulants

             benzodiazepines may be acceptable if prior authorization is obtained from the medical
             monitor.  When possible, benzodiazepines should not be administered within 3 hours
             before cognitive testing.  The use of more than one sedative-hypnotic medication is
