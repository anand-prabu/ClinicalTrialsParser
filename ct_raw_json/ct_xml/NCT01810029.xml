  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall hypothesis of this study is that a cardiac rehabilitation program with
      meditation will be more effective than cardiac rehabilitation alone in improving blood flow
      through the diseased coronary arteries in African Americans.  For this purpose, 56 African
      American men and women with coronary heart disease will be randomly assigned either to
      standard cardiac rehabilitation plus the Transcendental Meditation program or to standard
      cardiac rehabilitation alone. The treatment period will be 12 weeks in length.

      The overall objective of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial to determine
      the efficacy of cardiac rehabilitation with and without a structured, standardized, and
      validated stress reduction component in the secondary prevention of coronary heart disease
      (CHD) in African Americans.  In this phase II trial, 56 African American men and women with
      established CHD will be randomly allocated either to standard cardiac rehabilitation with
      formal stress reduction training using the Transcendental Meditation program or to standard
      cardiac rehabilitation alone. The intervention period will be 12 weeks. At baseline and
      posttest, subjects will be tested by quantitative Positron Emission Tomography (PET) for
      myocardial perfusion and ischemia. Secondary outcomes comprise physiological, behavioral and
      psychosocial risk factors for CHD. The field site will be Columbia University Medical Center
      and the coordinating center will be MUMRI-Center for Natural Medicine and Prevention.
