            "textblock": "The main purpose of this study is to test the effectiveness of nimodipine in preventing a\n      luteinizing hormone (LH) surge in women undergoing ovulation induction with clomiphene\n      citrate. It is important to prevent the premature LH surge in controlled ovarian stimulation\n      to allow adequate recruitment of follicles, proper maturation of a dominant follicle before\n      ovulation, and effectively time insemination with semen to allow fertilization of a mature\n      egg to occur.\n\n      The investigators are also conducting this study to determine medication side effect profile\n      (including lightheadedness or dizziness from low blood pressure or rapid heart rate,\n      headache, and nausea), patient treatment compliance, and clinical pregnancy (positive\n      pregnancy test and ultrasound evidence of fetal heart rate).  Finally, LH and follicle\n      stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels will be measured to determine effect of nimodipine on\n      these hormones.\n\n      As a calcium channel blocker, nimodipine has been shown to block calcium mediated release of\n      gonadotropin releasing hormone in animal and preliminary human studies.  The investigators\n      hypothesize that nimodipine, a calcium channel blocker, will prevent or delay the LH surge\n      during controlled ovarian stimulation cycles using clomiphene citrate in subfertile patients\n      undergoing assisted reproduction with intrauterine insemination (IUI)."
