  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disorders (SD) are common in adults with Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) on dialysis with
      a reported prevalence of 60-80%. To date three studies have reported on SDs in children with
      CKD but these have all been based on questionnaire data alone.  The findings were not
      confirmed with polysomnograms (PSG), the gold standard to diagnose SD, or actigraphy, a
      validated tool to assess the sleep/ wake cycle over a prolonged period in the home. This is
      highly relevant given the poor sensitivity and specificity of even validated questionnaires
      alone. The effect of untreated pediatric SD is pervasive. This study will provide the first
      objective assessment of SDs using PSGs in children with severe CKD, both on and off
      dialysis. Therefore, we will recognize and when possible treat SD in this severe CKD cohort
      potentially contributing to their immediate management (eg improved control of hypertension,
      improved school performance), while improving their Quality of Life (QOL) and helping ensure
      they achieve their full potential.

        The two study cohorts will be age and sex matched and constructed as follows:

          1. Pre-dialysis: Stage 4 CKD with an estimated GFR of 15-30 ml/min/1.73m2 based on IDMS
             Schwartz GFR

          2. Dialysis: CKD receiving outpatient hemodialysis (HD) or peritoneal dialysis (PD) for
             a minimum of 1 month. The PSG will be completed after the longest inter-dialytic
             interval for HD patients. Patients on PD will undergo PSG while on their usual cycler
             nocturnal dialysis regimen.
