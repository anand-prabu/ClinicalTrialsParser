    <textblock>
      Sarcopenia is the loss of muscle mass, strength and function with aging and is associated
      with increased disability, falls and fractures.  Older adults with diabetes and prediabetes
      are insulin resistant and have a higher risk of developing sarcopenia. This study examines
      the use of metformin, an antidiabetic drug, for preventing the development of sarcopenia in
      older adults with prediabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study utilizes clinical and translational research approaches to study
      sarcopenia. Sarcopenia is common in older adults and is associated with decreased strength,
      increased disability, falls and fractures. There are currently few interventions to prevent
      or treat sarcopenia and a poor understanding of the mechanisms for sarcopenia. Given the
      growing number of veterans over the age of 65, studies to prevent sarcopenia and resulting
      disability are important for the health, independence and well-being of this population. Our
      preliminary studies have shown that older adults with diabetes have an accelerated loss in
      muscle mass and gait speed, except when treated with metformin. Older adults with
      prediabetes also have a greater decline in muscle mass and higher incidence of disability.
      Therefore, this study further investigates these findings by addressing the following aims:
      (1) to determine whether metformin can prevent the loss in muscle mass and physical
      performance and (2) to examine changes in muscle histologic characteristics associated with
      metformin treatment in older adults with prediabetes.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  We will enroll 120 sedentary, weight-stable, ambulatory veterans aged 65 years and
             older with prediabetes identified with fasting glucose values 100 mg/dL or greater
             but under 126 mg/dL with no use of diabetes medications.
