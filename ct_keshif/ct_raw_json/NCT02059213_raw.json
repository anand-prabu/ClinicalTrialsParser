Adequate metastatic tissue from prior biopsy/resection\n             can be used if available in lieu of a biopsy.\n\n          -  ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group scoring system\n             used to quantify general well-being and activities of daily life; scores range from 0\n             to 5 where 0 represents perfect health and 5 represents death).\n\n          -  Patients may have received prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant hormonal therapy, for\n             non-metastatic disease but it must not have lasted for more than 36 months. At least\n             12 months must have elapsed since completion of androgen deprivation therapy in the\n             neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant setting, and serum testosterone must be within the\n             institutional normal range.\n\n          -  Within 14 days prior to registration patients must have adequate organ and marrow\n             function:  White Blood Cell (WBC) count \u2265 3,000/\u03bcl, Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) \u2265\n             1,500/\u03bcl, Platelet Count \u2265 100,000/\u03bcl, Serum Creatinine \u22651.5 x the institutional\n             upper limits of normal or corrected creatinine clearance of \u2265 50 mg/ml/hr/1.73 m2 BSA\n             (Body Surface Area), Bilirubin within the institutional limits of normal, AST\n             (Aspartate Aminotransferase) \u2264 2 x upper limits of normal, ALT (Alanine\n             Aminotransferase) \u2264 2 x upper limits of normal.\n\n          -  Patients must be able to take oral medication without crushing, dissolving or chewing\n             tablets.\n\n          -  Patients may have received prior radiation therapy or surgery. However, at least 14\n             days must have elapsed since completion of radiation therapy or surgery and patient\n             must have only grade 2 or less adverse effects at the time of registration.\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n             that is approved by an institutional review board.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients who have received androgen deprivation therapy within the past 12 months\n             prior to enrollment are not eligible for this study.\n\n          -  Patients who are currently being treated with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g.,\n             amprenavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir,\n             mibefradil, miconazole, nefazodone, nelfinavir, posaconazole, ritonavir, saquinavir,\n             telaprevir, telithromycin, verapamil, voriconazole, and grapefruit) or strong\n             inducers (e.g., carbamazepine, felbamate, nevirapine, phenobarbital, phenytoin,\n             primidone, rifabutin, rifampin, rifapentine and St. John's wort) must either\n             discontinue these drugs or are ineligible.\n\n          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial\n             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic\n             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse\n             events.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association Class III\n             and IV heart failure), unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric\n             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.\n\n          -  Patients with a \"currently active\" second malignancy other than non-melanoma skin\n             cancers are not eligible. Patients are not considered to have a \"currently active\"\n             malignancy if they have completed all therapy and are now considered without evidence\n             of disease for 1 year.\n\n          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible ."
