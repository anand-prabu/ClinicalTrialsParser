  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary trial objective is to determine the efficacy of KPT-330 (selinexor) in patients
      with advanced or metastatic gynaecological cancers by disease control rate (complete
      response (CR) or partial response (PR) or stable disease (SD) for at least 12 weeks,
      assessed according to RECIST 1.1 criteria). Three cohorts are planned: ovarian carcinoma,
      endometrial carcinoma, and cervical carcinoma.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Ovarian, fallopian tube or peritoneal carcinoma: both platinum refractory and
             platinum resistant  patients, who have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for
             relapsed disease (i.e., ≥2 lines of chemotherapy in total).

          -  Endometrial carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 line of chemotherapy for
             relapsed or advanced (stage IVb) disease.

          -  Cervical carcinoma: patients must have received ≥ 1 lines of chemotherapy for
             relapsed or advanced (stage IVb) disease.

          -  Must have either measurable disease (RECIST 1.1) or evaluable disease outside
             irradiated field on CT/MRI. A rise in CA-125 or other tumor marker alone is not
             sufficient.

          -  ECOG performance status of 0-1.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks.

          -  Able to swallow and retain oral medication.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of complete or partial bowel obstruction.

          -  All non-epithelial cancers of the ovary, fallopian tube, peritoneum, endometrium or
             cervix as well as neuro-endocrine tumors are excluded.

          -  Radiation (except planned or ongoing palliative radiation to bone outside of the
             region of measurable disease) ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1.

          -  Chemotherapy, immunotherapy or systemic anticancer therapy ≤ 3 weeks prior to C1D1.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before C1D1.
