The cleansers are\n      preferred over soap and water and can be applied on all areas of the skin. The Moisture\n      Barrier Cream is formulated especially for skin exposed to moisture, urine, or stool. The\n      Antifungal Cream is utilized for fungal infections associated with athlete's foot, jock\n      itch, and ring worm to relieve itching, soreness, and irritation."
