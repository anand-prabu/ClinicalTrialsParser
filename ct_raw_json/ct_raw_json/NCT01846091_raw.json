To determine the safety and toxicity of intratumoral administration of MV-NIS in patients\n      with recurrent/metastatic squamous cell head and neck cancer.\n\n      II. To assess in a preliminary fashion antitumor efficacy of this approach by following,\n      radiographic response, and time to progression.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the time course of viral gene expression and virus elimination and\n      biodistribution of virally infected cells at various time points after infection with MV-NIS\n      using single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)/computed tomography (CT) imaging.\n\n      II. To assess viremia, viral replication, and measles virus shedding/persistence following\n      intratumoral administration.\n\n      III. To determine humoral and cellular immune response to the injected virus.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive oncolytic measles virus encoding thyroidal sodium iodide symporter\n      intratumorally on day 1.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 6 weeks, every 3 months for\n      1 year and then every 6 months for 1 year."
