      This two-group study will investigate the effect of food (group 1) and esomeprazole (group
      2) on the single oral dose pharmacokinetics of RO5424802 in healthy volunteers.

      Participants in Group 1 will be randomly assigned to a two period treatment sequence (AB or
      BA) in which they will receive a single, oral dose of RO5424802 per period separated by at
      least 10 days. Each subject will receive single, oral doses RO5424802 given under fasted
      conditions (Treatment A) or following the ingestion of a high fat, high calorie meal
      (Treatment B) as determined by their assigned sequence.

      Participants in Group 2 will be given a single, oral dose of RO5424802 following a standard
      meal. After a washout period of at least 10 days, they will receive an oral dose of
      esomeprazole (40 mg) once daily for 6 days. On the 6th day of esomeprazole administration, a
      single, oral dose RO5424802 will be given after ingestion of a standard meal.

      In all groups, pharmacokinetics will be assessed in the 4 days following RO5424802
      administration.

             history, a complete physical examination including vital signs, 12-lead
             electrocardiogram (ECG), hematology, blood chemistry, serology and urinalysis.
