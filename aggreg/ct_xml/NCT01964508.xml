  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence is rapidly
      increasing. Palpable thyroid nodules are very common, affecting up to 5% of the general
      population. Nevertheless, only 5% of the thyroid nodules harbor malignancy, hence the
      obvious need to accurately characterize these nodules. Ultrasound guided fine needle
      aspiration biopsy (FNAB) is the most important tool in assessing the nature of thyroid
      nodules, however, in up to 30% of the biopsies the results are indeterminate. In this
      proposal, we hypothesize that leftover cells in the FNAB needle may be utilized for
      molecular analysis with an established microRNA panel and distinguish between malignant and
      benign lesions. Despite established studies on the diagnostic utility of microRNAs in
      thyroid nodules, the effect of microRNAs on specific target genes involved in thyroid cancer
      is poorly studied. In this proposal we hypothesize that the microRNAs identified in our
      panel will affect intracellular pathways by regulating target genes that are involved in
      thyroid tumorigenesis. We present preliminary data that confirms that microRNA panel may
      identify malignancy in thyroid nodules. In aim 1 we will identify the expression profile of
      miRNAs in the different thyroid cancers. We will statistically quantify the threshold of
      miRNA dysregulation for malignancy on a large number of tumor and benign samples. This will
      serve as matrix for defining malignancy on the FNAB samples. In aim 2 we will establish a
      reliable reproducible method to extract RNA from cells left over in FNAB samples. Our
      preliminary data support the feasibility of the method and it has not been described
      previously. This will be the first study that will compare cytology results and microRNA
      panel analysis on the very same FNAB cells. It will mimic the exact clinical scenario that
      such microRNA panel can be utilized in the future. Finally, in aim 3 we will characterize
      the effect of microRNAs on target genes expression. We will identify possible target genes
      from bioinformatics databases and will perform quantitative measurement of mRNA level of
      target gene by real time PCR and immunohistochemistry. These studies will hopefully support
      the utility of microRNAs as a diagnostic tool to accurately identify malignancy in thyroid
      FNAB leftover cells and point out possible target genes for future therapeutic approaches.
      This could impact many patients, as thyroid cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women,
      and the most rapidly growing malignancy in both men and women.
