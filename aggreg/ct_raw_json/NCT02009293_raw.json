            "textblock": "Rationale: Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive fibrotic lung disease of\n      unknown cause with a median survival of 3-5 years. No curative treatment exists, though in\n      2011 Pirfenidone was approved for the treatment of IPF as it appeared to slow down the\n      decline in lung function. In patients with IPF, the most common symptoms are cough and\n      breathlessness. Cough is not only a major distressing and disabling symptom but also an\n      independent predictor of disease progression and death in IPF. Recent preliminary data\n      suggest a possible effect of Pirfenidone on cough.\n\n      Objective: In this study we want to objectively measure the effect of Pirfenidone on cough\n      in patients with IPF that are treated with Pirfenidone in daily practice .\n\n      Study design: This is a prospective, observational, international multicenter study.\n\n      Intervention: Objective 24-hour cough frequency will be recorded using the Leicester Cough\n      Monitor (LCM), a validated ambulatory cough monitoring system, prior to starting with\n      Pirfenidone treatment. The cough recording will be repeated at 4 weeks and at 12 weeks\n      during treatment with Pirfenidone. At the days of cough recording, patients will be asked to\n      fill in questionnaires related to cough and to quality of life. Patient will be treated\n      according to normal clinical practice at their Physician's discretion.\n\n      Main study parameters/endpoints: The primary endpoint is change in cough frequency measured\n      by the Leicester cough monitor at week 12 compared to baseline. Secondary endpoints look at\n      the relationships between cough, change in cough, quality of life and clinical parameters."
