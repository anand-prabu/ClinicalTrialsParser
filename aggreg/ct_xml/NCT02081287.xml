  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inositol hexaphosphate (IP6, also called inositol hexakisphosphate, and phytic acid) is a
      naturally occurring phosphorylated derivative of myo-inositol. Myo-inositol has shown
      preliminary evidence of efficacy in controlling mood symptoms, and good tolerability in
      bipolar disorder in some studies, but failed to establish efficacy in subsequent
      meta-analyses. In the investigators proposed work, the investigators plan to orally
      administer the calcium/magnesium salt of IP6 (2,000-3,000 mg daily in two divided doses) to
      paid research subjects with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder who are in a depressed state,
      and who have failed an adequate course of treatment with lithium monotherapy. The
      investigators hypothesis is that IP6 may be similar to myo-inositol in terms of relieving
      depression, but more potent and effective. Our aim is conduct a preliminary pilot study in
      30 subjects (15 treated with IP6, 15 treated with lamotrigine, an active comparator) to
      assess the efficacy and tolerability of IP6 as an adjunctive treatment to lithium, the mood
      stabilizer most commonly used to treat bipolar disorder.
