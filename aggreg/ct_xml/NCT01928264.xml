  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a randomized control trial to investigate whether and to what extent regular
      and guided group physical activity over 12 weeks (2 sessions Ã  1 hour/week) improves
      physical fitness and (physio-)psychological functions (like subjective sleep, mental
      toughness, perceived stress, self-efficacy, etc.), as well as participation skills and the
      ability to work, in claimants for a disability pension due to psychiatric disorders, whose
      ability to work had recently been assessed by means of a psychiatric expert opinion. The
      control group is designed very similar and implies predominantly sedentary leisure time
      group activities (e.g. playing board games, doing handicrafts). Measures will be performed
      at baseline, post-test, and at follow ups three and twelve months after post-test, some
      variables will additionally be assessed 4-weekly during the intervention. We expect that
      intervention group participants will report and show, respectively, more improved physical
      fitness, (physio-)psychological functioning and participations skills, as well as increased
      ability to work, compared to the control group.
