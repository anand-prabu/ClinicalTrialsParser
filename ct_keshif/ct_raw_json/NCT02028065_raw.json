During each of Treatment\n      Periods 1, 2 and 3, each participant will receive a single intravenous (IV) bolus injection\n      of their randomized treatment while confined to the study center. In each Period,\n      participants will remain at the study center until completion of the 24-hour post dose\n      assessments. An approximately 5-week washout will be required between treatment periods."
