  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recovery post Total Knee Replacement Surgery ((TKA) has been a subject of interest. In a
      study of 379 patients who had hip or knee replacement surgery, it was reported that at 6
      months post-surgery patients with better baseline function had superior functional ability
      and less pain than patients with lower function at baseline. Another study of 276 patients
      undergoing TKA reported that pre-operative joint function was a predictor of joint function
      and overall function at 6 months post-surgery. These findings suggest that prehabilitation
      to increase functional ability prior to TKA may have a positive effect in recovering
      post-surgery.  In a randomized control trial of patients receiving TKA, the group receiving
      an Exercise Program (prehabilitation) made significant improvements in performance from
      baseline to before surgery, and at 1 and 3 months post surgery. For the group that did not
      receive the Exercise Program pre-surgery, significant improvement did not occur until 3
      months post surgery. The overall objective of the proposed single-blinded randomized
      controlled trial is to demonstrate that a well designed prehabilitation program for patients
      receiving TKA surgery will significantly improve outcomes related to pain and function and
      may reduce utilization of health care services post surgery.

      In this randomized control trial we hypothesize that the group of participants who receive a
      prehabilitation Exercise Program will recover quicker than patients who do not receive the
      Exercise Program based on several measures of performance including pain, quadriceps
      strength, range of motion and quality of life.

    <description>The three week, 3 days / week prehabilitation exercise program will consist of resistance training, step training and stretching(flexibility) as well as cardiovascular endurance training. Intensity of training will increase over the three weeks. Classes will be delivered over a four week period with a gap during the third week allowing additional time for participants to practice their exercises. The home exercise program will be designed to account for the additional week.</description>
