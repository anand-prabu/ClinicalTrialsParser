The investigators hypothesized that HIIT modality  will lead to a larger\n      improvement in physical fitness (i.e. VO2peak), cardiovascular parameters (cardiac output\n      and stroke volume)  and cognitive performance at rest and during submaximal exercise. The\n      primary endpoint will be the improvement in cognitive performance."

The selected HIIE session represented the best compromise between safety, time spent at a high level of VO2peak and psychological adherence. This HIIE session consists of a 10-min warm-up at 50% of MAP, followed by two sets of 10 min composed of repeated bouts of 15 s at 100% of MAP interspersed by 15 s of passive recovery. Four minutes of passive recovery were allowed between the two sets, as well as a 5-min cool-down after the last 15-s exercise bout. A total duration of 35 minutes will be employed for this session for coronary artery disease patients, and 22 minutes for chronic heart failure patients (Guiraut et al. 2010 b).",
