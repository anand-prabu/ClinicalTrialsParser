Blood\n      samples for PK analysis and measurement of Lp-PLA2 activity will also be collected.\n      Questionnaires will be completed to evaluate the frequency of odorrelated AEs with\n      non-enteric coated formulation of SB-659032 relative to placebo. This will be a double\n      blind, repeat dose, randomized, placebo-controlled, two period, period balanced, crossover\n      study. There will be a minimum of a 21 day washout period between dosing in each period."
