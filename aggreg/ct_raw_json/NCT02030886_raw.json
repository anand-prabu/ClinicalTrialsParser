Elevation of IOP above normal\n      range is called \"ocular hypertension\" (OHT). In a previous study, it has been shown that OHT\n      patients who progress to glaucoma (converters) have at baseline and prior to any conversion,\n      IOP patterns that more closely resemble those of established early primary open-angle\n      glaucoma (POAG) patients, while stable OHT patients (non-converters) have IOP patterns\n      closer to those of healthy control subjects. The study has been planned to recruit at least\n      48 eligible patients (24 converters and 24 non-converters)."
