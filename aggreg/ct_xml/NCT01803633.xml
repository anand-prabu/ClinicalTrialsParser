      Phase 2 of this study involves determining how consumption of cheese compared with a
      non-dairy cheese substitute influences inflammation over a six hour period.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 2 is a randomized crossover study designed to determine how consumption of cheese
      compared with a non-dairy cheese substitute influences postprandial inflammation in
      participants who have 2 or more risk factors of metabolic syndrome or BMI â‰¥ 30.

      Eligible participants will arrive to the Western Human Nutrition Research Center (WHNRC) at
      the University of California (UC) Davis campus on the morning of each test day after a
      10-12-hr overnight fast. Upon arrival participants will fill out a questionnaire about their
      dietary and medication intakes and  physical activity for the past 72 hours to ensure
      compliance. Compliant participants' weight and blood pressure will be measured and a fasting
      blood draw will be taken before participants consume their test meal (cheese or non-dairy
      cheese substitute). Participants will only consume this test meal and water freely for the
      duration of the test day. Blood will be drawn serially at 1, 3 and 6 hours postprandially.
      Participants will be tested on a second test day two weeks after the first test.

      On the second test day, participants' body composition and bone mineral density will be
      measured by dual x-ray absorptiometry.
