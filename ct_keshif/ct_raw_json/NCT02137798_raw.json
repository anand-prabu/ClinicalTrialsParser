This\n      randomized single-center study is to evaluate the reduction on fluoroscopy levels (time and\n      dosis) in catheter interventional treatment of symptomatic, antiarrhythmic refractory\n      paroxysmal atrial fibrillation using fluoroscopic image integrated 3-dimentional\n      electroanatomical mapping system, comparing with using 3-dimentional electroanatomical\n      mapping system without fluoroscopic image integration. Patients with documented paroxysmal\n      atrial fibrillation, who are going to receive a catheter interventional treatment to atrial\n      fibrillation, will be randomized (1:1) into two groups after signing an informed consent.\n      Group 1 (CARTOUNIVU): using fluoroscopic image integrated 3-dimentional electroanatomical\n      mapping system. Group 2 (CARTO3): using 3-dimentional electroanatomical mapping system\n      without fluoroscopic image integration.\n\n      The ablation strategies in both study groups are the same, including circumferential\n      isolation of ipsilateral pulmonary veins (PV) and voltage map guided substrate modification.\n      According to the randomization, the ablation procedure will be performed with or without\n      fluoroscopic image integration.\n\n      The primary endpoint of this study is the evaluation of reduction on fluoroscopy levels\n      (fluoroscopy time and dosis) during atrial fibrillation ablation procedure. Secondary\n      endpoints include complete isolation of the pulmonary veins, completely bidirectional block\n      of linear ablation lines, total procedure time, ablation-related complications."
