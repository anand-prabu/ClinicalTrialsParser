    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, controlled trial comparing telephone-cognitive behavior therapy
      (T-CBT) with a therapist to a &quot;Stepped Care&quot; intervention for depression treatment (iCBT
      with support from a telephone coach with the possibility of being stepped up to receiving
      T-CBT with a therapist).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common, with 12-month prevalence rates estimated to be
      between 6.6-10.3%. While many depressed patients state they would prefer psychological
      treatment to pharmacotherapy, substantial barriers to care exist, including cost, practical
      barriers such as time constraints and transportation, emotional barriers such as stigma,
      decreased motivation associated with depression itself, physical disability, and lack of
      availability of services. Telemental health has been proposed as a method of overcoming
      barriers to treatment. Research has focused primarily on two formats: the telephone and the
      Internet. Use of the telephone as a delivery medium produces reductions in depression
      equivalent to face-to-face psychological treatments, while also significantly reducing
      attrition. However, its success in outreach can also significantly increase costs for
      healthcare providing organizations. Internet interventions have the potential to produce
      moderate gains when supported by therapist or coach via brief telephone calls or e-mail but
      are also less expensive than standard therapy. Developing healthcare models that integrate
      treatment delivery media holds the promise of harnessing the advantages of each media, while
      minimizing the disadvantages. Stepped care models are a potentially useful framework for
      achieving such an integration. The stepped care model we will test initiates treatment with
      a validated, guided Internet cognitive behavioral therapy program. If patients fail to
      respond, they will be stepped up to a validated telephone-cognitive behavior therapy
      (T-CBT). The stepped care model will be compared to T-CBT in a randomized trial. Patients
      will be recruited from primary care and treated for up to 20 weeks, or until sustained
      remission is achieved.
