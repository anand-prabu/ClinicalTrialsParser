An alternate (non-inferior) strategy for management may be\n      possible, and may be associated with improved quality of life and fewer complications, and\n      lower overall costs. Although several researchers have suggested a clinical trial to\n      investigate this idea this would be the first time it has been done, and \tcould therefore be\n      practice changing."
