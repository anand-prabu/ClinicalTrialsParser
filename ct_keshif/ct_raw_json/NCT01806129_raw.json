To evaluate the success of the implementation of reproductive health\n      programming (Didactics, Engendering Reproductive Health Within Oncologic Survivorship [EROS]\n      Reproductive Health Assessment and EROS Trial Algorithm) among reproductive aged women\n      (18-55) with cancer. SECONDARY OBJECTIVES: I. To assess the degree of discrepancy between\n      patients and their clinicians in estimates of significance of the reproductive health goals\n      for the patient. II. To evaluate baseline and follow-up reproductive health assessments for\n      trends in reproductive health choices relating to oncofertility, oncocontraception and\n      pregnancy over the 5 year study period. III. To identify clinical and demographic factors\n      that predict the adequacy of reproductive health care management. TERTIARY OBJECTIVES: I. To\n      perform a longitudinal study following endocrine markers of fertility in a cohort of the\n      first 200 registered EROS trial patients who agree to participate. II. To perform a\n      longitudinal study of sexual function using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement\n      Information System (PROMIS) sexual function survey in all subjects participating in the EROS\n      Trial. OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms. ARM A: Patients undergo usual\n      standard practice related to reproductive health. ARM B: Patients undergo reproductive\n      health program comprising didactics, reproductive health assessment and navigating\n      algorithm, and network development. After completion of study treatment, patients are\n      followed up periodically."
