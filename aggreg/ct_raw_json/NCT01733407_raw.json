The investigators now plan to perform a two year study of L-serine supplementation\n      to correct the biochemistry and neurological disease in humans with HSAN1.

            "textblock": "The study objective is to evaluate the efficacy of L-serine in subjects with hereditary\n      sensory neuropathy type 1 (HSAN1). Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type I\n      (HSAN1) is a progressive and debilitating illness for which currently no treatment exists.\n      The investigators recently identified two novel deoxysphingoid bases (DSB) that accumulate\n      in plasma of HSAN1 patients and mutant transgenic HSAN1 mice. The disease is caused by\n      missense mutations in the SPTLC1 gene encoding a subunit of the enzyme serine\n      palmitoyltransferase (SPT). In normal circumstances the SPT enzyme catalyzes the reaction of\n      palmitoyl-CoA with serine to form sphinganine. The two newly identified DSB,\n      deoxysphinganine and deoxymethylsphinganine, arise from condensation of palmitoyl-CoA with\n      alanine and glycine respectively, suggesting that HSAN1 mutations alter amino acid\n      selectivity of SPT. In support of this hypothesis the investigators have shown that levels\n      of DSB in humans and mice can be lowered by supplementation with the enzyme's normal\n      substrate, serine.\n\n      In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross over study the investigators will\n      enroll 20 research participants with HSAN1 with 10 subjects assigned to L-serine\n      (400mg/kg/d) and 10 assigned to placebo who are each treated for 12 months. The 10 subjects\n      assigned to placebo will then be crossed over to active L-serine for the remaining 12\n      months. The progression of HSAN1 will be measured by the change in an established clinical\n      rating scale and measures of intraepidermal nerve fiber density (IENFD) on skin biopsy.\n      L-serine levels will be measured using 24-hour pharmacokinetic blood sample at 12-month\n      intervals. The investigators will assess the percentage of failures (clinical decline of > 1\n      point on CMTNS or > 30% decrease in IENFD) at 6 month intervals. Regardless of CMTNS score,\n      all subjects who are on placebo for the first year will be switched to active study drug in\n      year two."
