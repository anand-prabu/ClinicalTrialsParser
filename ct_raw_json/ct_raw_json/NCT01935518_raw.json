The secondary outcomes are the survival time, endpoint time(death, tracheotomy and\n      continuous ventilator-dependent), forced vital capacity (FVC), the short form health survey\n      (SF-36), evaluation of cognitive function (verbal fluency and Frontal Behavioral Inventory\n      Scale) and safety."
