  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), more than 300,000 babies with HIV die each year. HIV-infected
      children develop AIDS and die faster in SSA than those in developed countries. Bacille
      Calmette-Guerin (BCG) vaccine is given to infants at birth in SSA to protect them from
      severe forms of TB. BCG is known to cause immune cells to be active and replicate faster.
      The immune system of neonates also responds differently to BCG that to other vaccines and
      infections. We hypothesize that the routine immunization of neonates with BCG contributes to
      generalized immune activation in HIV-exposed infants resulting in skewed immune responses to
      vaccines and infections and increased rates of disease progression in those infants that
      become HIV-infected. However, delaying BCG until HIV testing is completed would result in
      operational difficulties, and may not induce the appropriate immune response. Delayed BCG
      would also render many HIV-exposed uninfected infants at high risk for disseminated TB. We
      plan to assess immune cells in infants to determine the impact of the timing of BCG
      vaccination on immune responses to tuberculosis (TB) and other vaccines. We will also
      compare the immune activation and disease progression of those infants that become
      HIV-infected in the BCG or control arms. Our results will provide key insights into the
      effect of BCG vaccination on immune responses to HIV as well as inform the optimal timing of
      BCG vaccination for HIV-exposed infants.
