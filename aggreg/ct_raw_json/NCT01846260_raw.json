            "textblock": "Cognitive impairment associated with chemotherapy is an important reported post-treatment\n      side-effect among breast and other cancer survivors. As some patients report cognitive\n      complaints before the administration of their therapy, some authors suggest an association\n      with psychological risk factors such as distress. Distress, a multifactorial unpleasant\n      emotional experience of a psychological (cognitive, behavioral and emotional), social and/or\n      spiritual nature that may interfere with the ability to cope with cancer effectively, its\n      physical symptoms and its treatment, can easily be assessed by the Distress Thermometer.\n\n      In this trial we aim to determine if the Distress Thermometer, accompanied by the 38-item\n      Problem List, could predict cancer-related cognitive impairment in patients with hematologic\n      malignancies, and in patients with gynecological, urological, breast, lung or\n      gastro-intestinal cancer receiving curative radiotherapy, chemotherapy, radiochemotherapy,\n      anti-hormonal or targeted therapy."
