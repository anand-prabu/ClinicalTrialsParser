Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining more than one drug with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma."

Assess the toxic\n      effects associated with this regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate this regimen in terms\n      of fatigue, depression, excessive daytime somnolence, and quality of life in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive carmustine IV over 1 hour on days 1-3, oral etoposide on days 1-21\n      and 29-49, and cisplatin IV over 1-2 hours on days 1-3 and 29-31. Treatment repeats every 8\n      weeks for 3 courses. Patients receive radiotherapy concurrently with the third course of\n      chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 4\n      years, and then annually for 5 years. Patients are followed every 3 months for 5 years and\n      then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28 patients will be accrued for this study within 20 months."
