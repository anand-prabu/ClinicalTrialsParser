    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, multi-center, open-label, drug-drug interaction (DDI) and PK study in
      subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.  It is designed to evaluate the effect of
      brodalumab on midazolam PK in addition to assessing single dose PK of brodalumab in subjects
      with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis.

      Approximately 30 subjects will be enrolled into two groups. Group 1 consists of 20 subjects
      and will receive 2 oral doses of midazolam and a single subcutaneous (SC) dose of
      brodalumab.  Group 2 consists of 10 subjects and will receive a single SC dose of
      brodalumab.
