The\n      data collection mechanism for this study is the INTERMACS Registry.\n\n      Study Objectives\n\n      Primary Objectives:\n\n        -  To confirm that patients implanted with the TAH-t and supported by the Companion 2\n           Driver System have outcomes similar to those patients implanted with the TAH-t and\n           supported by the CSS Console.\n\n        -  To review additional data (patient survival, adverse event rates and bridge to\n           transplant rates) to support the conclusion that the use of an artificial heart is\n           reasonable and necessary for the treatment of irreversible biventricular failure in\n           Medicare/Medicaid patients.\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n        -  To evaluate the incidence of adverse events (AEs). The AEs will follow the definitions\n           in the INTERMACS Registry.\n\n      Study Hypothesis\n\n      The primary hypothesis is that the survival rate (defined as transplant prior to three\n      months, transfer to the Freedom Driver System support prior to three months, or continuing\n      on implant driver support at three months, whichever occurs first) for patients supported\n      with the Companion 2 Driver System is not worse than the survival rate for patients\n      supported with the Circulatory Support System (CSS) Console.\n\n      Data Collection\n\n      The data will be collected as defined in the INTERMACS Protocol and the patients will be\n      followed at one week, one month and three months or until their study endpoint is reached.\n\n      Data Analysis\n\n      Data analysis will provide descriptive statistics on enrollment, adverse events, and\n      outcomes for TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the Companion 2 Driver\n      System compared to TAH-t patients who were implanted while supported with the CSS Console."
