      Objective:Health videos and group education to allow patients to a correct understanding of
      diabetes and insulin treatment.

      Method:

      Standards and number of patients:  The patients received subcutaneous insulin injection,
      estimated 30 people enrolled.

      Experimental Design and Methods:

        1. Screening out-patient treatment with insulin use, HbA1c&gt; 8% or poor postprandial
           glucose (PPG)

        2. At the time of the visits, invite the patient to participate in the Video group
           education on insulin therapy  By answering some questions about insulin injections,
           such as: do not know how to perform; afraid of the pain; fear of inconvenience, give
           patients time to complete the questionnaire.

      Diabetes is a long-term chronic disease. The patients need to correct &quot;knowledge and action&quot;
      lifestyle in order to achieve effective blood glucose control. Upon the general control of
      diabetic patients in Taiwan, however, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) is not satisfactory.
      One of the important reasons is the low rate of insulin injection. For the use of insulin,
      the patient has many misconception. The patients in the clinic need to spend a lot of time
      to explain and description, but the results are not necessarily good. So we hope that in
      this part of the health education activities through organized groups Videos to assist
      doctors and patients as a bridge of communication, to enhance diabetes doctor thus
      contributing to glycemic control results.
