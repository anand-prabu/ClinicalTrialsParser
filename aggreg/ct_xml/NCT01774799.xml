      This is a 5-year cluster RCT of a video Advance Care Planning intervention vs. control among
      360 nursing home residents with advanced dementia (N=180/arm) in 20 matched nursing homes
      (10 intervention/10 control). Clinical outcomes will be collected at baseline, and quarterly
      (up to 12-months) regarding goals of care preferences, advance care planning, and treatments
      received. The primary outcome is decisions not to be hospitalized at 6 months.

      The over-riding goal of the EVINCE study is to conduct a cluster RCT of a video Advance Care
      Planning intervention in nursing home residents with advanced dementia. A total of 360
      nursing home residents with advanced dementia (N=180/arm) in 20 matched nursing homes (10
      intervention/10 control) will be recruited. These residents' proxies with also be recruited
      for a total sample size of 720 residents and proxies (resident/proxy dyads).  Outcomes will
      be compared between residents in the intervention vs, control nursing homes at baseline and
      every 3 months up to 12 months. At baseline proxies of residents in the intervention nursing
      homes will view a 12-minutes video describing three level of care options in advanced
      dementia (intensive, basic and comfort) and their choice will be communicated to the
      resident's primary care providers. Residents in the control nursing homes will receive the
      usual advance care planning practiced in those facilities.
