Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of BMS-247550 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Part II: Patients with ovarian, breast, or other cancer receive BMS-247550 as in the\n           part I portion of the study at the MTD. Treatment continues in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 42-66 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-16\n      months."
