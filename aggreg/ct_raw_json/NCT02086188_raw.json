Trial will\n      last approximately 12 weeks for each subject, including screening period and treatment\n      period.\n\n      Active drug will be mirabegron 25mg daily with optional up-titration to 50mg daily after\n      approximately 5 weeks.  Subjects will be randomized at the Baseline Visit based on\n      recordings in a voiding diary kept for 72 continuous hours in the screening period.\n\n      Voiding diaries of a 72 hour period each will be utilized during the screening period,\n      between Phone Visit 1 and Titration and between Phone Visit 2 and Final Visit. In the\n      diaries, subjects will record the time of each micturition and/or urgency episode, urine\n      volume with each void (when available), any episode of incontinence, and the severity of\n      urgency (Overactive Bladder Symptom Composite Score, mean of 72 hour total daily cumulative\n      score.\n\n      Primary outcome will be average daily OAB-SCS total score, Final Visit vs. Baseline.
