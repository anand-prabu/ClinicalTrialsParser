The\n                stuffing will be removed on postoperative day 2. The patients will be discharged\n                on day 3 after surgery.\n\n             -  Other treatment: All patients will receive nasal irrigation (normal saline 500 mg\n                twice daily) from postoperative day 3 until day 30.

Drug treatment phase Three days after the surgery (FESS) described above,  all patients\n           will be assigned to the following two groups (30 patients each group) using random\n           numbers generated by statistical software.\n\n             -  Experimental group: Montelukast (10mg, once daily) and MFNS (200\u03bcg, once daily)\n                for 6 months\n\n             -  Control group: MFNS (200\u03bcg, once daily) for 6 months\n\n        3.
