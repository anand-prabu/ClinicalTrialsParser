If necessary, doses\n      should be either held or permanently discontinued (per package insert instructions).\n      Protocol specific dosing guidance is included in the 12PLK02 Work Instructions.\n\n      Patients will be scheduled for four response assessments.  Response assessment timing should\n      be targeted to fall within the following time points: between 5-11 weeks, 13-19 weeks, 24-30\n      weeks and one year after initiating therapy in either treatment arm. Timing of the response\n      assessments may be adjusted to facilitate clinical procedures and treatment decisions.\n\n      Patient treatment tolerability and safety events will be monitored and managed while\n      enrolled in the 12PLK02 study.  Patients who receive HD IL-2 in the 12PLK02 study will be\n      enrolled in the PROCLAIM study (Registry Protocol 10PLK13) for the collection of long-term\n      assessment data, including response and disease status and treatment decisions.  Patient\n      treatment data will be entered in to the PROCLAIM database, for a minimum target of 2 years\n      and potentially up to 5 years, after the patient completes the 12PLK02 study."
