This\n      study will aim to illustrate this by using the Oxford Knee Score and Western Ontario and\n      McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) to illustrate quantifiable difference between\n      the two treatment modalities. Patient satisfaction will be compared by utilizing the\n      Short-Form Survey-12 (SF-12) Score. Our null hypothesis states IA PrP is more beneficial in\n      the long-term treatment of primary OA of the knee."

The patients will be aware and will be consenting to the\n      treatment they will be receiving. An investigator from the research team, blinded to group\n      assignment, will assist patients in completing the Oxford Knee score, WOMAC and SF-12 scores\n      prior to receiving the treatment and at 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after receiving the\n      treatment. In addition, they will be followed by regularly (at 3 weeks, 9 weeks, 4 months\n      and 5 months) via telephone to inquire about any side effects of the treatment and to\n      document patient satisfaction. Subjects in both groups will continue to receive concomitant\n      treatments both pharmacological and nonpharmacological. All subjects will receive\n      physiotherapy sessions with their respective intervention.\n\n      The duration of this single blinded, prospective randomized trial will therefore be 6\n      months. Subjects will continue to receive treatment even if they wish to withdraw from the\n      study at any point."
