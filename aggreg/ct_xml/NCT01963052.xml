  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess the safety, pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity and
      anti-tumor activity of AGS15E in subjects with metastatic urothelial cancer who failed at
      least one prior chemotherapy regimen for metastatic disease.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a single intravenous infusion of AGS15E once weekly for 3 weeks of
      every 4 weeks.  A cycle is 4 weeks.  Subjects will continue treatment until disease
      progression, intolerability of AGS15E or consent withdrawal.

      The study design will follow a modified Continual Reassessment Method (CRM).  A disease
      assessment will be conducted every 8 weeks (Q8W) +/- 7 days until disease progression.

      A data review team (DRT) will review cumulative unaudited data on an interim basis to
      explore additional doses and/or schedules, or the expansion of existing cohorts. Doses
      intermediate to those predefined in the protocol may be explored with DRT endorsement.
