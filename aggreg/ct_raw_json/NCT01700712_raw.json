The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of probiotic lactobacilli\n      on plaque lactic acid (LA) production in vitro and in vivo.\n\n      Methods. subjects (n=18) were given lozenges with probiotic lactobacilli (L. reuteri DSM\n      17938 and ATCC PTA 5289) or placebo for two weeks in a double-blinded, randomized cross-over\n      trial. The concentration of LA in supragingival plaque samples was determined at baseline\n      and after 2 weeks. Salivary counts of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli were\n      estimated with chair-side methods."
