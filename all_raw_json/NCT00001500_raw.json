The\n      subjects will be adult male and female probands who display one or more of the phenotypes of\n      interest together with their brothers, sisters and parents.  Information on tobacco and\n      alcohol use, psychological and personality traits, sexual behavior, HIV status and\n      progression, and other characteristics with possible genetic components will be obtained\n      through structured interviews and questionnaires.  DNA will be prepared from blood samples\n      and typed for a series of candidate genes chosen for function and for random polymorphic\n      markers.  By correlating the genotypic and phenotypic information, we hope to identify\n      individual loci that interactively contribute to many different aspects of human health and\n      disease."
