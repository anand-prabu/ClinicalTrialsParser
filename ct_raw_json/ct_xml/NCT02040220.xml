    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, multi center post-authorization safety study that
      includes patients with a diagnosis of CRVO.  The investigator will have made the choice of
      treatment (EYLEA) as well as the decision to use EYLEA according the Japanese Package Insert
      prior to enrolling the patient in this study.

      The observation period for each patient starts when therapy with EYLEA is initiated. The
      enrollment period is 2 years. Patients will be followed for a time period of 2 years or
      until it is no longer possible (e.g. lost to follow-up) within the 2 years.

      For each patient, data are collected as defined in the case report form at the initial
      visit, follow-up visits and final visit, either by routine clinical visits (as per
      investigators routine practice).

      There will interim analysis of study data: 6 months after last patient first visit and
      J-PSUR(Japanese-Periodic Safety Update Report )

        Female and male patients with a diagnosis of CRVO will be enrolled after the decision for
        treatment with EYLEA has been made by the investigator. Those patients prescribed EYLEA
        previously will not be included in this study. Physicians should consult the full
        prescribing information for EYLEA before enrolling patients and familiarize themselves
        with the safety information in the product package label. Eligible patients who receive
        EYLEA will be enrolled and documented in the eCRF.
