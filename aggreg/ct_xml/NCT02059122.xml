  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site trial assessing the sensitivity of DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA versus
      standard reference tests (e.g. PCR or viral culture) for dengue diagnosis in the US and
      internationally.

      The DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of early
      stages of Dengue infection in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with Dengue
      infection.  This test is intended to be used on sera obtained within the first 7 days of
      symptoms. DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing
      with a reference standard test.

      Subjects will be patients who present with symptoms consistent with dengue infection, such
      as fever and myalgia. After informed consent is obtained and the subject is screened for
      eligibility, 2 diagnostic samples will be collected. The first will be collected within the
      first 7 days of symptoms onset, and the second will be collected at least 7 days later,
      between the 10th and 21st days post-onset of symptoms.

      ELISA and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff
      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples
      from each method independently.

        Human males and females of varying ages and geographical locations where dengue fever is
        endemic.  We will use retrospective (archived) and prospective human serum samples.

        Some study sites will only use retrospective (archived) serum samples not collected
        specifically for this study and not individually identifiable to the Investigators.
        These samples will fall under the category of &quot;leftover&quot; specimens as described by FDA
        guidance.  These archived samples will have been collected from patients within 7 days
        after onset of symptoms consistent with Dengue infection.

        In addition paired prospective samples will be collected in compliance with human subject
        protection.   The prospective samples will be collected from patients with symptoms
        consistent with Dengue infection.   The first sample will be collected within the first 7
        days of symptom onset; the second sample will be collected: 1) at least seven days later;
        and 2) between the 10th and 21st day of symptom onset.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All age groups and both sexes.

          -  Initial serum samples must be collected within 1- 7 days of onset of symptoms
             consistent with Dengue virus infection.

          -  Information must be available about symptoms, age, and sex of patient from which
             samples are collected.

          -  The location of sample collection must be recorded.

          -  Archived samples that have been sent to reference labs for dengue or flavivirus
             testing should be considered for inclusion as test specimens in this study.  If these
             specimens are included in this study, then they must have a documented history that
             the specimen was obtained within the first 7 days of onset of subject symptoms
             consistent with dengue infection.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Archived samples with linked personal identifiers or any sample for which personal
             information can be discovered.

          -  Prospective samples from nursing home residents; inmates/subjects in police custody;
             participants who are unable to understand verbal or written local language in which a
             certified translation of the informed consent is available, or requires a Legal
             Authorized Representative (LAR) for consent.

          -  Subject serum specimens that have undergone more than 2 freeze-thaw cycles or that
             have not been stored frozen.
