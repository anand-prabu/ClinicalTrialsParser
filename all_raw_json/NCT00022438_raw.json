Combining\n      vaccine therapy with interleukin-2 may be an effective treatment for metastatic melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy plus\n      interleukin-2 to that of vaccine therapy alone in treating patients who have metastatic\n      melanoma that has not responded to previous treatment."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to\n      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who do not need immediate IL-2 are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51\n           subcutaneously (SC) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 4 courses in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive TRP-2:180-188 peptide vaccine emulsified with Montanide ISA-51\n           SC once weekly on weeks 1-4. Treatment repeats every 7 weeks for up to 4 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients who have a complete response (CR) receive 1 additional course after achieving CR.\n      Patients who have progressive disease while receiving vaccine alone may cross over to\n      receive peptide vaccine with IL-2 for at least 2 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 83 patients (19-33 who need immediate interleukin-2 (IL-2);\n      15-25 per treatment arm who do not need immediate IL-2) will be accrued for this study\n      within 1 year."
