It is the most common cause of\n      motor disability in childhood. Most therapies are palliative rather than restorative.\n      Umbilical cord blood (UCB) and erythropoetin (EPO) may be used as restorative approach for\n      children with CP.\n\n      Many experimental animal studies have revealed that UCB is beneficial to improve and repair\n      neurological injuries. EPO is also known to have neuroprotective effects.\n\n      Based on animal studies and some clinical trials, UCB is suggested as a potential therapy\n      for children with CP. EPO is combined to add synergistic effects to UCB therapy."
