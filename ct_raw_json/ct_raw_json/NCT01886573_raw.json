Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Entinostat may stop the\n      growth of cancer tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving\n      azacitidine with entinostat may be an effective treatment for non-small cell lung cancer."

To measure the 3-year disease-free survival of operable non-small cell lung cancer\n      (NSCLC) patients who receive 1 cycle of preoperative epigenetic treatment.\n\n      II. To determine any potential toxicities, and reversibility of toxicities, of a single\n      pre-operative cycle of 5-azacytidine and entinostat.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive azacitidine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-6 and 8-10 and entinostat orally\n      (PO) on days 3 and 10. Patients undergo surgery between days 11-20 (this period can be\n      extended 10 more days if adverse events from therapy impose a surgical risk).\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks, every 3 months for\n      2 years and then every 6 months for 1 year."
