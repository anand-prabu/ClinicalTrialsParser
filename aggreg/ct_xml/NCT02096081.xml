  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to show that two FDA-approved Botulinum toxin drugs called
      Xeomin® and Toxin II can reduce the severity of vertical lines (wrinkles) that appear
      between the eyebrows (called glabellar frown lines).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, parallel group clinical study
      to investigate the equivalence of incobotulinumtoxinA (Xeomin®) to Toxin II in the treatment
      of Glabellar Frown Lines.
