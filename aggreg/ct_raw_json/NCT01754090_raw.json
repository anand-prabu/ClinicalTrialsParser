The second on relapse prevention - for example, when clients report drinking more than their target, they receive individualized content aimed at preventing a full blown relapse. The third is emotion regulation, where content and assignments from positive psychology and from cognitive behavioral therapy are used. Finally, intervention covers alcohol education (i.e. the same topics as in the booklet provided to the control group).",
