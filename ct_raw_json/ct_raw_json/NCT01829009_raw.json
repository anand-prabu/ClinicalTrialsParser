            "textblock": "Aging is characterized by a progressive loss of multiple physical and cognitive abilities.\n      From these changes, the most important one is the loss of muscle mass, which has been called\n      \"sarcopenia\". Resistance exercise is a therapeutic approach for sarcopenia, nevertheless\n      there is no universal consensus. Therefore, this research is interested in determining the\n      effect of a resistance exercise program on physical performance and/or functional status in\n      sarcopenic older women. The main study hypothesis is that a program of resistance exercise\n      will improve physical performance and functional status in sarcopenic older women compared\n      against general recommendations.\n\n      This is a single-blind, controlled clinical trial, including women> 70 years, living in the\n      community with sarcopenia. Those who agree to participate, will be randomly assigned to one\n      of the following groups:\n\n        1. Resistance Exercise Group\n\n        2. General Recommendations Group (control) The study will last 24 weeks, with 4\n           measurements performed at baseline, week 6, 12 and 24. Multilevel models (random\n           effects) will be constructed for the comparison between the two groups. Tests will be\n           conducted with a P=0.05 and confidence intervals at 95%. This protocol has been\n           approved by the local ethics committee."
