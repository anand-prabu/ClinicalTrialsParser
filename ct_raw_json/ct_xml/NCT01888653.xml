  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging research implicates biased attention to threat in the pathophysiology of anxiety
      disorders. Recent findings demonstrate significant associations between attention bias and
      stress vulnerability. This work has motivated the development of a novel therapy,
      attention-bias-modification treatment (ABMT). ABMT is designed to implicitly modify
      patients' biased threat attendance via computerized training protocols. Emerging evidence
      indicates that ABMT is effective in modifying threat-related attention biases and in
      ameliorating anxiety symptoms. However, it is unclear whether ABMT is efficacious for
      Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The present pilot study is a double blind trial that
      seeks to examine feasibility, acceptability, safety, efficacy, and risk/benefit ratio of
      ABMT in individuals with PTSD. In addition this pilot study seeks to identify specific genes
      associated with anxiety disorders and to examine whether these can predict the success of
      the ABMT.

    <description>Placebo-training program: The placebo condition is identical to the ABMT protocol except that during the presentation of the trials where a threat face is presented, the probe will appear with equal frequency in the position of the threat and neutral faces. Thus, neither threat nor neutral faces provide information regarding the position of the target probe, and there is no contingency between the position of either threat or neutral words, and the position of the probes.</description>

    <description>ABMT is designed to implicitly modify patients' biased threat attendance via computerized training protocols. Recent meta analysis of 10 eligible RCTs (N=467) concluded that ABMT produced significantly greater reduction in anxiety symptoms than control training, with a medium effect size (d=.61, p&lt;.001).11</description>

    <description>Attention Bias Modification Treatment (ABMT) is a novel 4-week, intervention designed to normalize attention bias to threat and reduce symptoms of anxiety. This neuroscience-informed treatment grew from research linking attention biases to neurocognitive perturbations in PTSD. Currently available treatments, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, may fail to address anxiety-related deficits in rapidly deployed processes instantiated in subcortical circuitries.ABMT was designed to at least partially address such rapidly-deployed processed through repetitive, computer based training methods, methods previously shown to alter implicit and dynamic neural processes.</description>
