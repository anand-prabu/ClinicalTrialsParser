            "textblock": "Type 2 diabetes is a major healthcare problem in the developed and developing world. Recent\n      clinical trials have demonstrated that it may be prevented by lifestyle intervention focused\n      on diet and physical activity. These trials have been expensive and labour intensive and\n      this has limited translation of the known benefits to the population at large.\n\n      We propose using a mobile phone intervention for lifestyle change and will assess it in a\n      clinical trial(study) in people with impaired glucose regulation (high risk at developing\n      type 2 diabetes).\n\n      The study will be conducted in both India and the UK. The purpose of the study is to assess\n      the effectiveness and acceptability of a text messaging system to prevent the progression to\n      diabetes in people with high risk. The study involves five visits to clinic over 2 year\n      period.\n\n      Study participants will be divided into two groups by the computer generated random method -\n      one is 'Usual Care' group and the other 'Text Messaging' group.\n\n        -  Usual care will consist of a 30 minute interview, delivering personalized diet and\n           exercise advice, supplemented by written material and education regarding diabetes.\n           This will be delivered once at the beginning of the study.\n\n        -  The intervention group will undergo the same initial interview and, in addition, will\n           receive 3 times weekly text messaging with education, advice, support and motivation.\n           These messages will be personalized to individual targets set at the initial interview.\n\n      The primary outcome will be progression to diabetes, with and without SMS intervention.\n      Secondary outcomes will be improvements in physical activity (reported and directly\n      measured), body weight and other cardiovascular risk factors (blood pressure, total and HDL\n      cholesterol and serum triglycerides)."

We\n           estimate that the two year conversion rate to diabetes in the control group will be\n           25%. A total of 1134 individuals per group are required across both countries to detect\n           a 20% reduction in risk of progression with 80% power at 5% significance. A study of\n           this size will be able to address the question of whether, overall, the text messaging\n           system is effective in reducing progression to diabetes in high risk individuals. It\n           will not be sufficiently powered to address this question in each country separately,\n           nor to detect differences of effect between them. However, a study of this size is\n           extremely well powered to detect an impact on the continuously distributed secondary\n           outcome of moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) as assessed by Actigraph. The\n           standard deviation of MVPA in the ProActive trial was 17 minutes per day.  Thus the\n           study overall has >99% power to detect a difference of 4 minutes per day of extra\n           walking between groups. It will be possible, therefore, to examine country specific\n           effects of the intervention on MVPA\n\n        -  Missing, unused, and spurious data will be assessed on an individual basis and may be\n           ignored, withdrawn or the visit may be removed from the analysis with appropriate\n           justification adjudicated by the Principal Investigator.\n\n        -  Data will be analyzed using parametric and nonparametric statistical methods for the\n           primary and secondary outcomes.\n\n      Regulatory Issues:\n\n        -  Ethics Approval The Chief Investigator has obtained approval from the Westminster\n           Research Ethics Committee.  Local Research and Development(R&D) Approval at each\n           participating NHS Trust is also required before accepting participants into the study.\n           The study will be conducted in accordance with the recommendations for physicians\n           involved in research on human subjects adopted by the 18th World Medical Assembly,\n           Helsinki 1964 and later revisions.\n\n        -  Consent to enter the study must be sought from each participant only after a full\n           explanation has been given, an information leaflet offered and time allowed for\n           consideration.
