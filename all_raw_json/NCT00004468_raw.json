Patients either apply\n      topical petrolatum (Vaseline) with calcitriol (vitamin D3) on a psoriatic lesion daily and\n      petrolatum only on an other similar lesion daily to serve as a control (arm I) or receive\n      oral calcitriol nightly (arm II).\n\n      Arm I patients continue treatment for at least 2 months.  At the end of 2 months of topical\n      treatment, one biopsy is taken of the lesion treated with calcitriol, one biopsy of the\n      lesion treated with petrolatum alone, and one biopsy of skin unaffected by psoriasis.\n      Lesions are also photographed prior to therapy, 2-4 weeks during therapy for the first two\n      months, then once every 1-3 months, and then once at end of treatment.\n\n      Arm II patients increase dosage of oral calcitriol every 2 weeks up to a maximum dosage\n      daily in the absence of adverse effects (high urinary calcium or serum calcium levels).\n      Patients continue treatment for at least 1 month. Lesions are photographed prior to therapy,\n      2-4 weeks during therapy, and then once at end of treatment."
