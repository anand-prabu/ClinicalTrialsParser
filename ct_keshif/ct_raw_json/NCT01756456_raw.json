The patient and/or his/her legal representative must read, sign and date the\n             Informed Consent document before any study-related procedures are performed. The\n             Informed Consent form signed by patients and/or legal representative must have been\n             approved by the IEC/IRB for the current study.\n\n          8.

History of any ocular surgery (including laser or refractive surgical procedures) in\n             the affected eye within the three months before study enrolment. (An exception to the\n             preceding statement will be allowed if the ocular surgery is considered to be the\n             cause of the stage 2 or 3 NK). Ocular surgery in the affected eye will not be allowed\n             during the study treatment period and elective ocular surgery procedures should not\n             be planned during the duration of the follow-up period.\n\n          8.

Presence or history of any ocular or systemic disorder or condition that might hinder\n             the efficacy of the study treatment or its evaluation, could possibly interfere with\n             the interpretation of study results, or could be judged by the investigator to be\n             incompatible with the study visit schedule or conduct (e.g. progressive or\n             degenerative corneal or retinal conditions, uveitis, optic neuritis, poorly\n             controlled diabetes, autoimmune disease, systemic infection, neoplastic diseases).\n\n         13.

These treatments are allowed during the study if initiated\n             prior to 30 days before study enrolment provided they remain stable throughout the\n             course of the study treatment periods.\n\n         14.
