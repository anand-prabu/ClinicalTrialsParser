  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Graft rejection has traditionally been one of the leading causes of cornea transplant
      failure. To help prevent rejection, corticosteroid eye drops are used for an extended period
      after transplant surgery. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and side
      effects of different corticosteroid dosing regimens after endothelial keratoplasty (cornea
      transplant) surgery.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  At least 18 years of age

          -  Male or female patient who had endothelial keratoplasty procedure within the past 1
             to 7 weeks

          -  Patient is able and willing to administer eye drops

          -  Patient is able to comprehend and has signed the Informed Consent form.

          -  Patient is likely to complete the one-year course of the study

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A history of a previous rejection episode in the study eye

          -  A patient exhibiting intraocular inflammation

          -  A patient with a known sensitivity to any of the ingredients in the study medications

          -  A patient who has a condition (i.e., UNCONTROLLED systemic disease) or is in a
             situation which in the investigator's opinion may put the patient at significant
             risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with the
             patient's participation in the study

          -  A patient with abnormal eyelid function.

          -  A patient that is exhibiting active corneal ulceration, keratitis, or conjunctivitis,
             or who has a history of herpetic keratitis.

          -  Presence of any ocular disease that would interfere with the evaluation of the study
             treatment.  However, patients with a history of cystoid macular edema, age-related
             macular degeneration, controlled glaucoma, corneal neovascularization, and other
             non-interfering comorbidities may be enrolled.

          -  A patient with a history of non-compliance with using prescribed medication.

          -  A patient who is concurrently involved in or participated in another randomized
             clinical trial within 30 days prior to enrollment in this study.

          -  Patients who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant within the duration of the
             study
