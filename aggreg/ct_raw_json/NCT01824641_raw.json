However, myocardial perfusion\n      after thrombus aspiration has not been evaluated by a quantitative, invasive method.\n      Investigators intend to determine whether thrombus aspiration of the infarct-related artery\n      increases myocardial perfusion, as measured by IMR, compared to conventional primary PCI.\n\n      Study design PATA-STEMI is a single center, prospective, randomized trial with a planned\n      inclusion of 128 patients with the first STEMI. Patients are randomly assigned, before\n      coronary angiography, to thrombus aspiration using the 6 or 7 French Eliminate aspiration\n      catheter (Terumo Medical Supply, Japan) or to conventional primary PCI. The IMR will be\n      determined in infarct-related artery and non-infarct-related arteries without critical\n      stenosis to measure microcirculatory resistance. The primary endpoint is defined as IMR in\n      infarct-related artery in thrombus aspiration compared to conventional PCI group. Secondary\n      end points are myocardial perfusion grade and resolution of ST-segment elevation, infarct\n      size and left ventricle remodeling, as  assessed by echocardiographic indices. Transthoracic\n      echocardiography will be conducted within 24 hours and at 4 months after the primary PCI.\n\n      Implications: If manual thrombus aspiration reduces microcirculatory resistance, indicating\n      improved myocardial perfusion, as compared to conventional PCI, it might become the\n      preferred strategy in patients with STEMI."
