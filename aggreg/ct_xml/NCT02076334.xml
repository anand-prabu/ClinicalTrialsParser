  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To examine the influence of compression garments manufactured with Far-Infrared technology
      on exercise performance during and after repeated eccentric isokinetic muscle actions of the
      leg extensors.

      Participants: Eighty recreationally active (1-5 hrs per week) healthy participants between
      the ages of 18 - 35 will visit the Neuromuscular Research Laboratory on 6 separate
      occasions, with 4 of those occasions also requiring a visit to Health services for a blood
      draw.

      Procedures (methods): During pre-screening, each participant will complete an informed
      consent document, a health history questionnaire, and have their stature and body mass
      assessed. A familiarization session will then be conducted on a separate day where all
      participants will practice the strength assessment, eccentric isokinetic protocol, and
      ultrasound assessments. Participants will be assigned to 1 of the 4 treatment groups based
      on their initial maximal isometric strength values using a matched-participants design. The
      first experimental session will then begin 2-10 days later, where the participants will
      perform the repeated eccentric exercise protocol (10 sets of 15 eccentric contractions 210
      deg/sec with 3 min of rest between sets) with the non-dominant leg following a 60 min rest
      period where they will wear the apparel and perform a 5 min warm-up on a cycle ergometer.
      Follow-up blood draws and strength and ultrasound assessments will be obtained at 24 and 48
      hours post-exercise. Each participant will also complete a visual analog scale at baseline,
      24, 48, and 72 hours post-exercise to examine perceived muscle soreness.
