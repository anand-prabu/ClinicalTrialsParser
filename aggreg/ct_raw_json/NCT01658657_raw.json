Plasma renin is an enzyme in your blood that\n      can be measured to determine your hypertension subtype. Once the subtype is known, doctors\n      can prescribe specific medications to target your specific hypertension subtype. This study\n      will investigate whether targeting the specific hypertension subtype helps to achieve blood\n      pressure control sooner and with fewer medications compared to a standard fixed dose\n      combination therapy."
