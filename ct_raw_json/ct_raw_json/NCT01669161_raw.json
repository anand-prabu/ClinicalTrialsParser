Patients have two baseline evaluations, one evaluation after implant but before\n      initiation of treatment, and then six weeks of rehabilitation or rehabilitation + VNS,\n      followed by post acute therapy evaluations at 1, 7, and 30 days after the 6-weeks of\n      treatment.  The intent is to assess safety and provide preliminary effectiveness information\n      for VNS for upper limb functional improvement after stroke.
