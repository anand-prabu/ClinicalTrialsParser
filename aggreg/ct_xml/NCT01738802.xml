  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is evaluating the impact of antioxidant supplements on blood sugar control and
      cardiovascular risk factors in adults over the age of 50 with at 3 months of Type 2
      diabetes. The investigators hypothesize that daily supplementation with a multiple
      micronutrient formulation containing dietary and endogenous antioxidants in combination with
      usual care will reduce markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in Type 2 diabetes.

      This study is evaluating the impact of an antioxidant and micronutrient supplement on
      markers of oxidative stress and inflammation as well as on blood sugar control in adults
      over the age of 50 who have had Type 2 diabetes for at least 3 months. The purpose of this
      study is to see if these antioxidants reduce the oxidative and inflammatory state seen in
      patients with Type 2 diabetes as well as whether or not they make it easier to control blood
      sugar, affect the number and dosage of diabetic medications, and/or reduce the risk factors
      involved in long-term diabetes related complications such as in lipid profile and carotid
      intima-media thickness (CIMT).

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a diagnosis of Type 2  diabetes of at least three months duration

          2. 50 years of age or older

          3. Stable medical status (e.g., no myocardial infarction, stroke, major surgery, or
             major mental illness during the previous six months)

          4. Not taking or not expected to be taking any oral glucocorticoids (except for
             replacement therapy for those with adrenal insufficiency), amphetamines, anabolic, or
             weight-reducing agents during the course of the study

          5. Not receiving chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy

          6. Military healthcare beneficiary

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with Type 1 diabetes or those with Type 2 diabetes of less than 3 months
             duration.

          2. Inability to communicate in written and spoken English

          3. Organ (kidney, pancreas, liver) transplant recipients

          4. Individuals who are not likely to return for the follow-up because they or their
             sponsors are likely to have a permanent change of station or termination of service
             before completion of the protocol

          5. Pregnancy (Women who are pre-menopausal will be informed that pregnancy must be ruled
             out by a serum HCG test if they would like to be considered for participation in the
             study. Women who have had a hysterectomy or have not had a menstrual period for at
             least one year prior  to consent will be considered post-menopausal and will not
             require a serum pregnancy test).

          6. Patients who are routinely taking more than 81 mg aspirin (ASA)/day or who are using
             ASA or ASA-containing products to manage a chronic condition.
