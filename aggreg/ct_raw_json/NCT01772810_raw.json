            "textblock": "The treatment will consist of removal of spinal instrumentation (in order to allow\n      monitoring of the cell grafts by serial MRI for long-term), followed by laminectomy or\n      laminoplasty of 1-4 vertebral segments overlying the region of spinal cord injury (no\n      laminectomy if previous laminectomy). The dura will be opened midline and direct injections\n      into spinal parenchyma performed. 6 HSSC injections will be administered bilaterally (3 on\n      each side of midline): 2 at rostral and caudal edge of the injury site and 1 into\n      approximately one segment length inferior to the injury site. The injections will target\n      lateral funiculi, the most rostral injection site being in the first segment caudal to the\n      neurological level defined by ISNCSCI examination. Each injection in the first 4 subjects of\n      Group A will consist of 1 x 105 cells in 10\u03bcL volume. In the second 4 subjects of Group A,\n      each injection will consist of 2 x 105 cells in 10\u03bcL volume:\n\n        -  Group A1, n=4, T2 - T12: 1 x 105 cells in 10\u03bcL/injection x 6 injections\n\n        -  Group A2, n=4, T2 - T12: 2 x 105 cells in 10\u03bcL/injection x 6 injections\n\n      Post-operatively, subjects will receive routine standard of care for laminectomy subjects\n      who undergo an intradural procedure. Prior to and after the transplant, subjects will be\n      required to remain on immunosuppressive therapy for 3 months. Immunosuppressive therapy will\n      consist of: 1) basiliximab (Simulect\u00ae)) 20mg intravenously (IV) within 2 hours prior to the\n      onset of the surgery, then again at day 4 post transplantation; 2) tacrolimus (Prograf\u00ae)\n      initially dosed at a maximum of 0.1 mg/kg divided every 12 hours by mouth (po) on post\n      transplant day 1, and then maintained at a dose that provides a trough serum level of 4-8\n      ng/ml (adjusted for IV use as necessary); and 3) mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept\u00ae) starting\n      from 500mg p.o.\n\n      twice daily, progressively increased over 2 weeks to 1.0 gram twice daily as tolerated. The\n      decision to continue immunosuppression therapy will be at the discretion of the site\n      Principal Investigator. Mycophenolate mofetil may be dosed down to half or discontinued\n      prior to the end of the 3-month period if the subject experiences adverse reactions to the\n      immunosuppressive agents. If adverse reactions still persist, the tacrolimus dose can be\n      further reduced in half and then further considered to be discontinued. The Safety\n      Monitoring Board (SMB) will be convened at approximately 1 month (4 weeks) intervals after\n      the first subject and will review the available safety data of all treated subjects.\n      Starting from Week 13 post cell injection, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil will be\n      gradually withdrawn over 2 weeks. During this period and the ensuing weeks and months, the\n      subject's blood will be monitored for the appearance of antibodies against donor cell HLAs.\n      Signs of graft rejection will also be monitored by changes in MRI intensity of the graft\n      area. If antibodies are detected, the immune suppression regimen will be re-instituted and\n      maintained for as long as tolerable by the subject.\n\n      Subjects will be assessed for adverse events including pain and infection, motor function,\n      and quality of life. Additional assessments will be made to measure any postoperative\n      changes from baseline in neurologic deficits, neurophysiology, imaging studies, bladder or\n      bowel function, allodynia, and neuropathic pain (see Schedule of Events). Subjects will be\n      followed postoperatively at 2 weeks, monthly for 6 months during the study and at every 6\n      months thereafter in post-study safety follow-up for total 60 months post stem cell\n      treatment."
