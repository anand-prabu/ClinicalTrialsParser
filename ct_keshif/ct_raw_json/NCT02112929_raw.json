Since this is a relatively novel\n      technique, the investigators first need to acquire imaging and clinical data from a group of\n      participants with normal lungs. The investigators hope to generate an \"atlas\" of normality,\n      which will form the foundation of future studies to compare with patients suffering from\n      chronic respiratory disease. The investigators also aim to validate the new technique in\n      terms of intra-subject reproducibility."

            "textblock": "Currently, the gold standard for assessment of lung function in chronic respiratory disease\n      is spirometry. This is combined with anatomical imaging (chest x-ray and computed\n      tomography) for structural assessment. Spirometry only measures global lung function. It\n      provides no information regarding the different regions of the lung or about the supporting\n      \"framework\" of the lung itself, the parenchyma. In addition, changes in lung function as\n      measured with spirometric indices do not correlate coherently with the symptoms experienced\n      by patients, nor reflect their decline in health. This weak relationship is probably because\n      the lung is a complex regional organ where localized disturbances of a variety of factors\n      including gas flow (ventilation), blood flow (perfusion) and gas transfer all combine to\n      impair respiratory function.\n\n      MRI has the advantage of being an imaging technique free from ionizing radiation making it\n      safe and practical for diseases such as asthma and obstructive lung disease where repeated\n      follow-up scans are necessary. Hyperpolarized xenon, in the doses given for imaging has been\n      shown to be safe. Conventional MRI has limited use in respiratory disease, because the lung\n      is largely composed of air spaces that do not generate an MR signal. Hyperpolarized noble\n      gases can resolve this problem."
