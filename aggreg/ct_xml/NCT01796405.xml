      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the
      effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is still being studied and that
      research doctors are trying to find out more about it-such as the safest dose to use, the
      side effects it may cause, and if the drug is effective for treating different diseases. It
      also means that the FDA has not yet approved clofarabine for your disease.

      Clofarabine is a chemotherapy drug that has been used in the treatment of leukemia in
      children and adults. Information from other research studies suggests that this drug may
      also be effective in patients with LCH.

      The purpose of this study is to estimate the response rates of participants with recurrent
      LCH to clofarabine within each of two strata: a) low-risk participants with disease
      reactivation, and b) high-risk participants with risk-organ involvement.

      Other purposes are to estimate the progression-free survival after clofarabine treatment,
      estimate survival of participants with refractory multi-system LCH with risk organ
      involvement treated with clofarabine and to describe toxicities of clofarabine in
      participants with LCH.

      If you are willing to participate in this research study you will be asked to undergo some
      screening test or procedure to find out if you are eligible. Many of these tests and
      procedures are likely to be part of regular care and may be done even if it turns out that
      you do not take part in the research study. If you have had some of these tests or
      procedures recently, they may or may not have to be repeated. These tests and procedures
      include the following: a medical history, performance status, blood tests, assessment of
      disease and pregnancy test. If these tests show that you are eligible to participate in the
      research study, you will begin the study treatment. If you do not meet the eligibility
      criteria, you will not be able to participate in this research study. After confirming
      eligibility you will also have a bone marrow test, electrocardiogram and urinalysis.

      You will receive a maximum of 6 cycles of study treatment. Each treatment cycle will last
      approximately 4 weeks. In each cycle, you will receive the study drug clofarabine daily on
      the first 5 days (days 1 to 5) and rest for the remaining days. Clofarabine will be
      administered into the vein (IV) over two hours in the clinic or in the hospital. If you have
      high-risk disease, the dose of clofarabine will be higher during the first two cycles.

      Before the start of each cycle, and at the end of your therapy, you will have a physical
      exam and you will be asked questions about your general health and specific questions about
      any problems that you are having and any medications you are taking. You will also have
      blood and urine tests done to monitor organ functions. You will also undergo an assessment
      of your disease by x-ray, CT scan, MRI or PET or bone scans, which wil be performed every
      two cycles and at the end of study treatment.

      After the final dose of the study drug there will be a follow up period. Once every three
      months for the first year, twice yearly for the second and third years, and then annually,
      you will have a physical exam and be asked questions about your general health. You will
      also have blood and urine tests performed.

      Twice yearly for the first three years, x-ray, CT scan, MRI, PET, and/or bone scans will be
      repeated if your doctor feels they are necessary.
