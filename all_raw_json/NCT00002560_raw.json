Combining colony-stimulating\n      factors, such as sargramostim, with monoclonal antibodies may be an effective treatment for\n      advanced neuroblastoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of monoclonal antibody 3F8 plus\n      sargramostim in treating patients who have advanced neuroblastoma."

Treatment is repeated every 4 weeks\n      for up to 4 courses in the absence of progressive disease, HAMA response, or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-40 patients will be accrued for this study over 4 years."
