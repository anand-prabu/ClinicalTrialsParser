COMIT II will also\n      include analysis of FAEs to elucidate the mechanisms by which canola oil may be modifying\n      body composition. Measurement of endothelial function using flow mediated dilation (FMD),\n      and measurement of inflammatory, endothelial function, adiposity, and insulin sensitivity\n      biomarkers will be done to determine the positive health impact of the changes in body\n      composition achieved through canola oil consumption."

The proposed COMIT II research program will proceed as a\n      double blind, randomized crossover study consisting of three treatment phases of six weeks,\n      each separated by a 6-week washout period. Participants will consume a fixed composition of\n      a precisely controlled basal, weight-maintaining diet (35% energy from fat, 50% carbohydrate\n      and 15% protein) supplemented with the following treatment oils: (a) regular canola oil, (b)\n      high stability/ high oleic canola oil and (c) a typical \"Western diet\" fat intake as a\n      control treatment comprised largely of saturated fat with substantial levels of omega-6\n      linoleic acid, common to current North American intakes. Treatment oils will be\n      isocalorically incorporated into fruit smoothies made with milk and consumed at breakfast\n      and supper. The clinical segment of COMIT II is expected to be completed by the mid to end\n      of the second year, with sample analyses to be completed by the end of year three."
