      The purpose of this study is to assess the control of COPD using a symptom and exacerbation
      risk based treatment strategy based on GOLD 2011. This study is conducted in Japanese
      subjects with COPD and assess whether the GOLD 2011 strategy is effective in medical
      practice in Japan.

      PROTOCOL SUMMARY Rationale Both ADOAIR and tiotropium bromide ( hereinafter tiotropium）are
      now well established, effective treatments for COPD and are frequently co-prescribed
      (hereinafter TRIPLE therapy).  The addition of ADOAIR to tiotropium improves lung function
      and quality of life and may further reduce exacerbations. GOLD 2011 thus recommends TRIPLE
      therapy as the second choice of COPD treatment strategy. However, the criteria for switching
      from each individual treatment to TRIPLE therapy are not clearly shown so far.

      This study will be conducted in Japanese subjects with COPD and will assess whether the GOLD
      2011 strategy is effective in medical practice in Japan.

      Objective(s) The objective of the study is to assess the control of COPD using a symptom and
      exacerbation risk based treatment strategy based on GOLD 2011.

         12. Has a known or suspected hypersensitivity to β2-agonists, steroids, anticholinergic

         13. Has previously been enrolled to this study and investigational drugs has been
             administered

         14. Is not eligible to participate this study in the opinion of the
