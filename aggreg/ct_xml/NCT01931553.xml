  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attending morning rounds take place at teaching hospitals every day. They are the primary
      mechanism for patient care delivery, supervision and education of trainees, and
      communication with patients, families, and staff. However, they are done with little
      standardization or widely recognized best practices.

      The objective of this quality improvement (QI) initiative is to evaluate the adherence to
      and impact of implementing standardized attending morning rounds on medicine teams at our
      institution. A standardized rounding intervention has been developed which includes specific
      guidance on completing the following activities during morning rounds: (1) Pre-rounds
      discretion; (2) Pre-rounds huddle; (3) Bedside registered nurse (RN) integration; (4)
      Patient-centered rounding; (5) Real-time order writing.

      This trial will randomize half of the investigators' medicine teams at University of
      California San Francisco to this rounding intervention whilst the other half will be
      randomized to continue with usual unstandardized rounding practices.

      The investigators will compare medicine teams randomized to undertake standardized rounding
      to those teams undertaking usual practice. Outcomes assessed will relate to the patient
      (e.g. satisfaction), providers (e.g. satisfaction), efficiency (e.g. total morning round
      time) as well as adherence to the intervention .

      The investigators' study hypotheses are that patient satisfaction scores will be higher for
      those patients receiving standardized bedside rounds compared to the usual care group. The
      investigators also hypothesize that total attending morning rounds time and interns length
      of workday will be shorter and that the number of consultations ordered before noon will
      increase for those teams undertaking standardized bedside.  Further, the investigator
      hypothesize higher levels of nurse participation, physician and medical student satisfaction
      with standardized bedside rounding.
