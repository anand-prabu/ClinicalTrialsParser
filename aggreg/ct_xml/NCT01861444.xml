    <textblock>
      This prospective, multicenter, observational study will assess the prevalence of chronic
      hepatitis D in patients with chronic hepatitis B in Romania and evaluate the efficacy of
      Pegasys (peginterferon alfa-2a) in patients with chronic hepatitis D. Eligible patients
      treated with Pegasys according to current medical practice will be followed until 24 weeks
      after the end of treatment.
