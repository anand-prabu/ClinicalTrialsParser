Bortezomib may help\n      reduce the number of leukemia or lymphoma cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for\n      cell growth. It may also help chemotherapy work better by making cancer cells more sensitive\n      to the drugs. It is not yet known if giving standard chemotherapy with or without bortezomib\n      is more effective in treating T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia and T-cell lymphoblastic\n      lymphoma. ."

To compare event-free survival (EFS) in patients with newly diagnosed T-cell acute\n      lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) and T-cell lymphoblastic lymphoma (T-LLy) who are randomized\n      to a modified augmented Berlin-Frankfurt-M\u00fcnster (ABFM) backbone versus bortezomib plus the\n      modified ABFM backbone.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the safety and feasibility of modifying standard therapy for T-ALL and T-LLy\n      based on the results of UKALL 2003, which includes a dexamethasone-based induction,\n      additional doses of pegaspargase (PEG-ASP) during induction and delayed intensification\n      (DI), and dexamethasone pulses during maintenance therapy.\n\n      II. To determine if prophylactic (presymptomatic) cranial irradiation (CRT) can be safely\n      and effectively eliminated in the 85-90% of T-ALL patients classified as standard or\n      intermediate risk.\n\n      III. To determine the proportion of end of consolidation (EOC) minimal residual disease\n      (MRD) >= 0.1% T-ALL patients who become MRD negative (undetectable by flow cytometry) after\n      intensification of chemotherapy, using three high risk (HR) BFM blocks, and to compare EFS\n      between the patients who become MRD negative after the three HR BFM blocks and continue on\n      chemotherapy with those who continue to have detectable MRD and are eligible for other\n      treatment strategies, including hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Similarly, to\n      compare the EFS between very high risk (induction failure) T-LLy patients treated with HR\n      BFM intensification blocks who have partial or complete response (PR or CR) with those who\n      do not respond (NR).\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To investigate the prognostic significance of day 29 bone marrow (BM) MRD in T-LLy\n      patients.\n\n      II. To determine if protein expression patterns can predict bortezomib response and drug\n      resistance in T-ALL.\n\n      III. To analyze and target relevant signaling pathways in T-ALL blasts, focusing on early T\n      cell precursor (ETP) acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      INDUCTION ARM A: Patients receive cytarabine intrathecally (IT) at time of diagnostic lumbar\n      puncture (if within 72 hours from start of protocol therapy) OR day 1; vincristine sulfate\n      intravenously (IV) on days 1, 8, 15, and 22; dexamethasone orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on\n      days 1-28 (no taper); daunorubicin hydrochloride IV over 1-15 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and\n      22; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 4 and 18; and methotrexate IT on days 8 and 29\n      (and on days 15 and 22 for central nervous system 3 involvement [CNS3] T-ALL patients).\n\n      INDUCTION ARM B: Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11; and vincristine\n      sulfate, dexamethasone, daunorubicin hydrochloride, pegaspargase, and methotrexate as in\n      Induction Arm A.\n\n      CONSOLIDATION: Beginning on day 36 from Induction, patients receive methotrexate IT on days\n      1, 8, 15, and 22 (days 1 and 8 only for CNS3 T-ALL or CNS3 T-LLy patients); cyclophosphamide\n      IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 29; cytarabine IV over 1-30 minutes or subcutaneously\n      (SC) on days 1-4, 8-11, 29-32, and 36-39; mercaptopurine PO once daily (QD) on days 1-14 and\n      29-42; pegaspargase IV over 1-2 hours on days 15 and 43; and vincristine sulfate IV on days\n      15, 22, 43, and 50.
