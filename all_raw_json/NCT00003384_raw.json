Patients then undergo a cone biopsy of the cervix\n      using loop electrosurgical excision procedure with an endocervical curettage, an excisional\n      cone biopsy of the cervix with or without endocervical curettage, or a hysterectomy.\n      Patients who are perimenopausal or postmenopausal or have a negative cervical cone biopsy\n      also undergo endometrial biopsy or curettage. The Pap smear specimen is analyzed to\n      determine MN antigen expression and the ThinPrep specimen is analyzed for the presence of\n      high-risk human papilloma virus and to determine MN antigen and other marker (e.g., P16)\n      expression.\n\n      Patients who do not undergo hysterectomy are followed every 6 months for 2 years. All other\n      patients are followed at 4, 26, and 30 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 500 patients will be accrued for this study within 5 years."
