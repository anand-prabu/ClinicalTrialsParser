To further\n      investigate the role of genes that control the cell cycle and apoptosis, we wish to\n      correlate the expression of multiple molecular targets [including but not restricted to\n      bcl-2, BAX, bcl-6, MIB-1, p53, p21, p27, p16, cyclin D(1), cyclin A, cyclin E, mdm-2, cpp\n      32, mcl-1, EBER-1, ALK, and a panel of B, T and other cell lineage markers], involving these\n      pathways, with clinical outcome following treatment with combination chemotherapy.  All\n      clinical data and tissue samples for this study will come from patients who have been\n      previously enrolled on two protocols for the initial treatment of aggressive lymphomas.
