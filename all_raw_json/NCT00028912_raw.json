Drugs used in chemotherapy such as carboplatin use different ways to\n      stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Bortezomib may help carboplatin\n      kill more tumor cells by making tumor cells more sensitive to the drug.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of combining bortezomib with carboplatin\n      in treating patients who have recurrent or progressive ovarian epithelial, primary\n      peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer."

Beginning with the second course, patients receive\n      bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8.\n      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, 8 additional\n      patients are accrued and treated at that dose.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-32 patients will be accrued for this study."
