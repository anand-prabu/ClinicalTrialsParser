  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing major spinal surgery continue to experience moderate-to-severe pain
      during the first 2-3 days following the operative procedure.  Pain complicates the recovery
      process, despite the routine practice of using potent opioid analgesics.  The primary reason
      that pain is poorly controlled in patients undergoing major surgery is that most
      commonly-used opioids only produce analgesia for 2-4 hours.  The intermittent use of these
      drugs results in periods of time when a patient will experience discomfort (at which time a
      nurse administers more drug or the button on a patient-controlled analgesic (PCA) system is
      pressed to deliver more medication).  The use of a long-acting opioid may be advantageous in
      the perioperative setting.  Methadone is an opioid that has a median duration of analgesia
      of 24-36 hours.  Therefore, a single dose administered in the operating room may reduce the
      need for pain medication and improve pain control for the first few postoperative days.  The
      aim of this randomized clinical trial is to examine the effect of methadone (compared to
      hydromorphone) on postoperative pain management in patients undergoing major spine surgery

      Patients:   100 patients (ages 18-80) will be enrolled in this clinical trial.  All patients
      presenting for elective posterior lumbar or thoracic spinal fusion surgery will be eligible
      for enrollment.  Patients will be randomized to receive either methadone or hydromorphone on
      the basis of a computer generated random number table. Patients in each group will receive
      standard clinical intraoperative doses of either methadone (0.2 mg/kg) or hydromorphone (2
      mg).  An analysis of patients undergoing posterior lumbar fusion surgery at Evanston
      Hospital revealed that patients received, on average, approximately 2 mg of hydromorphone
      intraoperatively.  The most commonly used doses of methadone administered in clinical
      studies have been either 0.2 mg/kg or a dose of 20 mg.   Furthermore, these doses also
      represent dosages which appear to be approximately equipotent.  Study medications will be
      prepared by the pharmacy, and all clinicians will be blinded to group assignment.  Two
      syringes will be prepared for each patient, one which contains the study drug (either
      methadone 0.2 mg/kg or hydromorphone 2 mg), and the other containing the placebo (saline).
      If the patient is randomized to the methadone group, a 3 cc syringe containing 0.2 mg/kg of
      methadone and saline (total volume 3 cc) will be prepared, as well as a 10 cc syringe
      containing 10 cc of saline (placebo).  If the patient is randomized to the hydromorphone
      group, a 3 cc syringe containing 3 cc of saline (placebo) will be prepared, as well as a 10
      cc syringe containing 2 mg of hydromorphone with 9 cc of saline (total volume 10 cc).  At
      induction of anesthesia, the 3 cc syringe containing either 0.2 mg/kg of methadone or
      placebo will be given over 5 seconds.  At the conclusion of surgery, the 10 cc syringe of
      either hydromorphone or placebo will be titrated slowly per clinician's preference.  The
      administration of all other anesthetic agents will be standardized and reflect the usual
      practices of anesthesiologists at Evanston Hospital (spine protocol).

      Anesthesia will be standardized and include propofol for induction, a propofol and
      remifentanil infusion for maintanance (plus sevoflurane), and IV acetaminophen 1000 mg
      during the last 60 minutes of the case.

      On arrival to the postanesthesia care unit (PACU), patients will be assessed for pain by
      PACU nurses per standard protocols.  Patients will be evaluated for pain on PACU arrival and
      then every 15 minutes.  Patients will be administered hydromorphone 0.25-0.5 mg for pain,
      and doses will be repeated until the patient is comfortable (pain &lt; 3 on a scale of 0-10;
      0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable).  The patient will then be connected to a PCA device
      to deliver pain medication during the remainder of the postoperative period.

      All postoperative management will be per standard surgical protocols

      Sample Size:  The primary end-point of the investigation is amount of hydromorphone used.
      In a clinical trial by Urban et al. of patients undergoing complex spine surgery using a
      standard anesthetic, average hydromorphone consumption in the first 24 hours was 27 mg (18).
       The investigators expect to see at least a 33% reduction in hydromorphone consumption in
      the methadone group.  Group sample sizes of 39 and 39 achieve 91% power to detect a
      difference of 9.0 between the null hypothesis that both group means are 27.0 and the
      alternative hypothesis that the mean of group 2 is 18.0 with estimated group standard
      deviations of 10.0 and 10.0 and with a significance level (alpha) of 0.01000 using a
      two-sided two-sample t-test.  The investigators plan to enroll a total of 100 patients to
      ensure complete collection of data.
