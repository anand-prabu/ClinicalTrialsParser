  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of ketamine for the
      treatment of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS).

    <textblock>
      Potential patients must clear all study requirements to be enrolled. Study requirements
      include labwork, psychiatric evaluation, and cardiology evaluation. Once enrolled, patients
      will either receive a subanesthetic racemic ketamine infusion or a placebo (saline infusion)
      in conjunction with an epidural infusion with opioid, local anesthetic, and clonidine during
      a five day in-patient hospital stay. After discharge from the hospital, patients will
      receive either a subanesthetic racemic ketamine infusion or a placebo (saline infusion)
      booster infusion during three out-patient visits. The patient and study staff are blinded.

      This study requires multiple visits to the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City
      over the course of three months and concludes with a final visit after six months. The study
      will only cover costs associated with the scheduled in-patient and out-patient visits. The
      study patient will be responsible for all other costs (including travel and hotel
      accommodations) that he/she may incur for participating in this study.
