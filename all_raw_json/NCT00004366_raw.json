During this time, the nature of the\n      anxiety disorder is explained and exposure to previously feared situations is encouraged.\n\n      Only patients who remain symptomatic at a stable level following self-exposure will proceed\n      with rehabilitation training.\n\n      Patients meet with a physical therapist once a week for 4 weeks to further evaluate the\n      extent of problems associated with balance.  Then, patients undergo weekly 1 hour exercises\n      for 8 weeks with the physical therapist, focusing on sensation, head and eye coordination,\n      movement with eyes opened and closed, and gait.\n\n      Concurrently, patients meet with the clinical nurse specialist every 4 weeks during and\n      after physical therapy to evaluate the effects of vestibular treatment on anxiety symptoms.\n\n      Training is continued if patient is symptomatic; otherwise, patient is discharged from\n      study."
