Bone marrow transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher\n      doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus donor\n      bone marrow transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer."

CD34+ stem cell augmented donor bone marrow is infused on day 0.\n      Methylprednisolone is administered IV over 1 hour on days 5-16, and then tapered. Patients\n      are followed every 6 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
