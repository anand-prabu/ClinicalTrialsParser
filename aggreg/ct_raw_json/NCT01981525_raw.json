Among many other functions p53 is involved in the regulation\n           of mitochondrial respiration and energy homeostasis.\n\n        -  Metformin is an oral biguanide drug that is approved by the FDA for the treatment of\n           type II diabetes. Metformin has been associated with reduced cancer risk in several\n           epidemiologic studies and reduced cancer mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes.\n\n        -  Metformin decreases circulating insulin and IGF1, and promotes glucose uptake in\n           skeletal muscle and inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver. Elevations in circulating\n           insulin and IGF1 levels have been associated with increased cancer risk.\n\n        -  Metformin and p53 both have effects on the mitochondria. One effect of metformin is\n           inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory complex I, thereby decreasing ATP production\n           via oxidative phosphorylation.\n\n        -  It is proposed that in the absence of a normal functioning p53, metformin may modulate\n           mitochondrial function by inhibiting oxidative phosphorylation in turn inducing a\n           bioenergetic crisis in rapidly proliferating cells and cellular senescence or\n           apoptosis.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  Determine the tolerability of oral daily metformin in patients with LFS caused by\n           germline TP53 mutations.\n\n        -  Determine if 8 weeks of daily metformin administration has any effect on circulating\n           IGF-1, insulin, and IGFBP3\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Must have a germline TP53 mutation and provide documentation of testing.\n\n        -  Must have adequate organ function.\n\n        -  Age greater than or equal to 18 years.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This is a pilot study to assess the tolerability of daily oral metformin administration\n           in patients with LFS caused by germline TP53 mutations and to study the effect of\n           metformin on biomarker levels in these subjects.\n\n        -  Patients will be assessed for biomarker levels (IGF-1, insulin, IGFBP3) by blood sample\n           at baseline, and weeks 2 and 8.\n\n        -  Patients will also undergo optional mitochondrial studies."

Levels of\n        metformin excreted in breast milk appear to be low and not clinically significant.\n\n        However, for protocol safety reasons, we will not be enrolling pregnant and/or nursing\n        women in this study as metformin as has not been extensively evaluated in non-diabetic\n        pregnant and nursing women. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree\n        to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence)\n        prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women who are nursing\n        will be advised to discontinue breastfeeding if the mother is treated with metformin.\n        Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in\n        this study, she should inform Drs.
