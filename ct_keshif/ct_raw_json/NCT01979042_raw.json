Furthermore creatinin is not an ideal marker for renal\n      function during acute changes.\n\n      Several works have shown that modern urinary markers such as NGAL (neutrophil\n      gelatinase-associated lipocalin), KIM-1 (Kidney Injury Molecule-1) and others rise earlier\n      and are much more sensitive for kidney insult. There is a lack of research on their role in\n      acute kidney obstruction"

They will be followed 48 hours and 1 one\n      week later with additional blood and urine tests.\n\n      The admitted patients that will undergo renal drainage will be a specific subgroup in which\n      a selective urine test will be taken from the drained kidney\n\n      The non stone group:\n\n      -------------------- These are our control group from which we will take a single blood and\n      urine test before their elective surgery."
