Currently, there is no\n      standard second-line therapy for this disease.\n\n      BKM-120 is a pan-PI3K inhibitor currently tested in clinical trials. In a cellular model of\n      oral-esophageal carcinogenesis, it has shown that EGFR overexpression activated PI3/AKT\n      pathway. Therfore, there is interest to see the efficacy and safety of BKM120 in this\n      setting."
