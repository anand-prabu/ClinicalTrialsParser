(Patients who are ELISA positive but Western blot or other confirmatory tests\n             are negative may continue in study).\n\n          -  HIV antigen positive.\n\n          -  Clinical symptoms which lead to a diagnosis by a licensed physician of AIDS or AIDS\n             related complex or AIDS-related dementia. Also excluded are individuals who have\n             experienced similar HIV exposure as described in this protocol in the past month and\n             individuals who have previously been enrolled in this study. The purpose of these\n             exclusions is to eliminate possible seroconversion in an individual that could be\n             attributed to HIV exposure other than the single exposure experienced just prior to\n             entry into the study.\n\n        Prior Medication:\n\n        Excluded within 4 weeks of study entry:\n\n          -  Any potentially myelosuppressive drug.\n\n          -  Nephrotoxic agent.\n\n          -  Other experimental therapy.\n\n        Exposure of a health care worker to HIV-contaminated blood or blood component within 5\n        days prior to beginning therapy, defined as one of the following:\n\n          -  Penetrating wound from needle recently removed from patient or sample container\n             (e.g., blood bag, blood tube) or from sharp object visibly contaminated with\n             HIV-positive blood or blood component. In the case of needlesticks or cuts with sharp\n             objects, blood or blood component must not have been exposed to the air for more than\n             1 hour. If actual infusion of blood occurs, the 1-hour time limit does not apply.\n\n          -  Hypodermic needles should come in contact with the blood and blood component from an\n             HIV source but need not be visibly contaminated with blood to be considered a source\n             of contamination.\n\n          -  Significant exposure to HIV-positive blood or blood component as the result of splash\n             on abraded skin.\n\n          -  Significant exposure to HIV-positive blood or blood component as the result of splash\n             on mucous membranes.\n\n          -  Participant must be able to give informed consent.\n\n        Active drug or alcohol abuse sufficient in the physician's opinion to prevent compliance\n        with the study regimen."
