We will compare quantities\n      of 5,6-EET in inflammatory and non-inflammatory zones of biopsies from IBD patient to\n      biopsies from control patient. We will establish a cluster of lipid compounds associated\n      with pathological activity. We will determine the exposed profile of receptor lipid\n      mediators expressing to the 5,6-EET lipid compound and one of its signalization.\n\n      All data will be submit to statistical analysis to confirm relevance.\n\n      We expect this pilot study to help us define 5,6-EET and other components of the same\n      metabolic family as markers for IBD activity. It could point lipid mediators and their\n      receptors as potential new therapeutic targets.\n\n      It will increase our knowledge on current treatment efficiency by evidencing lipid markers\n      for the inflammatory condition."

Biopsies are frequently taken for histology, needed for cancer or IBD diagnosis.\nExtra-biopsies for research purpose will only be performed if the clinician decides that they are necessary for the clinical diagnosis or for the disease follow-up.\nFor this protocol, collecting these extra biopsies should last under 5 minutes and should not extend the procedure by more than this time.",
