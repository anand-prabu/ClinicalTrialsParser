This study is for supporting registration of FP Nebules treating Chinese pediatric\n      and adolescent subjects (aged 4 to 16 years) with an acute exacerbation of asthma in China.\n\n      At least 250 subjects, aged 4-16 years old, diagnosed an acute exacerbation of asthma at\n      presentation, are eligible to take part in the study if they meet the inclusion criteria.\n      They are randomly assigned at the ratio 1:1 to one of the following treatment groups for 7\n      days:  FP Nebules 2\u00d70.5mg/2ml twice daily/Placebo tablets once daily; Or, Oral prednisone\n      tablets once daily (2mg/kg.day, up to 40mg/day for 4 days, then 1mg/kg.day or half of the\n      original dose, up to 20mg/day for 3 days) / Placebo Nebules 2\u00d72ml 0.9% saline twice daily.\n      While all subjects are given Salbutamol Nebules / MDI for relief of symptoms. After\n      randomization (visit 1), the following visits are on Day5 (visit 2) and Day8 (visit 3), and\n      a follow-up phone call (visit4) will happen two weeks post treatment on Day 21 for\n      collection of  adverse events.\n\n      The primary endpoint is  mean morning PEF on diary card over the treatment assessment\n      period. The secondary endpoints include subject derived data (symptom scores ), evening PEF\n      on diary card, use of rescue medications, clinic assessments of pulmonary function ( FEV1,\n      and FVC) , clinical scoring index , patient/parent and investigator global evaluation, and\n      use of rescue medications during the trial.
