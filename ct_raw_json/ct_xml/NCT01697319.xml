             performance of any research-related procedure.

          -  Has documented clinical diagnosis of MPS IVA based on clinical signs and symptoms of
             MPS IVA and documented reduced fibroblast or leukocyte GALNS enzyme activity or
             genetic testing confirming diagnosis of MPS IVA.

          -  Is â‰¥ 5 years of age.

             major surgery during the first 24 weeks of the study.

          -  Has used any other investigational product or investigational medical device within
             30 days prior to the Screening Visit or requires any investigational agent prior to

          -  Has a concurrent disease or condition, including but not limited to symptomatic
             cervical spine instability or severe cardiac disease or complete paralysis due to a
             spinal cord injury (defined as an inability to move arms and legs), that would
             interfere with study participation or safety as determined by the Investigator.

          -  Has any condition that, in the view of the Investigator, places the patient at high
