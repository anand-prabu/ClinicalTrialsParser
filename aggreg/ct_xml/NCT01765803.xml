  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the possibility of using the drug thioridazine (also called
      Mellaril) to increase the number of certain types of cells moving from the bone marrow to
      the circulation in a group of healthy humans. The types of cells we hope to collect are
      called CD34+ progenitor, or stem cells. These cells can be used in the laboratory to better
      understand a number of diseases and suggest new strategies for therapy.  Perhaps the most
      important potential application of human stem cells is the generation of cells and tissues
      that could be used for cell-based therapies, as a renewable source of replacement cells and
      tissues to treat diseases including Alzheimer's diseases, spinal cord injury, stroke, burns,
      heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and rheumatoid arthritis.

      This is a single-arm, feasibility study to test whether a single dose of Mellaril
      (thioridazine HCL) is able to effectively mobilize CD34+ cells in a set of health human
      subjects. This study does not involve the use of placebos, and subjects will serve as their
      own controls for CD34+ cell mobilization. We hypothesize that a single dose of Mellaril
      (thioridazine HCL) will mobilize CD34+ progenitor cells into human peripheral blood by a
      factor of at least 10 fold, from 4 to 40 cells/microliter.

    <description>Subjects will undergo a physical exam including an electrocardiogram (EKG) and have blood drawn before treatment. A single 50 gm dose of thioridazine (Mellaril) will be given to eligible subjects. Any subject who receives treatment on this protocol will be evaluable for toxicity. A second blood draw will occur at 24 hours post-treatment. All subjects will be followed for possible adverse events (toxicity) for 30 days after treatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy, non-smoking subjects (male or female)

          -  Age:  18 to 55 years

          -  All subjects must agree to refrain from consuming alcohol during for 48 hours after
             taking thioridazine.

          -  Performance status Karnofsky score of 100%.

          -  Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception
             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for
             the duration of study participation, and for 90 days following completion of therapy.
             Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.

          -  A female of child-bearing potential is any woman (regardless of sexual orientation,
             having not undergone a tubal ligation, or remaining celibate by choice) who meets the
             following criteria:

          -  Has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or has not been naturally
             postmenopausal for at least 12 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time
             in the preceding 12 consecutive months).

          -  Ability to understand the purpose and procedures of this study, and the willingness
             to sign a written informed consent document.

          -  Only subjects whose laboratory testing, including platelet counts and transaminase
             levels are within normal limits are eligible.

          -  Subjects must pass pre-treatment screening by EKG to rule out long QT syndrome or
             subclinical cardiac arrhythmia.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks prior to entering
             the study or those who have not recovered from adverse events due to agents
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to Agent(s) or other agents used in study.

             arrhythmia, a febrile illness within 35 days of study entry, or psychiatric illness
             or dementia, or social situations that would limit compliance with study
             requirements.

          -  Subjects must not be pregnant or nursing due to the potential for congenital
             abnormalities and the potential of this regimen to harm nursing infants.

          -  Subjects who received thioridazine within 7 days of dosing on this protocol are
             excluded from participation.

          -  Subjects who have had pelvic radiation are excluded from participation.

          -  Subjects who have received myeloablative regimens at any time are excluded from
