The intervention model\n      emphasizes the important role of teachers as change agents to address early attendance\n      problems and emerging truancy. Specifically, the goals of this pilot project are: 1) to\n      facilitate positive, trusting, and collaborative home-school relations and to promote a\n      positive teacher-child relationship; 2) to provide teachers with timely information about a\n      student's attendance pattern; and 3) to train and supervise teachers in the implementation\n      of individualized attendance interventions to improve student attendance and prevent\n      emerging truancy among elementary school students. As this is a pilot study, another\n      important goal is to obtain teacher and administrator feedback to improve and refine all\n      aspects of the project."
