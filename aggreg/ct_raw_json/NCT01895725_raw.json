A total of 600 subsequent patients\n      with or established cardiovascular disease or at least one cardiovascular risk will be\n      tested with a high-frequency ultrasound probe equipped with automated IMT measurements and\n      3D quantitative plaque volumetry. Plasma samples will be collected and tested for\n      traditional and novel cardiovascular risk factors. Both ultrasound examinations and blood\n      sampling will be repeated once per year to assess changes in these parameters over time\n      depending on treatment modalities, which are left to the discretion of the treating\n      physicians. The primary endpoint of the planned study will be the correlation between\n      P-selectin and the progression of atherosclerosis as measured by plaque volume and IMT in\n      the carotid and femoral arteries, respectively. Secondary endpoints will include the\n      correlation of established (hypertension, smoking, diabetes, dyslipidemia) and novel risk\n      factors (hsCRP, P-selectin, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), intercellular\n      adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), CETP TaqIb polymorphism) with the progression of\n      atherosclerosis,  the correlation of cardiovascular events with the progression of\n      atherosclerosis and the additional predictive value of plaque volume and IMT compared to an\n      established risk score (SCORE card)."
