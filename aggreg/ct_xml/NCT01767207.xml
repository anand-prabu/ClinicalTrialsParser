  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients referred to pediatric rehabilitation services have often cognitive
      deficits/intellectual disabilities.

      Neurocognitive assessment is, hence, important when designing treatment plans.
      Traditionally, assessments of cognitive function, language function and motor function etc.
      have been the main focus areas, while assessment and treatment for psychological disorders
      have been relatively more neglected.  Accumulating evidence indicate that children with
      cognitive dysfunction have a significant higher risk of developing psychological disorders.
      Therefore assessment of such comorbid disorders should be offered. The main purpose of this
      pilot study is to systematically assess the prevalence and type of comorbid psychological
      disorders among children with cognitive dysfunction referred to a Norwegian outpatient
      pediatric rehabilitation clinic.
