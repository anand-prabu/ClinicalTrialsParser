  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the intrinsic electrical activity of the urinary bladder in response
      to filling is detectable and can be mapped. This is a pilot study to evaluate the
      feasibility of using cardiac electrical mapping catheters to measure bladder voltage in
      patients at the time of routine urodynamic and cystoscopic evaluation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is looking at the possibility of adapting some of the tools and techniques
      used by cardiac electrophysiologists (doctors specializing in the electrical activity of the
      heart) to help diagnose and treat Overactive Bladder.  The rationale for this approach is
      based on the similarities of the two organs.  In simple terms, the heart and bladder are
      both hollow muscular organs that expand and contract to hold and move fluid.

      In an electrophysiology study looking at cardiac (heart) arrhythmia (irregular heartbeat),
      the cardiologist places one or more electrode catheters (thin hollow tube with an electrical
      conductor on the end) through a vein or artery in the leg or arm to contact heart tissue.
      By recording the electrical activity at multiple sites of the heart, the catheter allows for
      mapping of the electrical activity and the arrhythmia mechanism.

      In this study, investigators will use the same electrode catheter to contact bladder tissue
      and map the electrical activity of the bladder.  It is hoped that the information from this
      electrophysiological testing of the bladder may eventually lead to treatment of areas of
      electrical abnormality of interest.  No actual treatment of the bladder will be done as part
      of this pilot study.
