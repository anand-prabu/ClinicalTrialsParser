      This study is research two questions.  First, is vitamin D3 more effective than vitamin D2
      in fully refilling 25(OH)D levels in CKD patients?  And secondly, what are the differential
      effects of vitamin D2 and vitamin D3 on inflammatory pathways related to monocyte function?

      Vitamin D helps form and strengthens bones by allowing the body to absorb calcium. Vitamin D
      helps the immune system fight infection as well as helps keep muscles strong. Without enough
      vitamin D, bones can become weak, thin and brittle.

      Vitamin D is useful in people with all different types of health issues. CKD is the slow
      loss of kidney function over time. The main function of the kidneys is to remove wastes and
      excess water from the body. This loss of function usually takes months or years to occur.
      Patients with CKD often have low levels of vitamin D in their blood.

      This study will have two groups of patients with CKD as well as low levels of vitamin D.

      One group will be treated with Vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) and the other group will be
      treated with Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).  The purpose of this study is to compare the
      effects of the two different forms of Vitamin D in patients who already havIe chronic kidney
      disease.
