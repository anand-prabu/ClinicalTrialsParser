To explore whether oral gold therapy either stabilizes or lowers the CA 125 level and\n      maintains patients in an asymptomatic state and to provide descriptive data on tumor\n      response and duration of response.\n\n      II. To acquire qualitative data on patients' perceptions of learning of CA 125 elevation.\n\n      III. To explore whether immunohistochemical staining for PKC iota expression in resected\n      tumor samples appears to be associated with clinical outcomes with auranofin.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive auranofin orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every\n      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 6 months for 2 years."
