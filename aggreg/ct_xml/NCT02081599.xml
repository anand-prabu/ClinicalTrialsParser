      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Teneligliptin in
      combination with Insulin in patients with type 2 Diabetes for 16 weeks administration and to
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of Teneligliptin in combination with Insulin with an
      extension treatment for up to 52 weeks.
