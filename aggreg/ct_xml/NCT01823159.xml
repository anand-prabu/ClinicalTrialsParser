  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to characterize the effects of a single-dose of retigabine on
      cortical excitability in healthy subjects, as quantified by means of TMS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Epilepsy is a disorder of brain excitability. Antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) modulate this
      excitability and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) imposed itself as one of the best
      noninvasive methods to study cortical excitability in human subjects.

      Based on several recent studies, we hypothesize that measuring TMS parameters in the
      patients suffering from epilepsy can rapidly predict the effectiveness of the newly given
      AED and, ultimately, guide the optimization of the AED therapy. Characterizing the
      neurophysiological properties of innovative AEDs such as retigabine with TMS will allow 1)
      to better understand  how AEDs modulate, in vivo, cortical excitability in humans in
      relation to their mode of action and 2) to establish TMS as a tool for assessing individual
      responsiveness to a particular AED treatment and for antiepileptic treatment monitoring.

      The effects of most AEDs on cortical excitability have been investigated. The modifications
      of the excitability parameters are related to the specific mode of action of each AED. For
      the new AED retigabine, at least two modes of action are known: 1) increase in cellular
      potassium efflux by changing conformation of the KV7.2-7.3 channels and 2) enhancement of
      GABA-A activity.

    <description>The primary endpoint is the impact of retigabine on TMS cortical excitability parameters in healthy volunteers compared to placebo, in a double-blind cross-over design.  These parameters were specifically chosen according to the known dual mechanism of action of retigabine. Modulation of GABA-A receptors and increase of potassium efflux.
The parameters studied are the motor threshold (MT), the amplitude of motor evoked potential (MEP), the cortical silent period (CSP), the short interval intracortical inhibition (SICI), the long interval intracortical inhibition (LICI), the intracortical facilitation (ICF) and the short interval cortical facilitation (SICF).
Parameters are registered before and after retigabine or placebo intake. Modifications of these parameters are recorded and compared for retigabine vs placebo for each subject. A group analysis retigabine vs placebo is also performed.</description>
