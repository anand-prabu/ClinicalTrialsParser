    <textblock>
      The objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of
      NUEDEXTA capsules containing 20 mg DM (Dextromethorphan)/10 mg Q (Quinidine) for treatment
      of PBA in patients with prevalent conditions such as  dementia, stroke and traumatic brain
      injury over a 12 week period.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an Open-label, Multicenter, study in patients with PBA and dementia, stroke or
      TBI. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of PBA and who meet all other inclusion and
      exclusion criteria will be eligible to participate and receive NUEDEXTA for 12 weeks.

      Males and females patients with a minimum age of 18 years, a clinical diagnosis of
      Pseudobulbar Affect and a documented diagnosis of neurologic disease or brain injury, will
      be enrolled in this study.

      The primary effectiveness endpoint is the mean change in the CNS Lability scale (CNS-LS).
      Secondary objectives include measures to evaluate treatment outcomes.
