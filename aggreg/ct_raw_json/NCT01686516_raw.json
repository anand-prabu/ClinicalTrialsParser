To correlated these DWI changes with anatomical ones, we\n           used anatomical imaging like T1 maps and susceptibility-based maps.\n\n      First, the relatively new technique of diffusion functional magnetic Resonance (DfMRI) was\n      explored to obtain activation of brain following visual stimulations. These modality was\n      compared to BOLD and anatomical venography.\n\n      The DWI exams for anatomical (tractography) used both high angular resolution directional\n      diffusion encoding (18 directions) and high b-values (as high as b=12 000 s/mm\u00b2) to obtain\n      precise knowledge about tissue microstructure.\n\n      Study was approved by the National French Institute of Health and by french organism for\n      biomedical studies (AFFSAPS). Study involve 35 subjects, with 5 additional subjects for\n      eventual rejection because of ineligibility criterion, and compare 15 young (20-30 years) to\n      aged healthy people (60-80 years).\n\n      Then, anatomical studies are devoted to obtain microstructures information about brain areas\n      that are changed with age, and to validate fully the feasibility of the DfMRI approach."
