The mechanism of UAO during anesthesia shares many similarities with\n      the upper airway obstruction observed during obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Obesity is major\n      risk factors for OSA and obese patients have a higher prevalence of UAO during anesthesia.\n      The change of body position improved upper airway stability during sleep in patients with\n      OSA.We hypothesis that the 30\u02da reverse trendelenburg body position maintain airway patency\n      in obese patients during general anesthesia."

Fifteen subjects with BMI limited in the range\n      of 30 kg/m2 to 50 kg/m2, between 18-65 years of age meeting ASA physical status\n      classification I-III requiring general anesthesia for elective surgery will be recruited\n      from the main operating room of the Massachusetts General Hospital. We will start the\n      recruiting process at least 12 hours ahead of the surgery at a pre-admission test area.\n\n      The PI/Co-I who approaches a potential subject who has expressed interest will not be the\n      anesthesiologist providing anesthesia care for the subjects. In addition the PI/Co-I\n      approaching the patient will reinforce that she or he does not have to participate and that\n      the decision not to participate will not affect their care at anytime.\n\n      The Principal Investigator or Co-Investigator will participate in the informed consent\n      process in operative holding area. Subjects to be recruited will be given a thorough review\n      of the informed consent, as well as the study purpose and procedures, and its risks,\n      discomforts, and potential benefits.  When the subject is comfortable with and knowledgeable\n      about the protocol, he or she will sign the consent form in the presence of the\n      investigator.  Investigator will also sign the informed consent form.  All subjects will be\n      given ample time to read the consent form and consider participating in the trial. Any\n      complaint or problems related to our recruitment plan will report in real time to the IRB."
