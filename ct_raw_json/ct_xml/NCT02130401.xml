  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study with a single active treatment arm. The study is designed to assess
      the efficacy of a portable, non-invasive neuromodulation system for the treatment of Type 2
      Diabetes.  In particular, the primary outcome measure is a reduction in A1c.
