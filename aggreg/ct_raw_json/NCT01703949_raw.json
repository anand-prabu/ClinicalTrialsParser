To monitor clinical outcome following the study treatment regimen.\n\n      II. To estimate the frequency of CD30 loss in patients following resistance to brentuximab\n      vedotin.\n\n      III. To describe the pattern of CD30 expression (membranous, cytoplasmic, Golgi) in\n      comparison to the pre-brentuximab vedotin expression.\n\n      IV. To semi-quantitatively estimate and compare the surface density of CD30 pre and post\n      brentuximab vedotin as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n      V. To correlate response with CD30 density as measured by flow cytometry.\n\n      VI. To evaluate the tolerability of the weekly regimen in patients previously exposed to\n      brentuximab vedotin.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive brentuximab vedotin intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on days 1, 8, and\n      15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 4 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3-5 weeks, every 3 months\n      for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 4 years."
