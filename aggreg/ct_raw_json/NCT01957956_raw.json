Vaccines made from a person's white blood cells mixed with\n      tumor proteins may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells.\n      Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth\n      of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving\n      vaccine therapy and temozolomide may be an effective treatment for glioblastoma."

Assess the relationship between ability tumor induce TAA-specific immune responses and\n      evidence of immunosuppression (peripheral blood immunophenotyping by flow cytometry)\n      following allogeneic tumor primary tumor culture lysate / autologous DC vaccine in newly\n      diagnosed GBM patients.\n\n      III. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free\n      survival, tumor response) and tumor-associated antigen immune response following combined\n      autologous or allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.\n\n      IV. Assess the relationship between efficacy endpoints (survival, progression-free survival,\n      tumor response) and evidence of immunosuppression at baseline and over time with combined\n      autologous or allogeneic tumor lysate / DC vaccination and adjuvant temozolomide.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      COURSE 1: Patients receive temozolomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-5.\n\n      COURSES 2-3: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor\n      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine intradermally (ID) on days 1, 3, and 5.\n\n      COURSES 4-6: Patients receive temozolomide PO daily on days 1-5 and malignant glioma tumor\n      lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic cell vaccine ID on day 1.\n\n      COURSES 7-12: Patients receive malignant glioma tumor lysate-pulsed autologous dendritic\n      cell vaccine ID on day 1.\n\n      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and\n      then every 6 months for 3 years."
