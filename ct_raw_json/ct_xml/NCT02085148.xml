  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine at which dose regorafenib is safe for children and
      adolescents and also to investigate the pharmacokinetics (explores what the body does to the
      drug) of regorafenib (study drug) in children and adolescents. Additional objectives of the
      study are:

        -  To assess the tolerability of regorafenib in children and adolescents

        -  To assess whether there is any tumor response to regorafenib

        -  To assess the palatability and acceptability of regorafenib tablets in children

    <description>Regorafenib will be given orally once a day, across cycles of 28 days each. During each cycle regorafenib is taken for 3 weeks followed by one week off the drug.  Doses of the study drug used in this study are age-dependent and the children's dose will been adjusted based on the age and the body surface area.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age: from 5 years to less than 18 years old

          -  Pediatric subjects who are able to swallow tablets

          -  Diagnosis: subjects must have had histologic verification of solid malignancy at
             original diagnosis. Subjects with recurrent or refractory solid tumors are eligible,
             including primary CNS tumors or subjects with known CNS metastases

          -  Subject's current disease state must be one for which there is no known effective
             therapy or therapy proven to prolong survival with an acceptable quality of life.
             Effective therapy may include surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy or any
             combination of these modalities.

          -  Subjects must have at least one measurable or evaluable lesion according to Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST), version 1.1. For neuroblastoma subjects
             with osteomedullary disease, the SIOPEN (International Society of Pediatric Oncology
             Europe Neuroblastoma Group) score will be used.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks from the time of signing informed consent/assent

          -  Performance level: Karnofsky ≥ 70% for subjects &gt; 10 years of age and Lansky ≥ 70%
             for subjects ≤ 10 years of age, except children with motor paresis due to disease.
             Neurological deficits in subjects must have been stable for a minimum of 1 week prior
             to first dose of study treatment.

          -  Adequate renal, hepatic and hematologic function

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior treatment with regorafenib. Subjects permanently withdrawn from study
             participation will not be allowed to re-enter the study.

          -  Other anticancer treatment, including any investigational new drugs within 28 days or
             5 drug half-lives (if drug half-life in subjects is known), whichever is shorter (or
             within 6 weeks for mitomycin C), before start of study treatment

          -  Subjects with uncontrolled baseline hypertension higher than Grade 1 NCI-CTCAE v.4.0
             (recurrent or persistent [≥24 hours] blood pressure [BP] &gt;ULN: BP &gt; the 95th
             percentile for age, height, and gender measured)

          -  Unresolved toxicity higher than NCI-CTCAE v. 4.0 Grade 1 attributed to any prior
             therapy/procedure (excluding alopecia, chemotherapy-induced ototoxicity,  Grade 2
             chemotherapy-induced neuropathy and, as per above eligibility criteria, anemia with
             hemoglobin ≥ 8 mg/dL and ANC ≥ 1.0 x 10 9/L ).
