To establish the efficacy of the melatonin\n      administered to encephalic death donors (EDD) in liver transplantation. The aim is to\n      improve the functional quality of the retrieved organs, attenuate lesions and\n      ischemia-reperfusion mediators, and provide grafts with greater resistance to\n      post-transplant aggression.\n\n      METHODOLOGY. Prospective, randomized, double-blind, pilot trial to evaluate preconditioning\n      with melatonin versus placebo in EDDs. Two groups, melatonin and control-placebo, n=30 per\n      group. Administration to donor via NG tube of 30mg of melatonin or placebo (lactose) upon\n      inclusion in the trial, 60 minutes prior to commencement of surgery and following laparotomy\n      during extraction. Evaluation of response to treatment: A) Conventional clinical,\n      hemodynamic, analytical and histopathological parameters in donor and recipient. B) Plasma\n      determinations for: oxidative/nitrosative stress; acute phase proteins; cellular and humoral\n      immunity; NT-proBNP and cystatin C; endocrine profile; melatonin levels. C) Determinations\n      in liver tissue: quantification of malonyldialdehyde-4hydroxyalkenals and protein carbonyl\n      content; cellular and mitochondrial membrane fluidity; markers of tissue-vascular damage and\n      proliferation: transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-\u03b2); hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) and\n      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Data will be analyzed following a prospectively\n      define plan and by intention-to-treat analysis."
