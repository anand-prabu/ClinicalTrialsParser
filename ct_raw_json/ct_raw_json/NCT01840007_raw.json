            "textblock": "In western countries, melanoma represents a major mistake of public health by its frequency,\n      lethality and the increasing of incidence. Surgery can cure melanoma diagnosed very early.\n      In other cases, it exists a risk of recurrence of lymph node and visceral.  At the stage of\n      visceral metastases, the prognosis of melanoma is catastrophic, with a median survival of 6\n      months. Indeed, the reference chemotherapy by dacarbazine induces a very limited response\n      rate of 10-20%, the ipilimumab which has been authorized in the second intention, has a\n      response rate of 10%, and other available treatments don't have a superior efficiency.\n      Metformin is an oral antidiabetic of biguanides family which acts by inducing the activation\n      of AMPK, a molecule which is inactivated in many cancers including the melanoma. In\n      agreement with these data, several preclinical studies suggested that metformin has\n      antineoplastic activity. In the case of melanoma, a study published recently has showed that\n      metformin inhibits proliferation of melanoma cells in vitro and we confirmed for our part\n      these results in our laboratory (INSERM U895)."
