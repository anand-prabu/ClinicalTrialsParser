            "textblock": "Recent Canadian studies, public opinion polls and the Canadian Heart Health Strategy and\n      Action Plan state that women's heart health is a key national priority; it should be\n      addressed through improving heart health awareness and prevention, and reducing care\n      inequities for women in general and younger women in particular. Given the costs of treating\n      heart disease and screening for it, new and unique ways to identify women who should undergo\n      screening are needed to achieve this goal. Studies have demonstrated that the development of\n      pre-eclampsia (PET), gestational hypertension (GHTN), or gestational diabetes (GDM) in\n      pregnancy, is associated with a greater risk of developing heart disease and stroke\n      suggesting that these conditions and heart disease share a common cause. As previously\n      demonstrated, the development of these pregnancy complications provides a window of\n      opportunity for identifying women who have underlying heart disease risk factors. The\n      investigators have developed an innovative and interactive mobile website based postpartum\n      lifestyle modification program (regular physical activity and nutritional guidance), based\n      on established national guidelines, to improve heart disease risk factors in women who\n      developed PET, GHTN or GDM. The investigators will conduct a trial to determine if the\n      mobile website based lifestyle modification program can be maintained and reduces a\n      collection of risk factors, which occurring together, greatly increases the risk of\n      developing heart disease. The investigators hypothesize that the interactive mobile website\n      directing regular physical activity and personalized nutritional guidance, compared to\n      standard postpartum care, will be motivational and result in a reduced modified metabolic\n      syndrome z score at 8 months postpartum among the intervention group."

The program is designed to be completed at home with minimal equipment.\nThe nutrition portion of the program consists of 16 video tutorials developed by a local Registered Dietitian and weekly diet logs. The video tutorials cover all aspects of healthy eating, from the basics of Canada's Food Guide, to smart snacking, to eating healthy over the holidays.",
