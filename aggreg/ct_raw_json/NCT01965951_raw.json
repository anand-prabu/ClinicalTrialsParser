            "textblock": "Problems with attention are a common and debilitating consequence of brain injury. Studies\n      show that poor attention is the number one predictor of poor cognitive functioning one year\n      post-injury. This is due to the fact that attention is a necessary component of more complex\n      cognitive functions such as learning & memory, multi-tasking and problem solving. In many\n      cases, individuals may exhibit problems with spatial attention known as 'hemi-spatial\n      neglect syndrome' or simply 'neglect'. Many studies now show that the processing machinery\n      of the brain is plastic and remodeled throughout life by learning and experience, enabling\n      the strengthening of cognitive skills or abilities. Research has shown that brief, daily\n      computerized cognitive training that is sufficiently challenging, goal-directed and adaptive\n      enables intact brain structures to restore balance in attention and compensate for\n      disruptions in cognitive functioning. The study aims to understand how our computer program\n      can affect cognition and attention in those with acquired brain injury."
