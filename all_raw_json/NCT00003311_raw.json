Patients may receive either regimen A or both regimen\n      A and regimen B, depending upon response.\n\n        -  Regimen A: Patients receive methotrexate IV over 24 hours on day 1. Cytarabine is\n           administered IV over 2 hours every 12 hours on days 2 and 3. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is\n           administered subcutaneously (SC) daily beginning on day 4 and continuing until blood\n           counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 8 courses.\n\n        -  Regimen B: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV over 3 hours every 12 hours on days\n           1-3. Doxorubicin is administered IV over 24 hours on days 4 and 5. Vincristine is\n           administered IV over 30 minutes on days 4 and 11. Dexamethasone is administered orally\n           or IV on days 1-4 and 11-14. G-CSF is administered SC beginning on day 6 and continuing\n           until blood counts recover. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 7 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-45 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
