Those analyses should help to determine the relevance of IgE mediated\n      mechanisms to chronic skin inflammation and T cell proliferation in AD patients.\n\n      A staining for the surface markers chemokine receptor (CCR4)+ and cutaneous lymphocyte\n      antigen (CLA)+ which reportedly are enriched in inflamed skin will further allow to\n      investigate whether patients with high numbers of T lymphocytes expressing CCR4 and CLA tend\n      to exhibit stronger skin inflammation. Moreover, allergen-specific antibody and T cell\n      responses will be analyzed 6-8 weeks after the epicutaneous allergen application."
