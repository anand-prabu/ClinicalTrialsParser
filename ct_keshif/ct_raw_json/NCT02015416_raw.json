The goal is for IDC-G305 to stimulate the body's\n      immune system to fight the spread and growth of cancer for patients whose tumors include the\n      NY-ESO-1 protein.  Patients with melanoma, ovarian, renal cell or non-small cell lung cancer\n      may be considered for the trial."

Patients with unresectable, relapsed or metastatic cancer but with low disease\n      burden and indolent disease course may be considered for the trial.  Tumors must express the\n      NY-ESO-1 gene signature and tumor types that will be studied are: melanoma, ovarian,\n      sarcoma,non-small cell lung  and breast cancer.\n\n      Each of three dose level cohorts will be treated contingent upon absence of dose limiting\n      toxicity (DLT) and acceptable safety data for the preceding cohort.   Initially, three\n      patients will be scheduled to receive IDC-G305 in each dose level cohort. Dose escalation\n      will be contingent upon the assessment of safety data obtained during the initial\n      injections.\n\n      Patients will be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals for safety and immune\n      response.  Both cellular and humoral immunogenicity will be explored."
