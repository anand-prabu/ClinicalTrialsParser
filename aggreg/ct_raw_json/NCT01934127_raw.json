Results of any\n             repeat testing cannot be used to qualify a subject for enrollment.\n\n          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.\n             Non-childbearing potential is defined as current tubal ligation, hysterectomy,\n             ovariectomy or post-menopause.\n\n          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if they\n\n               -  have practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and\n\n               -  have a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and\n\n               -  agree to continue to practice adequate contraception until 2 months after the\n                  last dose administered.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Presence or evidence of neurological or psychiatric diagnoses which, although stable,\n             are deemed by the investigator to render the potential subject unable/unlikely to\n             provide accurate safety reports.\n\n          -  Presence or evidence of substance abuse.\n\n          -  Diagnosed with cancer, or treatment for cancer within three years.\n\n               1.

Topical, intra-articularly\n             injected, or inhaled glucocorticoids, topical calcineurin inhibitors or imiquimod are\n             allowed.\n\n          -  Any significant disorder of coagulation or treatment with warfarin derivatives or\n             heparin.  Persons receiving individual doses of low molecular weight heparin outside\n             of 24 hours prior to vaccination are eligible.
