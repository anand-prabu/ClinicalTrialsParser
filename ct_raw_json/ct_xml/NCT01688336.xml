  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multi-center phase II clinical trial will assess the safety and efficacy of
      FOLFIRINOX in the first-line setting in patients with unresectable locally advanced (ULA)
      and borderline resectable (BR) pancreatic cancer.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      FOLFIRINOX regimen was recently presented at an international oncology meeting and
      represents a new standard in the treatment of metastatic pancreatic cancer for selected
      patients. With improved overall survival (OS) and response rates (RR) in the metastatic
      setting, we hypothesize that in patients with less tumor burden, this regimen will be safe
      and well tolerated, improve OS, progression free survival (PFS), and RR, and improve
      resectability rates, as compared to historical data from standard single agent gemcitabine
      therapy for unresectable locally advanced  (ULA) patients and standard radiation with
      concurrent 5 flourouracil (5FU) chemotherapy for borderline resectable (BR) patients. While
      both ULA and BR patients will be eligible for the present study, our primary objective
      concerns ULA patients, and we plan to enroll 45 patients in this group.

      Patients meeting eligibility criteria will be consented and treated with FOLFIRINOX every 2
      weeks (1 cycle = 4 weeks = 2 treatments). Patients will undergo repeat imaging (CT or MRI)
      every 2 cycles and reassessed for resectability of the tumor. All patients that are not able
      to undergo surgical resection, due to insufficient down-staging or patient preference, will
      continue on protocol-based therapy until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, study
      withdrawal, or death.

    <description>All patients who have received at least one cycle of treatment and have their disease reevaluated will be evaluable for assessment of objective response and will be followed for up to 3 years for survival.
Disease will be evaluated using the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST, version 1.1) every eight weeks and at the time of disease progression by the same modality as the baseline evaluation: CT abdomen and chest (preferable) or MRI abdomen and CT chest.
Objective response rate will be measured by the number of complete responses (CR) and partial responses (PR), as determined by RECIST 1.1 criteria.
Patients who drop out of the study prior to disease evaluation will not be evaluable for response unless the patient undergoes radiologic evaluation or their disease progresses clinically.</description>

    <description>Rate of resectability will be evaluated by determining the number of patients who were initially deemed to have ULA or BR disease and, following any period of treatment, were subsequently deemed to have resectable disease and undergo surgical resection.
