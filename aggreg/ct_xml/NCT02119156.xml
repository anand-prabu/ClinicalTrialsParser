      This study will assess the effect of a 24-week withdrawal followed by a 28-week
      reintroduction of belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care medications in subjects with
      stable low systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity.  Rebound phenomenon will be
      assessed for subjects who have permanently withdrawn from further belimumab treatment.

      This study will assess the effect of a 24-week withdrawal of belimumab followed by a 28-week
      reintroduction of belimumab 10 mg/kg plus standard of care medications on immunogenicity,
      markers of biological activity, efficacy, and safety in subjects with stable low systemic
      lupus erythematosus (SLE) disease activity.  Additionally, this study will assess rebound
      phenomenon in subjects with any disease level of SLE who have permanently withdrawn from
      further belimumab treatment

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Received a minimun of 6 months therapy with with belimumab 10 mg/kg in their current

          -  Non-prenant, non-lactating females willing to comply with specific birth control
             requirements as set forth in the protocol.

          -  Able to provide written informed consent to participate.

          -  Subjects who wish to enroll in the control group and the group taking a 6 month
             belimumab treatment holiday will need a SELENA SLEDAI score of 3 or less after the
             minimum of 6 months belimumab therapy, as well as having C3 and C4 complement levels
             at or above the lower limit of the central laboratory reference range, and are on a
             stable SLE treatment regimen during the 30 day screening period prior to Day 0.

          -  Subjects who wish to enroll in the long-term discontinuation group have voluntarily
             withdrawn from their continuation studies.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who have developed clinical evidence of significant, unstable or
             uncontrolled, acute or chronic diseases not due to SLE, or experienced an adverse
             event (AE) in their belimumab continuation study that could, in the opinion of the
             principle investigator, put the subject at undue risk.

          -  Subjects who have developed any other medical diseases, laboratory abnormalities, or
             conditions that, in the opinion of the principle investigator, makes the subject
