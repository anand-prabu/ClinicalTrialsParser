  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if tivantinib (ARQ 197) is effective in treating
      patients with MET diagnostic-high hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer) who have already
      been treated once with another therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Expression of c-Met in tumors correlates with aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)
      features. Overexpression of the receptor in tumor samples or high level of blood HGF in
      subjects is related to higher recurrence rate after surgery for HCC, while high c-Met
      expression correlates with shorter survival in HCC subjects. In summary, c-Met holds an
      important prognostic role in the natural history of HCC.  This Phase 3 study in MET
      Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC subjects has been designed based on the results from the
      randomized, controlled Phase 2 study conducted by ArQule, Inc. with tivantinib versus
      placebo in subjects with MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC who have failed one prior
      systemic therapy, mentioned above. The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of
      tivantinib in MET Diagnostic-High HCC subjects who were previously treated with one systemic
      therapy, and to further evaluate the safety profile of the experimental drug in this subject
      population.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed HCC that is inoperable (where surgery is not indicated due
             to disease extension, co-morbidities, or other technical reasons), and not eligible
             for local therapy

          -  MET Diagnostic-High tissue reported by the central authorized laboratory using
             archival or recent biopsy tumor samples

          -  Received at least 4 weeks of one prior sorafenib containing systemic therapy and then
             experienced documented radiographic disease progression; or inability to tolerate
             prior therapy received for at least a minimum period of time.

          -  Discontinued prior systemic treatment or any investigational drug for at least 2
             weeks (14 days) or for at least 3 weeks for IV anti-cancer drugs, prior to the study
             randomization

          -  ECOG Performance Status (PS) of &lt;= equal to 1

          -  Local or loco-regional therapy (i.e., surgery, radiation therapy, hepatic arterial
             embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency ablation, percutaneous ethanol
             injection, or cryoablation) must have been completed &gt;= 4 weeks prior to
             randomization

          -  Measurable disease as defined by the RECIST v1.1. Tumor lesions previously treated
             with local therapy should demonstrate clear dimensional increase by radiographic
             assessment in order to be selected as target lesion(s) at baseline.
