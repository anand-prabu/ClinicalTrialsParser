If participant missed a dose, they\n      should not take an extra dose.  Instead, participant should take their next dose on time.\n      If participant vomits a dose within 30 minutes after taking it, they can take an extra dose\n      to make it up for it.  If participant vomits and more than 30 minutes has passed since they\n      took ruxolitinib, they should not take an extra dose.  Instead, participant should take\n      their next dose on time.\n\n      If needed, participant's doctor may raise or lower their dose of ruxolitinib, based on how\n      the disease is responding to the drug or if they are experiencing severe side effects.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      At about 2 weeks and then 3 months after participant's first study drug dose:\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for cytokine testing.\n\n        -  Participant will fill out the symptom questionnaire.  This can be done at the clinic or\n           mailed to the study staff.\n\n      About every 1-2 months:\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      If it is more convenient, some of the study tests and procedures can be done at\n      participant's home doctor's office.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      Participant may receive the study drug for up to 2 years.  At that point, participant may be\n      allowed to continue taking the study drug for as long as the sponsor provides the drug and\n      the doctor thinks it is in their best interest.  Participant will no longer be able to take\n      the study drug if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if they are\n      unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the end-of-treatment visit.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      After participant is finished taking the study drug, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn\n      for cytokine testing.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available\n      for the treatment of myelofibrosis (MF).  Giving ruxolitinib to patients with CLL is\n      investigational.  The study doctor can explain how the study drug is designed to work.\n\n      Up to 40 participants will enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson."

Subjects with an invasive malignancy over the previous 2 years except treated basal\n             or squamous carcinomas of the skin completely resected intraepithelial carcinoma of\n             the cervix and completely resected papillary thyroid and follicular thyroid cancers.\n\n          7.
