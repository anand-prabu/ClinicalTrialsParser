In patients without\n      high-risk factors maintenance therapy was given with per oral mercaptopurine and\n      methotrexate for two years including reinduction courses: daunorubicine, vincristine and\n      prednisolone every second month (1st year) and cytarabine, thioguanine and prednisolone\n      every third month (2nd year)."
