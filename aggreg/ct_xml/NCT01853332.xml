      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of individual characteristics, life
      stresses, and relationships over time on psychosocial outcomes (e.g. marriage, parenting,
      work) and physical health

      Research Procedures:  If a patient choose to take part in this research study, they will
      undergo these research procedures:

      The patient will participate in a total of two meetings and four phone calls over the course
      of the study (two and a half years). The meetings will be held at the beginning and end of
      the two and a half year period. The first part of each meeting will take place at Beth
      Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC) where they will sign this consent form and then be
      interviewed for medical history, given a physical examination, and have blood tests
      described below. The patient will then be transported to Judge Baker Children's Center
      (JBCC), where they will have lunch, complete questionnaires, and participate in taped
      interviews (approximately 4 hours).  The phone calls will be approximately every six months
      and the patient will be contacted by the people at JBCC.  More detailed information on the
      study procedures is outlined below and on the JBCC consent form for the study.

      Interviews, Questionnaires, and Phone calls: These aspects of the study are covered in the
      Judge Baker Children's Center consent form. Briefly, the patient will be asked to discuss
      relationships with their partner, family, and friends, their career, their current goals in
      life, their health status, etc. These sessions will be recorded so that the patient's
      answers can be coded and analyzed at a later time.  All information will be kept strictly
      confidential.

      Medical Examination: The patient will arrive fasting to the medical examination.  During the
      medical exam, a physician will ask the patient questions about their physical health and
      family history.  The doctor will then conduct a physical examination which includes:

        1. Glucose finger stick for diabetes screening

        2. Vital signs (such as blood pressure) and anthropometrics (such as waist circumference).

        3. Measuring the amount of fat in the patient's body using bioelectrical impedance
           analysis. This test will measure the resistance to the naturally occurring flow of
           electrical currents within the nerves and muscles using a few electrical sensors
           (similar to the EKG) attached to the patient's wrist and ankle for less than a minute.
           This procedure is not painful and uses the same principle as weighing oneself on a
           scale that provides body mass index.

        4. Measuring the patient body's ability to use sugar through an oral glucose tolerance
           test (OGTT). A nurse will place an intravenous (IV) catheter (a small tube) in the
           patient's arm. It will be taped to stay in place for approximately four hours. The
           patient will drink a mixed nutrient drink called Boost. The patient's blood will be
           drawn through the catheter 15 min after the Boost is given and then at 30-minute
           intervals for 3 hours to measure how they metabolize the nutrient drink.

        5. EKG

    <description>Participants will be assessed in two visits, baseline (visit 1) and follow up (visit 2) 2.5 years after baseline. To assess clinically significant physical health outcomes including 1) establishing risk factors for CVD and type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM)  2) establishing novel  risk  factors  for  CVD  and  DM  (e.g., inflammatory  markers, hormonal mediators ), and 3) determining the prevalence of established CVD and DM.
Metabolic Syndrome Components (MetS).
Both insulin and glucose will be measured.
Adipokines.
Myokines.
Triglycerides and HDL cholesterol will be considered in light of their relevance to CVD.
Proinflammatory markers.
Stress hormones.</description>

    <description>Measurements will be obtained during 2 meetings and 4 phone calls over the course of the study (2.5 years). The meetings will be held at the beginning and end of the 2.5 year period.

Measurements of psychosocial outcomes include in-person and telephone interviews   as well as questionnaires to assess: Socioeconomic Status (SES), Adversity: Trauma &amp; Stress, Mental Health &amp; Negative Emotions, Competency and Positive Feelings, and Relationships.</description>

Acute and chronic stress will be measured by the Evaluation of Lifetime Stressors (ELS) to assess trauma exposure in childhood and adulthood. Individual competences, beliefs, and positive emotions will be assessed by the Social Adjustment Scale  (SAS;  assesses global functioning and 5 specific domains of functioning in the preceding 2 months via semi-structured interview). Relationships will be assessed based on couples' interactions, Secure Base Scoring System, Dyadic Adjustment Scale.</description>

        Approximately 165 former participants and 250 new participants will take part in this
        study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (and Judge Baker Children's Center). The new
        sample will include 250 African American and Black Caribbean midlife men and women with
        the goal of recruiting 80% as couples. A total of 415 people will take part in this study
        at all study sites. Spouses and long-term significant others (with bonuses to couples for
        joining) will be encourage to also participate in the study. Targeting couples in this way
        will be parallel for the community and longitudinal samples

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male and female participants between 35 and 55 years of age.

        Exclusion Criteria: (based on interference with key assessments)

          -  Abnormal hepatic function (liver function tests &gt;2X upper normal);

          -  abnormal renal function (creatinine &gt;1.3 mg/dl);

          -  conditions/illnesses such as active infection, significant
             malabsorption/malnutrition, cancer;

          -  active hormonal disease such as overt hypo/hyperthyroidism, hypogonadism,
             hyper-cortisolism, or treatment with steroids or growth hormone.

          -  Known Diabetes Mellitus (DM) and Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) will be screened for by
             a detailed history and systems review.

          -  Baseline laboratory analysis with chemistries, CBC, hormone levels, and EKG will be
             completed.

        Two exceptions will be made to the usual exclusion criteria:

          1. Original subjects with DM or CVD will not be excluded,  since  that  would  result
             in  bias  in  that  sample  and  loss  of  opportunity  to  examine  predictors
             associated with these outcomes.

          2. Community adults diagnosed with these disorders at the screening visit will be
             retained and referred for medical treatment as needed. In both groups, those with DM
             and/or CVD will be followed for psychosocial and relevant biomedical variables,
             excluding assessments interfered with by CVD and DM relevant medications. Those with
             DM and CVD will at times be separately analyzed, together with participants who
             develop these disorders in the years of this new study phase.
