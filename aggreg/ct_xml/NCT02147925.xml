    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to explore the effectiveness of liraglutide combined with metformin
      in non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) compared
      to sitagliptin and insulin glargine in combination with metformin.

      This is a 26-week, randomized, open-label, active controlled, parallel group, multi-centre
      trial.To compare the change of intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by magnetic resonance
      spectroscopy(MRS) in type 2 diabetic patients with non-alcoholic fatty-liver disease after a
      26-week treatment of liraglutide, sitagliptin or insulin glargine per day combined with
      metformin.The primary endpoint will be defined by intrahepatic lipids (IHL) as measured by
      magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS).
