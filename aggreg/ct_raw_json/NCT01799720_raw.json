Therefore, the main objective of this paper is to\n      analyze the effect of dietary supplements Omega-3 with different levels of oxidation in the\n      lipid profile of women who consume these supplements. For this purpose the investigators\n      have designed a single-blind, parallel-groups, randomized controlled trial. Finally, 52\n      women between 25 and 75 years old were randomly distributed into three groups: (1) took 2\n      capsules/day of one of the less oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA + DHA) and diet, (2)\n      took 2 capsules/day of one of the most oxidized oil (containing 300 mg EPA + DHA) and diet\n      and (3) no capsules, only received the diet. There was a 30 days follow-up . All groups\n      followed a low cholesterol diet. Circulating glucose, total cholesterol, triglycerides and\n      glutamic pyruvic transaminase were determined at the beginning and end of a 30 day period."
