The initial dose for each of the subsequent age cohorts will be modified if necessary, based on the recommendation of the DSMB.\nFollowing the initial dose, clevidipine will be up-titrated every 1.5 minutes, according to subject need, to achieve an SBP within the pre-specified SBP target range. Doses may be increased by less than doubling, and the time between dose adjustments may be lengthened, as the target blood pressure is approached. The infusion rate may be maintained for up to 96 hours, once the subject's SBP is within the target range, and titrated as necessary to maintain blood pressure within the range."
