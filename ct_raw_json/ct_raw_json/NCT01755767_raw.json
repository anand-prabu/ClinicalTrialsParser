Overexpression of the receptor in tumor samples or high level of blood HGF in\n      subjects is related to higher recurrence rate after surgery for HCC, while high c-Met\n      expression correlates with shorter survival in HCC subjects. In summary, c-Met holds an\n      important prognostic role in the natural history of HCC.  This Phase 3 study in MET\n      Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC subjects has been designed based on the results from the\n      randomized, controlled Phase 2 study conducted by ArQule, Inc. with tivantinib versus\n      placebo in subjects with MET Diagnostic-High inoperable HCC who have failed one prior\n      systemic therapy, mentioned above. The purpose of this study is to confirm the efficacy of\n      tivantinib in MET Diagnostic-High HCC subjects who were previously treated with one systemic\n      therapy, and to further evaluate the safety profile of the experimental drug in this subject\n      population."
