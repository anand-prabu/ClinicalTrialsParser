A key limitation of contemporary treatment strategies\n      of AAA is the lack of therapy directed at reducing expansion. Although surgical repair is an\n      effective treatment for large AAA, it is associated with significant mortality and morbidity\n      as well as substantial cost. The rationale for this randomized controlled study is to\n      investigate whether treatment with Ticagrelor inhibits growth of small abdominal aortic\n      aneurysms."
