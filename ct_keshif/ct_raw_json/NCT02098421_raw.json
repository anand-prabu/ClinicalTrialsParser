The investigators will also assess other\n      maternal and neonatal outcomes including risk of infection (i.e. chorioamnionitis),\n      bleeding, uterine atony, cesarean delivery and use of regional analgesia.\n\n      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 2 arms of the study: use of oxytocin or\n      no oxytocin while the Foley bulb is in place. As part of standard of care for inductions,\n      Foley bulbs will be placed for all participants. Study participants who are randomly\n      assigned to the use of oxytocin will receive oxytocin at the time the Foley bulb is placed.\n      Study participants randomly assigned to no oxytocin will receive the oxytocin once the Foley\n      bulb is removed.\n\n      After delivery, information will be collected from participant's chart on the outcome of\n      pregnancy such as gestational age at delivery, type of delivery (vaginal or cesarean\n      section), and baby's outcome (such as birth weight, APGAR scores, and any complications)."
