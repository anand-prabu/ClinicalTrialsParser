  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of PF-045 and PF-055 with that of vehicle
      in subjects with scabies. It is anticipated that a majority of subjects will require and
      receive a single treatment; however, those subjects not showing improvement at the follow-up
      visit 2 weeks after initial treatment will be treated a second time.  Those subjects
      originally assigned to vehicle for the first treatment will receive a &quot;re-treatment&quot; with
      one of the active doses.

    <description>&quot;Treatment success&quot; is defined as achieving an Investigator Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 or 1 at Day 28 (i.e., following a single full-body treatment).  IGA measures scabies disease status on a 5-point scale (0=clear to 4=severe).</description>

    <description>The change in the signs/symptoms related to the disease in each treatment group at Days 14 and 28, as well as at Day 42 for those subjects provided with re-treatment at Day 14 who show improvement in their IGA score at Day 28.</description>
