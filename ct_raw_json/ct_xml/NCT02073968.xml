      This phase II trial studies how well intensity modulated radiation therapy adjusted by
      positron emission tomography (PET) scanning together with combination chemotherapy works in
      treating patients with stage II-IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Radiation therapy
      uses high energy x rays to kill tumor cells. In intensity-modulated radiotherapy, multiple
      beam angles and dozens of beam segments are used to deliver highly conformal radiation
      therapy. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different
      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from
      dividing. Giving PET-adjusted IMRT together with combination chemotherapy may kill more
      tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy (based on post-treatment PET findings) of dose-painted
      intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy for
      locally-advanced non-small cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the efficacy (based on clinical endpoints including locoregional control
      [LRC], disease-free survival [DFS], and overall survival [OS]) of dose-painted IMRT with
      concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy for LA-NSCLC.

      II. To evaluate the safety of dose-painted IMRT with concurrent and adjuvant chemotherapy
      for LA-NSCLC.

      III. To evaluate the utility of post-treatment PET/computed tomography (CT) imaging as a
      predictor of clinical outcomes following treatment with this novel approach.

      IV. To explore, in a preliminary manner, whether metabolomic markers in the blood and urine
      prior to and during the course of treatment are associated with treatment response, clinical
      endpoints, and treatment-related adverse events such as radiation pneumonitis.

      OUTLINE:

      RADIATION THERAPY: Patients undergo PET-adjusted IMRT five days a week for 5 weeks.

      CONCURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 3 hours and
      paclitaxel IV over 1 hour once weekly for 6 weeks beginning week 1 of thoracic radiotherapy.

      CONSOLIDATION CHEMOTHERAPY: Beginning approximately 4-6 weeks after the completion of all
      radiation therapy and when esophagitis and chemotherapy-induced neuropathy are grade 1 or
      less, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; 1500, and platelet count &gt; 100,000, patients receive
      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours on day 1. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for up to 3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable
      toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4 weeks 12-16 weeks, every
      3 months for 2 years and then every 6 months thereafter.
