However this approach is often felt uncomfortable by the mothers,\n      and sequential pumping is preferred.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine which modality of milk expression by electric pump\n      is the most efficient and productive when sequential pumping is used.This is done by\n      assessing  the milk volume expressed per expression and its macronutrients content."

Complete pumping of one breast (first left) for 15 min, followed by complete pumping of\n           the right breast for 15 min, until the breast is empty.\n\n        2. Pumping both breast simultaneously for 15 min.\n\n      At day one of the study, the mothers will follow the standard pumping modality in practice\n      at our department.\n\n      In between the two studied procedures at day 4 of the study, the mothers will again follow\n      the standard pumping modality.\n\n      On each day of the study, in the morning after the first expression of the day, a sample of\n      2 ml of pumped breastmilk will be taken, and the total volume of the daily expressed milk\n      will be recorded."
