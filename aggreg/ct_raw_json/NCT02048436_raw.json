The subjects will be selected to represent a range\n      of body types including small, average, muscular, and large with a range of BMI's.\n\n      A range of stable respiratory rates will be elicited from each volunteer test subject.  The\n      rates will be approximately 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 40 breaths per minute; with some\n      natural variation from these exact numbers.\n\n      Each subject will be instrumented with an open system mask that allows for measurement of\n      the end tidal carbon dioxide (EtCO2) respiratory rate and tidal volume.  The EtCO2 monitor\n      will be used as the Accuracy Reference Device (Reference) in this study.  Performance of the\n      currently released ECG Impedance Respiratory Rate monitor (Acceptance Standard) will be used\n      to establish the acceptance criteria in this study by comparing to Reference."
