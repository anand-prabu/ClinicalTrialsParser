        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent

          -  Male or female

          -  Age 18-65 years inclusive

          -  Subjects with a current episode of moderate to severe Major Depressive Disorder
             meeting the criteria of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)
             IV -TR and documented using the brief structured interview Mini International
             Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) version 5.0 and with a minimum duration of two
             weeks and a maximum of twelve months

          -  Minimum Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) 17 items total score of 18 at screening and
             ≥12 at the end of the lead-in phase prior to randomization.

          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential and female subjects who
             are neither surgically sterilized nor post-menopausal (defined as no menses for one
             year or an follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) value &gt;40 IU/L) will be required to use
             effective contraception throughout the study and for 30 days after. The following
             contraceptive methods are acceptable: hormonal (e.g. oral, injection, transdermal
             patch, implant, cervical ring), barrier (e.g. condom or diaphragm with spermicidal
             agent), intrauterine system (IUS) or intrauterine device (IUD). If hormonal
             contraceptives are used by female subjects they must be established for 6 weeks
             before the first administration of test product. Male sterilization is considered an
             acceptable form of contraception if the appropriate post-vasectomy documentation
             (absence of sperm) is provided. Sexual abstinence is considered acceptable if this is
             in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject; periodic abstinence
             (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are
             not acceptable methods of contraception.

          -  Benzodiazepine or any other psychotropic medication including lithium or other mood
             stabilizers within 1 week of screening

          -  Renal insufficiency defined as creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min

          -  Epilepsy

          -  Uncontrolled hypothyroidism

             1 year prior to screening

          -  Significant history of alcohol or substance abuse

             seropositivity.

          -  A corrected QT interval of &gt;470ms for female subjects of &gt;450ms for male subjects,
             calculated using the QTcB (Bazett Correction Formula) , or second degree or higher
             heart block on an electrocardiography (ECG) recording, at screening.

          -  Allergy to the study drugs or excipients
