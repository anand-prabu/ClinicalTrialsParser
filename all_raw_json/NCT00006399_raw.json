            "textblock": "Estrogen (EST) may have significant benefits in preserving cognitive functioning in normal\n      aging after menopause and in decreasing the incidence of Alzheimer's disease (AD).  On a\n      molecular level, EST has effects on a variety of cholinergic neuronal and receptor-mediated\n      mechanisms that may be responsible for these beneficial effects.  These neurons have\n      critical relevance for the development of age-related cognitive changes and dementing\n      disorders.  However, little is known about the clinical relevance of EST-cholinergic\n      interactions, either in normal aging or in AD.\n\n      The primary goal of this study is to test the hypothesis that three months of administration\n      of EST to 1) normal post-menopausal women, and 2) female patients with mild-moderate AD who\n      are concurrently treated with anticholinesterase therapy (donepezil), will positively change\n      or blunt the negative and behavioral effects of drugs that block central cholinergic\n      receptors (both muscarinic and nicotinic). Participants will be blindly placed on EST or\n      placebo for three months each.  After each three month period, they will be cognitively\n      assessed after receiving single doses of the cholinergic antagonists scopolamine and\n      mecamylamine.  These results will have direct implications for the use of EST in\n      post-menopausal women as well as interactive treatment with cholinergic drugs for AD.\n      Researchers plan to recruit a total of 45 women (30 healthy, and 15 patients with AD).\n\n      NOTE: This study is only recruiting participants with Alzheimer's Disease at this time."
