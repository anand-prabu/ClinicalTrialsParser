      Background

        -  Esophageal carcinoma is the sixth leading cause of cancer -related mortality and the
           eighth most common cancer worldwide

        -  The incidence is increasing rapidly

        -  The overall 5-year survival ranges from 15% to 25% in the literature and poor outcomes
           are related to diagnosis at advanced stages.

        -  Surgery used to be the cornerstone of treatment of resectable esophageal cancer, but
           treatment of esophageal carcinoma remains challenging and need to be considered through
           a multimodal approach. However the modalities and the impact of this multimodal
           approach at a national level are unknown Primary objective: To identify predictors of
           recurrence after esophageal cancer surgery

      Secondary objectives :

        -  5-year recurrence free survival

        -  5-year overall survival

        -  Predictors of postoperative mortality and mobidity after surgery

        -  Impact of pCR on recurrence and survival

        -  Impact of neoadjuvant treatments on recurrence and survival

        -  Impact of patient preconditioning (such as nutritional support, esophageal prosthesis,
           mini-invasive approach…) on outcomes

      Methodology : European French-speaking retrospective multicentric study Inclusion criteria:
      All consecutive patients operated on, for a histologically proven carcinoma of the
      esophagus, the esogastric junction (Siewert type I and II), in surgical investigator centers
      between January 2000 and December 2010 Exclusion criteria:  Siewert III type carcinoma of
      the esogastric junction , non surgical treatment of esophageal carcinoma Planned study
      period:  The data will be collected over a 11-year period from January 2000 to December
      2010. Follow up will be ascertained in May 2013.
