Though there\n      is no direct evidence that H. pylori infection is a risk factor for gastric cancer in family\n      members of gastric cancer, current European guideline recommends H. pylori eradication in\n      first-degree relatives of gastric cancer patients.\n\n      In this study, the investigators will evaluate whether H. pylori eradication can reduce\n      gastric cancer risk in the first-degree family members of gastric cancer patients."
