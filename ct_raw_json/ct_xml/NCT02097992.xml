  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to test the hypothesis that in patients with
      stable COPD who use ICS regularly, a single dose of and long-term treatment of 4 weeks with
      roflumilast increase Qaw (not affected by ICS) and potentiate albuterol-induced vasodilation
      in the airway beyond the preexisting effect of ICS. These vascular effects of roflumilast
      can be considered to be anti-inflammatory. A secondary objective is to determine if
      roflumilast potentiates albuterol-induced bronchodilation, potentially a useful effect in
      acutely exacerbated COPD.

    <textblock>
      Participants will be on this study for about three months There will be 6 study days
      (visits). The patients will be asked to come to the research laboratory in the morning of
      the study day. They will be instructed to abstain from ingesting alcoholic beverages or
      using PDE5 inhibitors the night before the study, and from consuming coffee or caffeinated
      drinks in the morning of the study day because of their potential acute cardiovascular
      actions. The patients will also be asked not to have a fatty breakfast on the study day to
      avoid potential effects of fat on the absorption of roflumilast.

      The visits will be separated by at least 48 hours.

      The treatments will be administered in a double-blind randomized design, using active
      roflumilast and identically appearing roflumilast placebo provided by Forest.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Twenty-four patients with physician-diagnosed COPD (female and male, current smokers
             or ex-smokers) over the age of 45 years will be recruited for this study.

          -  The patients will have to have a smoking history of at least 10 pack-years, and they
             must have been using an ICS regularly for at least 4 weeks at the time of screening.

          -  Confirmation of the diagnosis of COPD will require the presence of persistent
             exertional dyspnea and a post-bronchodilator FEV1 of less than 80% of predicted and
             FEV1/FVC ratio less than 0.7 (GOLD stage ≥2). At entry into the study, the patients
             will have to be clinically stable; they will be allowed to remain on their regular
             COPD treatment regimen and use a LABA and/or LAMA until 24 hours before, and a SABA
             and/or short-acting muscarinic antagonist (SAMA) until 6 hours before coming to the
             laboratory. If using roflumilast, the subjects will have to discontinue it 4 weeks
             before entering into the study.-

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Women of childbearing potential who do not use accepted birth control measures

          -  Pregnant and breast-feeding women.

          -  Use of cardiovascular medications that cannot be held on the study days

          -  Use of oral airway medications or anti-inflammatory agents

          -  Use of supplemental oxygen that cannot be discontinued during the laboratory visit

          -  Subjects with known SABA or roflumilast intolerance

          -  An acute COPD exacerbation within four weeks prior to the study
