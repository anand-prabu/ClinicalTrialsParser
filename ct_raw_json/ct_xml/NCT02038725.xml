  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with a transient ischemic attack (TIA) are at high risk of stroke. Rapid assessment
      and treatment can reduce the risk. Several international guidelines recommend a test, the
      ABCD2 score, to identify TIA patients with low and high risk for stroke. The main purpose of
      this study is to investigate stroke risk after TIA in both short (1 week) and long term (3
      months/1 year), and to assess whether the Age, Blood pressure, Clinical features, Duration
      of TIA, Diabetes (ABCD2) score is a sufficient tool for predicting stroke risk. Secondary
      aims are to explore whether adopting imaging modalities (ultrasound, MRI) and biological
      markers of blood into a risk score could improve the predictive value of the ABCD2 score and
      still be feasible in a daily clinical practice. Further on overall risk factors in TIA
      patients, and the incidence of other vascular events will be studied. A substudy designed as
      a randomised controlled trial evaluates pharmaceutical counseling in a subset of
      participants. Cost-benefit analysis, and a long-term follow-up (5 years) is planned.
