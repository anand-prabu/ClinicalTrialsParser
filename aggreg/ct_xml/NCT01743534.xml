  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The insanities, priority of public health in 2008, have significant prevalency in Limousin,
      region in the ageing demography (1/3 of the population is more than 60 years old against
      1/5th of average in France). To prevent the lack of therapeutic solutions, for these
      evolutionary diseases, the new plan Alzheimer 2008-2012 encourages the research.

      The insanities deprive gradually the individual of their autonomy, their personality and
      their identity. The help of an institution is sometimes inevitable. In the middle of this
      stressful environment, the patient affected by severe insanity, need marks.

      The aspect of their old objects, significant for them, has to be prioritized because the
      institutional universe, often depersonalized doesn't mean anything for them. In front of
      repeated failures, they're hurt in their self respect.

      The prevention of the undernutrition, comes by a preservation of praxis and pleasure at
      table. The institutional plate used in certain hospital sectors, is unpersonal (rectangular,
      divided) and can be destabilizing for the mentally ill person.
