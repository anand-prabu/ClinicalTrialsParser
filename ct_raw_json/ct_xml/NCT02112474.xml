  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Electrical stimulation of the spinal cord (Spinal Cord Stimulation or SCS) for pain relief
      has been used for decades. It is used most commonly in patients with  chronic neuropathic
      leg pain, after spinal surgery. Conventional neurostimulation is applied in frequencies of
      30 to 60 Hertz (Hz) and perceptible paraesthesias are felt. Stimulation using higher
      frequencies with sub perception paraesthesias has recently challenged the conventional form
      of neurostimulation.The high frequency stimulation appears to show better pain relief for
      both back and limb pain in comparison to low frequency SCS, and may also to be effective in
      some subjects who did not respond to low frequency SCS.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale:

      Electrical stimulation of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord (Spinal Cord Stimulation or
      SCS) for pain relief has been used in humans for several decades. The most common indication
      for SCS is the treatment of refractory neuropathic leg pain, particularly when these
      symptoms persist after an anatomically successful operation (Failed Back Surgery Syndrome or
      FBSS).

      Low frequency - conventional - SCS (LF-SCS) is applied in frequencies ranging from 30 to 60
      Hertz (Hz) and the subject feels paraesthesias in the painful area, which is considered the
      ideal situation. Recently, LF-SCS has been challenged by the development of stimulation
      modes at higher frequencies which provide pain relief at sub-perception threshold, i.e.
      without paraesthesias. A recent case series reported that High Frequency Spinal Cord
      Stimulation (HF-SCS) appears to show better pain relief for both back and limb pain in
      comparison to LF-SCS, and also to be effective in some subjects who did not respond to
      LF-SCS.

      Objective:

      The primary objective of this trial is to compare pain suppression in two groups of subjects
      with chronic unilateral limb pain as a result of FBSS .

      Study design:

      A prospective, double blind (subject, physician, statistician), multi-centre, randomized,
      crossover trial of SCS in the treatment of subjects with refractory neuropathic leg pain
      after back surgery.

      Study population:

      Patients with chronic neuropathic refractory unilateral leg pain

      Intervention:

      Patients will undergo neurostimulation with low and high frequency parameters, the order in
      which they receive treatment will be randomized

      Main study endpoint:

      Pain suppression in the short and long-term (24 days and 12 months)

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:

      Both methods of stimulation are standard clinical practice performed routinely in the study
      centres, both groups will receive this standard care. The only difference is change of
      stimulation frequency and the order in which it is applied.

      Possible benefit to the subject is that both forms of stimulation will be evaluated. This
      may lead to a better quality of life in the HF-SCS Group as result of pain relief without
      paraesthesias. Furthermore, non-responders to LF-SCS may benefit from HF-SCS.
