      This study had four aims:

        1. To evaluate the correlation between the planned preoperative cup size and the actual
           cup size that was implanted in surgery.

        2. To examine the absolute difference between the implanted cup size diameter and the
           actual femoral head size diameter.

        3. To examine the absolute difference between the planned cup size diameter and the actual
           femoral head size diameter

        4. To suggest an additional online monitoring tool on the accuracy of the preoperative
           process and implant selection. We hypothesized that high accuracy rates will be found
           between the preoperative planned cup size and the actual implanted cup size.
           Furthermore, we hypothesized that strong correlations will be found between the planned
           and actual implanted cup size and the actual femoral head diameter size.

      Methods This is a retrospective study , that will include patients who underwent  primary
      cementless THA due to end-stage hip osteoarthritis during 2011 and 2013 . Inclusion criteria
      were: Patients that underwent primary THA due to end-stage primary osteoarthritis; Males and
      females between 15-90 years of age.

      Data collection The following data will be collected: patients' characteristic including
      gender, age at surgery and side of surgery; implant information including cup model, planed
      cup size, actual cup size, shell type and outer diameter size (mm); actual femoral head
      diameter size (mm); the difference between the planned cup size and the actual cup size that
      was used; the difference between the actual femoral head diameter size measured at the end
      of surgery and the cementless implanted cup outer diameter size; the difference between the
      actual femoral head diameter size  and the planed cup size..
