  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a very common, chronic/intermittent and disabling neurovascular headache
      disorder that has long believed to have no severe consequences. Recent evidence, however,
      strongly suggest that migraine is associated with increased risk of ischemic stroke and
      there is initial evidence that migraine is associated with structural brain changes
      independent of the occurrence of stroke.

      As migraine has strong links with the vascular system, it is plausible that vascular
      functions interact on the association between migraine and structural brain changes as well
      as cognition.

      Our primary objectives are to investigate: (i) the relationship of migraine and migraine
      subtypes on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes in a cohort of patients with active
      migraine; (ii) the relationship of migraine on cognitive performance among patients with
      active migraine; and (iii) the relationship of migraine and migraine specifics with vascular
      functions and morbidity. As secondary objective, we investigate whether the association of
      migraine on structural brain changes or cognitive performance is modified by vascular
      functions.

      This will be an observational study conducted in the Headache Center in Bordeaux. 300
      patients have to be included (150 patients with migraine with aura and 150 patients with
      migraine without aura).

      Inclusion criteria are: all patients with a clearly defined migraine (as per
      IHS[International Headache Classification] criteria) who are aged 30 and older, are able to
      fluently speak French, and who are willing to participate.

      Exclusion criteria are:  pregnant woman and patient who have a major psychiatric disease or
      major anxiety disorder or had a pacemaker  (which would not allow to perform a MRI imaging).

      The cognitive status in the patient cohort will be ascertained by the Repeatable Battery for
      the Assessment of Neuropsychological Status (RBANS). In addition to the RBANS, we will use
      the HIT-6 (Headache Impact Test) and MIDAS (MIgraine Disability ASessment) and the
      depression scale CES-D (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale).

      Vascular risk status will be assessed by measurement of blood pressure and reports of
      vascular risk factors.  The endothelial function will be measured with a noninvasive
      Peripheral Arterial Tone (PAT) signal technology using the EndoPAT device (Itamar Medical
      Inc, Framingham, MA).

      For crude comparisons, chi-square tests will be used for categorical variables and t-test
      for continuous variables. Multivariable-multinominal modeling techniques will be utilized
      for the comparisons adjusting for potential confounding variables. All statistical tests
      will be two-tailed and a P &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.
