            "textblock": "Recent studies have shown that human breast cancers can be immunogenic, and that enhancing\n      the immune effector function already present may augment the cytotoxic effects of standard\n      therapies.\n\n      Vaccination is an  attractive strategy because of its expected inducement of both\n      therapeutic T cell immunity (effector T cells) and protective T cell immunity\n      (tumor-specific memory T cells that can control tumor relapse). Clinical studies have now\n      demonstrated that immunity against tumor antigens can be enhanced in cancer patients by\n      vaccination with ex vivo-generated tumor antigen-loaded dendritic cells (DCs). This strategy\n      capitalizes on the unique capacity of DCs to prime lymphocytes and to regulate and maintain\n      immune responses.\n\n      In addition, blockade of interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) represents a novel approach to breast cancer\n      immunotherapy. Cancer cells induce interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1 \u03b2) secretion from DCs and monocytes\n      in a contact-dependent fashion. This is mediated by cancer cell-derived TGF- \u03b2. IL-1 \u03b2\n      induces Thymic stromal lymphopoietin ( TSLP) production from breast cancer cells lines in a\n      dose and contact dependent manner. TSLP-neutralizing antibodies are found to block up\n      regulation of OX40L by tumor- infiltrating mDCs, and consequently block mDCs' capacity to\n      generate iTH2 cells (CD4+ T cells) and to accelerate tumor development in vivo.33 Thus,\n      interference with the TSLP-OX40L-IL13 axis will allow modification of cancer-associated\n      inflammation and thereby offer a novel therapeutic approach for patients with TNBC. Results\n      showed high levels of IL-1 \u03b2 in the breast cancer microenvironment. Anakinra is a\n      recombinant soluble non-glycosylated homolog of human IL-1R\u03b1 that competitively inhibits\n      binding of IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1 \u03b2 to the receptor type. Administration of the IL-1R antagonist,\n      anakinra, is thought to prevent tumor growth in vivo, blocks OX40L+ expression on DCs, and\n      blocks iTH2 generation in vivo.\n\n      Our goals are to boost T cell immunity targeted against breast cancer utilizing a tumor\n      antigen-loaded DC vaccine, to reverse the immune suppressive tumor microenvironment by IL-1\n      blockade, to enhance chemotherapy effectiveness and decrease tumor metastagenicity, and to\n      decrease the recurrence rates of LA TNBC. Patients with LA TNBC will be treated with a\n      combination of antigen-loaded DC vaccinations along with standard preoperative chemotherapy,\n      to improve TNBC immunogenicity and to increase the pCR rate achieved with standard therapy.\n      The trial will consist of 2 patient cohorts. In the first group, patients will receive DC\n      vaccinations in combination with preoperative chemotherapy. In the second group, IL-1\n      blockade with anakinra will be added to the treatment regimen."
