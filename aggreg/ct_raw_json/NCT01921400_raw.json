By comparing the regulation of key steps in the intracellular life cycle of\n      HCV in cytotrophoblasts to highly permissive hepatocytes, significant differences in HCV\n      regulation should be revealed.\n\n      Based on our preliminary data, our working hypothesis is that HCV Core protein is\n      differentially processed in cytotrophoblasts compared to hepatocytes."
