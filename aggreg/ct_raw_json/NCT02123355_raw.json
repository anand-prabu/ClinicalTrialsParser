So, the prevention and treatment of POCD in\n      geriatrics is important.\n\n      Dexmedetomidine is found to have the effect of  neuro-protection, but it is controversy\n      whether  Dexmedetomidine has the effect of neuro-protection in geriatrics, especially the\n      prolonged surgery.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to explore the effect of Dexmedetomidine to the cognitive\n      function at prolonged surgery in geriatrics in geriatrics."
