  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether combining laparoscopic adjustable
      gastric band (AKA: lap-band surgery, LAGB) and laparoscopic gastric plication (making tucks
      in the large curve of the stomach with stitches) to lap-band surgery alone will result in a
      greater loss of excess weight over time. We anticipate that the average percent of excess
      body weight loss for study subjects will exceed 29% at 12 months.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding when combined with gastric plication will provide
      lasting weight loss benefits to patients. We are projecting that the percent of Excess Body
      Weight Loss (% EWL) will be greater in study subjects when compared with our control group
      with LAGB alone. Furthermore, it is anticipated that the % EWL in study subjects will be
      similar to patients  who have laparoscopic Roux-En-Y Gastric Bypass.

    <description>Excess Body Weight is identified pre-operatively and will be monitored during each post operative visit. The percent of Excess Body Weight Loss (%EWL) will be calculated using as a baseline the % Excess Body Weight identified pre-operatively during the subject's initial consult. The change in %EWL at will be calculated at 6 months and 12 months. The %EWL will then be compared to a similar cohort of patients who had the LAGB alone at the same milestones. It is anticipated that study patients' %EWL will be significantly greater.</description>
