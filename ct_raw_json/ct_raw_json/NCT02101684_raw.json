            "textblock": "Granulosa Cell ovarian carcinoma is an infrequent subtype of neoplasia well differentiated\n      from epithelial tumors. They account for 5% of all ovarian malignancies and, with an\n      incidence of 0.4-1.2 cases per 100000 habitants, is considered as a rare disease.\n\n      Though most cases are identified at initial stages and can be cured through surgical\n      resection, distant recurrences have been documented even 10 years after resecting the\n      primary tumor. At advanced stage it is a lethal disease.\n\n      Unfortunately because of the low incidence of this disease randomized clinical trials are\n      lacking. In fact current evidence for treatment is provided by case reports, retrospective\n      studies and phase II clinical trials performed one decade ago.\n\n      Orteronel, a novel, orally active, selective inhibitor of 17,20-lyase, is being developed as\n      an endocrine therapy for relevant hormone-sensitive cancers such as prostate cancer and\n      breast cancer.  Orteronel is expected to suppress sex hormone levels in both circulation and\n      relevant hormone-dependent malignant tissue.  Since sex hormone overproduction has been\n      demonstrated in granulosa cell ovarian tumors and seems to play a major role in this\n      disease, this study will assess the efficacy or orteronel treating such tumors."
