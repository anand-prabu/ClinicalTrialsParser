  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fish oil supplements (which are rich in omega-3 fatty acids) have been shown to provide
      cardiometabolic benefits to individuals of all ages. Specifically, the daily consumption of
      fish oil supplements has been reported to reduce blood triglyceride levels, and influence
      glucose homeostasis and whole-body inflammation. However, recent evidence highlights
      important gaps in our understanding with respect to the impact of fish oil supplements on
      health; specifically, not everyone responds to these supplements in the same manner. The
      goal of this research is to explore how an individual's genetic make-up may modify their
      response to fish oil supplements.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The typical Western diet is now recognized to have insufficient amounts of omega-3 fatty
      acids (in particular EPA and DHA). These fatty acids have several known health benefits,
      including improvements in heart health, metabolic syndrome, and inflammation. These benefits
      occur because omega-3 fatty acids can regulate a myriad of cellular functions. In order to
      increase the levels of these omega-3 fatty acids in the body, individuals must either
      consume more marine products or take an omega-3 rich dietary supplement, such as fish oil.
      While fish oil supplements are commonly consumed by people, it is now recognized that not
      everyone responds to these supplements in the same manner. Therefore this study aims to
      improve our understanding of why people respond differently to the same dietary supplement.
      The goals of this research will be accomplished using a number of approaches:

        1. The investigators will examine how fish oil supplementation leads to an enrichment of
           EPA and DHA in various cells throughout the body (erythrocytes, adipose tissue, etc).

        2. The investigators will determine the dynamic changes in EPA and DHA incorporation into
           different cell-types during distinct phases of our dietary intervention study (e.g.
           during supplementation and subsequent wash out periods).

        3. The investigators will study how fish oil supplements influence various blood markers
           of cardiometabolic health (e.g. triglycerides, cholesterol, glucose, C-reactive
           protein, etc) and whether this is modulated by an individual's genotype.
