      The mian purpose of this study is to analysis the imaging changes in 3.0T MRI of lumbar
      small joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and muscle in hospital nurses first suffered
      with low back pain.

    <textblock>
      Low back pain is a common clinical disease seriously affects the quality of people's lives.
      And this disease takes up a large proportion in the crowd. Incipient lumbago is hard to
      diagnose and often hidden morbidity. If early  symptoms are ignored by patients, it will
      greatly influence the quality of life in the future. This study will use 3.0T MRI to
      distinguish the difference of lumbar small joints, intervertebral discs, ligaments and
      muscle between the normal and the pain.

      Firstly, we recruit nurses with low back pain in one group, with the normal as control. Then
      the subject will accept 3.0T MRI scanning at the same time. Before scanning we will
      determine the MRI sequence to make sure the imageis  are clear enough. At last, we will
      analysis the photos in the image processing workstation, reconstruct the anatomical
      structure in the scanning area. All of this is to find a possible reason or explanation in
      the occurrence of  incipient lumbago through the comparison of two group`s images.
