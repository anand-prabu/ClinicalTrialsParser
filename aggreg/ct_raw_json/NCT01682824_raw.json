To address this growing concern,\n      researchers at MD Anderson Children's Cancer Hospital and Texas Children's Cancer Center\n      have joined forces to learn more about how to design a program that would promote healthy\n      lifestyles among survivors of childhood cancer."

Only the adolescent and young\n      adult (AYA) survivors of CNS tumors eligible after screening will be invited to respond to\n      the survey.  Following the final screening, the eligible participants will be randomized to\n      Site A or Site B.\n\n      Each participant will complete the web-based questionnaire that has a total of 53 questions.\n       For site A, the order of the questions will be TFEQ-R18v2, multifactor screener, and\n      EQ-EMA.  For site B, the order of the questions will be EQ-EMA, multifactor screener, and\n      TFEQ-R18v2.  The 53 questions came from the original TFEQ-R18v2, the multifactor screener\n      used in the National Cancer Institute's Observing Protein and Energy Nutrition Study, and\n      the adapted TFEQ-R18v2 for use via EMA methodology.\n\n      Multifactor screener is a short assessment tool used to evaluate dietary intake of fruits,\n      vegetables, percentage of energy from fat, and fiber.\n\n      Eating Questionnaire-EMA (EQ-EMA) was adapted based on the original TFEQ-R18v2 for use via\n      EMA methodology.  The changes made were related to a change in verbiage to reflect our goal\n      of assessing a participant's current behavior before and after an eating episode."
