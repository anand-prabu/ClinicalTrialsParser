  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine the feasibility of conducting a randomized
      controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of an online, Emergency Department-initiated
      asthma management intervention designed to reduce asthma-related morbidity among urban
      teenagers aged 13-19 years with uncontrolled asthma. The study will examine issues around
      recruitment, participant compliance with the study protocol, Internet access, and attrition.
       Investigators will first develop a protocol for recruiting 13-19 year old patients with
      acute asthma into an ED-initiated pilot trial of an online asthma management program,
      describing recruitment and refusal rates.  Investigators will measure participant compliance
      with the pilot study protocol including 4 online sessions and a 6 month survey.
      Investigators will also measure compliance of the participants parents at baseline and a six
      month follow up.   Investigators will then use pilot study results to describe the
      intervention effect on selected outcomes including ED visits, asthma control as measured by
      Asthma Control Questionnaire, functional limitations, quality of life, and behavior change.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participating emergency departments include Henry Ford Main, Henry Ford Fairlane, and
      Detroit Medical Center Children's hospital.  Eligible teens will be 13-19 years of age.
      (Including 19 year olds in the the proposed sample means the data is comparable to age
      categories used by many federal agencies). Eligibility criteria include: a physician
      diagnosis of acute asthma at the ED visit and parent and teen written informed
      consent/assent. Eligibility criteria can be confirmed with the help of the ED nursing staff
      as some teens presenting with symptoms of acute asthma, may receive an asthma diagnosis for
      the first time in the ED. Using the investigator's data from the school-based trial of Puff
      City, investigators observed that 12.9% (20/155) of teens reporting an ED visit at baseline
      also reported no physician diagnosis. This is used as an approximation of the number of
      participants in the ED pilot that may be newly diagnosed. Teens previously enrolled in the
      school-based version of Puff City will not be eligible to participate in this pilot.
      Eligible teens are approached by a recruiter during down time in the ER (while waiting
      during receiving treatment or while waiting to be discharged).  A study recruiter will
      provide the teen with an enrollment packet that includes an informational brochure (SD 1), a
      consent (SD 2), and an assent form (SD 3).  The recruiter will go through these materials
      with the parents and teens and answer any questions they may have about the program. The
      recruited teens who enroll are randomized to either treatment or control.  Both groups will
      be asked to complete an online baseline questionnaire before leaving the ED.  An example of
      this questionnaire has been included with this application (SD 4).  Once the baseline
      questionnaire is finished, teens will then be completing 4 online sessions of web-based
      asthma education on their own time on a computer with Internet access.  Control group will
      receive commercial websites such as those sponsored by the American Lung Association; the
      American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology; the Asthma and Allergy Foundation, and
      others. Treatment group receives the 4 online, tailored educational sessions.  Teens will be
      encouraged to complete the 4 sessions within 90 days, with a minimum of 7 days between
      sessions to allow for behavior change. To regulate dosage, control participants receive a
      &quot;time expired&quot; message after 30 minutes of browsing; this time limit is commensurate with
      the estimated time needed to complete a tailored session.  Teens will also be asked to
      complete a 6-month follow-up survey (SD 5).Parents/Guardians of the enrolled teens will also
      be asked to complete a baseline questionnaire and a follow-up at 6 months (SD 6-7) in the
      form of a telephone interview with a trained interviewer.

      In YR1 investigators will develop the recruitment protocol, hire and train recruiters, and
      establish a study database. Investigators will get on the agenda of CHM ED staff meetings to
      orient clinic staff to the intervention, obtain input/feedback, discuss logistics, address
      concerns, and answer questions about the project. Prior to recruitment Investigators will
      develop signage about the study (as appropriate) for the ED. Recruitment will start in month
      six of YR1, with at least two practice runs of the protocol. In YR2, investigators will
      continue recruitment and begin 6 month follow-up surveys. Recruitment will end in the fall
      of YR2 leaving 6-8 months for completion of follow-up, analysis and write-up. At the end of
      YR1 and again at the end of YR2, investigators will conduct short, qualitative interviews
      with ED and research staff to ensure identification of issues, barriers, and obstacles to
      conducting a trial of an ED-initiated version of Puff City.
