Assess the comparative\n      effectiveness of lottery-based and direct payment financial incentives on weight loss and\n      maintenance; 4. The degree to which weight loss is maintained in the intervention groups\n      relative to usual care during the 6 months following cessation of the intervention will also\n      be determined.\n\n      During Phase I, incentives will be provided to some study participants (direct payment and\n      lottery arm) for the first 6 months and subjects will be followed for 6 more months to\n      examine effects following cessation of incentives."
