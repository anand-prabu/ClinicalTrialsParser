Adequate waiting periods will be used to\n      ensure that fraction reduction does not proceed prior to observing toxicity. The purpose of\n      the study will be either to determine the maximal fraction reduction possible until a dose\n      is reached where a dose-limiting toxicity occurs.  The initial dose and fractionation will\n      be 50 Gy in 15 fractions with the goal to reduce number of fractions to a dose of 42.5 Gy in\n      5 fractions.  The rationale for using 5 fractions is that it is tolerated in centrally\n      located lung tumors at a dose of 50 Gy in 5 fractions, and thus, is likely to be tolerated\n      in large calliber airways."
