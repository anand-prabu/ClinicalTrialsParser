Among the first, most consistent, and\n      broadly replicated of such findings in drug\u2010 (including cocaine) dependent individuals has\n      been the reduction in subcortical (striatal) D2/3 receptors as imaged, most commonly, by the\n      reversible, non\u2010selective, D2/3 receptor antagonist radiotracer, [11C]raclopride. Certain\n      dissociations on D2/3 availability by radioligand ([11C]raclopride vs. [11C]PHNO) and by\n      brain region (striatum vs. SN; terminal vs. somatodendritic, respectively) are poorly\n      understood in relationship to prior antagonist tracer results. In the current study the\n      investigators will use pharmacological interventions (AMPT and methylphenidate) with both\n      antagonist and agonist radiotracers to experimentally reconcile these discordant findings\n      and clarify potential mechanistic inter\u2010relationships."
