HIV\n      prevention interventions must focus on women at early points of entry into the criminal\n      justice system, when they are still in the community and at higher risk of engaging in\n      unsafe sex and drug behaviors. This study focuses on a population of drug-involved women who\n      have been arrested and given a court sanction, but are still living in the community."
