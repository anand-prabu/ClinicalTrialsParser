In fact, long-term\n      mortality was significantly increased with a hazards ratio of 1.30 in patients receiving 80%\n      oxygen, and this appeared to be statistically significant in patients undergoing cancer\n      surgery, but not in non-cancer patients.\n\n      At this point, no convincing mechanism explains the observed increased mortality after\n      hyperoxia, as the long-term pathophysiological effects of oxygen are not fully understood.\n\n      Primary hypothesis of this follow-up study of the PROXI trial: Use of 80% oxygen increase\n      the frequency of patients with a subsequent, new or recurrent, cancer."
