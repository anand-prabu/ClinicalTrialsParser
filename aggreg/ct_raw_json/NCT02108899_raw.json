This phenomenon is called\n      retrieval practice and is supported by an extensive research literature mostly carried out\n      in normal students. This paradigm begins to be used in cognitive remediation programs in\n      patients suffering from memory difficulties.\n\n      The objective of this study is to investigate whether retrieval practice is spared in\n      patients with schizophrenia.\n\n      If effective, this method could be used in cognitive remediation programs.\n\n      Since episodic memory difficulties are supposed to be secondary to deficits in the\n      initiation/elaboration of efficient encoding and retrieval strategies our hypothesis is that\n      retrieval practice is spared in schizophrenia."
