St. John's wort may interfere with the effectiveness of\n      chemotherapy. It is not yet known if chemotherapy is more effective with or without St.\n      John's Wort in treating solid tumors.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of docetaxel with or\n      without St. John's wort in treating patients who have solid tumors that cannot be removed by\n      surgery."

Patients who have not\n      been receiving chronic Hypericum perforatum (St. John's Wort) are assigned to group A, while\n      a cohort of 8 patients who have been receiving chronic Hypericum perforatum are assigned to\n      group B.\n\n        -  Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral placebo three times daily on days 1-14 and docetaxel IV\n           over 1 hour on day 15.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral Hypericum perforatum three times daily on days 1-14 and\n           docetaxel as in arm I.\n\n        -  Group B (non-randomized group): Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I and continue to\n           receive their chronic regimen of Hypericum perforatum except on day 15.\n\n      Treatment in both groups repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for new primaries and survival only.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 92 patients will be accrued for this study."
