The first test a semi-quantitative\n      panel test marketed under the brand name dBest (AmeriTek, Seattle WA, USA). This\n      urine-based, one-step kit has been used in two previous studies in Vietnam (12, 13).  The\n      second test is a locally available urine dipstick (Quickstick one-step hCG Pregnancy Test,\n      Phamatech, San Diego, CA, USA).\n\n        1. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 35% of the HSPT will correctly\n           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 14.\n\n        2. The investigators hypothesize that 99% of the SQPT and 25% of the HSPT will correctly\n           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 7.\n\n        3. The investigators hypothesize that 75% of the SQPT and 10% of the HSPT will correctly\n           identify ongoing pregnancy at day 4."
