  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OSA is a major chronic condition affecting the quality of life of millions of Americans. Per
      the Institute of Medicine new treatment adherence strategies are needed to help improve the
      quality of care, reduce social and economic costs, and help those with chronic conditions
      (such as OSA) live healthier and more productive lives through better management of their
      conditions. Using an mHealth tool to help deliver our Self-Management intervention and
      improve the frequency and quality of patient-provider communications is a central component
      of that discovery process.

      The objective of this proposal is to evaluate a new mobile health (mHealth) system for
      patients with Obstructive Sleep Apnea syndrome (OSA) that facilitates patient-centered,
      collaborative management for patients prescribed the first-line treatment, continuous
      positive airway pressure (CPAP). CPAP adherence rates are disappointingly low. The mHealth
      system proposed for use in the study is informed by our group's previous interventional
      efforts, including that of an interactive website intervention for OSA patients prescribed
      CPAP. Limitations of that intervention included use of an immobile desktop computer for
      website access and that it was not based on a previously evaluated protocol. The advantages
      to the proposed mHealth system are the use of a mobile device to allow for increased
      patient-provider communications and the incorporation of our Sleep Apnea Self-Management
      Program protocol. The evaluative aspect of this proposal is designed as a randomized,
      controlled clinical trial-Usual Care (control; UC); Self-Management Care (intervention 1;
      SM); Self-Management via mHealth (intervention 2; SM-Mobile). The key feature of the
      SM-Mobile intervention is the use of a mHealth tool that allows for the provision of the
      Self-Management Program through the utilization of audio/visual conferencing,
      self-monitoring, and treatment tracking with the patient remotely (i.e., in the non-clinic
      environment).

      CPAP adherence patterns are established very early in the treatment initialization process,
      but previous interventional efforts have only used increased telephone support to bridge
      this gap. The use of an mHealth tool to facilitate improved communications between patient
      and provider (audio plus visual) along with content sharing tools (e.g., videos, pictures)
      to overcome previous limitations and allow patients and providers to engage in more frequent
      &quot;productive interactions&quot; with each other. Further, our protocol is based on an
      individualized Self-Management intervention that is focused on helping patients become more
      informed about their OSA and its treatment, and to have a more active role in the treatment
      process. In particular, SM-Mobile helps with two key issues facing OSA patients: 1)
      troubleshooting of problems experienced early in treatment that often undermine the CPAP
      initialization process, and 2) discussion and recognition of treatment benefits to
      positively reinforce continued, sustained CPAP use. The overarching aim of the present
      project is to examine the effect of this patient-centered, collaborative care intervention
      on improving the quality of care, and increasing CPAP adherence to a clinically meaningful
      level. The central questions that encompass the conceptual and empirical contours of the
      study: Does the SM-Mobile intervention have an effect on the patient's experience of care,
      CPAP adherence, and OSA outcomes relative to Usual Care and Self-Management Care? To answer
      these research questions, and in the process address fundamental intervention efficacy and
      cost issues in telemedicine, the proposed randomized, controlled trial aims specifically to
      achieve the following goals:

      This project has the following specific aims:

      Aim 1: To examine the effect of the Self-Management Care delivered by mHealth (SM-Mobile)
      intervention compared to Usual Care (SM) and Self-Management Care (SM) on level of CPAP
      adherence. The hypothesis is that participants in SM-Mobile group will exhibit higher levels
      of CPAP adherence compared to the UC and SM groups over the 2-month intervention period.

      Aim 2: To examine the effect of the SM-Mobile intervention, compared to Usual Care and
      Self-Management Care, on the patient's experience of the quality of patient-centered,
      collaborative care (as measured by the Patient Assessment of Chronic Illness Care and the
      CAHPS Clinician &amp; Group Survey). The hypothesis is that participants in the SM-Mobile group
      will experience a greater improvement in patient-centered, collaborative care compared to
      the UC and SM groups over the 2-month follow-up period.

      Aim 3: To examine the effect of SM-Mobile, compared to UC and SM, on OSA apnea outcomes
      (e.g., OSA symptoms and OSA-specific health-related quality of life [HRQOL]). The hypothesis
      is that participants in the SM-Mobile group will experience greater improvements in
      self-reported OSA symptoms and HRQOL from baseline compared to the UC and SM over the
      2-month follow-up period.

      Aim 4: To perform a basic cost analysis of the SM-Mobile intervention compared to Usual
      Care, applying a micro-cost methodology of measuring the quantity of inputs used in the
      production of care and the unit cost of each. This will be a test against the null
      hypothesis of no significant cost differences between groups.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        The project will have a 4-year timeline. Patients and providers at both the VA Pulmonary
        Sleep Clinic will participate in this prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients will
        participate by completing written informed consent, agreeing to be randomized, completing
        a baseline assessment, participating in the study interventional protocol, and completing
        follow-up assessments up to one-year post-intervention. Our intent is to recruit a study
        population that is fairly representative of the overall VASDHS population of patients
        diagnosed with OSA. To this end, inclusion criteria are designed to be as inclusive as
        possible and are operationalized as follows:

          -  age &gt; 18 years;

          -  confirmed diagnosis of OSA;

          -  being newly prescribed CPAP therapy; and

          -  having chronic symptoms as noted on screening symptom checklist. OSA diagnosis by the
             Sleep Clinic has been and is currently consistent with published consensus
             statements49 that CPAP treatment is indicated when the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI,
             number of apneas + hypopneas per hour of sleep) is either (1) greater than or equal
             to 15, or (2) between 5 and 15 AND accompanied by documented sleep apnea symptoms,
             including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired cognition, mood disorders, insomnia,
             and documented cardiovascular diseases. Because mild OSA symptoms are at best
             modestly correlated with AHI, the research study will focus on patients with moderate
             to severe sleep apnea, and therefore inclusion criteria will require AHI &gt; 15.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria include cognitive impairment sufficient to cause inability to
             complete the protocol (MMSE &lt; 24/30);

          -  residence in a geographical area outside of San Diego County (which could make some
             necessary face-to-face contact difficult);

          -  fatal comorbidity (life expectancy less than 6 months as indicated by treating
             physician);

          -  significant documented substance/chemical abuse; or

          -  other participant circumstances that, in the opinion of a consensus of study team,
             would interfere with the safety of a prospective participant or their need for
             treatment (i.e., clinical needs of patient outweighs needs of research study). No
             exclusion criteria or any other study design elements will be used directly or
             indirectly to restrict study participation by women, members of minority groups, or
             primary language. Because men have a greater risk for OSA (and are identified and
             diagnosed at a greater rate) than women, we anticipate a final sample that reflects
             the OSA base rate differences on sex. Some minority groups are thought to have higher
             OSA prevalence rates than Caucasians, so assuming they are being screened/diagnosed
             at the same rates as Caucasians, we expect minority groups to be included in the
             study at levels that reflect those rates.
