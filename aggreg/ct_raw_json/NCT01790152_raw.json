Although adult studies have\n      shown that dexrazoxane (DRZ) is effective in minimizing cardiomyopathy/heart failure (CHF)\n      after anthracycline therapy, short and long-term data in children are much more limited.\n      Furthermore, concerns regarding DRZ's interaction with cancer therapies and possible\n      association with an increased risk of second cancers have limited its use among children\n      despite possible protection against premature CHF. To address these gaps in knowledge, using\n      a cross-sectional study design, we propose to ascertain echocardiographic and serum\n      biomarkers of cardiac injury in a cohort of long-term pediatric T-cell leukemia and Hodgkin\n      lymphoma survivors enrolled on 3 front-line Children's Oncology Group (COG) clinical trials\n      (POG 9404, 9425, 9426) between 1996-2001 that featured upfront DRZ randomization and a range\n      of anthracycline exposures commonly used in contemporary therapy (100-360 mg/m2\n      doxorubicin). Our primary aim will be to determine whether patients randomized to the\n      experimental DRZ arms have decreased markers of myocardial injury compared with patients\n      treated without DRZ. Specifically, this will include a one-time measurement of an\n      echocardiographic index of pathologic left ventricular (LV) remodeling (wall\n      thickness-dimension ratio), complemented by serum biomarkers and a physical examination for\n      signs and symptoms of CHF. We will also evaluate whether DRZ's cardioprotective effect is\n      modified by anthracycline dose, chest radiation, and selected demographic factors (age at\n      cancer diagnosis, current age, sex). In secondary analysis, we will also update the overall-\n      and event-free survival rates between patients on the DRZ and non-DRZ arms. Finally, we will\n      determine whether projected quality-adjusted life years differed by randomization status,\n      accounting for premature cardiac disease, primary disease relapse, and second cancers."
