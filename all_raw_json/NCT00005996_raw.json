SU5416 may stop the growth of solid tumors by stopping blood\n      flow to the tumor. Combining more than once chemotherapy drug with SU5416 may kill more\n      tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of SU5416 combined with gemcitabine and\n      cisplatin in treating patients who have advanced solid tumors."

Determine the\n      antitumor activity of this combination treatment regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, dose escalation study of SU5416. Patients receive\n      gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by cisplatin IV over 1 hour on day 1; SU5416 IV over\n      70 minutes on day 4; gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes followed by SU5416 IV over 70 minutes on\n      day 8, and SU5416 on days 11, 15, and 18. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Following 6 courses\n      of therapy, patients with stable and responsive disease may receive SU5416 alone on days 1,\n      4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 1 year. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of SU5416 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is reached. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which at least one third of the patients experience\n      dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, and then every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
