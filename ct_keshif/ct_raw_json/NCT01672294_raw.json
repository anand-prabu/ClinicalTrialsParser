In the first session, subjects will be asked to discuss\n      issues related to relationship life review.\n\n      In session two, participants will be asked to speak in more depth about issues such as\n      regret and forgiveness. In the final session, subjects will focus on legacy and celebration.\n      Caregivers in the second group (\"attention control\") will meet with a facilitator three\n      times for a period of forty-five minutes each and be asked to listen to a non-guided\n      relaxation CD or participate in a guided relaxation exercise.\n\n      Participants in both groups will receive pre and post-test measures administered by a\n      blinded interviewer. Outcome measures will be measures by the FACT-G, Quality of life scale,\n      FACIT-sp sub-scale, Anticipatory Grief Scale, Caregiver Reaction Assessment, the Qual-E\n      completion and preparation sub-scales, and patient days at home."
