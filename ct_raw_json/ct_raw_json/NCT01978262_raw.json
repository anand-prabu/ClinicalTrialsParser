The investigators also want to see if the timing of\n      vaccine administration has any effect on women's reproductive hormones.  The investigators\n      hypothesis is that influenza vaccine given right before ovulation may change the hormone\n      levels usually seen after ovulation."

The\n      women will be followed for one menstrual cycle to measure basal body temperature, estradiol,\n      progesterone, and cortisol, and then vaccinated with the seasonal inactivated influenza\n      vaccine prior to ovulation during a second month. At the investigator's discretion, or if\n      there is active circulation of influenza virus in Baltimore, the investigators will\n      vaccinate during the first menstrual cycle (prior to ovulation) and then follow for a second\n      menstrual cycle for comparison. After vaccination, they will be followed for cytokine and\n      chemokine responses as well as changes in the concentrations of steroid hormones. This study\n      will evaluate the effect of IIV) on inflammatory cytokines and hormonal responses before and\n      after ovulation. Each woman will have 11 visits in addition to a screening visit, and will\n      be followed for 2 complete menstrual cycles."
