Since intubation with subsequent\n      (prolonged) invasive mechanical ventilation is associated with considerable side effects\n      this new strategy has the potential to improve overall clinical outcome in this selected\n      patient group."

Blood flow range from 0.5 to 4.5 l/min and sweep gas flow between 1 and 10 l/min. At blood flows of 2 l/min and higher the device also oxygenates the patients blood. The diameter and length of cannulas and the sites of venous insertions are left to the decision of the treating physician. Cannulas are inserted in seldinger technique under sterile conditions. Function and patency of the extracorporeal circuit requires mild therapeutic anticoagulation.",
