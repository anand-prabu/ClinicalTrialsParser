  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary incontinence (UI) is a common disorder among older women that greatly affects
      quality of life. Emerging evidence from observational studies links vitamin D insufficiency
      with UI. Prior to a larger intervention trial of vitamin D among older women with low serum
      vitamin D levels and urgency UI, we propose a pilot study in 100 older women comparing
      weekly, oral vitamin D3 50,000 IU to placebo. We hypothesize that adequate vitamin D
      supplementation will improve UI symptoms in older women with vitamin D deficiency. Changes
      in UI-episodes will be assessed by a 7-day bladder diary and other validated symptom
      measures administered at baseline and after 12-weeks of intervention. Serum calcium and
      25(OH)D levels will be monitored. The expected outcomes will provide new knowledge regarding
      the impact of vitamin D supplementation on UI symptom improvement and inform a larger,
      randomized controlled clinical trial involving vitamin D supplementation.

        assessment and (2) not take these medications during the study's treatment and assessment
        period.

        absorption and metabolism; (3) Prior pelvic floor radiation; (4) Obstructive causes of
        UI;(6)Current use of medications known to affect vitamin D levels; (7) Uncontrolled
        diabetes (Hemoglobin A1C&gt;9%); (8) albumin corrected serum Calcium &gt; 11.0 mg/dL; (9)history
