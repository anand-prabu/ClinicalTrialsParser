The development of an\n      alternative ART regimen which lessens the risk of metabolic complications could improve\n      long-term adherence and reduce the risk of certain co-morbidities associated with long-term\n      ART use. If this new combination is found to be as efficacious as the standard regimen with\n      enhanced tolerability and improved metabolic effects, there is great potential for altering\n      the current practice of HIV medicine."
