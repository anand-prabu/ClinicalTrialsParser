      This is a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled,
      single-dose, 5-treatment, 5-period, 5-way crossover study in pediatric patients with
      persistent asthma. The primary purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy and safety
      of Albuterol Spiromax with that of ProAir HFA in pediatric asthma patients at 2 delivered
      dose levels equivalent to 90 mcg and 180 mcg of albuterol base.

    <textblock>
      The study consists of a screening visit (SV) followed by up to 16 days by a treatment period
      comprising 5 visits (TV1-TV5). The treatment period visits will each be separated by a
      washout period lasting 2-7 days. During each treatment period visit, the forced expiratory
      volume in 1 second (FEV1) will be determined at 30 minutes and again immediately prior to
      the commencement of study medication administration, and 5, 15, 30, 45, 60, 120, 180, 240,
      300, and 360 minutes after completion of study medication administration.

    <description>The percent predicted FEV1 (PPFEV1) area under the curve (AUC)0-6 will be calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule, and baseline adjustment will be made by subtracting the average of the 2 pre-dose PPFEV1 values from each post-dose PPFEV1 determination. If only 1 pre-dose FEV1 determination is available, that value will be taken as the baseline.</description>

             per protocol prior to the screening visit.
