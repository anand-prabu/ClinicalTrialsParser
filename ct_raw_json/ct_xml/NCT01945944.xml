  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children who need to be on a ventilator often have thick secretions/mucus in their lungs.
      These secretions can obstruct the breathing tube and their windpipe, which can worsen lung
      function and prolong the need for the ventilator.  Hypertonic saline is a medicine that is
      used to thin out secretions in patients with cystic fibrosis (and other conditions).  We
      hypothesize that having children on a ventilator inhale this medication will shorten the
      amount of time that they need to be on the ventilator.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent pediatric data shows that less than 80% of children mechanically ventilated for ≥ 96
      hours survived to PICU discharge, while 100% of children mechanically ventilated for &lt; 96
      hours survived to PICU discharge.  Interventions that decrease duration of mechanical
      ventilation may improve outcome by limiting ventilator-induced lung injury, sedative
      medication usage and ventilator-associated pneumonia.  Obstructive airway secretions may
      prolong mechanical ventilation by causing atelectasis and endotracheal tube obstruction,
      with resultant cardio-respiratory instability.  Nebulized hypertonic saline (HTS) is used to
      decrease mucus viscosity and increase mucociliary clearance in patients with diseases such
      as cystic fibrosis and bronchiolitis, and has been used to enhance airway clearance in
      mechanically ventilated children.  Administering nebulized HTS to mechanically ventilated
      children may facilitate airway clearance and shorten mechanical ventilation.

      In a randomized study of children &lt; 2 years old following cardiac surgery, patients given
      dornase, another mucolytic agent, had a significantly decreased duration of mechanical
      ventilation versus those given saline placebo (52 hrs vs. 82 hrs).  HTS may be even more
      effective, as mechanically ventilated newborns with persistent atelectasis had more
      improvement in radiographic findings and oxygen saturation when randomized to receive
      hypertonic saline compared to those randomized to receive dornase.  This may be because
      dornase may only be effective in patients with leukocytes or bacterial present in tracheal
      aspirates, while HTS may be effective in all ventilated patients.  Further study of the
      impact of prophylactic mucolytic therapy on the duration of mechanical ventilation in
      children is warranted.
