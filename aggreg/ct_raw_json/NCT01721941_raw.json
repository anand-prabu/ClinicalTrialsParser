HCC is the second leading cause of\n      worldwide cancer death and is generally incurable without liver transplant. TACE can convert\n      about 40% of these patients to transplant candidates.  Additionally, in non-transplant HCC\n      patients, TACE confers statistical improvements in overall survival.  Selective HCC arterial\n      catheterization during TACE allows for the delivery of concentrated drugs to the liver tumor\n      but the optimal TACE chemotherapy regimen has not yet been determined.  TH-302 is a hypoxia\n      inducible agent that can be activated in the hypoxic environment induced by TACE."

            "textblock": "Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) is the major modality utilized for tumor downstaging\n      for transplant and for local therapy in non-transplant patients.  This procedure allows\n      delivery of concentrated drugs to the tumor, followed by embolization that eliminates its\n      blood supply creating an environment of hypoxia. The process induces tumor ischemia, while\n      achieving a drug concentration in the tumor 10 to 25 times greater than can be achieved by\n      infusion.\n\n      A hypoxic microenvironment is a characteristic of many solid tumors including hepatocellular\n      cancer, further induced by TACE. The hypoxia-activated prodrug, TH-302, is designed to\n      selectively physiologically target the hypoxic microenvironment.  While doxorubicin and\n      cisplatin have been used as the drugs in TACE  among other agents, none have stood out as\n      the optimal agent in targeting HCC.   Because of the action of TH-302 in hypoxia, this agent\n      has a mechanistic advantage as a agent in TACE.\n\n      The current study is designed to assess the potential therapeutic benefit of adding TH-302\n      to the standard doxorubicin based TACE regimen in patients with advanced hepatocellular\n      carcinomas."
