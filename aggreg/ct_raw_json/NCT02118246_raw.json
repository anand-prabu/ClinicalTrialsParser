Trigger point of the vastus lateralis muscle  may\n      pull the patella superiorly and laterally, increasing compression of the patellofemoral\n      joint during physical activities, result in PFPS and anterior knee pain.

Spontaneous presence of the typical referred pain pattern and/or patient recognition\n             of the referred pain as familiar.\n\n        5- Pain of at least 30 mm on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm\n        (worst imaginable pain).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. had a history of  fracture of knee joint, dislocation of patella\n\n          2. previous knee or ankle surgery\n\n          3. had a history of neurologic condition\n\n          4. having physical  therapy within the past month before the study\n\n          5. pregnancy\n\n          6. taking anticoagulants (e.g. warfarin)\n\n          7. local infection"
