  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite substantial improvements of patients outcome in advanced RCC, durable and complete
      response is uncommon.  The majority of patients eventually develop resistance and exhibit
      disease progression.  Combining a PD-1 inhibitor, which has shown single-agent efficacy with
      axitinib may provide additional clinical benefit compared to axitinib alone.

    <description>Time in weeks from the first documentation of objective tumor response to objective tumor progression or death due to any cancer. Duration of tumor response was calculated as (the date of the first documentation of objective tumor progression or death due to cancer minus the date of the first CR or PR that was subsequently confirmed plus 1) divided by 7. DR was calculated for the subgroup of participants with a confirmed objective tumor response.</description>

    <description>Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial remission (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed remission are those with repeat bone marrow showing less than 5 percent (%) myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines and absolute values of the peripheral blood lasting at least 2 months. PR are those with all CR criteria except at least 50% decrease in the blasts over the pretreatment.</description>

    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.  Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling.  Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
