  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this investigation is to compare the clinical and radiographic outcomes of
      pulpotomies done using mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) dental cement and the root
      canal/zinc oxide and eugenol (RCT/ZOE) technique in primary maxillary incisors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary maxillary incisors are important in masticatory function, occlusal development,
      articulation and self-esteem.  Cariously exposed vital pulps of primary incisors require
      pulp treatment to avoid infection, pain and premature tooth loss.  Unfortunately, there is a
      paucity of investigations of maxillary incisor pulp treatment.

    <description>After complete removal of all caries, if a pulp exposure is detected the pulp chamber will be opened and vital coronal pulp to a depth of 2mm below free gingival margin will be removed. A solution of ferric sulfate will be applied to the amputated pulp surface and then flushed with water. MTA paste is then used to cover over the exposed amputated pulp surface.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  children with one or more carious primary maxillary incisors where removal of dental
             caries will likely to produce a vital pulp exposure

          -  reside in the GTA at time of inclusion

          -  English-speaking

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  clinical or radiographic evidence of pulp degeneration (such as internal/external
             root resorption and/or periapical bone destruction or swelling)

          -  radiographic evidence of physiological root resorption

          -  possibility of proper restoration of the tooth

          -  maxillary incisors present with an associated swelling
