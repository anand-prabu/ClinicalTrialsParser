This\n      may result in difficulty with feeling, speech, muscle strength or coordination, movement,\n      thinking, or other brain functions.  Having a stroke increases the risk of another stroke\n      occurring in the future.  Higher blood levels of a natural chemical known as homocysteine\n      may contribute to hardening of the arteries in the brain or heart and increase the risk of\n      stroke or heart attack.  Folic acid, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine), and vitamin B12\n      (cyanocobalamin) may lower blood levels of homocysteine and reduce the risk of having\n      another stroke or a heart attack."

Myocardial infarction (heart attack) as a complication of stroke adds to\n      stroke death and disability.  Because homocysteine may be a major contributor to stroke, its\n      reduction by appropriate intervention with vitamin supplements could reduce the impact of\n      recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction, and vascular death.  The purpose of this trial is\n      to determine whether a multivitamin containing high-dose folic acid, pyridoxine, and\n      cyanocobalamin, in addition to best medical/surgical management and risk factor\n      modification, reduces the recurrence of stroke or occurrence of myocardial infarction in\n      stroke patients with elevated homocysteine levels."
