            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the response rate and duration of response in patients with\n      AIDS-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma treated with gallium nitrate after failure on first-line\n      chemotherapy regimen. II. Determine the qualitative and quantitative toxic effects of this\n      regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic parameters of this regimen in\n      these patients, and determine if there is a correlation between those parameters and\n      response.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive gallium nitrate IV continuously on days 1-7. Courses repeat every\n      4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who achieve\n      complete remission (CR) receive 2 additional courses past CR. Patients who relapse after\n      achieving CR may be retreated in the absence of disease progression. Treatment for relapse\n      after a second CR is at the discretion of the principal investigator. Patients with\n      leptomeningeal disease at study entry must receive intrathecal (IT) methotrexate with IV\n      leucovorin calcium or IT cytarabine. Patients who develop leptomeningeal disease while on\n      study may continue treatment with gallium nitrate but must also receive IT methotrexate and\n      leucovorin calcium (with or without radiotherapy) or IT cytarabine. Patients are followed\n      for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
