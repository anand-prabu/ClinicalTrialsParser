      To investigate the safety and efficacy of long-term  treatment with pioglitazone (Actos

    <textblock>
      This is a special drug use surveillance with an observation period of 12 months designed to
      investigate the safety and efficacy of pioglitazone (Actos) in the routine clinical setting
      in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who responded inadequately to treatment with
      biguanides in addition to diet therapy and exercise therapy (planned sample size, 1000).

      The usual adult dosage is 15 to 30 mg of pioglitazone administered orally once daily before
      or after breakfast. Dose adjustment will be made according to gender, age, and symptoms with
      an upper limit of 45 mg.
