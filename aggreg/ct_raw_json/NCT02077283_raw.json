            "textblock": "NAFLD(non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is a common liver disease with a high\n      morbidity which seriously influence people's health. In clinical, there are two major\n      Traditional chinese medicine(TCM) patterns which are the pattern of \"liver depression and\n      spleen deficiency\" and pattern of \"damp-heat in the interior\", According to TCM patterns,\n      the treatment is effective, but not used worldwide. While the development of metabonomics\n      provides a tool to investigate the correlation of TCM patterns and metabonomics which will\n      promote the further development of TCM.\n\n      Currently researches on NAFLD patterns based on metabolomics were limited. Our study was\n      undertaken to investigate the correlation of TCM patterns and metabonomics, to evaluate the\n      application of urinary metabonomics in NAFLD: whether it can be used in TCM patterns\n      auxiliary classification of NAFLD. In addition, the investigators also aim to discover novel\n      biomarkers for the noninvasive early diagnosis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD).\n\n      In this study, urine samples from humans of three divided groups (healthy controls, the\n      group of \"liver depression and spleen deficiency\" pattern and group of \"damp-heat in the\n      interior pattern) were collected, then 4\u2103, 15 min 3000 rpm centrifuged and - 80\u2103\n      cryopreserved. The metabolic profile changes were analyzed by Gas Chromatograph-Mass\n      Spectrometer(GC/MS) with principal component analysis (PCA), partial least\n      squares-discriminate analysis (PLS-DA) and orthogonal partial least squares-discriminate\n      analysis (OPLS-DA). Furthermore, biochemical examination were also carried out to compare\n      among these three groups.\n\n      Base on literature survey, the investigators inferred that there should be metabolic\n      differences between the two patterns of NAFLD. If the investigators hypothesis is correct,\n      the investigators can find different metabolites which can be used discriminate between\n      NAFLD and healthy population, different patterns through urinary metabonomics.\n\n      The results will be attractive which mean a lot: it will prove the importance of the four\n      diagnosis methods of TCM used in differential analysis by metabonomics; it will validate the\n      classification of TCM syndromes is scientific; it will shed light in the study of TCM\n      syndromes; it will find biology markers to help diagnosis, treatment and pattern\n      discrimination."
