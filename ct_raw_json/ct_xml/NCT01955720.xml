             and = 32 kg/m2

          -  Male and female volunteers with mild renal impairment (CLcrd 60-90 (mL/min))  in
             relatively good health, age =45 and =80 years, BMI range: =18.5 and =32 kg/m2
             Moderate renal impaired (CLcrd =30 to &lt;60 mL/min according Cockcroft&amp;Gault formula in

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Any finding of the medical examination (including BP, PR and ECG) deviating from
             normal and of clinical relevance

          -  Any evidence of a clinically relevant concomitant disease (other than mild renal
             impairment in the respective group) A significant disease is defined as a disease
             which in the opinion of the investigator

          -  put the volunteer at risk because of participation in the study

          -  may influence the results of the study

          -  may influence the volunteerÂ¿s ability to participate in the study

          -  is not in a stable condition Diabetic, hypercholesterolemia or hypertensive subjects
             can be entered in this trial if the disease is not significant according to these
             criteria

          -  Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract (except appendectomy)

          -  Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy) or psychiatric disorders or
             neurological disorders

          -  History of relevant orthostatic hypotension, fainting spells or blackouts.

          -  Chronic or relevant acute infections

          -  History of relevant allergy/hypersensitivity (including allergy to drug or its
             excipients)
