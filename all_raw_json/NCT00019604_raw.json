To achieve a 1\n      cm margin of ablated tissue around each lesion, multiple ablation courses may be performed,\n      depending on the size of the lesions and the time required to complete the treatment.\n\n      Patients undergo magnetic resonance imaging with gadopentetate dimeglumine contrast, CT\n      scan, ultrasound, and positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 at baseline, 6\n      weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 weeks, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2\n      years or until evidence of recurrence.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 58 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years."
