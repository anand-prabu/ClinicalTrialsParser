    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of hydrocodone bitartrate
      extended-release tablets at doses of 30 to 90 mg every 12 hours compared with placebo in
      alleviating moderate to severe pain in patients with chronic low back pain. Patients may be
      opioid-na√Øve or opioid-experienced.

      The study will consist of a screening period of approximately 7 to 14 days (visit 1), an
      open-label titration period of up to 6 weeks (visit 2 [titration baseline] through visit 6),
      a double-blind treatment period of up to 12 weeks (visit 7 [day 0/baseline]; visits 8
      through 11 [weeks 1, 2, 4, and 8, respectively; a final on-treatment visit [if applicable);
      and a final study visit (visit 12/week 12 [or early termination]).

             study center for scheduled study visits, as specified in the protocol.

          -  The patient is 18 through 80 years of age at the time of screening.

          -  Women of childbearing potential (not surgically sterile or 2 years postmenopausal)

             method for the duration of the study and for 30 days after participation in the
             study, and have a negative pregnancy test at screening. - Acceptable methods of
             contraception include barrier method with spermicide, intrauterine device (IUD), or
             steroidal contraceptive (oral, transdermal, implanted, and injected) in conjunction
             with a barrier method. NOTE: A woman will be considered surgically sterile if she has
             had a tubal ligation, hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral

             chronic pain other than low back pain.

          -  The patient has radicular (nerve compression) pain or another type of purely
             neuropathic pain.
