After an acclimatization phase the stimulation is turned on for 20 minutes followed by 20 minutes of paused stimulation, 20 minutes of stimulation, and another 10 minutes paused stimulation. This intervention is repeated on four consecutive days. Needle electrodes stay fixed over the whole study period.\nTwo different stimulation schemes are tested, each being assessed twice in random order. Stimulation amplitudes are adjusted with respect to a distinct but comfortable sensation at the auricle.\nDuring the described protocol various biosignals are continuously recorded, including ECG, respiration, blood perfusion, oxygen saturation, transcutaneous oxygen tension, blood pressure and skin temperature."
