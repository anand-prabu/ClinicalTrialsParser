  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is common, it is expensive, and it is a chronic condition. Estimates put the
      prevalence of diabetes at almost 20 percent in VA patients and the prevalence of diabetes in
      the VA is higher among racial and ethnic minorities. Poorly controlled diabetes leads to a
      number of complications including cardiovascular disease, blindness, amputation, and end
      stage renal disease. Adherence to medication regimens (as well as lifestyle factors such as
      diet and exercise) is important to achieve diabetes care goals. Adherence to recommended
      care is related at least in part to effective communication in medical encounters. This
      project is designed to test a video intervention to improve patients' communication
      behaviors. Doctors will also receive a communication skills training program. The project
      will assess the impact of the training programs on communication and outcomes. The study is
      designed to help make patient care more patient-centered, which is one of the six aims for
      improvement in the IOM Report, Crossing the Quality Chasm and is a goal of VA transformation
      efforts.

      Background: Diabetes is estimated to affect up to 1 in 5 VA patients overall and up to 1 in
      4 racial/ethnic minority patients. Patients with low health literacy and minority groups
      have more difficulty communicating with physicians, report lower adherence to physicians'
      recommendations, and have higher rates of poor diabetes outcomes. Activating patients to use
      more effective communication with physicians' can lead to better adherence to treatment and
      to better biomedical outcomes. In this project we build upon our prior work from two HSRD
      funded pilot projects to improve doctor patient communication in patients with type 2
      diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In a previously funded short-term project, SHP-08-182, we
      conducted focus groups with patients with T2DM to elicit and understand from the patient
      perspective, barriers to communicating with their physician. This qualitative work was used
      in a subsequent pilot project, PPO-08-402 to refine and pilot test an educational video to
      encourage patients to use active participatory communication in their visits to physicians.
      This work was successfully completed and the product is a 10 minute video that in testing
      was found to be acceptable to patients and feasible for patients to view immediately
      preceding their medical encounter.

      Objectives: In this project we propose to test the effectiveness of the video as an
      intervention to improved patients' communication. Our primary aim is to conduct a randomized
      controlled trial of an intervention testing whether the intervention increases patients'
      active participatory communication behaviors, patients' post-visit ratings of self efficacy
      to communicate, medication adherence, and diabetic control (HgbA1c). There are four
      secondary aims which include assessments of the (1) mediators, and (2) moderators of the
      relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, (3) costs of the intervention, and
      (4) an evaluation of the feasibility of using the video for pre-visit preparation.

      Methods: We will conduct a two group, pre-post, randomized controlled, single-site trial of
      the intervention in patients with T2DM. We will recruit 156 patients and their physicians
      for a pre and post-intervention visit. Physicians will be trained with the agenda setting
      module from the Four Habits model. Patients will be randomized to view a 10 minute
      intervention or control video prior to their second visit. Visits will be audio recorded and
      analyzed for patients' and physicians' communication behaviors. Self-efficacy to communicate
      will be collected by self report. Adherence will be collected by self-report and by
      medication possession ratio. Diabetic control is collected by chart review. Analyses will
      evaluate the relationship of the intervention condition to outcomes, mediators and
      moderators of that relationship, and will estimate costs of the intervention and feasibility
      of using the video in a busy clinic.

      Impacts: VA transformation efforts including interprofessional Patient Aligned Care Teams
      (PACT) are focusing attention on patient-centered care. Improved communication is a central
      feature of patient centered care. Communication in medical interactions is critical and
      plays an important, but often overlooked role in health-care decision making and quality of
      care. Patients who have difficulty communicating are less involved in consultations with
      their physician, receive less information and support, and are less satisfied with their
      care. In turn, these patients may not understand their treatment options, may have less
      knowledge, less positive beliefs about treatment and less trust in physician, and may
      experience poorer health outcomes. Teaching patients to communicate more effectively is
      patient-centered because it inherently supports a patient-driven approach to delivering
      healthcare. Our intervention is designed to encourage patients' active communication.
      Improving patients' communication is a unique focus that may supplement and add to the VA
      efforts in areas such as the Patient Aligned Care Team. In addition, the methodology is not
      disease specific and may be a paradigm for improvement in other conditions.

    <description>Active Participatory Communication Behavior (collected at visits 1 and 2) is derived from the content of audio recordings of the physician-patient visits.
Active participatory communication behaviors include four essential elements:
telling a medical history;
asking questions,
