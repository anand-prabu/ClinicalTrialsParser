            "textblock": "The main aim of this study is to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical\n      activity in frail older people during hospital based rehabilitation is associated with\n      better mobility outcomes compared to usual care. A second aim is to investigate whether this\n      physical activity intervention is associated with improvements in health related quality of\n      life. Finally we plan to investigate whether increasing the amount of physical activity\n      during rehabilitation is cost effective, measured from a health system perspective, compared\n      with usual care.\n\n      Older people receiving inpatient rehabilitation will be randomly assigned to an intervention\n      group, who will receive extra physical activity on weekdays and weekends or a control group,\n      who will receive additional activities based on social interaction. The activity sessions\n      will be individualized to the particular participant. Both groups of people will be assessed\n      at baseline, discharge from hospital and at 6 months following discharge. The intervention\n      group will be provided with one or two extra sessions on weekdays and two extra sessions on\n      weekends for the duration of their rehabilitation stay. To account for the extra\n      physiotherapy time that the intervention group receives, the people in the control group\n      will spend the same amount of time performing other activities, such as cards, board games\n      or reading, whilst seated. To ensure the safety of the participants in this study, each\n      physical activity session will be supervised by either a physiotherapist or allied health\n      assistant.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: The primary hypothesis is that, compared with usual care, increasing the\n      amount of physical activity in frail older people during rehabilitation will lead to more\n      optimal mobility at discharge, as measured by gait speed.\n\n      Secondary hypotheses are that, compared with usual care, increasing the amount of physical\n      activity during rehabilitation will:\n\n      Hypothesis 2: lead to significantly greater improvements in mobility and function both at\n      discharge and six months following discharge.\n\n      Hypothesis 3: lead to better quality of life six months following hospital discharge,\n      measured using the EuroQol Health (EQ5D) Questionnaire and the EuroQol-Visual Analogue Scale\n      (EQ-VAS).\n\n      Hypothesis 4: be cost effective compared to usual care"
