            "textblock": "-  Background Context: no studies have been identified to analyse the effect of real time\n           feedback (using inertial sensors) on physiotherapy students learning the art of\n           posterior-anterior thoracic manipulation (PATM).\n\n        -  Purpose: to study the effect caused by real-time feedback on the learning process for\n           PATM, comparing two undergraduate physiotherapy student groups. Hypothesis: significant\n           differences will exist in the execution parameters of manipulation among students\n           receiving real-time feedback versus those who do not.\n\n        -  Study Design/Setting: longitudinal, pre-post intervention.\n\n        -  Patient Sample: Sixty-one undergraduate physiotherapy students were divided randomly\n           into two groups, G1 (n = 31) (group without feedback in real time) and G2 (n = 30)\n           (group with real-time feedback).\n\n        -  Outcome Measures: time, displacement and velocity and improvement (only between groups)\n           to reach maximum peak, to reach minimum peak from maximum peak, total manipulation\n           time.\n\n        -  Methods: two groups of physiotherapy students learned PATM, one using a traditional\n           method and the other using real-time feedback (inertial sensor). Measures were obtained\n           pre- and post-intervention. Intragroup pre- and post-intervention and intergroup\n           post-intervention scores were calculated. An analysis of the measures' stability was\n           developed through an ICC (1,2).\n\n        -  Results: the values of ICC ranged from 0.881 to 0.997. Statistically significant\n           differences were found in all variables analysed (intra- and inter-group) in favour of\n           G2.\n\n        -  Conclusions: the learning process for posterior-anterior thoracic manipulation is\n           facilitated when the student receives real-time feedback."
