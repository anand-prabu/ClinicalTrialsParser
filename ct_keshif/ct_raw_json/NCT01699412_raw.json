Patients were randomly assigned between two study groups: one group rinsed with a\n      solution of clobetasol propionate 0.05% associated to nystatin 100,000 UI/mL; and another\n      group rinsed with a solution of dexamethasone 0.1 mg/ml associated to nystatin 100,000\n      UI/mL. Patients were instructed to use the solution 3 times a day, during 1 minute, for 28\n      days. Clinical exams were performed at baseline and after 28 days. Patients were evaluated\n      by an oral medicine expert, previously calibrated for evaluation of oral cGVHD lesions. Oral\n      lesions of cGVHD were diagnosed according to NIH 2005 criteria, and graded according to the\n      modified oral mucositis rating scale. Evaluation of the symptoms of the oral mucosa and of\n      xerostomia were performed through visual analogue scale. Samples for fungal culture were\n      obtained  before and after the topical treatment. Results were submitted to a descriptive\n      analysis. Chi-square was used for the comparison of categorical variables. Mann-Whitney and\n      Wilcoxon tests were used for the comparison of measurable data inter and intra-groups,\n      respectively. Significance level was set at 5%."
