        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All inclusion criteria from the Essure Permanent Birth Control System Instructions
             for Use and/or the NovaSure Impedance Controlled Endometrial Ablation (EA) System
             Instructions for Use and Controller Operator's Manual will apply.

          -  Women experiencing menorrhagia due to benign causes

          -  Women who are relying on the Essure micro-inserts for permanent contraception

             Study)

          -  Women willing to accept the risk of pregnancy while relying on the Essure
             micro-inserts for prevention of pregnancy following a NovaSure ablation procedure for
             menorrhagia

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  All exclusion criteria from the Essure Permanent Birth Control System Instructions
             for Use and/or the NovaSure Impedance Controlled Endometrial Ablation System
             Instructions for Use and Controller Operator's Manual will apply.

          -  Women who previously underwent a fallopian tube sterilization procedure (other than
             Essure placement)

          -  Women who present with any other medical complaints, conditions or symptoms unrelated
             to the Essure System and/or subsequent NovaSure EA including, but not limited to:

               -  Gynecological co-morbidities (e.g., pelvic infection, cervicitis, undiagnosed
                  vaginal bleeding, endometrial cancer, myomas, and polyps)

               -  Reproductive tract anatomical variants and/or pathology which could make the
                  subject unsuitable for the Essure and/or NovaSure transcervical procedures

          -  Women currently wearing an intrauterine device
