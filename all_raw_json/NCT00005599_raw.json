Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of unacceptable toxicity\n      or disease progression.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, after courses 1 and 2, and then after every 2\n      courses thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 19-33 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
