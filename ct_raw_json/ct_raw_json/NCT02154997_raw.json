Pregnant woman tend to suffer from hyperemesis and this affects their food\n      choice.\n\n      Amongst pregnant women with Diabetes the glucose balance is extremely important during\n      pregnancy. Glucose balance is a result of correct nutrition and an exact amount of insulin.\n      This delicate balance requires from the pregnant women an ability to perform correct\n      carbohydrate count.\n\n      Hyperglycemia has already been proven to affect the fetus and the neonatal outcomes.\n      Hypoglycemia may also have a negative effect but the main danger is immediate harm to the\n      mother and therefore to the fetus. For those reasons glucose balance is crucial and demands\n      delicate synchronization of nutrition and insulin therapy."
