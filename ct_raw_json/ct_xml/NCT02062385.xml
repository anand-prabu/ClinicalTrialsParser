    <textblock>
      This study will assess the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a 3-dose regimen of
      RotaTeq™ (V260) in healthy Chinese infants. Approximately 4040 participants at least 6 weeks
      and up to 12 weeks of age at the time of the first vaccination with V260 or placebo will be
      enrolled and randomized (1:1) to receive either V260 or placebo. Participants will also
      receive the routine China Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) vaccines (oral poliovirus
      vaccine [OPV] and diphtheria, tetanus, and acellular pertussis vaccine [DTaP]) either
      staggered or concomitantly with V260 or placebo. All participants will be followed for
      efficacy and safety. Immune responses to OPV and DTaP will be evaluated in a subset of
      participants. The primary hypothesis of the study states that V260 will be efficacious in
      preventing any severity of rotavirus gastroenteritis as compared with placebo.
