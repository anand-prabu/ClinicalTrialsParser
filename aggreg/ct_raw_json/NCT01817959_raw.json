Among possible mechanisms CXCL8 could\n      play a crucial role in triggering the inflammatory reaction and might represent a relevant\n      therapeutic target to prevent early graft failure.\n\n      Preliminary data obtained in transplanted patients recruited in the ongoing pilot trial\n      coupled with the safety shown in human phase 1 and 2 studies provide a sound rationale for\n      further development of reparixin in islet transplantation and prompted the conduct of this\n      phase 3 clinical study aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of reparixin in preventing\n      graft dysfunction after islet transplantation in T1D patients.\n\n      At least 42 patients receiving pancreatic islet transplant will be involved. Patients may\n      receive up to 2 islet transplants, with the second transplant on average 6 months after the\n      first one.  Patients will be randomly (2:1) assigned to receive either reparixin or placebo\n      (control group).  The Investigational Products will be administered as an added on treatment\n      to the immunosuppressant regimen."
