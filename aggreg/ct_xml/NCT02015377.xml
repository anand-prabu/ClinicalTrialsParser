  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of FAME is to examine the metabolic and behavioral links between
      dietary intake and its subsequent effects on circulating appetite regulating hormones and
      physical activity levels in Hispanic and African American adolescents.

    <textblock>
      Our major unifying hypothesis is that diets comprised of high sugar, energy dense, low fiber
      meals, are associated with a post-prandial metabolic, hormonal and psychosocial profile that
      promotes overeating and sedentary behavior. Specific Aims: (1) Compare the effects of a HIGH
      SUGAR, LOW FIBER (HSLF) meal versus a LOW SUGAR, HIGH FIBER (LSHF) meal on insulin dynamics,
      selected gut peptides, mood and levels of physical activity in minority adolescents, (2)
      Explore the effects of HSLF versus LSHF meals on post-prandial ad libitum food intake, (3)
      Explore differences in reaction to HSLF versus LSHF meals in lean and overweight adolescents
      and (4) Examine ethnic differences in meal responses between Hispanic and African American
      children. Research Design and Methods: We will employ a cross-over design with a 3-4 week
      washout period where normal weight and overweight African American and Hispanic youth come
      to our Observation Lab in a fasting state and consume high sugar and low sugar meals at
      separate visits in random order. Meal consumption will be followed by five hours of
      intensive observation in which we quantify real-time physical activity in laboratory setting
      that was designed to offer equally attractive choices for active or sedentary behaviors.
      After 5 hours, participants will be offered food platters with an array of food types and be
      invited to eat ad libitum. Subsequent energy and nutrient intake will be quantified.
      Rationale: This study is prompted by three observations: (1) The disproportionate levels of
      obesity and risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in Hispanic and African
      American children; (2) The rapid decline in physical activity during puberty especially in
      Hispanic and African American adolescents, and (3) Children, and particularly minority
      children, tend to have diets high in added sugars and low in fiber. Thus, it is imperative
      to improve our understanding of the interrelationships between dietary intake, physical
      activity and risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease in minority youth,
      particularly during puberty, when physical activity levels significantly decline. Relevance
      to public health: This study will provide new information on the acute effects of meal
      composition on mood and subsequent choices of physical activity in normal weight, healthy
      overweight and insulin resistant overweight Hispanic and African American youth.
      Furthermore, we suggest that our findings may potentially lead to a better understanding the
      acute affects of poor nutritional choices on physical activity in minority adolescent
      populations at high risk for obesity, diabetes type 2, and other obesity-related diseases.

    <description>On the day of the meal visits, participants arrived at the Observation Lab on campus at approximately 7:00 am after a 10-hour overnight fast. Topical anesthetic (EMLA) will immediately be placed on likely forearm IV sites.  After every effort has been made to &quot;break the ice&quot; and develop rapport, a saline lock intravenous catheter was inserted and secured for stability in a forearm vein, not involving wrist or elbow joint in order to maximize motility during free activity. After a baseline blood draw (at -5 min), participants will be provided with a breakfast test meal. Blood is drawn every 30 minutes for 5 hours. The saline lock and blood draws were conducted by a trained and certified nurse.</description>
