The use of raloxifene and goserelin may be effective in\n      preventing breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized pilot study to study the effectiveness of combining raloxifene and\n      goserelin in preventing breast cancer in women who have a family history of breast cancer."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive goserelin subcutaneously once every month and oral raloxifene\n           daily for 6-12 months.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients are screened for breast cancer every 6 months. In both arms, patients\n           undergo annual mammograms.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\n      Patients are followed for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 150 patients (75 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
