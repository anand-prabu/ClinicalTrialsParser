        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subject hospitalized for complicated intra-abdominal infection

          2. At least 18 years of age (and not over 65 years of age for subjects in India)

          3. Evidence of a systemic inflammatory response

          4. Abdominal pain or flank pain (with or without rebound tenderness), or pain caused by
             cIAI that is referred to another anatomic area

          5. Able to provide informed consent

          6. If male: must agree to use an effective barrier method of contraception during the
             study and for 90 days following the last dose if sexually active with a female of

          7. If female, not pregnant or nursing or, if of childbearing potential: either will
             commit to use at least two medically accepted, effective methods of birth control
             (e.g., condom, oral contraceptive, indwelling intrauterine device, hormonal implant
             /patch, injections, approved cervical ring) during study drug dosing and for 90 days
             following last study drug dose or practicing sexual abstinence

        Exclusion Criteria:

          2. Renal failure

          3. Presence or possible signs of hepatic disease

             anti-retroviral therapy or with CD4 count &lt;300), AIDS, organ (bone marrow) transplant
             recipients, and hematological malignancy. Immunosuppressive therapy, including use of
             high-dose corticosteroids (e.g., &gt; 40 mg prednisone or equivalent per day for greater
             than 2 weeks)

          5. History of hypersensitivity reactions to tetracyclines, carbapenems, β-lactam
             antibiotics or to excipients contained in the study drug formulations

          6. Participation in any investigational drug or device study within 30 days prior to
             study entry

          8. Previously received eravacycline in a clinical trial

          9. Antibiotic-related exclusions:

               1. Receipt of effective antibacterial drug therapy for cIAI for a continuous
                  duration of &gt; 24-h during the 72-h preceding enrollment (however, subjects with
                  documented cIAI (i.e., known baseline pathogen) who have received at least 72-h
                  of antibiotic therapy and are considered treatment failures may be enrolled.
                  Treatment failure is defined as persistent fever and/or clinical symptoms; or
                  the development of a new intra-abdominal abscess after ≥ 72-h of antibiotic
                  therapy), or

               2. Receipt of ertapenem or any other carbapenem, or tigecycline for the current
                  infection or

               3. Need for concomitant systemic antimicrobial agents other than study drug

         10. Refusal of mechanical ventilation, dialysis or hemofiltration, cardioversion or any
             other resuscitative measures and drug/fluid therapy at time of consent

         11. Known or suspected inflammatory bowel disease or associated visceral abscess

         12. The anticipated need for systemic antibiotics for a duration of more than 14 days

         13. Systemic malignancy that required chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy or
             antineoplastic therapy within the previous 3 months or that is anticipated to begin
             prior to the TOC visit
