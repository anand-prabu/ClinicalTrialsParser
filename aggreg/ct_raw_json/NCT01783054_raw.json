However, candidates in this age group should be\n             thoroughly evaluated before enrollment in the study, to ensure they are fit to\n             receive chemotherapy, and to potentially undergo pancreaticoduodenectomy. In addition\n             to meeting all of the baseline patient selection criteria, clinical judgment on their\n             susceptibility to infection and expected stability of their performance status and\n             suitability to receive intensive chemotherapy cycles, should be paid special\n             attention to. Patients should not be enrolled in the study should there be any\n             hesitation on any of these considerations. Baseline criteria for all patients\n             enrolled on the study must be carefully evaluated and all criteria followed\n             appropriately."
