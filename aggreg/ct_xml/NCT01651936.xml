  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of MK-8457 in participants
      with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and an inadequate response or intolerance to
      anti-tumor necrosis factor α (anti-TNF-α) therapy. The primary hypothesis of this study is
      that among participants with active RA,  MK-8457 100 mg twice daily (BID) will be superior
      to placebo as measured by the change in Disease Activity Score 28 C-Reactive Protein
      (DAS28-CRP) after 12 weeks of treatment.

      This study consists of a 24-week base study in which participants will receive MK-8457 100
      mg twice daily or matching placebo, and a 76-week safety extension in which participants
      will receive MK-8457 100 mg twice daily.
