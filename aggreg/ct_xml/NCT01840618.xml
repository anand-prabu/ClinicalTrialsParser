  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common disease caused by hormonal
      imbalance and is also associated with overweight and obesity.  It affects 5-10% of
      adolescent girls and women capable of having children.  PCOS is associated with missed
      menstrual periods, hormonal imbalance, being overweight, and with a form of diabetes. Girls
      with PCOS may have a breathing problem known as &quot;sleep apnea.&quot; Sleep apnea may cause a
      person to stop breathing for short periods of time while sleeping. People with PCOS are
      thirty times more likely to develop sleep apnea than those who do not have PCOS. If sleep
      apnea is not treated, it may lead to daytime sleepiness, poor school performance, high blood
      pressure, heart disease and diabetes. The purpose of this study is to understand how insulin
      function is affected in presence of sleep apnea in girls with PCOS between 13-18 years of
      age as compared to girls with PCOS without sleep apnea. Insulin is one of the hormones made
      in your body to convert food into energy. In people with increase weight body cannot use
      insulin properly. The investigators also want to see if insulin action is also affected by
      sleep apnea.

    <description>We will initiate treatment of OSA with CPAP for 3 months in PCOS adolescents with moderate to severe OSA. Compliance will be defined as the average number of hours for which CPAP was used per night over the 12-wk treatment period. Adherence with CPAP will be defined as CPAP use â‰¥4 hours daily. The primary outcome variable will be insulin sensitivity measured as change in GIR. Changes in cardio metabolic variables after CPAP treatment will be expressed as a percentage of the corresponding baseline values.</description>
