            "textblock": "3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"ecstasy\") is widely used by young people for its\n      euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE).\n      5-HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is\n      involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA mediates the\n      reinforcing addiction-related effects of drugs of abuse but it is unclear whether DA\n      contributes to the acute effects of MDMA in humans. To determine the role of DA\n      transporter-mediated DA release in the acute response to MDMA in humans the investigators\n      test the effects of the DA transporter inhibitor bupropion on the physiological and\n      subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double-blind\n      placebo-controlled cross-over design with four experimental sessions. Bupropion or placebo\n      will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and\n      cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma\n      samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that bupropion reduces\n      the MDMA-induced increase in positive mood."
