If improvement then reaches a plateau, uridine (UR) and thymidine\n      (TDR) are added to the regimen.\n\n      Patients who receive no benefit after 8 weeks of ribose are treated with UR/TDR.  Patients\n      who improve after 8 weeks of this combination continue therapy.\n\n      Ribose is added to the treatment regimen for patients on UR/TDR at entry.  At maximal\n      improvement, TDR and UR are sequentially tapered."
