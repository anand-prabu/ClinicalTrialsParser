            "textblock": "Recent research suggests that BPD is a common, serious but treatable disorder with a better\n      than previously recognized prognosis. Despite these findings, many patients with BPD are not\n      given the borderline diagnosis by the mental health professionals treating them. It is also\n      true that many newly diagnosed borderline patients are not provided with up-to-date\n      information on the disorder even though psychoeducation has been found to be a useful form\n      of treatment for other serious psychiatric illnesses.\n\n      The investigators have conducted a preliminary randomized trial of psychoeducation for BPD\n      that found that those provided with immediate psychoeducation had a significantly greater\n      reduction in two core symptoms of BPD--general impulsivity and stormy relationships--than\n      those with delayed psychoeducation.\n\n      However, both instruction and assessment of change over time were conducted in person by\n      paraprofessionals. The importance of the current study is that it will allow the\n      investigators to develop and test the efficacy of an internet-based program of\n      psychoeducation for BPD that will be both cost efficient and easy to disseminate widely,\n      particularly to underserved populations."

            "textblock": "Clinical experience suggests that many people with borderline personality disorder (BPD) are\n      not told of their borderline diagnosis by those treating them. Clinical experience also\n      suggests that many people with newly diagnosed BPD are not provided with up-to-date\n      information on the disorder. These practices are unfortunate as the results of a\n      preliminary, randomized, controlled trial of psychoeducation for BPD conducted by the\n      investigators  suggest that informing patients about BPD soon after diagnostic disclosure\n      may be an effective form of early treatment for BPD as it significantly reduced the severity\n      of two of the core symptoms of borderline psychopathology\u2014general impulsivity and unstable\n      relationships.\n\n      This application proposes building on the PI's prior work in this area by developing a\n      web-based program for the education of those with BPD and the assessment of three key\n      outcomes; psychoeducation and assessment of outcome that had previously been provided by a\n      team of clinically experienced research assistants. Both of these initiatives would allow\n      for the widespread, cost-efficient dissemination of this early form of treatment for BPD\u2014a\n      form of treatment that has proven effective for other serious psychiatric illnesses.\n\n      The investigators first aim is to update our curriculum for teaching individuals with BPD\n      the latest information concerning the disorder. This information will be organized into\n      seven modules: introductory information (history of diagnosis, stigma associated with\n      disorder, and demographic characteristics associated with BPD), symptoms of BPD,\n      co-occurring disorders, etiology, longitudinal course, psychosocial treatments, and\n      psychotropic medications. Some modules will be divided into sub-modules. For example,\n      etiology will encompass childhood adversity, family history of psychiatric disorder,\n      temperament, genetics, and other biological findings.\n\n      The investigators second aim is to develop a website for teaching the most up-to-date\n      information about BPD and assessing three key outcomes: the severity of borderline\n      psychopathology, psychosocial impairment, and treatment utilization over time. These\n      outcomes will be assessed using self-report measures with proven psychometric properties.\n      Symptom severity will be accomplished through the internet-based administration of the\n      self-report version of the already widely used Zanarini Rating Scale for Borderline\n      Personality Disorder (ZAN-BPD)\u2014a dimensional measure of the nine Diagnostic and Statistical\n      Manual of Mental Disorders, fourth edition(DSM-IV) symptoms of BPD. The investigators will\n      also use the Borderline Evaluation of Severity over Time (BEST) developed by Pfohl and Blum\n      as a secondary measure of change in severity of borderline psychopathology. Two other\n      self-report measures will be used to assess psychosocial impairment (Sheehan Disability\n      Scale and Weissman's Social Adjustment Scale). The use of nine forms of psychiatric\n      treatment will be assessed using a self-report version of the treatment section of the\n      Background Information Schedule and its follow-up analog.\n\n      The investigators third aim is to conduct a small-scale randomized controlled trial of\n      psychoeducation for BPD using this set of web-based instructional and assessment tools. Half\n      of the 80 subjects will be randomized to the investigators web-based intervention, which\n      will occur a week after diagnostic disclosure, and half will not. The investigators plan to\n      assess symptom severity, psychosocial impairment, and treatment utilization each week for 12\n      weeks (as the investigators did in our prior study) using the web-based self-report measures\n      described above to determine its immediate effects. The investigators also plan to assess\n      these outcomes using these measures at six months, nine months, and 12 months after\n      randomization to determine if these effects are long lasting. The investigators hypothesize\n      that two of the nine symptoms of DSM-IV BPD will decline significantly more in the subjects\n      who receive psychoeducation than those who do not-general impulsivity and unstable\n      relationships. The investigators further hypothesize that those in the treatment group will\n      have more improved functioning in the social and vocational (but not family realm) than\n      those in the non-treatment group. Finally, the investigators hypothesize that those\n      receiving psychoeducation will be more likely to seek out ongoing psychiatric treatment and\n      less likely to use emergency psychiatric services, such as hospitalizations, than those who\n      do not receive psychoeducation concerning BPD.\n\n      If successful, the results of this trial would provide further evidence that psychoeducation\n      is a useful form of early treatment for BPD. These results would also suggest that our\n      web-based platform is an effective and cost efficient method for delivering such a program.\n      Finally, these results would pave the way for a large-scale, multi-site randomized\n      controlled trial of this web-based program in community settings."
