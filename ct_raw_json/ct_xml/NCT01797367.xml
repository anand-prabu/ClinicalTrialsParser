  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if starting anti-retroviral therapy (ART) above 500
      cluster-of-differentiation-4 (CD4)+ cells/milliliter (mL) ('early ART group') slows the rate
      of decrease in lung function over time compared to waiting to start ART until the CD4+ drops
      below 350 cells/mL ('deferred ART group').  Lung function normally declines with age, and
      both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and ART have been shown to case a decline
      in lung function as well.  Decline in lung function can be an early indicator of chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a significant cause of sickness and death in people
      with HIV.  In this study, lung function will be measured at baseline and every year
      thereafter by using a spirometer.

    <measure>Change from baseline in post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, then at annual visits for up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>FEV1 is measured by having the participant inhale a dose of bronchodilator (albuterol/salbutamol), wait 15 minutes, and then inhale maximally and exhale maximally and forcefully into a spirometer.  Participants do at least 3 trials of spirometry for each measurement, and up to 8, to obtain 3 usable measurements.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in respiratory health status using the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire for COPD (SGRQ-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, then at annual visits for up to 6 years</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SGRQ-C is a standardized, validated, self-administered questionnaire that measures respiratory health status and includes domains of respiratory symptoms, activity limitations, and psychosocial impact.  It will be given to participants to complete in their native language.  It contains 40 items and takes approximately 10-15 minutes to complete.</description>

          -  Age &gt;= 25 years

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  An episode of respiratory illness with 2 or more symptoms of cough, wheezing,
             breathlessness, or increase in sputum production within the 6 weeks before baseline
             spirometry.

          -  Use of asthma medications (bronchodilator, inhaled corticosteroid, leukotriene
             inhibitor, or theophylline) for 2 or more consecutive weeks within the 6 months
             before baseline spirometry.

             &gt;110 beats per minute, or a known serious or recurrent or uncontrolled cardiac
             condition (such as unstable coronary artery disease, decompensated heart failure, or
             recurrent tachyarrhythmias).
