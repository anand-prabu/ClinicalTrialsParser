Original design: To evaluate the\n      short-term effects of combined administration of zidovudine (AZT) and increasing doses of\n      recombinant interleukin-2 (aldesleukin; IL-2) in patients infected with HIV, who have\n      lymphadenopathy, but who are otherwise asymptomatic (no other symptoms). The first phase of\n      this clinical trial will establish maximum tolerated dose ( MTD ). How quickly the drugs get\n      into the blood and how long they remain there (pharmacokinetics) will also be studied at\n      each dose as well as the effect on HIV.\n\n      Since AZT has no effect on cells that contain inactive virus (latently infected cells) and\n      these cells may act as viral reservoirs, that a second agent that can destroy these infected\n      cells would be useful in combination with AZT. The different activities of AZT and IL-2, as\n      well as the non-overlapping nature of their mechanisms of action and toxicity, increase the\n      theoretical benefits of combining AZT, a drug which has clinically significant activity in\n      HIV-related disease but cannot eliminate infected cells, with IL-2, a drug which may enhance\n      anti-HIV immunity, destroy chronically infected cells, and allow immune recognition of\n      latently infected cells."

The IL-2 is administered by 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion according\n      to this schedule for 4 weeks. The first week of IL-2 treatment is on an inpatient basis and\n      the remaining 3 weeks are on an outpatient basis. Toxicity is monitored every week. Maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the maximum dose at which 3 out of 5 patients experience\n      Grade 3 or above toxicity during the course of IL-2 administration. A second cohort of five\n      patients will receive IV IL-2. If the MTD is not reached, five additional patients will\n      receive IV IL-2. All five patients in a given cohort must complete a full 4-week course of\n      IL-2 before subsequent patients are entered at the next higher dose level. After IV dosing\n      is completed at these three levels, additional 5-patient cohorts receive subcutaneous (SC)\n      IL-2 according to the same schedule. Each patient is restricted to one dosage group.\n      Patients are treated and followed for a total of 24 weeks. Patients receive ibuprofen for\n      fever and chills."
