    <textblock>
      This research is being done to compare two types of talk therapy to see which is most
      effective in helping school children with anxiety disorders. The investigators will compare
      usual care (UC) with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Both therapies will be administered
      by the school mental health counselors to see if they help children with anxiety disorders
      to feel less scared or worried.

    <textblock>
      This four year study involves a blocked randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing the
      effectiveness of school-based CBT to usual care (UC) for approximately 375 students ages
      7-17 diagnosed with an anxiety disorder. Randomization will occur at the school level and
      the investigators propose to conduct the study in approximately 46 schools (23 in CBT; 23
      UC). Evaluations will be conducted by study staff to measure treatment progress at the end
      of the 12-week treatment program, at a three month follows up, and at natural termination.
