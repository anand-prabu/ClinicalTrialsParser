  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is being done to find out whether combining two FDA approved drugs along with
      radiation therapy for the treatment of high risk localized prostate cancer is safe and well
      tolerated.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  this pilot study will assess the safety and tolerability of combining enzalutamide with
           an gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRH) and external beam radiation

        -  Correlative imaging and tissue biopsy analysis will be performed to assess the
           radiographic response to enzalutamide plus gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist
           (GnRH) therapy as well as intratumoral androgen signaling
