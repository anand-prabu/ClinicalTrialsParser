      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of three weekly intra-articular
      injections of SUPARTZ to three weekly intra-articular injections of Euflexxa for the relief
      of knee joint pain in subjects with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee as measured by the VAS
      (0-100 mm) Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) Pain
      subscale score Change from Baseline (CFB) over Weeks 3, 6, 12.

      Safety will be accessed by recording adverse events, concomitant medications, physical
      examinations, and vital signs.
