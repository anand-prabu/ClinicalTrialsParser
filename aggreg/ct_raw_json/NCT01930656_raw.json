            "textblock": "Background: The Taiwanese FRAX\u00ae (Fracture Risk Assessment Tool) calculator is available\n      online for clinical use. Our Taiwanese Osteoporosis Clinical Treatment Guidelines suggests\n      using the American high risk cut-points for considering treatment but also suggests deriving\n      domestic cut-points from cost-effective approach. Establishing cost-effective domestic\n      cut-points for policy suggestions coupled with mobile devices with wireless access would\n      potentially increase the usage of FRAX\u00ae tool.\n\n      Objectives: 1) Using literature review to establish cost-effectiveness FRAX\u00ae cut-points. 2)\n      To assess the effectiveness of mobile devices assisted FRAX\u00ae tool based osteoporosis\n      diagnostic and management model. 3) To provide FRAX\u00ae based reimbursement policy suggestions.\n\n      Methods: 1) Investigators will use FRAX\u00ae, cost-effectiveness and other key words to search\n      Pubmed and international osteoporosis guidelines to better understand the clinical\n      applications of FRAX\u00ae in other countries. Investigators will also search epidemiological\n      data for osteoporosis, facture, quality of life and cost to establish domestic\n      cost-effeteness, and translational approach FRAX\u00ae cut-points. 2) Three targeting populations\n      from National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) are selected for prospective study (Group A:\n      geriatric health exam clinics with American cut-points, group B: orthopedic clinics with\n      translational approach cut-points and group C: endocrine clinics with cost-effectiveness\n      cut-points,). A mobile device with app application coupled with the FRAX\u00ae tool is used by a\n      trained research assistant during clinic waiting periods to screen and enroll high risk (75\n      from each clinic) adults with informed consents. Participants are referred to geriatric\n      clinics for systemic osteoporosis diagnoses and managements. Percentage of participants that\n      meet the current NHI medication reimbursement regulation and percentage of self-pay\n      medications are calculated. Analysis is stratified by age and gender. 3) The impacts of 3\n      different cut-points on increment NHI reimbursement are estimated. An osteoporosis expert\n      group meeting is to be held for FRAX\u00ae based osteoporosis medication reimbursement\n      modifications to the NHI and the Department of Health.\n\n      Expected Outcomes: 1) To establish the mobile device assisted FRAX\u00ae based osteoporosis\n      screening and management model. 2) Base on the study results and expert consensus,\n      investigators will provide policy suggestions of FRAX\u00ae based reimbursement modifications."
