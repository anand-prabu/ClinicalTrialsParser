  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with diabetes can have nerve damage in their extremities (peripheral neuropathy), and
      this can lead them to being less able to maintain their balance when they are standing,
      walking or performing complex movement tasks in their day-to-day life. This results in them
      being more prone to falls, and consequent injuries. The purpose of this study is to
      determine whether providing strength and balance retraining (in the form of specific
      physical exercises or activities) can help people with diabetic peripheral neuropathy regain
      their ability to maintain their balance, increase their confidence in performing
      balance-based activities and improve their quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) comprise 16-24% of patients with
      diabetes mellitus in Singapore, and this is set to rise with the increasing prevalence of
      diabetes. DPN is also associated with the greatest reduction in health  related quality of
      life (HRQoL) among all diabetic complications, specifically PCS (Physical health Component
      Summary) and its sub-components, physical functioning and physical role. However, there is
      currently no intervention that targets individuals with DPN for improvements in HRQoL and
      functional status.

      The investigators hypothesise that a targeted intervention providing strength and balance
      training will improve HRQoL and functional status in patients with DPN, which will be
      sufficiently large relative to increases in cost to make the intervention cost-efficient.

      The specific aims of the study are to test the effectiveness of a structured strength and
      balance training intervention in 1) improving the physical health component summary (PCS)
      measure of health related quality of life, 2) functional status, and 3) assessing
      cost-utility of the intervention, in individuals with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN).

    <description>Subjects will be guided through 8 weeks (1 hour per week) of home-based strength and balance training sessions. During each session, a trainer will guide subjects to perform muscle strengthening, range of motion, static balance, dynamic balance and endurance exercises, after an initial warm up. They will also be given advice on continuing such training as well as daily walking for the rest of the week.</description>
