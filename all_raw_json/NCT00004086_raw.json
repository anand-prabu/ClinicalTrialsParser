Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor\n      to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of radiolabeled monoclonal antibody plus\n      combination chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who\n      have recurrent or B-cell cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose and dose limiting toxicity of yttrium Y\n      90 humanized anti-CD22 LL2 (Y90 MOAB hLL2) in combination with salvage chemotherapy and\n      autologous peripheral blood stem cell rescue in patients with recurrent or refractory B-cell\n      malignancies. II. Study the effect of chemotherapy on the uptake of Y90 MOAB hLL2 into tumor\n      sites and normal organs by pretherapy imaging using indium In 111 humanized LL2 and\n      intratherapy imaging. III. Determine the extent and duration of tumor response in patients\n      receiving this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of yttrium Y 90 humanized anti-CD22 monoclonal\n      antibody LL2 (Y90 MOAB hLL2). Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily for 5\n      days and undergo harvest of peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) on 2 or more consecutive\n      days. If an adequate number of CD34+ cells are not harvested, autologous bone marrow may be\n      used. Chemotherapy-induced mobilization with filgrastim allowed. Patients undergo pretherapy\n      imaging with indium In 111 humanized LL2 (In111 hLL2) for up to 40 minutes on day -7.\n      Patients receive Y90 MOAB hLL2 for up to 40 minutes on day 0 plus In111 hLL2, followed by\n      Y90 MOAB hLL2 alone on day 3. Patients receive ifosfamide IV over 1 hour, cisplatin IV over\n      2 hours, and cytarabine IV over 2 hours on days 1 and 4. Oral etoposide is given daily on\n      days 1-7. PBSC or bone marrow is reinfused on days 9-14, depending on MOAB clearance.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of Y90 MOAB hLL2 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed weekly for\n      2 months, monthly for 6 months, and then every 6 months for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 15-24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-2.5\n      years."
