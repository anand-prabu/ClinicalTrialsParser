  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are cells in the skin and blood of humans with chronic moderate to severe plaque
      psoriasis with specific activities that may determine the effectiveness of treatment.  These
      activities may be described by obtaining samples of skin and blood and analyzing them using
      a variety of tests.
