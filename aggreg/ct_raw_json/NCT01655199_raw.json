These new field tests are 3-min paced-walk test (3MPWT) and 3-min\n      paced step test (3MPST). If the validity and sensitivity of the TM3 could be highlighted,\n      particularly by the reduction of dyspnea level following bronchodilatation, Phase II\n      highlight that the 3MPST does not allow to detect this decrease of dyspnea after\n      bronchodilatation. The use of too high step rates could explain these results through a\n      hypothesis relative to neuromechanical coupling of dyspnea. The main objective of this trial\n      is to follow the investigations on the sensitivity of 3MPST to detect the effects of\n      pharmacological intervention on the exertional dyspnea in COPD patient. The hypothesis of\n      this work is that the use of lower step rates cadences could allow to detect an improvement\n      of exertional dyspnea following treatment-induced bronchodilatation, contrary to higher step\n      rates."

During the first visit, baseline pulmonary function\n      and maximal exercise capacity will be evaluated and the patients will be familiarized  with\n      step test proceedings. Between the different visits, a 3-7 days period will be respected.\n      During the second and the third visits, 4 step tests will be performed at 4 different rates,\n      following one of the two conditions (placebo or bronchodilatation). This project will\n      propose two randomization levels. The first randomization will be relative to the choice of\n      the condition used during the second visit (placebo ou bronchodilatation) and the second one\n      for the rates order (14, 16, 20, 24 steps/min). During each performed exercise,\n      cardiorespiratory and pulmonary parameters will be measured using a portable system."
