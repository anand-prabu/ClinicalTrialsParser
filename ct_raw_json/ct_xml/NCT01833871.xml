  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colour Doppler sonography has also been evaluated in differentiating adenomyosis from
      fibroids. Two dimensional color Doppler ultrasound revealed that 87% of adenomyosis cases
      had vessel distributions different from those found in leiomyoma cases, in addition to a
      high pulsatility index (PI) .Adenomyotic lesions had  randomly scattered vessels or
      intratumoral signals while leiomyomas usually had peripheral scattered or outer feeding
      vessels.

      Because it is more sensitive, less angle-dependent, and not susceptible to aliasing , power
      Doppler Sonography has the potential to detect fluctuations in blood flow , with results
      superior to those of frequency-based color Doppler sonography, particularly in situations of
      low-velocity blood flow. Three dimensional power Doppler ultrasonography can be applied to
      differentiate  between uterine adenomyosis and leiomyoma ,and it may reduce the number of
      false positives by detailed investigations.

    <description>The ultrasonographic examination will provide data related to lesion size, lesion volume, uterine artery doppler indices and vascular location (location), vascular index (VI), flow index (FI), and vascular-flow index (VFI). The region of interest will include the entire region of the uterine mass. The virtual organ computer aided analysis (VOCAL) software for the analysis of 3D power Doppler histograms will be used with computer algorithms to form indices of blood flow and vascularization. All data will be collected and compared with the post operative histopathology results.</description>
