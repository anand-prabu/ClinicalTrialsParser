    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, therapeutic exploratory
      clinical trial of branched chain amino acids (BCAA's) in the treatment of sports-related
      concussion. The aim of the study is to determine whether, compared to placebo treatment,
      administration of BCAA's, at one or more doses, after a sports-related concussion improves
      neurocognitive recovery at one or more time-periods post concussion.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Centers for Disease Control now estimates that 1.6 - 3.8 million sports related
      concussions occur each year in the United States. A large proportion of these athletes have
      enduring cognitive and neurobehavioral problems. Concussion is a heterogeneous insult to the
      brain that precipitates a complex pathophysiological process that can result in a cascade of
      deleterious side effects. At present, there are no proven therapies to mitigate or prevent
      the neurocognitive and neurobehavioral consequences of sports-related concussions. The
      limbic hippocampus, a brain structure crucial for learning and memory, is often damaged in
      concussion. In preclinical studies, analysis of hippocampi isolated from mice after
      traumatic brain injury demonstrated that only the concentrations of the three branched chain
      amino acids (valine, isoleucine, and leucine) were significantly altered (reduced) after
      injury. When these brain-injured animals received dietary supplementation with branched
      chain amino acids (BCAA's), the concentrations of these amino acids were restored in the
      injured hippocampus and the injured animals demonstrated significant cognitive improvement
      to levels comparable to those obtained in non-injured control animals.  In light of these
      results and the increasing awareness and morbidity associated with concussion, we are
      conducting a therapeutic exploratory clinical trial to determine the effects of BCAA's in
      reducing the neurocognitive side effects of sports-related concussion injury.
