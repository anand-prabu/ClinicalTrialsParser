      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the sequential infusion
      of allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), expanded &quot;in vitro&quot; with platelet lysate without
      addition of animal products in the treatment of patients undergoing allo-HSCT who developed
      one or more cytopenias.

    <description>The efficiency is measured by the recovery of cytopenia after administration of MSC (depending on the original cytopenia) and may be of two types:
Complete response:

Platelets&gt; 100.000 Million / L
Maintained at least 7 days
Partial response:
Hb&gt; 8 and &lt;10 g / dL
Neutrophils&gt; 1000 and &lt;1500 Million / L
Platelets&gt; 50000 and &lt;100.000 Million / L

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with hematologic malignancies who have been subjected to allo-HSCT and that
             are diagnosed with one or more peripheral cytopenias with complete chimerism in bone
             marrow (determined by molecular-STR-studies). They may include:

               1. Patients who have received as a source of cells MO or SP

               2. Patients who have received cells from a related donor or unrelated HLA-matched

               3. Patients transplanted with myeloablative or non-myeloablative conditioning

          -  Adequate cardiac function assessed from a clinical point of view by the researcher,
             with no history of ischemic heart disease (angina or myocardial infarction) in the
             previous 6 months.

          -  Adequate pulmonary function assessed clinically without evidence of severe
             obstructive or restrictive lung disease.

          -  Patients between 18 and 70 years

          -  Signed informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients whose haemopathy has not been controlled by the transplantation or is in
             progress at the time of treatment.

          -  Patients who do not have complete chimerism in bone marrow (performed within 28 days
             prior to baseline by molecular study -STR-).

          -  Patients with thrombotic microangiopathy.

          -  Patients with post-transplant cytopenias with toxic origin in relation to antiviral
             treatment (eg ganciclovir, valganciclovir) without concomitant graft against host
             disease.

          -  Patients with bacterial, viral or fungal infection that is not being controlled with
             proper treatment.

          -  Patients with a history of ischemic heart disease (angina or myocardial infarction)
             in the previous 6 months, and those considered by the investigator does not have
             adequate cardiac function, evaluated from a clinical point of view.

          -  Patients with poor lung function, evaluated clinically, according to the researcher.

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, are not on a good position to
             tolerate treatment.

          -  Patients who do not have the required donor.

          -  Women pregnant or at risk of pregnancy by contraceptive measures inadequate.

          -  Patients &lt;18 or &gt; 70 years.

          -  Patients who did not sign the informed consent.
