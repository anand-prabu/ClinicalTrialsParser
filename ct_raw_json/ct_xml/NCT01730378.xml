  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of PrepandrixTM in Korean
      subjects. A second group of subjects will receive FluarixTM vaccine as control.

    <textblock>
      Initially, 124 subjects were planned to be enrolled according to a 1:1 randomisation ratio.
      However, by mistake, the randomisation application was set up consistent with the vaccine
      supply ratio (2:1) rather than the treatment group randomization ratio (1:1). Subsequently,
      the protocol was amended to adjust the sample size and randomisation ratio for the study.

      The study will enrol 126 subjects randomised 2:1.  84 subjects will receive Prepandrix™ and
      42 subjects will receive Fluarix™.
