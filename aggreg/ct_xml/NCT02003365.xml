    <textblock>
      This study will be an open-label, single administration design, conducted in  patients with
      OA of the knee.

      Patients will be enrolled sequentially with 8 to 10 patients per Cohort as follows:

      Cohort A: FX006 40mg, Final Visit at Week 20 Cohort B: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 16
      Cohort C: FX006 10 mg, Final Visit at Week 12 Cohort D: FX006 40 mg, Final Visit at Week 12

      Each patient will be evaluated for up to 12, 16 or 20 weeks following a single
      intra-articular (IA) injection of FX006 at 10 mg or 40 mg, depending on the assigned Cohort.
       Following the screening visit, safety will be evaluated at three (3) out-patient visits and
      synovial fluid will be collected at Day 1 for baseline measurements and the Final Visit for
      drug concentration measurements.
