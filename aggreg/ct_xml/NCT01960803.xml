      The overall objective of this study is to determine the feasibility and tolerability of
      single dose Intraoperative Electron Radiation Treatment (&quot;IOERT&quot;) as definitive therapy when
      administered at the time of breast conserving surgery for patients with early stage breast
      cancer.

    <description>Intraoperative electron radiotherapy (IOERT) is delivered after completion of the lumpectomy and sentinel node procedure. IOERT is performed on a mobile self-shielded magnetron-driven X-band linear accelerator specifically developed for use in the operating room. This machine produces megavoltage electron beams of energy ranging between 4 and 12 MeV. The radiation is delivered from the device to the tumor bed through an attached applicator. A single dose of 21 Gy calculated to the 90% depth posterior to the tumor bed will be administered and will last approximately 2.5 minutes.</description>
