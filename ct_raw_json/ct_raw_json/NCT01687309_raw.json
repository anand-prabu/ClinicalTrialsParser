The effect of food and gender on\n      pharmacokinetics will also be investigated following single dosing.\n\n      The study is made up of 2 groups of healthy subjects. The first group consists of 6 female\n      subjects who will receive a single dose of 800mg GSK2586184 (study medication) during 2\n      seperate sessions. One session will involve the female subjects taking the study medication\n      with food and the other session will involve study medication being taken without food. The\n      safety and tolerability of the study medication in female subjects and the effect of food on\n      the pharmacokinetics of the study medication will be investigated.\n\n      The second group will consist of 12 healthy male subjects participating in 2 sessions. 8\n      subjects will receive study medication and 4 will receive placebo (dummy medication) during\n      the course of the study. Neither they or their study doctor will know which one they are\n      given. Each male subject will receive a single dose of study medication or placebo followed\n      by 13 days of twice daily dosing of study medication or placebo. Each dose will be taken\n      with food.The single dose results from this group of subjects will be compared to the female\n      group to investigate the effect of gender on pharmacokinetics. The safety and\n      pharmacokinetics of repeat dosing will be investigated. The effect of repeat dosing on\n      kidney function and the immune system will also be investigated.\n\n      The study will take place in the SGS Clinical Pharmacology Unit in Antwerp, Belgium.  A\n      pharmaceutical company, GlaxoSmithKline, is funding the study."
