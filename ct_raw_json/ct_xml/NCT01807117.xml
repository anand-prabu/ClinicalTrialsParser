      This pilot clinical trial studies positron emission tomography (PET)-magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI) and PET-computed tomography (CT) as diagnostic imaging in patients with colon
      and/or rectal cancer. New diagnostic imaging procedures, such as PET-MRI, may help find and
      diagnose rectal cancer or recurrence of colorectal cancer

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test the diagnostic performance of PET- MRI in the staging of preoperative high-grade
      rectal cancer patients, defined by T3 stage or higher or N1 stage or higher or presence of
      metastasis, that are referred to PET-CT and MRI.

      II. To test the diagnostic performance of PET-MRI the follow up of colorectal cancer
      patients that are referred to PET-CT with or without a diagnostic MRI request by their
      physicians.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To test different attenuation correction MR sequences and novel diagnostic MR sequences.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo fludeoxyglucose F 18 PET-CT and PET-MRI.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Either having a T3 (the cancer has grown through the muscularis propria and into the
             outermost layers of the colon or rectum but not through them) or higher, node
             positivity or metastatic lesion in the context of rectal cancer or being studied for
             colorectal cancer follow up, independent of the renal function

          -  PET-CT should be requested by a referring physician; in the case of having an MR
             requested as well, it will be reported from the MRI images generated in the PET-MRI

          -  Stable physical medical conditions to undergo a MRI

          -  Informed consent must be given and signed prior to study enrollment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refuse to give and/or sign the informed consent

          -  Subjects who have a metallic prostheses either in the pelvis or in the abdomen that

          -  Subjects who suffer from claustrophobia

          -  Pregnant women
