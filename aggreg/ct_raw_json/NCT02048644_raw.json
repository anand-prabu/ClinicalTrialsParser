            "textblock": "The investigator has recently studied markers of platelet activation in idiopathic pulmonary\n      fibrosis (IPF) and found that in IPF patients there is a significantly increased platelet\n      reactivity when compared with controls which is demonstrated by a concentration dependent\n      increase in platelet-monocyte complex formation, platelet P-selectin expression and platelet\n      fibrinogen binding in the presence of` the platelet agonists Adenosine diphosphate and\n      L-\u200bThreonyl-\u200bL-\u200bphenylalanyl-\u200bL-\u200bleucyl-\u200bL-\u200bleucyl- L-argininamide (TFLLR).\n\n      During platelet activation the platelets degranulate releasing numerous profibrotic\n      cytokines including Transforming growth factor beta  and Platelet derived growth factor that\n      are recognised to be important in the pathogenesis of IPF. It is therefore plausible that\n      the observed increased platelet reactivity in IPF contributes to the fibrotic process\n      through local activation and degranulation with release of proinflammatory and profibrotic\n      mediators within the pulmonary circulation.\n\n      There is evidence that corticosteroid treatment may alter platelet adhesion, in a study of\n      spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) increased circulating glucocorticoid, suppressed\n      p-selectin expression.   p selectin is a transmembrane protein present in the \u03b1 granules of\n      platelets. P selectin has a crucial role in platelet aggregation and platelet-leukocyte\n      interactions, which are both potentially important mechanisms in the initiation and/or\n      progression of tissue injury and development of thrombosis.  In a study of patients with\n      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation these were treated with either \u03b2\n      agonists alone or \u03b2 agonist and 40mg prednisolone and compared with a control group.  At\n      presentation the COPD patients had higher pulmonary artery pressure (PAP)  higher p selectin\n      and fibrinogen levels but lower Antithrombin III levels (AT III).  The pulmonary artery\n      pressure and fibrinogen levels were found to be significantly decreased in the steroid\n      treated group whilst the p-selectin levels further increased in the non steroidal therapy\n      patients.\n\n      Rationale for the Current Study\n\n      There is a significant unmet medical need for the treatment of IPF; the only medication\n      approved for treatment of IPF in the United Kingdom (UK) is Pirfenidone and outside the UK\n      there is none. The main goal of the current study is to evaluate the effect of Fostair on\n      the biomarkers of platelet activation in IPF disease which the investigator believes play a\n      pivotal role in the pathogenesis of IPF and whether this translates in to a clinically\n      beneficial effect of Fostair on IPF disease."
