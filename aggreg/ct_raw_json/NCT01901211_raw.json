            "textblock": "As children with cerebral palsy (CP) become teenagers, they experience a decrease in their\n      physical function and mobility. Decreased mobility leads to increased social isolation for\n      the teens and impacts negatively on their quality of life. This loss of function is\n      multifactorial, but poor physical fitness and muscle weakness secondary to disuse are\n      significant contributors. Exercise video games are a novel approach to engage youth in\n      physical exercise and social interaction with their peers. The objective of this study is to\n      evaluate  the impact of an exercise video gaming intervention to improve physical fitness\n      and social wellbeing. Our over-arching research questions are whether \"exergames\" can\n      provide health benefits (improved physical fitness) and improved social wellbeing in youth\n      with CP."

In addition, the effect of the exergaming intervention on overall\n      health-related quality of life (HRQL), self-esteem and motor participation will also be\n      measured. Finally, the effectiveness of a technique for balancing performance in multiplayer\n      exergames will be evaluated.
