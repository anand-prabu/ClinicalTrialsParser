    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety of increasing doses of a potential vaccine
      against Campylobacter with and without Alhydrogel®, an aluminum hydroxide adjuvant. This
      study will also assess immune responses induced by the vaccine.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, dose-escalating study in which a total of 48 healthy volunteers will
      receive 2 vaccinations (one on Day 0 and one on Day 28 ± 2 days).

      There are 3 cohorts (dose levels) with 2 groups of 8 volunteers in each cohort. A cohort
      will be administered one of 3 intramuscular (IM) doses at 2 μg, 5 μg, or 10 μg of
      Capsule-Conjugate Campylobacter Vaccine (CJCV1) with or without Alhydrogel®, aluminum
      hydroxide adjuvant (alum) at 125 μg.

      An interval no less than 1 week will separate the last dose of a volunteer group from the
      first dose of the next volunteer group (receiving different CJCV1 doses). Blood specimens
      will be collected at intervals to examine systemic and mucosal antigen-specific immune
      responses. Vaccine safety will be actively monitored during vaccination and for 28 days (± 2
      days) following the second vaccination and complete the study with a telephone follow-up
      approximately 6 months (± 1 month) after the first vaccination. The total duration of
      participation in this study is up to 270 days (including screening).

    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Vaccine safety will be assessed by evaluating post-vaccination local and systemic reactions through targeted physical exams, symptom surveys, and other adverse event (AE) monitoring. All subjects will be observed in the clinic for at least 30 minutes after receipt of the investigational product. Approximately 48 hours after vaccination, subjects will return to the Clinical Trials Center for observation and reporting of any local and/or systemic AEs. Seven days after vaccine administration, subjects will return to the Clinical Trials Center to review their memory aids with study personnel and to report any AEs. In addition to planned visits, if a subject experiences any unanticipated AE, the subject will be seen by one of the study investigators. All AEs will be coded for onset date, duration, severity, and potential relationship to the investigational product.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The antibody titer assigned to each sample will represent the geometric mean of duplicate tests performed on 2 different days. Reciprocal endpoint titers &lt; 5 will be assigned a value of 2.5 for computational purposes. Seroconversion will be defined as a &gt; fourfold increase in endpoint titer between pre- and post-vaccination samples and post-vaccination reciprocal titer &gt; 10.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>A positive immunoglobulin A (IgA)-ASC response will be defined as a &gt; twofold increase over the baseline value of the ASCs per 10^6 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). A subject will be considered a responder if the post-vaccination value is greater than 2.0 per 10^6 PBMCs. Blood samples will also be utilized to explore in vitro production of interferon (IFN)-(gamma).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy adult, male or female, age 18 to 50 years (inclusive) at the time of
             enrollment.

          -  Completion and review of comprehension test (achieved 70% accuracy).

          -  Signed informed consent document.

          -  Available for the required follow-up period and scheduled clinic visits and telephone
             follow-up.

          -  Women:  Negative pregnancy test with understanding (through informed consent) to not
             become pregnant during the study or within three months after the last vaccine dose
             (Day 28). Sexually active females, unless surgically sterile or at least one year
             postmenopausal, must have used an effective method of avoiding pregnancy (including
             oral or implanted contraceptives, intrauterine device (IUD), female condom, diaphragm
             with spermicide, cervical cap, abstinence, use of a condom by the sexual partner, or
             sterile sexual partner) prior to dosing of study vaccine. Female subjects unable to
             bear children must have a note from a primary care provider or obstetrics and
             gynaecology (OB/GYN) as proof of documentation (eg, tubal ligation or hysterectomy).
             If a volunteer becomes pregnant during the study, the PI will notify the study
             monitor, the sponsor, and the local institutional review board (IRB). The volunteer
             will be asked to provide serial follow-ups, including copies of clinic visits on the
             status of her pregnancy as well as health information on her infant following
             delivery.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Health problems, for example, chronic medical conditions such as psychiatric
             conditions, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, or any other condition requiring daily
             therapy that would place a subject at increased risk of AEs. Study clinicians, in
             consultation with the PI, will use clinical judgment on a case-by-case basis to
             assess safety risks under this criterion. The PI will consult with the research
             monitor as appropriate.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on physical examination.

          -  Use of immunosuppressive medications, such as corticosteroids and chemotherapy,
             during the course of the study or immunosuppressive illness, including IgA deficiency
             (defined by serum IgA below level of detection).

          -  Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant during the study period plus 3
             months beyond the last vaccine dose and currently nursing women.

          -  Participation in research involving another investigational product 30 days before
             the planned date of first vaccination or anytime through the last study safety visit.

          -  Positive blood test for HBsAg, anti-hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody, HIV-1.

          -  Clinically significant abnormalities on basic laboratory screening.

          -  Presence of significant unexplained laboratory abnormalities that, in the opinion of
             the PI, may potentially confound the analysis of the study results.

          -  Regular use (weekly or more often) of anti-diarrheal, anti-constipation, or antacid
             therapy.

          -  Abnormal bowel habits as defined by fewer than 3 stools per week or more than 3

          -  Personal or family history of an inflammatory arthritis.

          -  Personal history of irritable bowel syndrome.

          -  Positive blood test for Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA)-B27.

          -  History of allergy to any vaccine.

          -  History of allergy to alum.

          -  History of travelers' diarrhea or residence (&gt; 2 months) in the past 3 years in a
             country with potentially higher Campylobacter rates to include Africa, South America,
             Central America, and Asia (except Japan).

          -  Occupation involving handling of Campylobacter bacteria or vaccine products currently
             or in the past 3 years.
