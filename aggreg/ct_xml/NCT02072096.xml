    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to compare the benefits and risks associated with the use
      of 2 treatment strategies to lower blood sugar in participants aged 65 and older with T2DM.
      One strategy is based on the use of oral and injectable medications that only reduce blood
      sugar (glucose) when it is high.  The other strategy is based on non-glucose dependent
      agents.  The trial will last up to 72 weeks for each participant.

             (mL/min/1.73 m^2) or advance renal disease including history of renal transplantation
             or currently receiving renal dialysis

          -  Have obvious clinical signs or symptoms or laboratory evidence of liver disease
             (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] or aspartate aminotransferase [AST] &gt; 2.5 times the
