    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety and efficacy of a noninvasive cortical
      electrostimulation therapy known as &quot;Reduced Impedance Noninvasive Cortical
      Electrostimulation&quot; (RINCE) in the management of fibromyalgia. Patients who meet the 1990
      American College of Rheumatology criteria for fibromyalgia will receive up to 24 RINCE
      treatments delivered by a medical device called &quot;NeuroPoint&quot;. Approximately 45 fibromyalgia
      patients will be randomized into one of three study groups. One of these groups will receive
      sham treatment, meaning they will receive no treatment at all, while the remaining two
      groups will receive different amounts of RINCE therapy. The study's primary outcome measure
      will be the patient's change from baseline in self-reported 24-hour average pain intensity.
      The study's hypothesis is that there will be a difference between treatment groups in
      primary outcome measure.

          -  Patients must have a 24-hour recall pain intensity score at both the screening and

             hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or tubal ligation) or greater than one
             year post-menopausal, defined as a complete cessation of menstruation for at least

             suicidal ideation within preceding 6 months; or any history of bipolar disorder,
             schizophrenia, schizoaffective or other psychotic disorder).

          -  Patient has a score of 2 or 3 on item 9 of the BDI, or, based on the investigator's
             judgment, the patient is at risk of suicidal ideation or behavior.

          -  Patient is currently using prohibited medications or treatments (see Prohibited
             Concomitant Therapy section of protocol) including FDA-approved fibromyalgia

             skin cancer).

          -  Patient has any other chronic pain condition other than fibromyalgia that, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would interfere with the assessment of fibromyalgia (e.g.,

             her life except pediatric febrile seizures.

          -  Female patient who is pregnant, planning a pregnancy, or breastfeeding.

          -  Patient has any other disease or medical condition that, in the opinion of the
             investigator, would interfere with the evaluation of study device efficacy or safety,
             or would compromise the patient's ability to participate in or complete the study.

          -  Patient has a history of other cranial electrical stimulation device use, or
             electroconvulsive therapy.

          -  Patient has any metal implant, such as stents, aneurysm clips, shunts, pacemakers,

             of the medical monitor, would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the
             study.

          -  Patient is a staff member or relative of a staff member at either the investigative
