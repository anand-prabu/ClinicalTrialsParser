II.\n      Evaluate the efficacy of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive interleukin-12 gene by intratumoral\n      injection twice during week 1 and once weekly during weeks 2-7 in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 28-34 patients will be accrued for this study."
