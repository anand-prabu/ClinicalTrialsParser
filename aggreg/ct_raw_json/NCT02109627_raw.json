Exception for patients with\n             hepatitis B on antivirals and low viral load, to be determined at the discretion of\n             the investigator.\n\n          -  Uncontrolled infection\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness or psychiatric illness/social situations that would\n             limit compliance with study requirements\n\n          -  Active second malignancy that in the opinion of the PI may interfere with or be\n             adversely affected by this treatment.\n\n          -  Prior exposure to the investigational agent or anti-c-Met, anti-HGF or anti-VEGF\n             directed therapy within six months prior to study entry\n\n          -  Prior grade 4 toxicity attributed to cytarabine\n\n          -  Known or suspected drug sensitivity to cytarabine or the investigational agent\n             ficlatuzumab\n\n          -  Inability to provide consent\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effect of ficlatuzumab on the\n             developing fetus remains unknown and that cytarabine is a pregnancy risk category D\n             drug with known teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because of the potential\n             adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with\n             ficlatuzumab and cytarabine, breastfeeding should be discontinued while on study.\n             Patients who become pregnant while on study will be removed from the study once the\n             pregnancy is confirmed."
