  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In April 2011, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the oral drug
      abiraterone acetate (Zytiga ®) in combination with prednisone (a steroid) to treat patients
      with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have received prior docetaxel
      (chemotherapy). In December 2012, the FDA approved Zytiga ® in combination with prednisone
      to treat patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer who have not received
      prior chemotherapy. Degarelix (Firmagon ®), a testosterone lowering agent given as a monthly
      injection, is FDA approved for the treatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer. The
      purpose of this study is to evaluate abiraterone acetate and prednisone in combination with
      degarelix as a possible treatment for PSA recurrent prostate cancer as compared to
      abiraterone acetate alone and degarelix alone. This will be the first time these drugs will
      be used together.
