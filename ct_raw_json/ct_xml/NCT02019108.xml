  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is a costly health condition affecting more than 10% of Canadian
      adults. Excessive and unbalanced loads passing through the knee joint have been implicated
      in the progression of OA. Typical conservative treatment of OA has focused on increasing
      daily activity, without consideration for the underlying joint loading. This study aims to
      compare a 4-month walking program that aims to increase the angle of the foot (toe-out
      angle) during walking - a measure shown to reduce joint loading and OA disease progression -
      while increasing walking time/distance, with a standard walking program that aims to
      increase walking time/distance. It is predicted that the walking program focusing on
      increasing toe-out will provide greater reductions in self-reported knee pain and a greater
      reduction in unfavorable knee joint loading.

    <description>Average pain over the previous week will be assessed using an 11-point numerical rating scale (0 = no pain; 10 = maximum pain). Lower-limb impairments will also be measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC). The WOMAC is a 24-item self-report questionnaire that is a valid, reliable, and responsive disease-specific self-report instrument and has been used in many knee OA studies.</description>

    <description>Participants will undergo a gait analysis, where 10-15 trials of walking will be collected. Participants will walk in bare feet and at their own, self-selected speed while analyzed using three-dimensional motion analysis. Kinematic (joint angle) and kinetic (joint loading) data will be collected synchronously using high-speed digital cameras and floor-mounted force platforms. A total of 5 &quot;acceptable&quot; (clean force platform strikes and no observable deviation in walking characteristics) will be analyzed, and the peak knee adduction moment (an indicator of knee joint load) from these 5 trials will be calculated and averaged. Joint contact forces will be calculated using a validated musculoskeletal model that integrates motion and muscle activation data developed by a study collaborator at Melbourne University.</description>

    <description>Participants will complete 4 months of a home-based progressive walking program with toe-out gait modification aimed at improving physical activity level. This group will perform continuous treadmill walking during regular sessions with a study therapist and will be instructed to perform a toe-out gait, with the aid of a mirror during walking.  Focus will also be on increasing the time and distance of walking. These goals will be emphasized for the home-based portion of the intervention as well.</description>

    <description>Participants in this study group will perform continuous treadmill walking for a minimum of 30 minutes at each session, but the emphasis will be to increase toe-out angle by 10 degrees over that exhibited at baseline. A mirror will be provided for biofeedback and participants will be instructed on its use for achieving the target toe-out angle. Increased walking time and distance will be encouraged the same as for the control group.</description>

    <description>At each scheduled visit, participants will perform treadmill walking for a minimum of 30 minutes depending on the individual's baseline activity level and the stage of the intervention. Emphasis will be solely on increasing walking time and distance to achieve the target of a 40% increase in daily activity.</description>
