            "textblock": "PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine the feasibility and safety of trastuzumab (Herceptin) and chemotherapy in\n      patients with HER2-overexpressing (2+ level of expression) metastatic osteosarcoma.\n\n      II. Determine the response rate and 3-year event-free survival of patients treated with this\n      regimen.\n\n      III. Determine the cardiac toxicity and late effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      IV. Determine the response rate and 3-year event-free survival of poor-risk patients with\n      HER2-negative tumors treated with chemotherapy without the addition of trastuzumab.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to tumor HER2 status\n      (positive vs negative).\n\n      Patients receive induction therapy comprising doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes followed by\n      cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 1 and 6, and methotrexate IV over 4 hours\n      on day 1 of weeks 4, 5, 9, and 10. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium IV or orally\n      every 6 hours beginning 24 hours after each methotrexate dose and continuing for at least 10\n      doses until methotrexate levels sufficiently decrease. Within 24-36 hours after completion\n      of induction therapy, patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) daily until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients undergo resection of any remaining primary tumor and/or metastatic lesions during\n      week 11. Patients who are unable to undergo resection receive radiotherapy between weeks 11\n      and 17.\n\n      Patients receive post-induction therapy comprising doxorubicin IV over 20 minutes on days 1\n      and 2 of weeks 17, 25, and 29; cisplatin IV over 4 hours on days 1 and 2 of weeks 17 and 25;\n      methotrexate IV over 4 hours on day 1 of weeks 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, and 33; etoposide IV over\n      1 hour on days 1-5 of weeks 13, 21, and 34; and ifosfamide IV over 4 hours on days 1-5 of\n      weeks 13, 21, 29, and 34. Patients also receive leucovorin calcium and G-CSF as in induction\n      therapy. Patients whose tumors are found to over express HER2 (2+ level of expression) also\n      receive trastuzumab IV over 30-90 minutes once a week for a total of 34 weeks in addition to\n      the chemotherapy regimen.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 2\n      years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 80 patients (40 patients per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study within 2.5 years."
