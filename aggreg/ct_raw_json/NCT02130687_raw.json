The majority of patients with T2DM are also taking ACE inhibitors\n      or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in order to reduce cardiovascular and renal\n      morbidity and mortality. DPP4 and ACE inhibitors share the common vasoactive substrate\n      substance P. Substance P acts as a vasodilator but also activates the sympathetic nervous\n      system. Understanding the interactive effects of DPP4 and ACE inhibitors on blood pressure\n      and neurohumoral activation has important implications for the millions of patients with\n      T2DM who take these drugs concurrently."
