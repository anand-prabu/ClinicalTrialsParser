    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to explore immunomodulatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms of
      action of fingolimod in patients with Relapsing remitting multiple Sclerosis to collect data
      on biomarkers after initiation of fingolimod treatment.

    <textblock>
      After treatment with fingolimod the blood of the patients will be collected at different
      time points to examine the changes of T cells, B cells and biomarkers.
