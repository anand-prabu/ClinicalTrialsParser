SMARTgirl Plus will\n      add demonstrated approaches to ATS and HIV prevention (conditional cash transfer (CCT) and\n      microfinance (MF) opportunities) into an existing widely disseminated program (SMARTgirl),\n      using a stepped wedge randomized cluster design, and assess impacts on HIV related risk\n      behavior. Adding CCT and MF to existing HIV prevention programs will broaden the scope of\n      the current prevention model which focuses principally on reducing sexual risk through\n      condom use and STI care, and uptake of reproductive health services."
