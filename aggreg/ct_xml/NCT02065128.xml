  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable larynx syndrome (ILS) is a hyperkinetic laryngeal dysfunction that is
      characterized by a persistent cough, voice changes, or breathing difficulties, which are
      often triggered by an irritant. Diagnosis of ILS is difficult and typically made via a
      thorough review of the clinical history and, occasionally, the patient's reaction to an
      odor-provocation test. Standard treatment for ILS is behavioural therapy with a speech
      language pathologist (SLP), which provides symptom improvement for most patients. However,
      currently, there are no objective measures of the upper airway hyper-responsiveness in this
      condition to assist in diagnosing and monitoring disease severity.

      Since the cough is irritant-based, it is anticipated that patients with ILS will have a
      hypersensitivity to the irritant capsaicin. Capsaicin is the active component of chili
      peppers and is what makes them hot. The capsaicin cough challenge is a well recognized test
      that involves inhaling different concentrations of capsaicin solutions to determine a cough
      reflex sensitivity.

      The purpose of this research study is to confirm that ILS patients have a hypersensitivity
      to capsaicin compared to healthy volunteers. If a hypersensitivity is observed in ILS
      patients, the second objective of this study will be to see if behavioural therapy improves
      the cough reflex sensitivity in this patient population.
