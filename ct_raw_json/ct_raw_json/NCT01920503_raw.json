            "textblock": "Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare and very aggressive neoplasm that arises from the biliary\n      epithelium, constitutes approximately 2% of all reported cancer, and accounts for about 3%\n      of all gastrointestinal malignancies. Up to date, there are many modalities to diagnosis and\n      treat with a range of sensitivity and specificity, and also the advantage and disadvantage\n      of its modality. As physicians, we should be able to assess and choose promptly which\n      modality is best for our patient, even for palliative care. Treatment modalities are surgery\n      and non-surgery like adjuvant chemotherapy, radiation, chemoradiation, radiotherapy, TACE,\n      intra-arterial chemoinfusion, photodynamic therapy, liver transplantation, and palliative\n      therapy. The choice of treatment varies individually.\n\n      Cholangiocarcinoma has a poor prognosis. Surgical resection offers the only curative option\n      and usually requires a major hepatic resection in addition to resection of the\n      cholangiocarcinoma. Unfortunately, curative resection is possible in only about 30% of\n      patients due to locally advanced disease, distant metastases or comorbidity in elderly\n      patients. Even after resection, the recurrence rate is approximately 60%, resulting in a low\n      5-year overall survival (OS).\n\n      Patients with intra-hepatic Cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) have a very limited benefit from\n      systemic chemotherapy, indeed, in unresectable cholangiocarcinoma Overall Survival with\n      systemic chemotherapy is less than 1 year. Since most cholangiocarcinoma patients develop\n      distant metastases at late stages only, locoregional therapy is an interesting therapeutic\n      strategy.\n\n      Locoregional therapy studies in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma employing\n      radiofrequency ablation (RFA), transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or external as well as\n      internal radiation therapy yielded promising results in the last couple of years.\n\n      Locoregional therapies have been shown to be effective in patients with ICC. Trans arterial\n      chemoembolization (TACE),for example, is safe in patients with normal liver function, and\n      results in a prolongation of progression free survival (PFS) and OS. Local tumour control\n      may prolong OS and can be achieved by locoregional interventions applied either sequentially\n      or in combination with systemic chemotherapies.\n\n      TACE is also used as postoperative adjuvant therapy for cholangiocarcinoma, resulting in\n      prolonged survival in  patients with tumour size \u2265 5 cm or advanced primary tumor, regional\n      nodes, metastasis (TNM) stage.\n\n      TACE offers also greater survival benefits than supportive treatment for the palliative\n      treatment of unresectable ICC.\n\n      TACE is safe and may be effective for prolonging the survival of patients with nonresectable\n      combined hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) -cholangiocarcinoma, as compared with the\n      historically reported survivals of these patients. Tumor vascularity is highly associated\n      with tumor response. The patient survival period after TACE for combined\n      HCC-cholangiocarcinoma is significantly dependent on tumor size, tumor vascularity,\n      Child-Pugh class, and presence or absence of portal vein invasion.\n\n      Currently,  few centers perform TACE therapy for unresectable Cholangiocarcinoma. Several\n      European studies have reported the efficacy and safety TACE for ICC.\n\n      The establishment of a registry to obtain the majority of Cholangiocarcinoma cases treated\n      with locoregional approach within and outside Europe can help the investigators evaluate a\n      larger and non-ambiguous sample population. This would help the investigators evaluate the\n      technical success rates, clinical success rates, feasibility and safety of TACE for ICC.\n\n      All hospitals of IGEVO operating on patients with cholangiocarcinoma are eligible to take\n      part in the Registry."
