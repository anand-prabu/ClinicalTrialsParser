A 4-F arterial catheter (PulsiocathPV2014L16; Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany) was positioned in the descending aorta via the femoral artery using the Seldinger technique. The femoral arterial catheter and a standard central venous catheter were connected to pressure transducers, and also to an integrated bedside monitor (PiCCO; Pulsion Medical Systems).",
