As\n      liver biopsy in these patients not recommended because the risk of bleeding using Fibroscan\n      is a safe with diagnostic accuracy regarding the liver (& Spleen) fibrosis. Estimating\n      spleen fibrosis is an innovative approach in liver disease and Gaucher.\n\n      The evaluation of fibrosis with this new and safe method could avoid complications\n      antiinvasive procedure in GD patients. The addition of fibrosis biomarkers will help for\n      patients score evaluation. The finding of liver and spleen stiffness will be evaluated in\n      native and ERT treated Gaucher patients in order to assess ERT effect on fibrosis.\n\n      The Aims are: 1) To assess liver and spleen stiffness measurement using fibroscan and\n      evaluate liver and spleen fibrosis in patients with GD.\n\n      2) To compare the elastography in two cohorts of GD patients: ERT treated and na\u00efve GD\n      patients and two control groups of patients: healthy and Non Alcoholic Steatohepatitis\n      (NASH) patients.\n\n      3) To correlate the elastography findings with clinical and laboratory data in the four\n      patient groups focusing on Gaucher disease manifestations and GD severity.
