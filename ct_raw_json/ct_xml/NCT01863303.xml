  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence risk of colorectal cancer （CRC） is increasing at 4.2% year by year in China.
      Most effective way to reduce the death rate of CRC patients is to diagnose in quite an early
      stage. QiaoKou District is a chemical industry Zone of Wuhan with a long history, which has
      few data of CRC epidemiology. The investigators design the primary CRC screening for this
      district by healthy questionnaire, Fecal Occult Blood Test(FOBT) and colonoscopy. HanYang
      Areo has been chosen as Control for its non-industry environment.The crowd would be screen
      biennially. The high risk group would be intervened, such as resection of polyps or other
      specific treatment. A follow-up registration database has been built for analysis the
      relationship between incidence or death rate to high risk factors, such as age, life
      environment, lifestyles, base diseases and family history of cancer.

      This study will provide some epidemiology dates of CRC to the local Government, and assist
      the governor to built a more effective screening system of CRC.

      For this study, you will be asked to complete a personal interview. During the interview,
      you will be asked questions about your demographics (age, sex, etc.), underlying diseases,
      lifestyle, family history of cancer, awareness of CRC. It should take around 30 minutes to
      complete the interview.

      Residents in high risk group need to have some special tests, including FOBT and
      colonoscopy. Intestinal neoplasm will be suggested to biopsy or remove under colonoscopy for
      pathological examination. All tests are free. The interviews will be performed in
      Residential area and special tests will be done in the hospital during a regularly scheduled
      visit to Pu-Ai hospita.You may be contacted at home by phone so that researchers can collect
      information about any changes in your health status.
