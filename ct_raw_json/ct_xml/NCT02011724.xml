    <textblock>
      The objective of the study is to demonstrate that treatment with Apligraf reduces venous leg
      ulcer (VLU)-related pain and improves the quality of life (QOL) of patients with a painful
      VLU.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is a minimum of 18 years of age.

          -  Subject has read, understood, and signed an Institutional Review Board (IRB)-approved
             Informed Consent Form (ICF).

          -  Subject is able and willing to follow study procedures and instructions.

          -  Subject reports moderate VLU-related pain (defined as ≥4 based on maximum pain level
             over preceding 24 hours) on numeric rating scale (NRS) at both Week -2 and Day 0).

          -  Subject has a partial or full-thickness VLU between 1-60 cm2 and 1-36 months
             duration, which, in the opinion of the Investigator, has not adequately responded to
             conventional ulcer therapy.

          -  Female subject of childbearing potential has a documented negative urine pregnancy
             test.

          -  Subject (male or female) agrees to use highly effective methods of contraception for
             the duration of the study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has more than 1 VLU.

          -  Female subject who is lactating.

          -  Subject with significant or severe non VLU-related chronic pain which, in the
             Investigator's opinion, would impact subject's ability to evaluate their VLU-related
             pain. Subject with non-VLU-related chronic pain must be on a stable pain medication
             regimen and must, in the Investigator's opinion, not be anticipated to require a new
             pain medication for the chronic pain condition during the course of the study.

          -  Subject is not willing to discontinue the use of topical analgesics at the VLU
             (topical anesthetic is permitted for debridement).

          -  Subject who has arterial disease, as determined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI), of
             &lt;0.65.

          -  Subject who has received an investigational drug, device, or biological/bioactive
             treatment within 30 days prior to study enrollment.

          -  Subject who is scheduled to have a vascular intervention on the study extremity
             during the study.

          -  Subject with a biopsy confirmed active malignancy at the VLU. Also, subject with any
             active malignancy not at the VLU, with the exception of squamous cell carcinoma or
             basal cell carcinoma.

          -  Subject who is currently receiving, anticipates receiving, or has received, at any
             time within 30 days prior to Screening visit, topical corticosteroids at the VLU.

          -  Subject has vasculitis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, and other collagen vascular
             diseases.

          -  Subject has signs and symptoms of wound infection, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis at
             the VLU.

          -  Subject has a VLU with an avascular wound bed.

          -  Subject has a VLU with exposed bone, tendon, or fascia.

          -  Subject has other wounds (DFU, surgical, etc.) on the same limb as the VLU.

          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to bovine collagen or to the components of the
             Apligraf agarose shipping medium.

          -  Subject previously treated with Apligraf, or any other cell or tissue-based product
             at the VLU within 30 days of the Screening visit.

          -  Subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, has a history of alcohol or
             substance abuse within the previous year that could interfere with study compliance
             (eg, inability to attend scheduled study visits).

          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Investigator, for any reason other than those
             listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol.
