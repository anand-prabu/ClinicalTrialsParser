            "textblock": "For decades clomiphene citrate (CC) has been the first line therapy for ovulation induction\n      in anovulatory or oligoovulatory women, and for superovulation in women with unexplained\n      infertility or partners with mild sperm abnormalities.  While approximately 80% of patients\n      achieve ovulation with CC, less than half conceive.  Pregnancy is achieved in approximately\n      10% of ovulatory cycles.\n\n      Addition of dexamethasone to CC has been shown to result in pregnancy rates of 21-40% in\n      CC-resistant women (defined as patients failing to ovulate on CC alone).  A subsequent\n      randomized controlled trial demonstrated higher pregnancy rates in patients with unexplained\n      infertility undergoing intrauterine insemination (IUI) with CC + dexamethasone compared to\n      those taking CC alone.\n\n      In light of the relatively high pregnancy rates achieved in previous trials, we hypothesize\n      that dexamethasone as an adjunct to CC will increase the ovulation rate and pregnancy rate\n      for all appropriate candidates for IU with a standard CC regimen.\n\n      Our study is designed to randomize patients undergoing ovulation induction with IUI into two\n      groups: one consisting of a standard CC regimen, and the other consisting of the same CC\n      regimen with the addition of daily dexamethasone.  The primary outcome measure is pregnancy."
