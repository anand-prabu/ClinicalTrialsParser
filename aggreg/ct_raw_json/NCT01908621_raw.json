            "textblock": "Autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation  (autoHSCT) is a standard treatment of\n      eligible patients suffering from multiple myeloma (MM). Tandem autoHSCT allows to further\n      improve results of the therapy. Nowadays, 99% of the procedures are performed using\n      peripheral blood as a source of stem cells. Hence, the crucial point is to harvest adequate\n      number of stem cells allowing hematopoietic recovery. The number of 5 \u00d7 10^6 CD34+ cells/kg\n      is considered the optimal level, as far as double autoHSCT is concerned. There are two main\n      mobilization strategies being used: based on G-CSF alone or in combination with chemotherapy\n      (cyclophosphamide (CY) at dose range 1.5-7 g/m2 is mainly  used in MM setting). However, a\n      proportion of patients (5-40%) fail to collect the minimum number of cells required. Novel\n      agents, like plerixafor, CXCR4 inhibitor, may enable effective CD34+ cell harvest in \"poor\n      mobilizers\". Nevertheless, the optimal first-line and cost-effective protocol for\n      mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells has not been determined so far.\n\n      Randomized trials comparing chemomobilization with use of CY + G-CSF to G-CSF alone, which\n      had been conducted so far, did not demonstrate clear advantage of addition of CY to growth\n      factor. Intermediate-dose cytosine arabinoside (AraC), 1.6 g/m2 plus filgrastim, has been\n      shown to produce very high efficacy as a first or second-line mobilization regimen in\n      patients with lymphoid malignancies, including MM. In a retrospective comparison, this\n      strategy was significantly more effective than CY + filgrastim. This suggest that the type\n      of chemotherapy agent added to G-CSF may play role in mobilization efficacy and that the\n      combination of AraC and G-CSF may be more effective than G-CSF used alone. The goal of\n      current study is to verify this hypothesis in randomized controlled trial."
