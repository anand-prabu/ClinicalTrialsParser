In\n      clinical practise, it would be especially relevant if PEEP-induced changes in arterial\n      pressure variations could be used in evaluation of volume status and fluid responsiveness.\n      However, as ECHO-derived variables are used in greater extent to guide the treatment with\n      inappropriate evidence, the simultaneous registration of ECHO-derived hemodynamic\n      measurements is essential in the study design."
