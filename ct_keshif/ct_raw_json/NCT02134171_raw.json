Patients will be\n      assessed for cardiac involvement (troponin Ic level and cardiac ultrasonography) and\n      cerebral involvement (cerebral MRI). The investigators will assess whether serum troponin Ic\n      on diagnosis can predict morbidity and mortality of patients with a thrombotic\n      microangiopathy at the acute phase.\n\n      The primary outcome measurement is the event free survival at day 30, as defined by death,\n      myocardial ischemia, arrhythmia, severe cerebral injury and disease exacerbation. An\n      increase in troponin Ic on diagnosis is defined as at least one result above 0.2 ng/ml among\n      the three daily analyses performed after TMA diagnosis."
