            "textblock": "Under the escalation treatment strategy when a patient displays breakthrough disease\n      parameters under first line therapy, MS physicians are allowed by the EMEA to switch for\n      Natalizumab ( NTZ) or  fingolimod (FGL). NTZ and FGL efficacy have been demonstrated by\n      randomized therapeutic trial. As both treatments have been tested versus placebo a common\n      way to compare them is to look at their respective annualized relapse risk ratio decrease.\n      Roughly NTZ decrease by 70% and FGL by 50%. Nevertheless it is a terrible comparison since\n      the placebo group had different behaviour in the 2 trials and the patients demographic\n      features at baseline are also different. Therefore, it is right now totally impossible to\n      compare these 2 drugs with a decent methodology. Only a head to head comparison could do it.\n      Unfortunately this head-to-head comparison is not available and will not probably be done\n      under the drug companies initiative. During the time of this study we will perform a phase\n      IV, observational, prospective head to head comparison of NTZ versus FGL efficacy in 600\n      patients. Our primary end point will be disease free patients after 1 year of treatment.\n      Further, this trial will allow us to collect new biological samples, useful for a validation\n      our project main aim. Further these new samples will be obtained from 3 European countries,\n      which is a must if we want to generalize our conclusion obtained from a French cohort.\n      Cooperation at the European level is thus essential for the implementation of this project ."
