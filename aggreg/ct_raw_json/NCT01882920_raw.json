The GDT\n      group receive fluid  intravenous therapy according to a specific treatment protocol guided\n      by monitored hemodynamic parameters  assessed using the arterial pressure  signal monitoring\n      to assess stroke volume and cardiac output  via an automated pulse contour analysis\n      (Flotrac/Vigileo\u00ae); the control group receive the standard fluid therapy (crystalloid and\n      colloid). Fluid therapy regimen is free in the control group and targeted in the GDT group.\n      In both groups, the investigators evaluate the incidence of major abdominal and systemic\n      complications, the total duration of hospital stay, mortality, the total amount of fluids\n      administered, their breakdown (crystalloid/colloid) and the total number of colloid boluses\n      administered."
