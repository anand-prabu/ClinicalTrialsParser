These two groups of patients are being treated\n      differently and will be analysed separately.\n\n      The primary objective of this Phase I sequential cohort study was to determine the\n      feasibility of delivering modest acceleration and dose-escalated IMRT in locally advanced\n      high-risk thyroid cancers. We report the incidence and prevalence of acute toxicities of 2\n      dose fractionation regimens.\n\n      DL1: primary site 58.8 Gy in 28 daily fractions and nodal levels 50 Gy in 28 daily fractions\n\n      DL2: primary 66.6 Gy in 30 daily fractions and post operative nodal levels 60 Gy in 30 daily\n      fractions and elective nodal levels 54 Gy in 30 daily fractions"

Newly diagnosed histologically confirmed papillary,follicular, undifferentiated or\n             medullary carcinoma of the thyroid.\n\n          3. Tumours arising from the oral larynx or hypopharynx requiring radical radiation of\n             the primary tumour by parallel opposed lateral fields, and bilateral cervical lymph\n             node irradiation.\n\n          4. High risk of radiation induced xerostomia with conventional radiotherapy due to the\n             irradiation of the majority of both parotid glands (defined as estimated mean dose to\n             both parotid glands greater than 26 Gy using conventional radiotherapy technique).\n\n          5. Radiotherapy either as primary therapy or post-operative (only for thyroid\n             carcinoma). Techniques to be detailed by each centre. Neo-adjuvant and concomitant\n             chemotherapy are permitted.\n\n          6. Stage T1-4, N1-3, M0 disease\n\n          7.

Previous malignancy except non-melanoma skin cancer\n\n          3. Previous or concurrent illness which in the investigators opinion would interfere\n             with either completion of therapy or follow-up\n\n          4.
