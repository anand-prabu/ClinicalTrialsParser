In this\n      research study we are asking pregnant women with chronic high blood pressure to take Expecta\n      (DHA - Martek Biosciences, now known as DSM Nutritional Lipil) during the last half of their\n      pregnancy until six weeks after they deliver their baby."

They are able to buy this DHA supplement at most any store. The\n      dose often used over the counter is 200mg, we are testing the heart recommended dose of\n      1000mg.  Because we are using the heart health recommended dose and because there may be a\n      health claim we are doing the study using an FDA- food and drug administration IND.  IND\n      means investigational drug.  This dose has recently been used safely and effectively in\n      pregnancy both here in the United States and in Australia in hundreds of women.  There are\n      no risks to the fetus as the placenta prefers to transfer this important nutrient for fetal\n      eye and brain development.  The large studies done in pregnancy have followed their babies\n      into school age and found no adverse effects."
