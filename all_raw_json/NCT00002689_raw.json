Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Radiation therapy combined with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of brachytherapy followed by\n      external-beam radiation therapy plus chemotherapy in treating patients who have pancreatic\n      cancer that cannot be removed surgically."

Most patients receive a second course of this brachytherapy.\n\n      Patients then proceed to chemoradiotherapy beginning 7-14 days after brachytherapy.\n      Radiotherapy is administered 5 days a week for 6.4 weeks. Fluorouracil IV is administered\n      every other day for 4 doses during weeks 1 and 2.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 48 patients will be accrued for this study."
