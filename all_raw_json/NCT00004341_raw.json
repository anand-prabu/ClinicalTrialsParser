Patients with a known\n      immunodeficiency syndrome are studied in detail to identify the gene mutation, to assess the\n      effect of the mutation on the gene product, and to establish cell lines for further in vitro\n      assessment of the genetic defect.  The function of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome proteins (WASP)\n      in hematopoietic cells is studied.\n\n      Family members of patients with X-linked disorders are studied to identify carrier females."
