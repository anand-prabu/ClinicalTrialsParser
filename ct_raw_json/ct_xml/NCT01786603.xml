  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ALS is a disorder that weakens motor strength and lung function. Rapid loss of motor neurons
      in the brain and spinal cord of ALS patients causes the symptoms of increasing weakness and
      loss of muscle function. Motor neurons are responsible for sending signals to muscles in our
      bodies to trigger movement. While there are drugs to help relieve symptoms of ALS, there is
      no cure for ALS.

      Rasagiline is a drug with possible neuroprotective characteristics. Neuroprotective means
      that the nervous system may be protected against weakening. It is known that rasagiline has
      possible neuroprotective characteristics, but the effectiveness of rasagiline for patients
      with ALS has not been tested. Rasagiline is approved for the treatment of Parkinson's
      disease.

      Rasagiline for treatment of ALS is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) and is investigational. Investigational drugs are studied to find out if they are safe
      and effective in the treatment of diseases or conditions.

      By doing this study, researchers hope to learn if rasagiline is safe and slows disease
      progression in patients with ALS.
