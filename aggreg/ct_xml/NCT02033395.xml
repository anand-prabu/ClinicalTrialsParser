  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This observational study follows  subjects who have been exposed to a traumatic event and
      are at risk of developing PTSD symptoms. Participants are recruited within six hours of a
      traumatic event, and, starting from the recruitment session, are then examined on six set
      points of time within a period of thirteen months. The examinations include both biological
      studies of cortisol in hair, blood and saliva, and psychological examinations and
      questionaires that assess the development and severity of PTSD symptoms.

      The novel method of sampling hair cortisol allows investigators to retroactively estimate
      the mean levels of blood cortisol during the tree months prior to the sampling.

      The study aims at further illuminating the correlation between cortisol levels both prior
      and following a traumatic event, and the development and severity of PTSD symptoms
