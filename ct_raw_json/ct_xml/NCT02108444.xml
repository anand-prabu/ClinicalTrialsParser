    <textblock>
      This study is a retrospective analysis to explore the incidence of hepatitis B virus
      reactivation after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy, the efficacy and safety of
      chemotherapy, and overall survival rate in lymphoma patients with hepatitis B virus
      infection.

      All eligible patients will received prophylactic antiviral therapy during and within 6
      months after chemotherapy in previous sudy. We did not assign specific interventions to the
      subjects in this study. The primary endpoint of this study is the incidence of hepatitis B
      virus reactivation after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy. The secondary
      endpoints include the incidence of hepatitis flare related to hepatitis B virus reactivation
      after withdrawal of prophylactic antiviral therapy, the tumor response rate, and overall
      survival rate.
