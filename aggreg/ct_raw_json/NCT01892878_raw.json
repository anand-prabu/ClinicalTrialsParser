Evaluate the fusion status of facet joints following laminectomy and facet fixation\n           using the VerteLoc system in combination with unilateral and/or bilateral\n           posterolateral fusion.\n\n        2. Subject success / Clinical outcome: Evaluate the reduction in baseline VAS back pain\n           score at 2-3 weeks, 3 months, and 12 months.\n\n      The secondary objectives of this study are to:\n\n        1. Explore the effect of preoperative bone density on facet fusion status;\n\n        2. Assess the ease of use of the VerteLoc system;\n\n        3. Record operative time using the VerteLoc system;\n\n        4. Monitor the occurrence of adverse events related or possibly related to the use of the\n           VerteLoc system;\n\n        5. Monitor the occurrence of subsequent surgical intervention at the target level(s).\n\n        6. Subject success/Clinical outcome (Assess additional improvement criteria)\n\n        7. Evaluate Fusion rate in relations to DEXA value\n\n      Inclusion Criteria: Candidates must meet ALL of the following:\n\n        1. Have provided consent for research by signing the Institutional Review Board approved\n           Informed Consent;\n\n        2. Have given appropriate operative consent for a decompressive lumbar (L1-S1) laminectomy\n           procedure as standard of care;\n\n        3. Are skeletally mature, and are at least 18 years of age;\n\n        4. If female, are not pregnant;\n\n        5. Agree to adhere to post-surgical medically prescribed activity limitations and/or\n           physical rehabilitation.\n\n      Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        1. Previous surgery at the target or adjacent vertebral levels;\n\n        2. More than two intervertebral levels to be treated by the laminectomy procedure;\n\n        3. Found to be inappropriate candidates for facet fixation using the VerteLoc system;\n\n        4. Require additional and/or other surgical technique and/or approach to the laminectomy\n           at the index level(s), which may in the opinion of the Primary Investigator confound\n           measurement of outcome variables;\n\n        5. Has a medical disorder or is receiving medications that would be expected to interfere\n           with osteogeneses,\n\n        6. Active malignancy or patient with a history of any malignancy (except non-melanoma skin\n           cancer) with recurrence within 5 years of surgery;\n\n        7. Active local or systemic infection or history of local or systemic infection,\n           immune-deficiency, uncontrolled medical conditions, which in the opinion of the\n           Investigator may increase patient risk or confound fusion results;\n\n        8. BMI >40% ;\n\n        9. History of tobacco smoking within the past 6 months;\n\n       10. Has a history of alcoholism, medication or drug abuse, psychosis, is a prisoner, and/or\n           has a personality disorder, poor motivation, emotional or intellectual issues that\n           would likely make the patient unreliable for participation in the study;\n\n       11. Are participating in any other clinical trial. Study Duration : 12 months\n\n      Study Outcomes:\n\n      The primary study outcomes of this study are:\n\n        1. Fusion grade at 12 month follow-up using CT scans with a grading system based on:\n\n             1. Complete fusion;\n\n             2. Partial fusion;\n\n             3. No fusion;\n\n        2. Subject success / Clinical outcome:\n\n      Evaluate the reduction in baseline VAS back pain score at:\n\n        1. 2-3 weeks\n\n        2. 3 months\n\n        3. 12 months.\n\n      The secondary outcomes of this study are:\n\n        1. Statistical correlation of DEXA scan bone mass density score to CT and radiographic\n           fusion status;\n\n        2. Surgeon opinion of \"ease of use\" utilizing the VerteLoc system (0-10);\n\n        3. Operative time (minutes) from surgical access to completion of device placement\n\n        4. Occurrence and prevalence of adverse events related or possibly related to the use of\n           the VerteLoc System;\n\n        5. Occurrence of subsequent surgical intervention at the target level(s).\n\n      Study Assessments\n\n        -  Intraoperative: Post-placement radiograph;\n\n        -  12 months: A/P and lateral flexion and extension lumbar radiograph and lumbar CT scan.\n\n      Statistical Analysis\n\n      \u2022 Student t-tests"
