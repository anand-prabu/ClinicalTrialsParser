It is also important that these participants continue and\n      follow through with the study through the extended period of follow-up. A measurement of HIV\n      incidence and retention rate among high-risk women and HIV-discordant couples is necessary\n      for upcoming HPTN trials. Taken together with the need for estimates of HIV incidence and\n      the need for data to ensure high retention rates, this protocol is important for the HPTN\n      generally and for HPTU in Pune in particular."

            "textblock": "Previous prevention-trial planning efforts have indicated that Phase III studies of HIV\n      prevention interventions will require the participation of large numbers of persons at high\n      risk for HIV infection. In addition to accruing large numbers of participants, research\n      centers conducting Phase III HIV prevention studies must retain participants in extended\n      periods of follow-up in order to accurately reflect the impact of the intervention in the\n      target population. A current measurement of HIV incidence, the risk factors associated with\n      HIV infection, and the retention rate of newly enrolled high-risk women is necessary for an\n      upcoming HPTN trial. In addition, HPTN requires an assessment of its ability to enroll and\n      retain HIV-discordant couples for a proposed HPTN trial, as well as a timely assessment of\n      the HIV incidence rate in these exposed partners. This study will provide essential\n      experience and a preliminary base for the enrollment of discordant couples into future HPTN\n      clinical trials. Taken together with the need for current estimates of HIV incidence in the\n      cohort and community populations and the need for data to ensure high retention rates, this\n      protocol is important for the HPTN generally and for HPTU in Pune in particular.\n\n      Potential study participants will undergo eligibility screening, including administration of\n      a questionnaire, physical examination, and HIV antibody testing. Once participants are\n      enrolled in the study, the requirements will include follow-up every 3 months for 17.5\n      months, phlebotomy, physical exams, and questionnaires. At every follow-up visit, a short\n      questionnaire will be administered to all participants to assess their continued\n      understanding about the nature, duration, benefits and risks of being in the study and to\n      assure their voluntary participation in the study. Participants seen in follow-up also will\n      have a physical examination, be evaluated and treated for any STDs, receive additional\n      counseling, and be offered retesting for HIV infection. In addition, participants also will\n      be invited to participate in additional assessment issues addressing retention using a\n      series of focus groups, key informant interviews, and individual qualitative and\n      quantitative assessments. Participants in this protocol may also be eligible to enroll into\n      1 of 2 proposed ancillary laboratory substudies (HPTN 034A and 034B)."
