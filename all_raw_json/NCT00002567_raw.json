Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose radiation therapy and\n      etoposide followed by peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with acute\n      leukemia."

Evaluate the efficacy of myeloablative total-body irradiation and etoposide\n      followed by autologous peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) transplantation in prolonging the\n      disease-free survival of patients with acute leukemia. II. Investigate the ability of growth\n      factor-primed PBSC to provide hematopoietic reconstitution following myeloablative therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are treated on Regimen A, then Regimen B. Regimen A: Stem Cell\n      Mobilization. Granulocyte Colony Stimulating Factor (Amgen), G-CSF, NSC-614629. Regimen B:\n      Radiotherapy and Myeloablative Chemotherapy with Hematopoietic Rescue. Total-Body\n      Irradiation, TBI (high-energy electrons used for lung boost); and Etoposide, VP-16,\n      NSC-141540; with Peripheral Blood Stem Cells, PBSC; G-CSF.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Up to 45 patients will be studied over approximately 3 years."
