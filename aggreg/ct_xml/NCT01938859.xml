    <textblock>
      The purpose of the AGTs-BD study is to compare the treatment outcome and safety profiles
      between different mood stabilizers combination treatments in the patients with bipolar
      disorders, currently suffered from depression episode.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The AGTs-BD study is a randomized, open-label, rater-blind, multicenter study, which
      including an 8-week acute treatment (Phase I), followed by a 24-week recurrence prevention
      treatment (Phase II), and a 24-week relapse prevention treatment (Phase III). Patients
      initially enter an up to 4 weeks screening phase to confirm the randomization to whom met
      DSM-IV criteria of bipolar I or II disorder, currently depressed with Hamilton Depression
      Rating Scale-17 items (HAM-D) total score ≥17. The protocol was approved by the each sites'
      appropriate institutional review boards and ethics committees. After screening, patients
      were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) lithium monotherapy; (2) lithium plus
      quetiapine; (3) lithium plus a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named as Shuganjieyu
      capsule (SGJY, St. John's wort and acanthopanax senticosus combination). After phase I,
      patients who met stable remission, defined as HAM-D total score ≤7 and Young Mania Rating
      Scale (YMRS) total score ≤10 in two consecutive visit at least 4 weeks, were qualified into
      phase II and III. Patients remained on the allocated treatment for up to 48 weeks or until
      treatment failure. The difference between phase II and phase III was that treatment dose
      could be decreased (within the study ranges) if side-effects became troublesome in phase
      III, but not for phase II. All patients will be provided with free care (3 visits) by the
      investigators, for a period of up to 3 months after the end of the study, in order to help
      them make the transition into routine clinical care.
