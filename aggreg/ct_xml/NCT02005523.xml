          -  Normal 12-lead ECG prior to surgery.

          -  Women of childbearing potential who have a negative pregnancy test (urine HCG) before
             surgery.

          -  Capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and provide written,
             informed consent.

          -  Significant organ dysfunction, including cardiac, renal (eGFR ≤ 60 ml/min.), liver,
             central nervous system, pulmonary, vascular, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or
             metabolic (e.g., creatinine ≥ 1.6 mg/dL; ALT or AST ≥ 1.5x the upper limit of
