From start of anesthesia, until final valve implantation, local cooling (by the\n      RhinoChill device) will be applied to the brain. Effect of cooling on cerebral oxygenation,\n      by cerebral oxygen saturation monitoring (NIRS ForeSight technology) during the TAVI\n      procedure will be continuously assessed during native valve manipulation and during final\n      valve deployment (=primary endpoint of he study). As secondary endpoints, neuropsychological\n      testing performed before and after TAVI procedure will assess the effects of the use of\n      cooling during the TAVI procedure. Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) and S100-beta will be\n      analyzed during and up to 72hrs after TAVI to compare the cerebral ischemic damage between\n      cooled and non-cooled patients. And finally, diffusion-weighted MRI of the brain will be\n      performed  5 days before and 5-7 days after TAVI to compare the number and total amount of\n      cerebral ischemic insults between cooled and non-cooled patients. The hypothesis behind this\n      study is that by local cooling of the brain during manipulation of the calcified aorta and\n      aortic valve, the brain might be protected from cerebral ischemic insults."
