        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Completion of the Day 182 visit in a previous 26-week double-blind study
             (EVP-6124-015 or EVP-6124-016).

          -  Subject has signed informed consent for this extension study, indicating that the
             subject understands the purpose of and procedures required for the study, before the
             initiation of any extension study specific procedures.  Subjects who are unable to
             provide informed consent will not be included in the study

          -  No clinically significant changes in the subject's medical status during the
             participation in EVP-6124-015 or EVP-6124-016.  Any significant changes in health
             care status and their impact on subject eligibility will be reviewed by the
             investigator and sponsor on a case-by-case basis.

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the extension treatment is in the best interest
             of the subject.

          -  Fertile, sexually active subjects (men and women) must use an effective method of
             contraception during the study.  Females and the female partners of male must be
             surgically sterile (hysterectomy or bilateral tubal ligation), postmenopausal for at
             least 1 year, willing to practice adequate methods of contraception if of
             childbearing potential (defined as consistent use of combined effective methods of
             contraception [including at least one barrier method]).  Female subjects must have a
             negative urine pregnancy test predose on Day 1.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant risk for suicidal or violent behavior, as determined by the investigator.
              Significant risk for suicidal behavior is defined as 1) suicidal ideation as
             endorsed on items 4 and 5 of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS); 2)
             suicidal behaviors detected by the C-SSRS; or 3) psychiatric interview and
             examination.

          -  Adverse events from the previous study (EVP-6124-015 or EVP-6124-016) that have not
             resolved, are of moderate or greater severity and judged to be possibly related or
             related to study drug and are thought by the investigator to be contraindications to
             study participation.

          -  Any condition which would make the subject, in the opinion of the investigator,
             unsuitable for the study.

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant.

          -  Subjects who received any other investigational treatment during participation in
             either EVP-6124-015 or EVP-6124-016 other than assigned study medication.
