It has been specifically designed to overcome the limitations of tuning\n      forks for testing the integrity of vibration sense in clinic and by the bedside. The product\n      is a hand held device that is used to examine the feet of Diabetic patients who are\n      susceptible to peripheral neuropathy that can in turn lead to ulcers. Treatment is expensive\n      and can be over a period of time, often not being completely resolved, and can lead to\n      amputation. The product will increase awareness of foot care and achieve a reduction in\n      incidence of foot ulcers.\n\n      The study aims to evaluate the accuracy of the VibraTip device compared to the Gold\n      Standard, the 10g Semmes Weinstein Monofilament (MF) Test, and the accuracy and usability of\n      the VibraTip\u00ae device, as measured by different community medical practitioners."

Subjects will\n      receive a Patient Letter to invite them to take part in the VibraTip study and a Patient\n      Information Leaflet about the study enclosed within their Diabetes Clinic appointment. The\n      study will aim to invite 180 patients to take part in the study and aims to recruit 100\n      subjects into the study within 3 months. Subjects aged 18 to 75 (inclusive) of either sex\n      with pre-existing diabetes (Type 1 and Type 2). The study aims to recruit approximately 50\n      (50%) of patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy (both painful and painless) and 50\n      (50%) without diabetic peripheral neuropathy. (we will go for even split if possible)"
