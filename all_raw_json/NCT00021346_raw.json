Determine the dose-limiting toxic effects of this\n      regimen in these patients. III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of this\n      regimen in these patients. IV. Determine the observed responses in these patients receiving\n      this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gemcitabine. Patients are stratified according\n      to prior therapy (no prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to less than 20% of bone\n      marrow vs prior chemotherapy and/or prior radiotherapy to at least 20% of bone marrow).\n      Patients receive carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes\n      on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 1-3 patients receive escalating doses of gemcitabine until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding\n      that at which 2 of 3 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 18 patients (9 per stratum) will be accrued for this study."
