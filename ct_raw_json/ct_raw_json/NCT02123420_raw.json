A total of 36 implants,\n      (18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy PS, 18 Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy), were bilaterally\n      installed. All the implants were inserted with an insertion torque between 35 and 45 Ncm, in\n      healed healthy bone and the healing abutment was connected at the same time. Both implants\n      were delayed loaded with screw retained temporary crowns 3 months after implant insertion\n      and with screw retained definitive crowns 2 months later. Outcome measures were implant\n      survival, biological and prosthetic complications, radiographic marginal bone-level changes,\n      soft tissue parameters  (PPD and BOP). Clinical data were collected at baseline 6 and  12\n      months. Statistical analyses were conducted using computational program SAS (version 9.2),\n      with 1-away ANOVA and F-test. Statistical significance was tested at the 0.05 probability\n      level, and all values were presented as mean and standard deviation  with 95% confidence\n      intervals."
