Infection with dengue viruses is the leading cause of\n      hospitalization and death in children in at least 8 tropical Asian countries. There are 4\n      types of dengue virus (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4), each of which can cause dengue\n      illness ranging from a mild illness to life-threatening disease. This study will evaluate\n      the experimental rDEN2\u039430-7169 vaccine for the prevention of illness due to DENV-2. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of this vaccine in\n      healthy adults with no history of previous flavivirus infection.\n\n      At study entry, participants will be randomly assigned to receive either the dengue virus\n      vaccine or placebo. They will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after receiving the\n      injection for monitoring. Study visits will occur at Days 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 21,\n      28, 56, and 180. All study visits will include a blood collection, and most study visits\n      will include a physical examination. Female participants will have a pregnancy test at\n      select visits. Participants will record their temperature at least 3 times a day for the\n      first 16 days; study researchers will review these readings during the study visits."
