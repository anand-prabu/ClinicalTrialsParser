            "textblock": "Dysfunction of vital organs is one of the major reasons why trauma victims die after\n      sustaining a major injury, even though the organs themselves may not have been directly\n      injured. The inability to clot blood as a result of inflammation further contributes to\n      complications in a majority of these patients. One intervention proposed to protect against\n      impaired organ function is called \"Remote Ischemic Conditioning\", wherein application of\n      intermittent occlusion and release of blood flow to the arm by sequentially inflating and\n      deflating a blood pressure cuff can protect against the development of distant organ injury\n      and inflammation following a severe traumatic event. In a pilot study, we will investigate\n      the effects of remote ischemic conditioning in trauma patients with hemorrhagic shock, with\n      a view to evaluate its effects on the immune system and coagulation profiles, both of which\n      are known to be deranged in these patients. These studies will potentially benefit patients\n      and will serve as a proof of principle for the use of remote ischemic conditioning in the\n      trauma setting."
