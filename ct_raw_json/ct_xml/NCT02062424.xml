  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to test the effect of substitution dietary guidelines that
      are specifically aimed at the prevention of ischemic heart disease (IHD) on the dietary
      intake in the general Danish population.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      225 participants will be included in the intervention. The intervention is planned to run
      for six months in a real life setting.

      The study is a randomized, parallel dietary intervention study. Dietary intake, selected IHD
      biomarkers and anthropometric measurements will be measured at two visits during the
      intervention period as well as 6 months after the end of the intervention. The study
      includes a baseline visit followed by a visit where web based dietary records will be
      completed by the subjects and blood samples and anthropometrics will be measured.

      The intervention will consist of information on dietary advice due to the specific IHD
      dietary guideline or the current national dietary guidelines. The information will be
      provided to the participants via leaflets and recipes.

      After the baseline visit the subjects will be randomized to group A, B or C: In group A the
      subjects will receive dietary advice, according to the specific IHD dietary guideline, in
      group B the subjects will receive dietary advice according to the current national dietary
      guidelines and in group C the subjects will be instructed to follow their normal dietary
      habits.
