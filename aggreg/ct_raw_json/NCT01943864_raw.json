The primary\n      endpoint of this study is 12 week non-progressive disease (PD) rate defined as the\n      percentage of subjects without progression at Week 12. As a sub-study, pharmacokinetics (PK)\n      of four tablets of 0.5 milligram (mg) tablet, or one tablet of 2 mg tablet to achieve 2 mg\n      daily regimen will be assessed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of trametinib in Japanese\n      population.\n\n      Eligible subjects will be randomized to receive trametinib at the recommended Phase II dose\n      of 2 mg every day as one 2 mg tablet or four 0.5 mg tablets on Day 1. From Day 2 until\n      disease progression or withdrawal from the study treatment, all subjects will receive one\n      tablet of 2 mg trametinib . Disease assessment will be performed every 8 week. Translational\n      research is also planned to evaluate the potential blood or tumor tissue-derived biomarkers\n      for biological activity, and sensitivity or resistance to treatment with trametinib ."
