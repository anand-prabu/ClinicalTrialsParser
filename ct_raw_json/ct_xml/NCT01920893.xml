      Primary Objective:

      To evaluate the efficacy of dupilumab in the treatment of bilateral Nasal Polyposis (NP) by
      assessment of the endoscopic nasal polyp score in comparison to placebo.

      Secondary Objectives:

      To evaluate effect of dupilumab with regards to:

        -  symptoms of sinusitis

        -  sinus CT scan

        -  nasal polyp score in the sub-group of patients with co-morbid asthma

        -  Safety and tolerability

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Screening period (4 weeks) + Randomized Treatment Period (16 weeks)+ Post-Treatment Period
      (16 weeks) = 36 weeks.

      To ensure at least 28 patients with co-morbid asthma needed for subgroup analysis,
      recruitment of NP patients without co-morbid asthma will stop when approximately 28 patients
      without asthma are randomized.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

        Patients with:

          -  A minimum bilateral nasal polyp score of 5 out of a maximum score of 8 (with a
             unilateral score of at least 2 for each nostril) despite completion of a prior INCS
             treatment for at least 8 weeks before screening.

          -  Presence of at least two of the following symptoms prior to screening: nasal
             blockade/obstruction/congestion or nasal discharge (anterior/posterior nasal drip);
             facial pain/pressure; reduction or loss of smell.

        Exclusion criteria:

          -  Patients &lt;18 or &gt;65 years of age.

          -  Sinonasal outcome test (SNOT22) &lt;7.

          -  Patients who have taken other investigational drugs or prohibited therapy for this
             study within 2 months before screening or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer:

          -  who have required a burst of systemic corticosteroids within the 2 months before
             screening or are scheduled to receive systemic corticosteroids during the study
             period for another condition

          -  who have required intranasal corticosteroid drops within 1 month prior to screening
             Monoclonal antibody (mAB) and immunosuppressive treatment; Anti-immunoglobulin E
             (IgE) therapy (omalizumab) within 130 days of Visit 1; Leukotriene antagonists /
             modifiers unless patient is on a continuous treatment for at least 30 days prior to
             Visit 1.

          -  Patients who have undergone any nasal surgery (including polypectomy) within 6 months
             before screening or have had more than 5 sinonasal surgeries in the past of which
             maximal 2 were surgeries changing the lateral wall structure of the nose.

          -  Patients with asthma having:

          -  Forced Expiratory Volume (FEV1) ≤ 60%, or

          -  an asthma exacerbation requiring systemic (oral and/or parenteral) steroid treatment
             or hospitalization for &gt;24h for treatment of asthma, within 3 months prior to
             screening or are on a dose of greater than 1000 μg fluticasone or an equivalent
             inhaled corticosteroids.

        The above information is not intended to contain all considerations relevant to a
        patient's potential participation in a clinical trial.
