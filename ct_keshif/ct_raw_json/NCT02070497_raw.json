The patients with\n      new-diagnosed lung cancer and accepting case management will be assigned to the experimental\n      group\uff1b The patients with new-diagnosed lung cancer in the period of one year ago and without\n      accepting case management will be assigned to the control group\uff1bThe third group is the\n      patients with non-new-diagnosed lung cancer and with accepting case management. The staffs\n      are the doctors within the lung cancer medical team.\n\n      The lung cancer case management database, patients' satisfaction questionnaire, and staffs'\n      satisfaction questionnaire will be used to measure the effectiveness. Statistical software\n      SPSS for Windows version 17.0 will be used to analyze the data.\n\n      Expected results: The research outcome will to confirm the impact of case management on the\n      lung cancer patients and could be the reference data for future cancer case management\n      model."
