Pain is harder to evaluate in non-communicative patients, who can\u00b4t\n      report their own pain. Behavioral indicators have been proved as useful and reliable for\n      detecting and measuring pain in these patients, and have been the basis for constructing\n      scales for measuring pain, such as the Behavioural Pain Scale (BPS), the Critical Care\n      Observation Tool (CPOT) and the Scale of Behaviors Indicating Pain (ESCID) .\n\n      The BPS and ESCID were tested in a study with a sample of 42 critically ill patients in\n      Spain, showing good validity and reliability.\n\n      The objective of this Spanish multicentre study is to test the validity and reliability of\n      the ESCID scale in a large sample of critically ill patients with medical and postsurgical\n      pathology for the detection and measurement of pain."
