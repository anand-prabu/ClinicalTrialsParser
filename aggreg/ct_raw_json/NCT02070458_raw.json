Acute myeloid leukemia is a\n      cancer of the bone marrow cells; bone marrow is where blood cells are normally made.\n      Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell\n      growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as mitoxantrone hydrochloride, etoposide, and\n      intermediate-dose cytarabine, work in different ways to stop the growth of cancer cells,\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Mitoxantrone hydrochloride,\n      etoposide, and intermediate-dose cytarabine are standard treatment for relapsed or\n      refractory acute myeloid leukemia. Giving ixazomib with mitoxantrone hydrochloride,\n      etoposide, and intermediate-dose cytarabine may improve the effectiveness of the\n      chemotherapy."
