The V-WHI counselors will\n      address mental health and job-related issues that interfere with working.

At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI group is provided with a booster session.\n      Participants in both groups are administered follow-up questionnaires at two time-points:\n      month five and month nine."

This study will test the impact of the V-WHI\n      in combination with the Philadelphia VA's Primary Care Mental Health Integration program,\n      the Behavioral Health Lab (BHL).\n\n      The primary endpoints are pre/post changes in at-work performance and productivity scores\n      based on the validated Work Limitation Questionnaire (WLQ). Secondary endpoints include\n      changes in depression symptom severity (measured with the validated PHQ-9). An ROI analysis\n      will assess costs and benefits. For practical reasons, neither subjects nor the intervention\n      providers will be blinded to subject assignment.\n\n      After informed consent and eligibility screening, subjects are randomized to one of two\n      groups: the V-WHI intervention group or to the usual care group (BHL). 250 employed veterans\n      with depression and work limitations will be enrolled (half per group). The \"usual care\"\n      group participants are assigned to standard behavioral health care. The second group,\n      assigned to V-WHI services, is the experimental group. Participants in this group are\n      assigned to an innovative program designed explicitly to address mental health and\n      vocational issues that interfere with working (V-WHI) in addition to standard care. V-WHI\n      counselors offer work coaching and modification strategies and work-focused cognitive\n      behavioral therapy (CBT). This counseling is provided solely over the phone with sessions\n      every 2 weeks for 4 months (eight sessions total). At 8 months post-baseline, the V-WHI\n      group is provided with a booster session. Participants in both groups are administered\n      follow-up questionnaires at two time-points: month five (post-intervention) and month nine."
