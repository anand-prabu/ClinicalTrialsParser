  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of the oral Src/Abl
      inhibitor AZD0424, and to find tolerable and effective AZD0424 combination regimens for the
      treatment of advanced solid tumours
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      AZD0424 is a potent orally available, potent (IC50 approximately 4 nM) inhibitor of Src and
      ABL1 kinases with additional activity against Src family kinase (SFK) members including Yes
      and Lck.  AZD0424 was selective for SFKs and ABL1 kinase over C-terminal Src kinase (a
      negative regulator of Src) and a range of other kinase targets.  The anti-cancer activity of
      AZD0424 is thought to be mediated primarily by anti-migratory and anti-invasive signalling
      and, as such, it is expected that in the late stage cancer setting strong signals of
      efficacy with this compound used as a single agent are unlikely, requiring it to be
      administered in combination with other anti-cancer agents.

      In summary the study will be performed in four main stages:

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose escalation: Phase Ia single agent (AZD0424) dose escalation
           study to determine the MTD.

        -  AZD0424 monotherapy, dose expansion: Phase Ib single agent dose expansion at MTD.

        -  Combination arm(s) dose escalation: Provided that it is deemed appropriate (post review
           of available clinical data from the monotherapy dose escalation and available
           preclinical and published data on the combinations), up to three Phase Ia dose
           escalation arms of AZD0424 in combination with selected agent(s) will proceed to
           determine the MTD for the combination and a recommended Phase II dose.

        -  Combination arm(s) dose expansion: Up to three Phase Ib combination arm(s) as
           appropriate using the recommended Phase II dose for both AZD0424 and the combination
           agent.

    <description>AZD0424 will be administered as a flat dose orally once a day.  One treatment cycle consists of 28 days of continuous drug administration with AZD0424, with the flexibility to introduce treatment breaks if required due to cumulative toxicity.
Combination agents and treatment regimen with AZD0424 will be confirmed and approved at a later date.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically or cytologically proven solid tumour, refractory to conventional
             treatment, or for which no conventional therapy exists or is declined by the patient
             or for whom there is the prospect of clinical benefit

          -  Life expectancy of at least 12 weeks

          -  World Health Organisation (WHO) performance status of 0-2

          -  Haematological and biochemical indices within the ranges shown below. These
             measurements must be performed within one week (Day -7 to Day 1) before the patient
             receives AZD0424

             treatment and follow-up

          -  MTD Expansion cohorts only: A tumour which is safely accessible for biopsy (single
             and combination)

          -  Single Agent Expansion cohort only: patient must be willing and capable to have

          -  Ongoing toxic manifestations of previous treatments. Exceptions to this are alopecia
             or certain Grade 1 toxicities, which in the opinion of the Investigator and the DDO
             should not exclude the patient.

             measures not to father children by using one form of highly effective contraception
             as detailed in the protocol). Men with pregnant or lactating partners should be
             advised to use barrier method contraception (for example, condom plus spermicidal
             gel) to prevent exposure to the foetus or neonate.

          -  Major thoracic or abdominal surgery from which the patient has not yet recovered.

             uncontrolled infection.

          -  Known to be serologically positive for hepatitis B, hepatitis C or human
             immunodeficiency virus (HIV).

          -  Resting ECG with measurable QTc interval of &gt;480 msec (mean value and manually
             verified) of at least 3 time points within a 24 hour period.

             would be acceptable.

          -  Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a
             good candidate for the clinical trial.
