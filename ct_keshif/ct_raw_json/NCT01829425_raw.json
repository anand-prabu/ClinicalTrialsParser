The Hypothesis: Among patients with urgency urinary incontinence,\n                     hypnotherapy decreases abnormal perception of bladder distension outside the\n                     hypnotic state and is at least as effective as pharmacotherapy in diminishing\n                     the symptoms of urgency and severity of incontinence\n\n        2.

Post treatment fMRI results from\n                UUI subjects will be compared to their baseline results.\n\n             -  Measured outcomes will be differences in baseline brain function in UUI subjects\n                compared to normal controls as well as differences in treatment effect on brain\n                function in subjects receiving pharmacotherapy compared to those receiving\n                hypnotherapy\n\n                2a.The Hypotheses: 1) Patients with UUI will exhibit increased activation within\n                portions of the brain, the limbic cortex (anterior cingulate cortex& insula),\n                during bladder distension relative to controls. Patients will also exhibit an\n                abnormal pattern of functional connectivity within these parts of the brain. 2)\n                Among patients with UUI, hypnotherapy will decrease hyper-activation of portions\n                of the brain in response to bladder distension and/or modulate functional\n                connectivity within these portions of the brain. Moreover, normalization of\n                hyper-activation and connectivity will be greater in hypnotherapy compared to\n                pharmacotherapy."

To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective\n                and durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non-mind/body\n                treatment (pharmacotherapy) by comparing change in urinary incontinence episodes\n                recorded on voiding diaries between groups using a non-inferiority design.\n\n             2. To determine whether hypnotherapy treatment of UUI (urgency urinary incontinence)\n                is associated with greater modification of brain activation and connectivity on\n                functional MRI than that which occurs following pharmacotherapy\n\n        2. Secondary Objectives:\n\n             1. To determine whether a mind/body therapy (hypnotherapy) is at least as effective\n                and durable, in treating urgency urinary incontinence (UUI) as a non-mind/body\n                treatment (pharmacotherapy) comparing change in questionnaire results as well as\n                urinary frequency and pad counts recorded on voiding diaries\n\n             2. To determine the baseline occurrence of concomitant syndromes such as irritable\n                bowel syndrome or other bowel symptoms such as constipation or anal incontinence\n                or painful bladder syndrome in this population of women with UUI based on the\n                medical history  and questionnaires. We will explore whether there is a difference\n                in irritable bowel and other bowel symptoms and IC symptoms following treatment if\n                there are sufficient numbers of women with pain and IC at baseline.\n\n             3. To confirm differences in brain activation and connectivity on functional MRI in\n                UUI subjects compared to normative controls.\n\n      Overview:\n\n        1. Women with UUI who meet inclusion criteria and who choose to participate in the study\n           will be enrolled by the University of New Mexico Urogynecology Division. Investigators\n           will screen subjects for study entry based on voiding diaries to ensure that subjects\n           have UUI and with a screening questionnaire, the OAB Awareness tool.Subjects will be\n           randomized to treatment with either: 1) Pharmacotherapy, a standard therapy for UUI,\n           and conventional behavioral therapy or 2) Hypnotherapy and conventional behavioral\n           therapy. All subjects will give signed informed consent prior to study treatment. One\n           hundred fifty-two women will be randomized to hypnotherapy or to pharmacotherapy. Study\n           participation for these UUI subjects will be approximately 1 year; Measurements will be\n           performed prior to treatment, following completion of treatment visits (treatment\n           visits are performed over 8 weeks), and again at 6 and 12 months.  The primary analysis\n           of the RCT will be performed as an intention to treat analysis. A secondary analysis\n           will be performed as a per protocol analysis.\n\n        2. A subset of approximately 60 subjects with UUI (drawn from both treatment groups) will\n           have brain fMRIs performed at baseline and follow-up. Approximately 20 normative\n           controls will also undergo an fMRI to compare fMRI in affected women versus unaffected\n           controls. Measured outcomes will be differences in baseline brain activation during\n           bladder filling and in resting brain connectivity in UUI subjects compared to controls\n           as well as differences in treatment effect on brain activation and connectivity in\n           subjects receiving pharmacotherapy compared to those receiving hypnotherapy. Study\n           participants will be randomized to either pharmacotherapy or hypnotherapy groups using\n           a computer-generated randomization scheme in varying permuted block sizes.\n           Investigators involved in analyzing fMRI results, investigators analyzing the RCT\n           results and study personnel performing data entry will be blinded to knowledge of\n           subjects' treatment groups. Blinding of subjects to treatment is not feasible.\n\n      Visits for Study:\n\n      1)UUI study subjects Screening: Subjects who are interested in study participation will be\n      given information about the study and administered a screening questionnaire and be given\n      the opportunity to consider carefully whether they would like to participate in the study\n      Visit 1: Enrollment-- All subjects; Will be formally screened for eligibility prior to\n      signing the consent. (1) If eligible, written consent to participate will be obtained (2)\n      Will be administered the study questionnaires (3) Answer demographic questions and questions\n      about their past medical history(4) Undergo a Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantitation (POP-Q)\n      exam if they have not had one performed in the last year. Subjects will have cystometry\n      scheduled (5) Voiding diary will be reviewed (6) Subjects who are willing and able to\n      undergo fMRI will be screened and scheduled for that study (7) Behavioral interventions, a\n      standard treatment for urgency incontinence, will be discussed with all subjects and a\n      hand-out will be given to all subjects and arrangements for future contact with subjects\n      will be made.\n\n      Visit 2: Cystometry will be performed (see Visit 1). Subjects who will undergo fMRI will\n      also undergo a brief simulation of the fMRI tasks at this time, filling and emptying the\n      bladder. Subjects will undergo hypnotic susceptibility testing at this visit if at all\n      feasible (if not feasible, this will be performed at a separate visit prior to\n      randomization).\n\n      Visit 3 for fMRI Subjects: The baseline fMRI will be performed Randomization: The subjects\n      will be randomized to treatment interventions and contacted by the study personnel and\n      arrangements made for their interventions\n\n      Visits 3-10 for Hypnotherapy Treatments for those who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4-11 for\n      those who did undergo fMRI: Hypnotherapy sessions--Subjects assigned to hypnotherapy will be\n      scheduled for these visits which will be performed by a certified clinical hypnotherapist.\n      The subjects will have hypnotherapy sessions scheduled approximately weekly over 8 weeks.\n\n      Visits 3-10 for Pharmacotherapy Treatments for those who did not undergo fMRI, Visits 4-11\n      for those who did undergo fMRI--Medication Counseling Session: Subjects assigned to\n      pharmacotherapy will be scheduled for these visits which will be performed by trained\n      research personnel. The subjects will have pharmacotherapy counseling sessions scheduled\n      approximately weekly over 8 weeks.\n\n      Visit 12\u2014follow-up fMRI testing (for the fMRI group): Follow-up fMRI will be performed on\n      subjects who had baseline fMRIs performed.\n\n      Post Therapy visit--Visit 11 (for those who did not undergo fMRIs) or Visit 13 (for those\n      who did undergo fMRI): This study visit will be scheduled at the end of the hypnotherapy or\n      medication counseling sessions. Those who are in the subgroup who have undergone prior fMRI\n      testing will have it performed following completion of their active interventions. At the\n      final study visit, subjects will 1) be administered study questionnaires 2) They will return\n      their follow-up voiding diary\n\n      6 and 12 month follow-up visits may be conducted via phone or mail. Pharmacotherapy subjects\n      will continue to receive their medications for 1 year and Hypnotherapy subjects will be\n      encouraged to continue self-hypnosis with the aid of hypnotherapy recordings for 1 year.\n\n      2)Normative Controls participating in only the FMRI study: will be screened to ensure they\n      do not suffer from OAB and will give written informed consent. They will undergo a Pelvic\n      Organ Quantitation Exam, answer demographic questions and undergo cystometric testing and a\n      brief simulation of the fMRI tasks; filling and emptying the bladder. They will then have\n      their fMRI performed at a separate visit.\n\n      Description of Interventions:\n\n        1. Hypnotherapy:Hypnotherapy will be administered over 8 weeks by certified, trained\n           clinical hypnotherapists. The subjects will be informed that sessions will be\n           audio-recorded and one or more sessions will be reviewed by study personnel to ensure\n           that the hypnotherapist administers the hypnotherapy session in a standardized fashion.\n           Subjects will receive or download a digital recording specially prepared for them to\n           for home practice of hypnotherapy sessions. They will be encouraged to listen to the\n           CD/digital recording daily for one year.\n\n        2. Pharmacotherapy:Pharmacotherapy counseling sessions will be administered over 8 weeks\n           by trained research personnel. Subjects will be scheduled for visits with the\n           medication counselor who will review medications and their side effects. Subjects will\n           be informed that sessions will be audio-recorded and one or more sessions will be\n           reviewed by study personnel to ensure that the counseling is delivered in a\n           standardized fashion.If subjects state that in person visits are burdensome, these\n           visits may occur via phone. The study will use either of two standard, long acting\n           anti-cholinergic medications and dosages (Long acting Tolterodine or Extended Release\n           Oxybutynin or their equivalent generic substitutes). Following the 8 weeks of therapy\n           as described previously, subjects will continue to take their anti-cholinergic\n           medications or one year.\n\n      Description of Functional MRI:\n\n        1. FMRI Data Acquisition: High resolution T1 [TE (echo time) = 1.64 ms, TR (repetition\n           time) = 2.53 s, 7\u00b0 flip angle, number of excitations (NEX) = 1, slice thickness = 1 mm,\n           FOV (field of view) = 256 mm, resolution = 256 x 256] anatomic images will be collected\n           at the beginning of each experiment. For each of the FMRI tasks, echo-planar images\n           will be collected using a single-shot, gradient-echo\n\n        2. FMRI Subject and Task: Study participants will complete two tasks while undergoing\n           FMRI. Presentation software will be programmed to control stimulus presentation,\n           synchronize stimulus events with the scanner and collect response data for offline\n           analyses. To minimize neuronal activation associated with eye movements, subjects will\n           be instructed to maintain visual fixation throughout all trials on the centrally\n           presented cross. An eye-tracking device will be used to record saccades during the\n           experiment. Subjects will be scanned while undergoing bladder filling and emptying.\n\n        3. FMRI Image Processing: Preprocessing steps of fMRI data obtained during both tasks will\n           include slice correction, temporal auto-correlations correction and motion correction.\n           For task A, a voxel-wise multiple regression analysis will be used to estimate the beta\n           weights corresponding to the functional activation resulting from each of the separate\n           conditions. The multiple regression will contain one individually tailored demeaned\n           regressor corresponding to each individual subject's urge to void (urge regressor). The\n           urge regressor will resemble a step function, with each button press signaling the\n           onset of either increasing or decreasing subjective levels of urge to void. The\n           resulting step functions will then be convolved with a gamma variate function derived\n           from known parameters of the hemodynamic response. In addition, a regressor\n           corresponding to the inflation and the deflation of the bladder will be created by\n           convolving the experimental time-course with a gamma variate function. Connectivity\n           analysis will be performed using data from the extended resting task (unrelated to\n           bladder filling/withdrawal) Functional connectivity will be measured between specific\n           points and the remainder of the brain (i.e. whole brain analysis) as in our pilot\n           study. Averaged individual residualized time-courses from these spheres will be the\n           primary regressor in whole-brain BOLD connectivity analyses. Resultant Pearson's\n           correlation coefficients will then be converted to z-scores using Fisher's method and\n           blurred using a 10 mm Gaussian kernel & contrasted across the two groups using\n           independent sample T-tests Statistical Analysis\n\n             1. Specific Aim 1:\n\n                Investigators performed sample size calculations for change in UUI episodes and\n                change in OABq-SF scores based on investigators' pilot data & urgency incontinence\n                literature.6,7 The study design will use a non-inferiority design to compare the\n                primary outcome (change in UUI episodes in the hypnotherapy versus pharmacotherapy\n                groups). With respect to the outcome variable of percent reduction in UUI episodes\n                as determined by bladder diaries,investigators will use a one-sided\n                non-inferiority test at level alpha = 0.25 and a non-inferiority margin of 5%. If\n                \u03bc_h is the population mean percent reduction in incontinent episodes for the\n                hypnotherapy group, and \u03bc_m is the population mean percent reduction in\n                incontinent episodes for the medications group,investigators will then test\n                H_0:\u03bc_h-\u03bc_m\u2264-5 against the one-sided alternative H_0:\u03bc_h-\u03bc_m>-5  using\n                significance level 0.025. If the null hypothesis is rejected then investigators\n                may conclude hypnotherapy is not inferior to medication therapy, on average, by\n                more than 5%, and in fact may be superior to medication therapy, with respect to\n                percent reduction in incontinent episodes. The test may be performed by computing\n                the lower 97.5% one-sided confidence bound for \u03bc_h-\u03bc_m. If the lower confidence\n                bound exceeds -5% investigators will conclude non-inferiority of hypnotherapy.\n                Should that lower bound exceed zero investigators will conclude superiority.\n                Assuming a subject drop-out, withdrawal and missing data rate as high as 33%, 52\n                subjects will be available for analysis in both hypnotherapy and medications\n                groups. If \u03bc_h-\u03bc_m\u22659%, this sample size would provide power \u2265 80% for the\n                non-inferiority test. Improvement between hypnotherapy and controls will be\n                compared at baseline and follow-up at 2, 6, 12 months. Parameters will be compared\n                using a generalized linear mixed model analysis. If baseline differences between\n                groups are found (e.g. incontinence severity, coexisting illnesses, prior\n                treatment), appropriate variables will be added to the analysis as covariates.\n                Primary analyses will be performed using intention to treat. A per protocol\n                analysis will also be performed. Similar analyses will be performed comparing\n                group differences in change in questionnaire scores while accounting for other\n                covariates such as pain/interstitial cystitis or bowel abnormalities\n\n             2. Specific Aim 2.1 (Normative controls vs. urgency incontinence subjects):\n\n                Regions of interest containing the insula and anterior cingulate cortex will be\n                analyzed in keeping with the a priori hypothesis using two way ANCOVA with group\n                as the between subject's factor and age as a covariate. Pre-treatment \u03b2 weights\n                for both bladder filling and urgency regressor effect on anterior cingulate cortex\n                and insula signal among normative subjects will be compared to the effect on\n                signal in urgency incontinence subjects. The planned study size allows detection\n                of differences between groups with an effect size >0.8 with power of 0.8, smaller\n                than the observed effect size in the pilot study.43 The effect size observed in\n                the pilot study (Cohen's d ranged from 0.8 to 1.5) suggests that the study will be\n                adequately powered (greater than 0.8) to reject the null hypothesis at an\n                alpha=0.05. In addition to analysis of prior regions of interest, group wise whole\n                brain contrast will also be performed using an identical statistical model. False\n                positives will be corrected at a significance threshold corresponding to p <.005\n                applied in combination with a minimum cluster size threshold of 32 native voxels\n                (p < 0.05), parameters derived from 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations.80 Analysis of\n                between group differences in functional connectivity will be performed in a\n                similar fashion to that used to analyze brain activation evoked by bladder filling\n                and emptying. The large observed effect size in the preliminary data (>3) suggests\n                that the sample size used for proposed analysis of evoked potentials will be more\n                than adequate.\n\n             3. Specific Aim 2.2 Efficacy of hypnotherapy and pharmacotherapy on anterior\n                cingulate cortex and right insula activation will be compared using a 2x2 (Group x\n                Time) mixed model ANCOVA to correct for potential differences in group\n                characteristics (e.g. age). Analysis of treatment effect will be focused on the\n                anterior cingulate cortex and insula based on preliminary data that suggests the\n                effect size for change in activation will be highest in these regions. Current\n                study size will be able to detect differences between pre and post treatment\n                signal within a treatment group with an effect size of approximately 0.5 and a\n                power of 0.8. Minimal effect size would be approximately equivalent to a 60%\n                decrease in the excess (above normative control) anterior cingulate cortex and\n                insula signal. Investigators predict a main effect of time, suggesting that both\n                treatments are effective in reducing activity within the anterior cingulate cortex\n                and insula. However, investigators also predict a significant Group x Time\n                interaction, indicating that that change in activity will be greater for the\n                hypnotherapy relative to the pharmacotherapy group. Minimum detectable effect size\n                for the Group X Time interaction is 0.7 with power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05.\n                Simple effects tests will also be conducted to ensure that randomization to\n                treatment arm was successful (i.e. no differences in baseline activity across the\n                two groups).\n\n      Similar analyses will be conducted to evaluate the effect of treatment on functional\n      connectivity. Current study size will be able to detect within-group differences between pre\n      and post treatment signal with a minimal effect size of approximately 0.5 and a power of\n      0.8, much lower than the observed effect size of >3 in the pilot study. The minimum effect\n      size would be reached with a 15% decrement in anterior cingulate cortex to insula\n      connectivity. As for evoked activity investigators predict both a main effect of time, and\n      predict a significant Group x Time interaction, indicating that change in functional\n      connectivity will be greater for the hypnotherapy relative to the pharmacotherapy group.\n      Minimum detectable effect size for the Group X Time interaction is 0.7 with power of 0.8 and\n      alpha of 0.05.This minimum effect size will be reached when between group differences in\n      anterior cingulate cortex to insula connectivity are \u2265 30%.\n\n      Missing Data:\n\n      Standard procedures will be used to ensure that data are as complete and accurate as\n      possible. In order to decrease missing data, data collection forms will be designed for\n      recording measurements and the Redcap (Research Electronic Data Capture) System will be used\n      by the research staff for data management. Study personnel will check the data collection\n      forms for completeness before study participants leave the clinic so that missing clinical\n      information may be addressed while study participants are still in the clinic. Downloads\n      will be performed to check for missing values and skipped entries using SAS\u00ae programming and\n      will be designed to avoid skipped entries and allow flagging of missing data. For\n      individuals that withdraw from the study or have missing visits, investigators will collect\n      information on the reasons for those missed visits. That information, coupled with data\n      collected from earlier visits will be used to develop comparisons of the two treatment arms\n      using pattern mixture models. Investigators will use multiple imputation based on a model\n      conditional on baseline covariates, treatment group, and the previous measures. Separate\n      imputation models will be used for the two groups.\n\n      Data management: Data will be collected on CRFs approved by the UNMH HRPO including\n      demographic and patient history forms, eligibility forms, questionnaires, Cystometrics and\n      fMRI task data sheets, pharmacotherapy side effect and hypnotherapy practice logs, treatment\n      compliance logs as well as forms related to adverse event tracking. As noted above data base\n      has been constructed using the web-based platform, REDCap\u00ae The study's data entry personnel\n      will receive only coded information that is entered into the database under those\n      identification numbers. A separate log linking patient codes and unique patient identifiers\n      will be kept on password protected computer available only to study personnel. CRFs will\n      include forms used to collect subject information including demographic, medical history\n      forms, questionnaires, compliance forms, fMRI screening forms, inclusion and exclusion\n      criteria forms as well as patient behavioral therapy instruction handouts. The Mind Research\n      Network (MRN) investigators (investigators responsible for performing the fMRIs) will\n      collect data using standardized paper forms or digitally. Data will only be identified with\n      the study's unique identifier (ID) for the participant. The link between the name of the\n      participant and the study ID will be kept confidential by the MRN on a secure portal. All\n      data storage devices at the Mind Research Network are encrypted devices. Personally\n      identifying information will not be stored in files on networked computers and paper forms.\n      Such information will be kept in separate locked file cabinets. Electronic data are doubly\n      protected against computer catastrophe. Data will be backed up daily. The backup system will\n      be used only by a designated administrator, preventing accidental deletion even by project\n      staff.\n\n      Quality Control\n\n        1. RCT outcomes:\n\n           a) Research study members who distribute and evaluate the voiding diary(s) will\n           complete a training and certification process b) Research study members who distribute\n           the treatment compliance and expectation questions will be trained and certified on\n           their administration and interpretation\n\n        2. FMRI outcomes:\n\n           BOLD-related evoked activity and functional connectivity maps will both undergo\n           extensive QA procedures.\n\n             1. The transformation matrix registering each subject's functional data to structural\n                space will be visualized for accuracy (for both the evoked and resting state data)\n\n             2. Raw images will be examined for excessive motion as well as artifacts. In\n                addition, the degree of motion will also be quantified for each individual based\n                on the first two statistical moments from the cohort using previously published\n                algorithms at the end of the study\n\n             3. Investigators will examine the fit of different modeling parameters on a\n                per-subject basis.\n\n        3. Description of Plan for Data Quality and Management and Data Collection Forms: The\n           study staff under the over site of the PIs will review data collection forms on an\n           ongoing basis for data completeness and accuracy as well as protocol compliance. Data\n           verification will be performed by personnel other than the individual performing data\n           entry onto the database on 10% of data collected. The results of the data review will\n           be incorporated into the reports for each DSMB meeting and in the Annual Report. Data\n           collection forms will be maintained as part of Good Clinical Practice (GCP). Research\n           coordinator will review data collection forms for completeness."
