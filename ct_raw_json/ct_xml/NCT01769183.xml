      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy in the use of topical Squalamine
      Lactate Ophthalmic Solution, 0.2% in the treatment of retinal neovascularization resulting
      from proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

    <description>Study eyes will be assigned to receive Squalamine.  The dose will be one drop twice daily.  If neovascularization fails to regress at week one or if neovascularization returns within the study, the dose will be increased to four times daily.  In that case, a one day and one week visit will be added after increasing the dose. Patients will continue administering study drug until week 20.</description>

    <description>Patients will start with Squalamine one drop twice daily to the affected eye.  If at one week the neovascularization shows no sign of regression, then the dose will be doubled to four times daily with a follow up at one day and one week following the increased dose frequency, then resuming the schedule at four weeks.  If neovascularization returns within the study, the dose will be doubled to four times daily.  In that case, a one day and one week visit will be added after increasing the dose.  Squalamine treatment will discontinue after the week 20 visit.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt;= 18 years

          -  Individuals &lt;18 years old are not being included because PDR is so rare  in this age
             group that the diagnosis of PDR may be questionable.

          -  Diagnosis of diabetes mellitus (type 1 or type 2)

          -  Any one of the following will be considered to be sufficient evidence that diabetes
             is present:

          -  Current regular use of insulin for the treatment of diabetes

          -  Current regular use of oral anti-hyperglycemia agents for the treatment of diabetes

          -  Documented diabetes by ADA and/or WHO criteria (see Procedures Manual for
             definitions)

          -  At least one eye meets the study eye criteria

          -  Able and willing provide informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Significant renal disease, defined as a history of chronic renal failure requiring
             dialysis or kidney transplant.

          -  A condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would preclude participation in
             the study (e.g., unstable medical status including blood pressure, cardiovascular
             disease, and glycemic control).

          -  Individuals in poor glycemic control who, within the last 4 months, initiated
             intensive insulin treatment (a pump or multiple daily injections) or plan to do so in
             the next 4 months should not be enrolled.

          -  Participation in an investigational trial within 30 days of randomization that
             involved treatment with any drug that has not received regulatory approval for the
             indication being studied.

          -  Note: study participants cannot receive another investigational drug while
             participating in the study.

          -  Known allergy to any component of the study drug.

          -  Blood pressure &gt; 180/110 (systolic above 180 or diastolic above 110).

          -  If blood pressure is brought below 180/110 by anti-hypertensive treatment, individual
             can become eligible.

          -  Myocardial infarction, other acute cardiac event requiring hospitalization, stroke,
             transient ischemic attack, or treatment for acute congestive heart failure within 4
             months prior to randomization.

          -  Systemic anti-VEGF or pro-VEGF treatment within 4 months prior to randomization.

          -  These drugs should not be used during the study.

          -  For women of child-bearing potential: pregnant or lactating or intending to become
             pregnant within the next 3 years.

          -  Women who are potential study participants should be questioned about the potential
             for pregnancy. Investigator judgment is used to determine when a pregnancy test is
             needed.

          -  Individual is expecting to move out of the area of the clinical center during the
             study.

          -  History of allergy to Squalamine
