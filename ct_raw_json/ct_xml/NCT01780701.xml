  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prostate cancer diagnosis starts a list of events that often leads to fast-moving
      treatment, thought by many to result in vast over-treatment of this disease. So, discovery
      of different diagnostic methods that allow clinicians to identify slow-growing from
      potentially fast-growing disease prior to or at the time of prostate biopsy could result in
      early and suitable treatment for men at greatest risk, while greatly decreasing the number
      of biopsies, surgical procedures, hormonal and chemotherapeutic treatments, cost, and
      patient worry, for those with more slow-growing disease.
