Changing care systems\n      has been a standard treatment for CL discomfort for many years.   In the same survey, 30% of\n      practitioners felt there is absolutely no difference among solutions with respect to\n      reducing dryness and discomfort.\n\n      The investigators set out to compare the clinical performance of these two solutions: AMO's\n      RevitaLens and Alcon's Opti-Free PureMoist."
