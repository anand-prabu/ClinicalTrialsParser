Identify the toxicity associated with increasing doses of monoclonal antibody\n      F19 (BIBH-1) administered weekly by intravenous infusion in patients with unresectable,\n      advanced or metastatic fibroblast activation protein-positive colorectal cancer. II.\n      Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of this drug in these\n      patients. III. Measure induction titers of human anti-human antibody to BIBH-1 and correlate\n      immunologic-related clinical effects. IV. Determine the pharmacokinetics, biodistribution,\n      and imaging characteristics of increasing intravenous doses of the drug. V. Document tumor\n      responses in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, open label, multicenter study. Patients receive\n      monoclonal antibody F19 (BIBH-1) IV over 60 minutes weekly for 12 weeks. The first, fifth,\n      and ninth treatments are combined with iodine I 131. Patients with stable or responding\n      disease may continue treatment for up to 12 months. The dose of BIBH-1 is escalated in\n      cohorts of 3-6 patients until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is\n      defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 8 months."
