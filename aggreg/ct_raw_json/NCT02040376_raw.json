Survivors with a shunt will be\n             included in the trial, but will need to be identified prior to study enrollment to\n             discuss any specific considerations for imaging.\n\n          5.

Patient who is pregnant or lactating and does not agree to stop breastfeeding while\n             receiving trial treatment.\n\n          9. Have a history of renal disease or renal dysfunction e.g., as suggested by elevated\n             serum creatinine levels (see 5.a. Inclusion criteria) or abnormal creatinine\n             clearance.\n\n         10. Have a history of congestive heart failure requiring pharmacologic treatment.\n\n         11.
