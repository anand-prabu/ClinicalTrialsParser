  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the 2 year progression-free survival in men with
      recurrent PSA-only disease after prostatectomy receiving combined enzalutamide and standard
      androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT) with salvage radiation therapy.  Eligible men will have
      recurrent PSA-only prostate cancer within 4 years of prostatectomy, and a PSA of 0.2 - 4 in
      the absence of metastatic disease on CT and bone scans. In addition to standard ADT and
      radiation therapy, research participants will take enzalutamide once daily for six months.
      It is primarily hypothesized the 2 year PFS rate will be improved with the combined therapy
      compared to the historical control data in a similar patients setting.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma.  Variants of prostate
             cancer, including neuroendocrine features and small cell carcinoma of the prostate,
             are not permitted.

          -  Gleason sum of 7, 8, 9, or 10 at the time of prostatectomy.

          -  PSA relapse within 4 years of prostatectomy defined by persistently detectable or
             rising PSA after surgery.

          -  Evidence of disease recurrence or progression as evidenced by a PSA &gt; 0.20.  This
             requires 2 consecutive rises in PSA, at least 1 week apart, over the
             post-prostatectomy nadir or one PSA value above 0.20 ng/mL if the patient failed to
             achieve a post-prostatectomy nadir of &lt; 0.2 ng/mL.

             period and for 3 months after final study drug administration.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Radiographic evidence of metastatic disease.  Patients with node-positive disease at
             the time of radical prostatectomy are eligible.  Patients with pelvic nodes up to 2
