Treatment continues weekly for 2 weeks followed by one week of rest.\n      Courses are repeated every 3 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 11-22 patients will be accrued for this study over 12 months."
