    <textblock>
      Eating Disorders are a debilitating and serious mental illness.  This illness is associated
      with medical complications, psychological and social impairment.  Families of people with an
      eating disorder also report that they lack resources and have many unmet needs.  Families
      often have insufficient information regarding the eating disorder, available treatment
      options and strategies for supporting the person with the illness. The purpose of this study
      is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different family interventions for people with
      eating disorders and their family members (parents or partners) receiving treatment either
      in the inpatient or day treatment Eating Disorder Program at the Toronto General Hospital,
      University Health Network.  Family supportive counseling consists of people with eating
      disorders and their family members meeting with a family therapist.  Multi-family group
      therapy involves eight to ten families who meet as a group with two therapists. The
      investigators are conducting a study to assess the differences between these two different
      family interventions.  This study will help us identify who benefits the most from
      participating in family supportive counseling or multi-family therapy.  The investigators
      are also evaluating which intervention is more effective at helping the person with the
      eating disorder overcome their illness while helping their family members learn how to
      support the recovery process. Both family therapy interventions are delivered by experienced
      family therapy clinicians who work in either the Inpatient or Day Treatment Eating Disorder
      Program at Toronto General Hospital.

      Background: Bulimia Nervosa (BN) is a serious and persistent mental illness with a high rate
      of mortality and morbidity.  Research demonstrates that individuals with BN have high
      drop-out rates, multiple re-admissions to tertiary care programs and high relapse rates all
      of which may contribute to the chronicity of this illness. A systematic review of randomized
      controlled trials for eating disorders reveals dropout rates ranging from 0-43%. Individuals
      with BN are at the highest risk for relapse during the first three months following the
      completion of inpatient treatment for BN.  A higher BMI at completion of an intensive eating
      disorder program and weight maintenance immediately following treatment are associated with
      lower relapse rates at six and twelve months. Women with chronic BN have a poorer quality of
      life than women in the general population in a variety of domains. Individuals with BN have
      access to a smaller support network outside of their nuclear family compared with normal
      controls.  They are often confronted with negative stereotypes and stigmatizing attitudes
      from the general public  who often perceive affected individuals as having control over
      their eating behaviours.  Fear of being stigmatized and negatively stereotyped, a poor
      quality of life, a smaller social support network and lower expectations of receiving
      appropriate support, may contribute to and heighten the reliance of individuals with BN on
      their immediate families for emotional and instrumental support.  The over-reliance on
      families for support may contribute to duress in families who may be willing to assist the
      person afflicted with BN but lack the sufficient knowledge and skills to effectively
      intervene to assist with the significant medical and psychological impairment that results
      from this illness.

      Caregivers of individuals with eating disorders experience significant distress  poor
      quality of life, and intense feelings of self-blame and shame as a result of their
      caregiving role. Caregivers often feel responsible for causing a loved one to develop the
      illness, and these feelings are often reinforced by professionals.  In fact, the general
      public is more likely to blame families for causing BN compared with other mental illnesses
      such as schizophrenia.  Poor family functioning in families of individuals with BN is
      predicted by problematic eating symptoms, conflict about how best to support the affected
      person, stigma and lack of social support.  Concerns and fears that their loved one will be
      discriminated against or labeled negatively have been shown to result in family members
      withdrawing from their own social support network. Social support has been shown to mitigate
      caregiver distress and burden and poor health in carers of individuals with mental
      illnesses.  Hence, an intervention is required to increase social support for individuals
      and their family members while providing educational information that challenges stigma,
      self-blame and shame.

      Caring for an adult with chronic BN creates many challenges for the carer, including
      psychological duress, social isolation, stigma and poor family functioning. In turn,
      increased family conflict may exacerbate illness behaviours in the person with BN.  Due to
      the emaciated appearance of the person with BN and the life threatening nature of this
      illness, family members may become overly protective and avoid discussions that may be
      distressing to the affected individual.  Anxiety and depression may further heighten
      caregiver distress and intensify their propensity to over-protect the affected individual.
      Family members may also respond to severe symptoms by accommodating to the illness while
      taking on responsibility for the affected person in ways that are not age-appropriate.
      Negative feelings may be increased in the carers when their efforts to assist and motivate
      the person into treatment are met with denial about the seriousness of the illness and
      ambivalence to engage in treatment.  These responses may elicit criticism from carers,
      especially if they perceive the eating symptoms as volitional.  Emotional over-involvement,
      accommodation and criticism can have negative influences on the person with BN including
      heightened distress, decreased willingness to seek help and poorer treatment outcomes.  An
      intervention is urgently needed to address the burden that this illness imposes on families
      and improve the quality of life of the carer, while teaching communication and problem
      solving skills that facilitate recovery from BN.

      In the last decade, Multi-family group therapy (MFT) has been recognized internationally as
      an innovative approach to working with families of BN adolescents and has been shown to
      contribute to positive outcomes. MFT has also been widely employed and shown to be effective
      in families of adults affected with other mental illnesses including substance abuse,
      bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. To date, MFT has not been investigated in families of
      adults with BN. Given the evidence that demonstrates the efficacy of MFT in adolescent BN
      and other mental illnesses in adults, the proposed research study seeks to assess the
      efficacy of MFT for adults with BN and their families.

      Overview of Proposed Study: In this study, the investigators propose to investigate MFT,
      which has never before been studied in adults with BN and their carers.  The overarching
      objective will be to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing MFT with treatment as
      usual (TAU) in patients receiving intensive treatment for BN and their carers.

      Hypotheses and Research Questions:  This proposed randomized controlled trial aims to
      provide pilot data regarding the efficacy of Multi-Family Therapy (MFT) in improving
      treatment outcomes for patients with Bulimia Nervosa (BN) and in reducing caregiver
      distress. Compared with patients not participating in MFT, the investigators hypothesize
      that patients with BN and their carers participating in MFT will have: 1) lower drop out
      rates, 2) higher likelihood of sustaining a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 or higher at three
      months post-treatment,  3) greater improvement in general psychological health for carers
      from pre-treatment to three months post-treatment, and 4) reductions in the adverse impact
      of caregiving, expressed emotion and accommodation of eating behaviours at three months
      post-treatment. Finally, the investigators expect that descriptive data will show that MFT
      is a feasible, acceptable option for patients with BN and their carers.
