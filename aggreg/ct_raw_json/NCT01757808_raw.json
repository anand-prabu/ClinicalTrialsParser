The primary objective is:\n\n        -  To estimate the effect of ranolazine administration on acute hemodynamics.\n\n        -  To assess safety of ranolazine acutely over 6 hrs in the catheterization lab and after\n           12 weeks of therapy\n\n        -  To assess changes in right ventricular function after 12 weeks of therapy."

            "textblock": "Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a medical disorder in which pressure in the blood vessels\n      going from the right side of the heart to the lungs is higher than normal.  The increased\n      blood pressure in the lungs places a strain on the heart.  This strain causes the heart to\n      pump less blood into the lungs, causing physical symptoms of shortness of breath and\n      tiredness.  The added strain to the heart can cause physical symptoms of swelling in the\n      feet and abdomen.  These symptoms can get worse over time due to the decreased pumping\n      ability of the heart.\n\n      This study will use a drug called ranolazine. This drug has been approved by the Food and\n      Drug Administration (FDA) to treat chronic angina (chest pain). However, since it has not\n      been approved for use in PAH its use in this study is considered experimental."
