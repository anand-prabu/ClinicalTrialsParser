However, military combat rations\n      must meet rigorous shelf-stability guidelines (e.g.,, 3 years at 80\u00b0F or 6 months at 100\u00b0F),\n      which is problematic for natural food sources of n-3s (e.g., oil and fish), which degrade\n      when exposed to high temperatures and prolonged shelf-storage.  Encapsulation, e.g., coating\n      freeze dried n-3s with gelatin, can prevent this degradation, and Natick Soldier Research,\n      Development and Engineering Center's (NSRDEC) Combat Feeding Directorate used encapsulated\n      n-3 technology to produce n-3 enriched ration items that withstand environmental stressors\n      and meet shelf-life specifications for military rations.  However, the bioavailability of\n      the encapsulated n-3s in these rations is unknown, particularly when they are incorporated\n      into high-protein food items and exposed to high temperatures and prolonged storage.  In\n      this randomized, cross-over study, civilian and/or military personnel will be asked to\n      consume: 1) a high protein food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) and previously\n      stored for 6 months at 100\u00b0F; 2) a low-protein food item enriched with encapsulated n-3s\n      (600 mg) and previously stored for 6 months at 100\u00b0F; 3) a high protein food item with\n      encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not subjected to high-temperature and prolonged storage;\n      and, 4) a low-protein food item with encapsulated n-3s (600 mg) that was not subjected to\n      high temperature and prolonged storage.  Serial blood sampling to measure acute changes in\n      the circulating fatty acid profile will occur in the hour before and 6 hours after\n      consumption of each ration component.  The only known risks, which this study presents to\n      participants, are those associated with venous catheter placement.  The results will help\n      military ration developers determine the ration components best suited for n-3\n      fortification."
