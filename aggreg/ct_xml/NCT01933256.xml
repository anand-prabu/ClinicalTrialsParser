  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HIP2B is being developed for the treatment of type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus.

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and tolerability of repeat doses of
      HIP2B in subjects with type 2 diabetes mellitus.  The study will also assess whether islet
      β-cell number and function will increase over time in response to repeat HIP2B injections.
