      Abstract:

      Background: Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) had proven efficacy in pain relief,
      correction of nutritional status and improving the performance status. However, lack of
      standardization is the major obstacle for any scientific evaluation of any CAM trial.
      Mucositis is a major complication of irradiation in head and neck (H&amp;N) tumors, the addition
      of chemotherapy to irradiation may enhance this dose limiting problem. Licorice is a strong
      demulcent that had been effectively used in treatment of peptic ulcer. The main purpose of
      this study was to compare the therapeutic safety and efficacy of T. and L. mucoadhesive
      films on oral mucositis in terms of pain control and/or ulcer treatment.

      Methods and Materials: the study was a double-blind, randomized prospective trial of two
      types of mucoadhesive films in the management of oral mucositis occurred during head and
      neck cancer ( HNC ) radiotherapy. oral mucositis was assessed using a quantitative scale
      (WHO scales) and symptoms were assessed using visual analogue scales (VAS). 60 patients were
      enrolled in the study; there were 30 patients in the Triamcinolone (T) and 30 in the
      Licorice (L) group. In the T- group, patients received triamcinolone acetonide mucoadhesive
      films containing 1mg of the drug and patients in the L- group received licorice mucoadhesive
      films, an herbal agent. Data were collected at baseline, then twice a week for 4 weeks.
