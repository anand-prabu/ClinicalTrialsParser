Use of tobacco products within the past 6 months (since nicotine may affect\n             intestinal permeability).\n\n          3. Abdominal surgeries (except appendectomy, cholecystectomy and vaginal hysterectomy or\n             tubal ligation)\n\n          4. Use of Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs(NSAIDs) or aspirin within the past week\n             (since Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) affect intestinal permeability).\n\n          5. Use of oral corticosteroids within the previous 6 weeks.\n\n          6. Ingestion of artificial sweeteners such as Splenda\u2122 (sucralose), Nutrasweet \u2122\n             (aspartame), lactulose or mannitol 2 days before the study tests begins, e.g., foods\n             to be avoided are sugarless gums or mints and diet soda.\n\n          7. Bleeding disorders or medications that increase risk of bleeding from mucosal\n             biopsies.\n\n          8. High anxiety or depression score (>11 on each subscale) on the Hospital Anxiety\n             Depression Score questionnaire.\n\n          9. Known allergy to fluorescein."
