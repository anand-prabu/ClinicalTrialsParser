Radiolabeled monoclonal\n      antibodies can locate tumor cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances\n      to them without harming normal cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop\n      tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Interferon may interfere with the\n      growth of cancer cells. Combining monoclonal antibody, chemotherapy, and interferon alfa may\n      kill more tumor cells."

Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of intraperitoneal paclitaxel and topotecan\n      when administered as a radiosensitizer prior to intraperitoneal lutetium Lu 177 monoclonal\n      antibody CC49 (177Lu-CC49) following subcutaneous interferon alfa-2b (IFN-A) in patients\n      with persistent or recurrent ovarian cancer.\n\n      II. Determine the toxicity associated with intraperitoneal paclitaxel and topotecan in these\n      patients.\n\n      III. Examine the conjugate stability, pharmacokinetics, and biodistribution of 177Lu-CC49\n      given 48 hours after intraperitoneal paclitaxel.\n\n      IV. Determine the effects of IFN-A and intraperitoneal paclitaxel on 177Lu-CC49 tumor\n      localization and dosimetry estimates compared to a prior trial with 177Lu-CC49 alone.\n\n      V. Determine the MTD of yttrium Y 90 monoclonal antibody CC49 (90Y-CC49) when administered\n      with IFN-A and the dose of paclitaxel used at the MTD level of IFN-A, paclitaxel, and\n      177Lu-CC49.\n\n      VI.
