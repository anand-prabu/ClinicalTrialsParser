The intervention lasted for 24 weeks, with weekly phone calls for the first 12 weeks and 4 maintenance calls over the second 12 weeks. Study measurements were taken at baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, and 52 weeks. After 24 weeks, the investigators randomly divided the intervention group in half. The first group did not receive any more phone calls from the interventionist. The second group continued to receive monthly 20-minute phone calls from the interventionist. At 52 weeks post-baseline participants from both groups had their labs drawn, wore a pedometer for 3 days, and called in with a self-reported weight."

Three randomized trials have demonstrated\n      that intensive behavioral interventions can prevent or delay the onset of diabetes. The\n      purpose of this pilot study is to inform a future randomized, controlled Phase III trial of\n      a population-based, telephonic, exercise and weight loss intervention to translate the\n      findings of the Diabetes Prevention Program into practice. The telephonic intervention will\n      be compared to usual care (30 participants in each group). The investigators will deliver\n      the intervention in 12 weekly, 20-minute calls, with four subsequent maintenance calls, for\n      a total of 16 calls over 24 weeks. Study outcomes will be measured at baseline and at 12 and\n      24 weeks.\n\n      For this planning grant the investigators do not have an overall hypothesis. The\n      investigators' goal is to develop and test whether it is possible to do exercise and weight\n      loss"
