            "textblock": "Platelet recovery is significantly hampered following umbilical cord blood (UCB)\n      transplantation.  Median time to platelet engraftment (defined as the first of 7 consecutive\n      days of an unsupported platelet count of at least 20,000/microliter) in a large\n      retrospective study  was more than 70 days and cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at\n      6 months was 50.5%. In the pediatric population with acute leukemia median time to platelet\n      engraftment with UCB transplantation was 59 days and cumulative incidence of platelet\n      recovery at 6 months was 43%-73%, depending on human leukocyte antigen (HLA) disparity and\n      cell dose. Recently, in a cohort of adult patients given myeloablative conditioning followed\n      by double UCB transplantation, the cumulative incidence of platelet recovery (\u2265\n      50,000/microliter)at 100 days was 53%. In another cohort of patients given reduced intensity\n      conditioning regimen followed by single or double UCB transplantation, the median time to\n      platelet recovery (\u2265 50,000/microliter) and cumulative incidence of platelet recovery at 6\n      months were 49 days and 65%, respectively. Thus, after UCB transplantations, patients are\n      platelet transfusion-dependent for prolong periods of time, resulting in many drawbacks,\n      such as exposure to blood transfusions hazards, higher incidence of platelet allo-reactivity\n      and extended periods of bleeding diathesis and undesirable costly and long hospitalizations.\n\n      Eltrombopag is a thrombopoietin-receptor agonist that initiates thrombopoietin-receptor\n      signaling and thereby inducing proliferation and maturation of megakaryocytes.Administration\n      of eltrombopag increased platelet production in volunteers with normal platelet counts,\n      patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C virus infection and in patients with\n      chronic immune thrombocytopenic purpura.\n\n      We will evaluate the safety and efficacy of eltrombopag treatment given early after UCB\n      transplantation. The study is an open non-comparative study. The primary outcome will be\n      cumulative incidence of partial platelet engraftment (first of 7 consecutive days of an\n      unsupported platelet count of at least 20,000/microliter)at day 50 post transplantation.\n      Secondary objectives are safety, tolerability and other transplantation related outcomes."
