      This is a study of treatment approaches aimed to improve self-control and decrease stress
      and unhealthy/maladaptive behaviors such as drinking, overeating, and smoking.

      High levels of stress may make it harder to maintain self-control, especially when trying to
      control our unhealthy behaviors. Training on improving self control and decreasing stress
      may help decrease unhealthy behaviors. The goal of this new training program will be to
      decrease a subject's unhealthy behavior by helping them better manage their stress and
      improve their self control over unhealthy habits.

      This study proposes to pilot a mindfulness based affect-regulation treatment approach to
      improve self-control and physiological and biochemical indicators of stress, as well as
      decrease unhealthy/maladaptive behaviors such as drinking, overeating, and smoking. The
      broad aims of the treatment approach will be to teach participants to (1) observe and
      increase awareness of cognitive, affective, bodily sensations/expressions and action-urge
      components of emotional/compulsion experiences; and (2) develop alternate affective,
      behavioral and cognitive coping strategies in managing and regulating affect/urge
      experiences. It is hoped that the findings from this study will aid in the further
      development of treatment and prevention programs targeting stress reduction and coping to
      improve control over maladaptive behaviors and decrease physical and mental health symptoms.

      Aims:

        1. Develop a mindfulness based affect-regulation therapy manual, and training materials to
           train therapists on a treatment approach aimed at improving self-control over unhealthy
           addictive behaviors.

        2. Develop and implement &quot;Stress in Control&quot; (SynC) training competence and adherence
           rating scales;

        3. Conduct a preliminary study using the SynC manual, which will evaluate the
           effectiveness and feasibility of SynC in comparison to a Primary Care Treatment Control
           Group and a Historical Control Group approach for 100 individuals interested in help in
           decreasing targeted unhealthy behaviors. Primary outcomes will be a reduction in
           unhealthy problem behaviors, and secondary outcomes will be decrease in measures of
           stress, and increases in emotion regulation and self control.

        4. (secondary aim) Collect baseline data on measures of self control, mood, coping,
           personality, cognitive functioning, acute and chronic stress, and mental and physical
           health on a large sample of subjects seeking help in decreasing unhealthy behaviors.
