  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A split-thickness skin graft (STSG) is used for a large wounds or wounds that cannot be
      closed by primary and secondary wound closure. STSG is taken with the epidermis and part of
      the dermis from an uninjured area (donor site) to an area of skin loss (recipient site).Most
      patients have more discomfort at donor site than graft site. Accelerated
      re-epithelialization rate and minimizing pain and infection are main goals of donor care.
      Traditionally, skin graft donor sites have been dressed with paraffin gauze dressing
      (Jelonet速) or medicated paraffin gauze dressing (Bactigras速 and Sofra-tulle速). These
      dressing are inexpensive but adhere to the wound surface and cannot absorb exudates. Thus,
      we have developed a new biomaterial based on Thai silk for wound dressing application. Silk
      is composed of two types of proteins, fibroin and sericin. Silk fibroin (SF) has been used
      as biomedical materials because it has oxygen permeability, water vapor permeability,
      biodegradability, biocompatibility and minimal inflammatory reaction. Silk sericin (SS) has
      also been used as biomedical materials because it has moisturizing properties, collagen
      promoting activity and enhances attachment of cultured human skin fibroblasts. Thus, silk
      fibroin and silk sericin (SF/SS) were selected to produce wound dressing in this study. The
      objective of this study is to compare wound dressing containing silk fibroin with bioactive
      coating layer with standard dressing (medicated paraffin gauze dressing; Bactigras速), with
      regard to healing time, patients' pain intensity, skin's transepidermal water loss after
      healing and evidence of infection in the treatment of split-thickness skin graft donor
      sites. The study design is a randomized, controlled, self paired clinical trial. Patients
      age 18 to 60 years and undergo STSG at thigh in Division of Plastic and Reconstructive
      Surgery, Department of Surgery, King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital between November 2013
      and May 2015 will be recruited in the study. The exclusion criteria are donor sites other
      than thigh area or located at high risk of infection. Patients who are immunocompromised or
      diabetes mellitus or psychiatric disorders or low serum albumin level (less than 3.0 g/dL)
      or known allergic to SS or SF or paraffin or chlorhexidine acetate are also excluded. All
      subjects sign the informed consents after discussion the protocol, benefits and risks. The
      donor site will be divided into two equal halves, each site will be randomized to receive
      the wound dressing containing silk fibroin with bioactive coating layer or the medicated
      paraffin gauze dressing. The donor site wounds will be observed daily. The dressings will
      not be changed, except when they are fully soaked with exudates and easily fell off or any
      sign of infection. Healing time will be recorded when the dressing separate completely from
      the donor site, no exudates and no pain when the donor site is exposed to air. The patient's
      pain level will be evaluated with the visual analogue scale and the donor site wounds will
      be observed daily for signs of infection. On the day of the wound is recorded for healing
      time and 1 weeks, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 months after that, the skin barrier function (TEWL) of
      each site will be measured using a Tewameter (Courage &amp; Khazaka , GmbH). Blood sample will
      be collected from patients pre- and postoperatively (within day 3) for hepatic and renal
      function analysis.
