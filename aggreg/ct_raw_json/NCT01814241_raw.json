Each subject\n      will then undergo a modified rush phase in which the subject receives 6 doses of peanut\n      protein in one day. The build-up phase begins afterward in which the subject's dose of\n      peanut protein is increased every 2 weeks for 36 weeks. After the final build-up dose, the\n      subject consumes that dose for 2 weeks after which he or she returns to the food allergy\n      center for the second food challenge. If the subject successfully consumes this food\n      challenge without symptoms, the daily dosing of peanut protein will be stopped and the\n      subject will then undergo a third food challenge. If the subject successfully consumes the\n      peanut protein during that challenge, he or she will return for a fourth food challenge to\n      peanut."
