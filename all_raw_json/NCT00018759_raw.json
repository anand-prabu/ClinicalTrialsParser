It\n      is hypothesized that platelets of hypertensive patients with depressive symptomatology with\n      be hyper-responsive to serotonin.  Additionally, treatment with an SSRI antidepressant is\n      expected to produce a down-regulation of the serotonin receptor with an associated reduction\n      in platelet cytosolic calcium response as well as improved mood."
