The evaluation of samples\n      obtained from the pharynx is exploratory and will provide new information on the frequency\n      of pharyngeal infection due to CT and GC.\n\n      A secondary objective will be to evaluate the prevalence of Trichomonas vaginalis in vaginal\n      and rectal samples using both the Xpert system and AC2 to assess whether women positive for\n      this pathogen rectally usually or always have vaginal infection due to this pathogen.\n\n      The investigators hypothesis is that real-time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) amplification\n      testing with the Cepheid Xpert CT/NG will have greater sensitivity than culture in detecting\n      Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal samples. The investigators also hypothesize that Xpert CT/NG\n      will be equivalent to the Gen-Probe APTIMA Combo2 (AC2) in detecting Chlamydia trachomatis\n      and Neisseria gonorrhoeae in rectal samples."

There are multiple studies in the literature\n      evaluating NAAT assays in diagnosing CT and GC in rectal and pharyngeal specimens using\n      expanded reference standards, which includes positive culture result and secondary\n      confirmatory NAAT assays. The proposed validation study is intended to provide data to\n      support the use of NAAT for rectal and pharyngeal specimens."
