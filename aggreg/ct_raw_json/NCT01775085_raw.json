            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare two types of groups for breast cancer survivors: a\n      Meaning-Centered Group and a Discussion Group. Many breast cancer survivors seek help to\n      deal with the emotional burden of having gone through the cancer experience. Participation\n      in groups offering support often helps cancer survivors cope with stressors of life after\n      having had cancer by giving them a place to express their feelings. The \"Meaning-Centered\n      Group\" is intended to teach breast cancer survivors how to maintain or even increase a sense\n      of meaning and purpose in their lives after treatment for cancer. The \"Discussion Group\" is\n      intended to help breast cancer survivors cope by giving them a place to get support from\n      other breast cancer survivors.\n\n      The goal of this study is to compare the benefits of these two types of group approaches for\n      breast cancer survivors. The study is also testing the benefits and feasibility of\n      conducting the groups virtually using a telephone and computer."
