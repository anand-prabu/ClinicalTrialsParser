            "textblock": "Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease that affects 30,000\n      Americans each year. Of these 30,000 Americans, it has been suggested that up to 50% will\n      experience cognitive and behavioral changes in the form of frontotemporal dysfunction and up\n      to 40% will meet criteria for frontotemporal dementia (FTD). Riluzole the only FDA approved\n      agent for ALS extends a patient's lifespan by 2-3 months, and there are no proven therapies\n      for the cognitive changes associated with ALS. More effective therapy for this universally\n      fatal disease is desperately needed.\n\n      Results from an open label pilot trial of 20 patients treated with memantine at 10 mg BID\n      suggested that treatment with the combination of memantine and riluzole slowed ALS disease\n      progression. This trial also showed that levels of specific protein biomarkers in the CSF at\n      baseline correlated with the rate of disease progression. A concurrent phase II study\n      performed by Dr Carvalho, found no effect with similar dosing; however, the study was\n      limited in terms of power. Comments on previous failed drug trials in ALS have raised the\n      concern that many ALS trials study a potential therapeutic agent at only a single dose and\n      thus may miss the potential efficacy of non FDA approved doses; therefore, this proposed\n      study will test a higher dose of memantine, 20 mg BID, in a double blind, placebo\n      controlled, randomized trial of 90 patients with ALS to determine if a combination therapy\n      of memantine with riluzole can slow disease progression compared to treatment with riluzole\n      alone. The primary outcome measure will be the rate of disease progression as measured by\n      the ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R). In addition the investigators will\n      examine the cognitive deficits seen in ALS patients measured by the ALS Cognitive Behavioral\n      Screen (ALS-CBS) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NIP-Q). Finally the\n      investigators will examine specific validated protein biomarkers found in the cerebrospinal\n      fluid to determine if there is a correlation between the levels of these biomarkers and the\n      rate of disease progression. In particular the investigators will measure the ratio of\n      phosphorylated heavy neurofilament to Complement 3 to see if this ratio is predictive of\n      disease progression and if the levels change during therapy with memantine.\n\n      This project will offer unique insights into this untreatable disease. If this study\n      confirms earlier results and suggests that memantine, when used in conjunction with\n      riluzole, significantly slows down the progression of the disease, as well as ameliorates\n      cognitive deficits in patients with fronto-temporal dysfunction, it will set the groundwork\n      for conducting a larger phase III trial."

            "description": "It is demonstrated that up to half of patients with ALS may develop cognitive impairment during the course of the disease and up to 40% of ALS patients develop FTD. The ALS Cognitive Behavioral Screen (ALS-CBS\u2122) and the Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q), are two neuropsychological batteries that are validated, brief practical measures that will be administered. Previous data has shown that memantine  can slow the progression of behavioral and cognitive decline in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Lewy Body Disease, that there may be potential for a positive effect in patients with ALS.  These scales should be great indicators of not only the diagnosis frototemporal dysfunction and even FTD, but also whether memantine can have any positive effect upon the progression of these changes.",

The patient's rate of progression on active therapy during the 36 week treatment arm will be compared to the rate of progression of the placebo arm. \tDisease progression in numerous ALS clinical trials has been measured using the ALSFRS-R which is a 12 question rating scale used to determine each participant's assessment of their capability and independence in daily activities. The ALSFRS-R can be administered with high inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability in person or over the phone. The advantages of using such a measurement to determine disease progression are that the categories are relevant to ALS, it is a sensitive and reliable tool, and the rate of decline correlates strongly with survival",
