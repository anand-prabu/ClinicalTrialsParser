At pharmacologic concentrations however, pro-urokinase is converted to\n      urokinase - a non specific thrombolytic, limiting its therapeutic use. Mutant pro-urokinase\n      (M5) is more stable and its conversion to urokinase is inhibited by C1-inhibitor.\n\n      The primary objectives of the study are:\n\n        -  To assess the overall safety and tolerability related to systemic plasminogen\n           activation of single doses of M5 over a wide dose range (study part I).\n\n        -  To assess the effect of single doses of C1-inhibitor on the overall safety and\n           tolerability of single doses of M5 and its effect on M5-induced coagulation changes\n           (study part II)."
