            "textblock": "Postural Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS) is one of the most frequent forms of chronic\n      orthostatic intolerance and affects an estimated 500,000 people in the United States alone.\n      This disorder is a common source of disability in young adults, with a strong predilection\n      for premenopausal women. POTS is characterized by an excessive increase in heart rate (>30\n      bpm) on assuming the upright position that is associated with orthostatic symptoms that are\n      relieved by lying down. These symptoms include palpitations, chest pain, lightheadedness or\n      dizziness, blurred vision, nausea and fatigue. In addition, POTS patients commonly report\n      mental clouding or \"brain fog\" even while lying down or seated, which can pose significant\n      limitations to daily life.\n\n      Although mental clouding is an almost universal complaint among POTS patients, this\n      phenomenon is poorly understood. As a result, the optimal treatment strategies to manage\n      cognitive dysfunction in this condition remain unknown. The purpose of this study is to\n      better define the mental clouding associated with POTS and to determine whether the\n      psychostimulant modafinil is a viable therapeutic option to improve cognitive function in\n      these patients. The investigators hypothesize that acute modafinil administration will\n      improve seated measures of cognitive function in POTS patients. The specific aims are:\n\n        1. To assess whether acute modafinil improves seated measures of cognitive function,\n           particularly measures of attention and executive function, in POTS patients compared to\n           placebo.\n\n        2. To assess whether propranolol, either alone as an active control or in combination with\n           modafinil to mitigate potential heart rate increases, can improve cognitive function in\n           POTS.\n\n      Patients will be studied on 4 separate days with oral administration of: placebo, modafinil\n      (200 mg), propranolol (20 mg) and the combination of modafinil (200 mg) and propranolol (20\n      mg). The order of administration will be randomized in a double-blind manner. Patients will\n      be seated during the study and cognitive testing will begin approximately 2.5 hours after\n      medication administration. Cognitive testing will consist of the CogState computerized brief\n      battery and a Stroop Word Color test of executive function. Patients will also be asked to\n      stand for 10 minutes (or as long as tolerated) at 1, 3 and 4 hours post medication, with\n      some of the cognitive tests repeated while standing at the 4 hour time point."
