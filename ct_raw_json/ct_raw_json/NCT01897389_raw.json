Approximately 32 healthy\n      adult males will participate. The total study length is up to 68 days. This study will\n      consist of a screening phase followed by an open-label treatment phase consisting of 4\n      single-dose treatment periods separated by a washout period of at least 7 days between\n      dosing. Individuals will be randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment sequences. A single dose\n      of 1000 mg abiraterone acetate will be given in each treatment period under fasted\n      conditions. Participants will be confined to the study center from Day -1 of each treatment\n      period until completion of the 96-hour blood sample collection on Day 5 of each treatment\n      period. A follow-up visit will occur between 5 to 7 days after the last study procedure.\n      Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples will be collected\n      during the open-label treatment phase as detailed in the protocol. Safety will be monitored\n      throughout the study."
