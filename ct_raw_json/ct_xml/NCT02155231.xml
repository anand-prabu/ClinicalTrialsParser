      OBJECTIVES

        1. To determine the prevalence and incidence of anal HPV infection, including infection
           with high-risk HPV types, among MSM in Indonesia, Malaysia, and Thailand.

        2. To study the prevalence and incidence of HGAIN among these MSM.

        3. To evaluate risk factors, including HIV status, for anal high-risk HPV infection and
           HGAIN among these MSM.

      Study population An approximately 75 HIV-positive and 75 HIV-negative MSM who attended the
      study clinic in Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Bangkok will be enrolled.  The study will also
      enroll 185 HIV-positive and 95 HIV-negative MSM who are previous participants of the MSM VCT
      study. There will be approximately 260 HIV-positive and 170 HIV-negative MSM in total in
