Definitive information about the presence of malignancy will be obtained by biopsy\n           directed by the imaging method best depicting the lesion with 14-g or 11-g needle\n           devices or needle localized excision. The absence of breast cancer was determined by\n           means of biopsy, the absence of positive findings on repeat imaging and clinical\n           examination, or both at follow-up.\n\n        4. The diagnostic yield of digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT) compared to  ultrasonography\n           will be assessed."
