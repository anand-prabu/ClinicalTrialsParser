            "textblock": "In patients with a high thromboembolic risk, withdrawing anticoagulant treatment is\n      recommended in some situations, including when major h\u00e6morrhage occurs. But withdrawing\n      treatment can be risky. In patients on a curative dose of anticoagulant medicine, treatment\n      withdrawal heightens the risk of thromboembolic events occurring, with potentially major\n      consequences. For instance, mechanical valve thrombosis is fatal in 15% of patients.\n      Resumption of anticoagulation is therefore critical in patients at high risk for\n      thromboembolic events.\n\n      However, in these patients having presented major h\u00e6morrhage,  resumption of anticoagulation\n      heightens the risk of h\u00e6morrhage recurrence. This risk is even higher when the original\n      h\u00e6morrhage was not accessible via surgical, endoscopic or endoluminal hemostasis.\n\n      As far as investigators know, there is no data in the literature to rely on when the major\n      h\u00e6morrhage is not accessible via hemostatic intervention and the risk of thrombosis is high.\n      When confronted with patients who need anticoagulation but have a high risk of h\u00e6morrhage\n      recurrence, the question of when treatment should be resumed has not been resolved. This is\n      why investigators propose to conduct a randomised comparative study to evaluate two\n      treatment strategies - early resumption (H48 to H72) versus late resumption (H120 to H144)\n      of anticoagulation.\n\n      MAIN OBJECTIVE: The main objective of the present study is to evaluate in terms of bleeding\n      risk, thrombosis risk and mortality at one month, the effect of early vs. late resumption of\n      anticoagulation in patients having presented with serious h\u00e6morrhage while on curative-dose\n      anticoagulants and facing a high thromboembolic risk."

The accumulated frequency of major h\u00e6morrhage, thromboembolic events and\n      deaths should be 26% in case of early resumption and 15% in case of late resumption, i.e. a\n      relative risk reduction of 43%. Based on this hypothesis, to obtain 80% power with two-sided\n      \u03b1 being 5%, each group should include 208 patients, for a total of 416 patients.\n\n      EVALUATION CRITERIA: The main criteria in this study will be the accumulated one-month\n      incidence of h\u00e6morrhage recurrence, thromboembolic complications and deaths. It is a\n      combined criterion associating:\n\n        -  Fatal h\u00e6morrhage proven by autopsy or sudden deaths in a clinical context strongly\n           suggestive of h\u00e6morrhage\n\n        -  Fatal thromboembolic events proven by autopsy or imagery or sudden deaths in a clinical\n           context strongly suggestive of thrombosis\n\n        -  Any clinically significant h\u00e6morrhage leading to temporary (> 24 hours) or permanent\n           withdrawal of anticoagulant treatment\n\n        -  Any symptomatic thromboembolic event in any territory, proven by imagery or surgery\n\n      These events will be validated by a committee for the validation of critical events blind to\n      the date of anticoagulant treatment resumption. The secondary evaluation criteria will be\n      symptomatic h\u00e6morrhages, fatal or not, symptomatic thromboembolic incidents, fatal or not,\n      and mortality at 1 month and 3 mont"
