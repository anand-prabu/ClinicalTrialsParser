In low myopia, there seem to be a minor effect of such wavefront-guided\n      treatment. However, it remains to be established whether there is a beneficial effect in\n      higher degrees of myopia.\n\n      The study aims to determine whether myopic subjects (-6 to -10 diopters) with\n      higher-than-average preoperative higher-order aberrations have benefit of wavefront-guided\n      treatment. Subjects are randomized to wavefront-guided treatment in one eye, and\n      conventional treatment in the other."
