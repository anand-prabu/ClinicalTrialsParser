  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized trial that will compare the effects of two, 12-week activity
      interventions on patterns of physical activity, physical health, and quality of life
      measures in 40 older adults who are able to walk for exercise.  One intervention will target
      150 minutes per week of home-based moderate exercise (e.g. brisk walking), consistent with
      current recommendations.  The other intervention will target a decrease in time spent in
      sedentary behaviors (e.g. sitting) of 60 minutes per day.  Both interventions will wear an
      activity armband which will allow them to self-monitor their activity or sedentary behavior
      in real time using a smartphone.  The armband will also provide objective data to an
      interventionist that will facilitate the intervention.  The main outcome will be time spent
      in moderate exercise.

      Specific Aims: This application proposes to randomize community-dwelling, older adults to
      one of two, 12-week activity interventions that target either increased moderate-to-vigorous
      physical activity (MVPA) or decreased sedentary behavior (SED).  The primary aim of this
      research is to evaluate the effect of a behavioral intervention targeting decreased SED vs.
      increased MVPA on objectively monitored activity (minutes of SED and MVPA).   The secondary
      aim is to evaluate the effect of the SED intervention vs. the MVPA intervention on
      functional and psychosocial outcomes.  To the investigators knowledge, this research will
      provide unique experimental evidence that SED can be altered in an older adult population
      and will yield key pilot data on the expected effect size for an intervention targeting SED
      vs. MVPA.

      Background:  The older adult population is the least active age group in the U.S. by two
      distinct metrics: a lack of MVPA and a high rate of SED (sitting without any significant
      exertion).  This represents a public health opportunity because engaging in 150 minutes of
      MVPA is known to improve the risk of morbidity, mortality, and physical function. SED has
      emerged as a risk factor for adverse outcomes, independent of MVPA, and observational
      studies indicate that more SED is linked to an increased risk of clinical outcomes
      (mortality, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease) and worse aging outcomes, e.g. physical
      function. However, there exists no experimental data comparing interventions to reduce SED
      vs. increase MVPA in older adults.

      Summary of Methods: The investigators propose a 2-arm randomized trial that will target
      increasing MVPA (Get Active) vs. decreasing SED (Sit Less) among community-dwelling, older
      adults from the Pepper Center Mobility Registry.  The intervention will consist of a
      combination of in-person (Weeks 1-4, 6, 8, 10) and phone-based (Weeks 5, 7, 9, 11)
      individual counseling and will utilize the BodyMedia® Fit System (wearable armband with
      technology interface) to provide real-time feedback on daily MVPA or SED, which can be used
      by the subjects to self-monitor and by the interventionist to improve adherence.
      Assessments at baseline and 12 weeks will include objectively monitored minutes of MVPA and
      SED by a blinded armband, physical function (short physical performance battery, 400 meter
      walk, grip strength, gait speed), and assessment of subjective MVPA, SED, physical function,
      and psychosocial outcomes by questionnaires.

    <description>Physical function will be assessed by the following tests:
400 Meter Walk Test: a timed test that reliably and validly assesses mobility limitations in older adults by completing a hallway walk (10 laps of a 20 meter course) at usual pace.
Short Physical Performance Battery including a chair stand test (timed test to stand up and down 5 times without using hands), a 4-meter walk test for gait speed, and a standing balance test.
Grip strength using a hand dynamometer
In addition, participant will answer questionnaires about physical function and health including the SF-36, the Pepper Assessment Tool for Disability, and the Physical Function Questionnaire.</description>
