Cirrhosis is associated with impaired antibody responses and increased risk of\n      bacterial infections. We have recently identified that cirrhosis is associated with\n      abnormalities of memory B-cells, cells that make antibodies and help protect against\n      bacterial infections. We have identified that chemicals associated with gut bacteria might\n      play a role in causing these B-cell abnormalities. It is well known that gut bacteria have\n      increased access to the blood in individuals with cirrhosis, a process called bacterial\n      translocation.  We hypothesize that reducing bacteria counts in the gut by using\n      poorly-absorbed antibiotics (also known as selective gut decontamination) will partially\n      reverse losses of memory B-cells in cirrhosis by reducing bacterial translocation."
