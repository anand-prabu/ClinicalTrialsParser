Patients are stratified according to\n      performance status (0 or 1 vs 2) and participating center. Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive rebeccamycin analogue IV over 1 hour on days 1-5. Treatment\n           for both arms repeats every 3 weeks for 6-8 courses in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36-64 patients (18-32 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      at a rate of 3-4 patients per month."
