      This randomized clinical trial compares geriatric assessment intervention in reducing
      chemotherapy toxicity in older patients with advanced cancer. A geriatric assessment may
      identify risk factors for chemotherapy toxicity and may improve treatment for older patients
      with advanced cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine if providing information regarding geriatric assessment (GA) and GA-driven
      recommendations to oncologists reduces clinician-rated grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity in
      patients aged 70 and over with advanced cancer undergoing first-line chemotherapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Proportion of patients who are alive at 6 months after study entry. II. Evaluate whether
      providing oncologists with information regarding GA and GA-driven recommendations influences
      clinical care of older patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for advanced cancer.

      III. Compare chemotherapy treatment decisions (as measured by relative dose intensity of
      chemotherapy administered in the first cycle).

      IV. Compare the number and type of GA-driven recommendations implemented for older patients
      receiving first line chemotherapy for advanced cancer.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether providing oncologists with GA information and GA-driven
      recommendations can slow functional and physical decline in older patients with advanced
      cancer.

      II. To examine the association between patient-reported symptoms (as measured by
      Patient-Reported Outcomes [PRO]-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) and
      geriatric domains (as measured by geriatric assessment).

      III. To compare PRO-CTCAE and physician-rated CTCAE in a sample of older patients receiving
      first line chemotherapy.

      IV. To examine the association between PRO-CTCAE and chemotherapy decisions. V. To examine
      the association between PRO-CTCAE and adverse outcomes (early discontinuation of
      chemotherapy, hospitalizations, and mortality).

      OUTLINE: Treatment sites are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I (GA intervention): Patients complete a geriatric assessment. Patients and physicians
      are provided with the geriatric assessment information and recommendations.

      ARM II (usual care): Patients complete a geriatric assessment, but information other than
      clinically significant cognitive impairment and depression is not provided to the oncology
      teams.

      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at
      1 year.

    <description>A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) methodology will be used. Estimation will be performed using the Residual Pseudo Likelihood procedure, assuming a binomial distribution and logit link.

    <description>The effect of the intervention on decisional regret for both patient and physician will be compared using four linear mixed models (regret). For each model, Arm will be the fixed effect and CCOP will be a random effect (independent of residual error). Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) estimation will be used, and inference will be performed using the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment procedure.</description>

    <description>The effect of the intervention on RDI of chemotherapy will be compared using four linear mixed models. For each model, Arm will be the fixed effect and CCOP will be a random effect. REML estimation will be used, and inference will be performed using the Kenward-Roger degrees of freedom adjustment procedure. A linear mixed model will be used to investigate whether the intervention changes chemotherapy dosing. In this model, RDI will be the response. The fixed effect will be Armand, the random effect will be CCOP. Overall change in dosing will be assessed with an F Test.</description>

A GLMM will be fit with chemotherapy toxicity as the response, Arm, PEPPI, PEACE, CP and PC as fixed factors, and CCOP site as a random effect independent of residual error.</description>
