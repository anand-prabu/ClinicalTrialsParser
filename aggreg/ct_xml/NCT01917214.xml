  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, non-interventional study which looks at the cohort of Renal Cell
      Carcinoma patients in a real life clinical setting and analyses into factors why these
      patients have been surviving for as long as 3-5 years unlike Clinical study where the
      survival is around 2 years.

      The factors which will be analysed include patient characteristics, dosage and adverse event
      management and tries to correlate these factors with survival.

    <textblock>
      A single cohort of 200 patients who are diagnosed with metastatic renal cell carcinoma prior
      to 1st Jan 2012, and are seen by the medical oncologist at the centers involved with BIOGRID
      and its affiliated registries. Patients will be identified from the first date of their
      consultation with the medical oncologist and captured in the electronic database. Consent to
      use datasets has already been obtained from participating research institutes and hospitals
      IRB/Ethics Committees
