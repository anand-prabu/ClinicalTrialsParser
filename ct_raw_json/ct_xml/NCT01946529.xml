    <textblock>
      This protocol will study treatment for Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) and
      desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT).  Participants with ESFT will be divided into
      two treatment groups, A or B, based on tumor characteristics.

      Group A (standard risk) participants have tumor that is not in the pelvis, has not spread to
      other parts of the body, and are less than 14 years of age.  Because previous clinical
      trials have shown that standard treatment is very effective for children whose tumors have
      these characteristics, these participants will receive standard treatment.

      Group B (high risk) participants are 14 years of age or older or have tumor in the pelvis,
      or the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.  Participants with DSRCT in the abdomen
      and/or pelvis or with tumor that cannot be removed by surgery alone or has spread to other
      parts of the body will be included in Group B.  Participants in this group are considered
      high risk because there is a greater chance of tumor recurring following standard treatments
      currently in use.

      All participants will be followed and evaluated for 10 years following completion of
      therapy.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To estimate the response rate to two initial courses of temsirolimus, temozolomide and
           irinotecan in previously untreated patients with high-risk Ewing sarcoma family of
           tumors (ESFT).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        -  To estimate the overall survival and progression-free survival in participants with
           ESFT treated with these approaches.

        -  To estimate the time to progression in participants with ESFT treated in Group B (high
           risk).

        -  To estimate the cumulative incidence of local failure following local control paradigm
           in this trial.

      Group A:

      Participants will receive interval compressed (every 2 weeks) alternating courses of
      chemotherapy with vincristine, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) and with ifosfamide
      and etoposide (IE).  Doxorubicin will be omitted following a total cumulative dose of 375
      mg/m^2. Local control measures (surgery and/or radiation therapy) will be instituted after 6
      courses of chemotherapy.  Total duration of treatment is approximately 29 weeks.

      Group B:

      Participants eligible for the window therapy will receive two courses (21 days duration
      each) of mTOR inhibitor, temsirolimus, in combination with temozolomide and irinotecan.
      Irinotecan (20 mg/m^2) will be administered IV on a protracted schedule of daily for 5 days,
      2 days off, repeated daily x 5 [(qdx5)x2], temozolomide (100 mg/m^2) PO daily x 5 days and
      temsirolimus 35 mg/m^2 IV weekly on day 1 and 8.  Following window treatment (weeks 1 - 6),
      participants will proceed to induction chemotherapy (weeks 7 - 33) consisting of interval
      compressed (every 2 weeks) alternating courses of chemotherapy with vincristine,
      doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide (VDC) with ifosfamide and etoposide (IE).  Doxorubicin
      will be omitted following a total cumulative dose of 375 mg/m^2.  Local control measures
      (surgery and/or radiation therapy) will be instituted after 6 courses of induction
      chemotherapy (week 19).  Participants whose tumors respond to window therapy will receive
      temsirolimus, temozolomide and irinotecan at weeks 29 and 31 in place of ifosfamide and
      etoposide.  Following induction therapy, participants will receive six 21-day courses of
      maintenance therapy consisting of bevacizumab IV on day 1 and daily oral sorafenib and
      low-dose cyclophosphamide day 1 through day 21.

                  John's wort.

               -  Must have measurable disease.

               -  Must not have received emergent radiation therapy.

               -  Serum triglyceride level ≤ 300 mg/dL and serum cholesterol ≤ 300 mg/dL.

               -  Random or fasting glucose within the upper limits of normal for age.  If random
                  glucose is elevated, fasting glucose must be within normal range.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Participant is pregnant or breastfeeding.

          -  Inability or unwillingness of research participant or legal guardian/representative
             to give written informed consent.

          -  Participant has a prior history of malignancy, with the exception of non-melanoma
             skin cancer.  Participants with history of skin cancer must have 5 years elapse since
