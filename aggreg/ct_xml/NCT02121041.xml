  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness of ambulatory blood pressure
      monitoring to usual care (blood pressure measurement in the office) in diagnosing and
      managing hypertension.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The usual strategy for detecting hypertension—repeated office blood pressure (BP)
      measurements—is inefficient and inaccurate. When paired with ambulatory BP monitoring
      (ABPM), which takes a multitude of measurements over 24 hours, it is clear that office BP
      measurements may convey a falsely positive diagnosis known as white-coat hypertension. What
      is less well-known is that office BP measurements may also convey a falsely negative
      diagnosis termed masked hypertension (MH). That is, office BP may measure as normal, yet
      24-hour ambulatory measurements show elevated BP. People with MH have cardiovascular risk
      that is similar to that of people with diagnosed hypertension, yet MH goes unrecognized, and
      therefore, untreated.  Ultimately, identifying the best strategy for accurately detecting
      hypertension is vital to improving overall BP control and reducing cardiovascular events.
      Without a feasible ABPM strategy, MH will continue to go unrecognized and untreated.

      Participants enrolled in the study will be randomized to either the usual care group or the
      ABPM-guided group. All participants will have a baseline ABPM. ABPM will be used to make a
      diagnosis and determine anti-hypertensive treatment in the ABPM-guided group only.
      Participants in the ABPM-guided group will have a follow-up ABPM in 2 months. All
      participants will have a final ABPM 4 months after enrollment.
