Patient outcomes,  measured at 3, 6, and 12 months, include guideline-consistent\n      changes in depression treatment and reduction in depressive symptoms."

            "textblock": "The goal of this research is to improve depression treatment and outcomes among elderly home\n      healthcare patients. Homecare nursing is a major source of health care for a large and\n      growing number of medically ill or injured older adults who are homebound by illness or\n      disability. Clinically significant depression is twice as prevalent in this patient\n      population compared to similarly aged primary care patients. Depression can be effectively\n      treated in older adults, and treatment guidelines have been developed to help physicians\n      make treatment decisions for their depressed older patients. However, medical home\n      healthcare patients rarely receive guideline-consistent treatment for depression. This\n      research tests the effectiveness of an intervention, Depression Care for Patients at Home\"\n      (CAREPATH), on two outcomes: 1. Depression treatment (i.e., initiate treatment or have a\n      change in treatment that is consistent with guidelines), and 2. Depressive symptoms (i.e.,\n      reduction in depressive symptoms over time). The CAREPATH protocol was designed in\n      partnership with home healthcare providers. It includes the major elements of depression\n      care management models that have proven effective in primary care but restructures these\n      elements to fit the clinical needs of home healthcare patients and for consistency with home\n      healthcare practice. The intervention itself is designed to be ecologically sensitive to\n      maximize the feasibility and generalizability of the program. The CAREPATH Intervention is\n      being tested within six home healthcare agencies located in Vermont/New Hampshire, New York,\n      Pennsylvania, Michigan, Florida, and Arkansas. The design includes randomization of ~20\n      teams of nurses to CAREPATH or usual care. The impact of CAREPATH on depression treatment is\n      tested with all eligible patients (N~600) using data collected routinely by all agencies as\n      these are the kinds of data that agencies typically use for quality assurance. Depressive\n      symptoms outcomes are tested using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) collected by\n      researcher staff from (N=300) patients who consent to in-person baseline and telephone\n      follow-up interviews at 12, 24, and 52 weeks."
