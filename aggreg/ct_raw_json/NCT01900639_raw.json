Platelet reactivity follows a circadian rhythm, with a peak in the morning,\n      contributing to the morning peak of cardiovascular disease. Due to its short half life,\n      aspirin only inhibits platelets which are present at the time of intake. Thus, the timing of\n      aspirin intake may influence its inhibitory effect on platelets and intake of aspirin at\n      bedtime may attenuate the morning peak of platelet reactivity. The time-dependent effect of\n      aspirin on circadian rhythm of platelet function has never been studied before. We\n      hypothesize that aspirin intake at bedtime compared with intake on awakening results in a\n      reduction of the morning peak in platelet reactivity."

            "textblock": "Cardiovascular events are a leading cause of mortality and morbidity in western countries.\n      In the European Union, 47% of total mortality is caused by cardiovascular disease2. Aspirin\n      is a cornerstone in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease because of its\n      inhibitory effects on platelet aggregation. It reduces the risk of recurrent cardiovascular\n      events with about a quarter3. Although not supported by evidence, aspirin is usually taken\n      in the morning, but it may be more beneficial to take aspirin at bedtime instead of on\n      awakening. It has been convincingly shown that platelet activity follows a circadian rhythm,\n      with a peak of platelet reactivity in the morning4-8. This might in part explain the\n      increase in cardiovascular events in the early morning, with the highest incidence between 6\n      and 12 AM1.\n\n      Since platelet reactivity follows a circadian rhythm, the timing of aspirin intake may\n      influence its inhibitory effect on platelets. Due to its short half-life, aspirin only\n      inhibits platelets which are present at the time of intake. New platelets are released at a\n      rate of 10%/day, predominantly during the night9. Because they are more reactive and not\n      inhibited by aspirin taken in the preceding morning, these young platelets contribute to the\n      morning peak of platelet reactivity10, 11. It has been argued that intake of aspirin at\n      bedtime could better prevent the early morning increase in platelet reactivity than intake\n      on awakening, assuming that intake on awakening would be too late to prevent this morning\n      peak in platelet reactivity12. Additionally, a recent study showed significant recovery of\n      platelet aggregation after 24 hours in patients using low-dose aspirin on a daily basis13.\n      This supports the hypothesis that aspirin intake at bedtime could be beneficial in reducing\n      the morning peak of platelet reactivity, thereby possibly also reducing the incidence of\n      arterial thrombotic events in the morning. However, this has never been studied before."
