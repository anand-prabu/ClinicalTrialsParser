    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to develop and test Customized Care, an intervention to help
      patients dealing with depression and/or anxiety in the context of multiple chronic
      conditions. Customized Care is designed to help patients communicate about important issues,
      such as financial and safety concerns, with their primary care providers (PCPs). The
      intervention will be delivered in patient waiting rooms prior to a routine follow-up visit
      with the PCP. Phase 1 of the project will ensure that the main components of Customized Care
      are acceptable to patients and PCPs. Phase 2 will include a pilot study to test the effects
      of Customized Care on patient-PCP communication.

      Participants aged 40 years or older who have a diagnosis of two or more common chronic
      medical conditions will be recruited from primary care clinics. Patients screening positive
      for either depression or anxiety will be randomized to Customized Care vs. an active
      control.

      The investigators hypothesize that the Customized Care will improve patient-centered
      communication.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with depression or anxiety in the context of multimorbidity (2 or more chronic
      conditions such as Diabetes, Heart Disease, Arthritis, COPD, Asthma) are often preoccupied
      with day-to-day concerns related to issues such as finances, safety and functional ability.
      Determining which issues to discuss, and when to discuss it, is always difficult in the
      15-minute primary care visit, but it is especially challenging when patients have multiple
      diagnoses, symptoms and concerns.

      In this application the investigators will develop and test the feasibility of Customized
      Care, an intervention that capitalizes on decision technology and will be deployed in
      primary care waiting rooms.  The investigators will assess whether customized care will
      improve outcomes among patients with depression and/or anxiety in the context of
      multimorbidity. Customized Care consists of two different components designed to improve
      health outcomes by improving patient-provider communication. The first component is a
      computer-based discussion prioritization tool (DPT).  The DPT forces patients to make
      trade-offs between competing concerns to help them determine which are the most important to
      discuss. The second component is a customized question prompt list (QPL) to help patients
      communicate their priorities to the PCP. The QPL will be generated after patients use the
      DPT, and consists of question prompts tailored to the patients' priorities.

      When patients express their day-to-day concerns, and PCPs become aware of these concerns,
      the patient-provider alliance can deepen. In addition, patient motivation (perceived
      autonomy, competence) to manage those everyday concerns and engage in care for chronic
      disease and associated mental health conditions will increase. This project will lay the
      ground work for a larger randomized trial to assess whether customized care can improve
      mental health outcomes among patients with multimorbidity.

      The specific aims are:

        1. To assess usability of the Customized Care components (the DPT and QPL) (n=20 patients)

        2. To assess feasibility of Customized Care in primary care settings (n=10 patient- PCP
           dyads)

        3. To conduct a pilot study of the effects of Customized Care on patient-PCP communication
           (n= 40 patient-PCP dyads)

    <description>After the patient completes the experimental or active comparator intervention on the iPad, the patient will proceed with their office visit. The subsequent conversations between the patient and PCP will be audio-recorded and transcribed. We will use the Measure of Patient Centered Communication (MPCC), a validated observational measure, to rate patient centered communication during of the patient-PCP office visit.</description>

    <description>Before the office visit with the PCP, patient participants in the active control condition will interact with a health information website for chronic disease management. The research staff will help the participant use an iPad in the waiting room and direct them to the website. The research staff will help the participant choose a summary information page from the website to be printed out in the office and brought with them to discuss with the PCP.</description>

    <description>Before the office visit with the PCP, patient participants in the intervention group will interact with the computer based components of the customized care intervention while in the waiting room. The research staff will help the participant use an iPad in the waiting room and direct them to the Discussion Prioritization tool (DPT). After participants use the DPT, the program automatically generates a customized questions prompt list (QPL) which will be printed out in the office. Study staff will hand the QPL to intervention patients to bring to their office visit with the PCP.</description>

    <description>Participants in this active control condition will be directed to a link to a health information website focused on chronic disease management and endorsed by the primary care practices. Patients will be encouraged to click on different conditions and recommendations for chronic disease management.
