HPV is the most common sexually\n      transmitted infection and causes genital warts and cancer. The HPV vaccine has been\n      recommended for girls ages 11-26 since 2006, yet vaccination rates remain low. Tailored\n      online interventions may be more effective tools to promote behavior change among college\n      students than traditional static interventions. The proposed study is a randomized\n      controlled trial testing the efficacy of the Me First tool vs. standard static educational\n      material on increasing HPV vaccination intent and uptake among female university students\n      aged 18-26."
