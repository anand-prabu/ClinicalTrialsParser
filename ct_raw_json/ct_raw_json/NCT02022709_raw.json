Both of the treatments are effective, but few research has been done\n      to find out who are more responsive to one treatment than the other. The aim of our research\n      is to evaluate the efficiency of SSRIs ,ERP and the combination of the two therapies for OCD\n      patients ,at the same time, to find out the biological and psychological predictors of\n      treatment response in Chinese population.\n\n      This is a randomized, single-blind, cross-over design study.Approximately 60 patients will\n      be randomized to SSRIs or ERP group. Neuropsychological assessment and  fMRI(Functional\n      Magnetic Resonance Imaging\uff09 will be performed at baseline,during the treatment and at the\n      end of the study. The research has two period. In the first period(before week 8) ,the\n      patients will have monotherapy. In the second period(after week 8), rates of improvement\n      based on the YBOCS(Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale) scores will be assessed. The\n      patient will be considered responsive to treatment when he or she has a reduction in YBOCS\n      score \u2265 35% of the score at the baseline.If the patient is responsive to the treatment that\n      he or she has received at the first 8 weeks,he or she will continue to follow the previous\n      treatment strategy.If not,the patient will have a combination of SSRIs and ERP treatment for\n      another 8 weeks. The follow-up period will last up to 6 months.The result of the study will\n      improve our knowledge about the efficacy of the two first line treatments .Also,it will help\n      us to find out the predictors of the outcome of  the two different kinds of\n      treatments.Strategy of clinical treatment of OCD will be more individualized in the future."
