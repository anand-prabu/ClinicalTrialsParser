Determine the dose-limiting toxicity and other toxic effects of this regimen in these\n      patients.\n\n      III. Preliminarily determine the antitumor activity of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive bortezomib IV on days 1, 4, 8, and 11. Courses repeat every 21 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of bortezomib until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. If dose-limiting toxicity in the form of\n      myelosuppression occurs in stratum I, dose escalation continues with patients meeting the\n      qualifications for stratum II.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-36 patients will be accrued for this study."
