Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known whether combination chemotherapy plus epirubicin is more effective than\n      combination chemotherapy alone for stage I or stage II breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying combination chemotherapy alone to see\n      how well it works compared to combination chemotherapy and epirubicin in treating women with\n      stage I or stage II breast cancer who have undergone surgery to remove the tumor."

Patients are stratified according to radiotherapy\n      timing (concurrent versus sequential), nodal status (negative versus 1-3 versus at least 4),\n      age (50 and under versus over 50), grade, and tumor size. Patients are randomized to one of\n      two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide on days 1-14 and methotrexate IV and\n           fluorouracil IV on days 1 and 8. Treatment repeats every 4 weeks for 6 courses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive epirubicin IV on day 1 every 3 weeks for 4 courses followed by\n           cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and fluorouracil, as in arm I, for 4 courses.\n\n      Some patients may receive radiotherapy during or after chemotherapy. Treatment continues in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed in a subset of patients (N=500) before chemotherapy starts, at 3\n      months of treatment, at the end of chemotherapy, and at 6, 12, and 18 months after\n      treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed annually for 10 years.\n\n      Peer Reviewed and Funded or Endorsed by Cancer Research UK\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be accrued for this study within 4\n      years."
