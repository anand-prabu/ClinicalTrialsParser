However, HIV-infected\n      women are at a greater risk, and often their tumors become cancerous more quickly than those\n      in HIV-negative women. Isotretinoin may be able to prevent this from happening. However,\n      since these tumors tend to disappear over time, many doctors are hesitant to give their\n      patients isotretinoin since this drug causes birth defects. This study looks at whether it\n      is better to treat cervical tumors in HIV-infected women or to wait and see if they will\n      disappear by themselves."

            "textblock": "Cervical neoplasia is frequently seen in HIV-infected women, apparently resulting from\n      immunosuppression and common risk factors, including sexual behavior patterns. In HIV\n      seronegative women, progression of preinvasive neoplasia is relatively slow, and up to 40\n      percent of low grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (grade I CIN/HPV-associated changes)\n      regress to a normal appearance over time. Many clinicians have opted not to treat CIN\n      I/HPV-associated changes due to this high spontaneous regression rate. Currently, retinoids,\n      principally isotretinoin, are the most consistently effective medical therapy for\n      CIN/HPV-associated changes, but use of isotretinoin in HIV-infected patients has not been\n      extensively documented. (AS PER AMENDMENT 6/10/97)\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive oral isotretinoin for 6 months or be observed only for 6\n      months, with 12 additional months of follow-up. [AS PER AMENDMENT 7/23/99: Follow-up time\n      has been decreased to 9 months from the last patient enrolled.]"
