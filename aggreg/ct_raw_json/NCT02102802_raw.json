            "textblock": "PTSD is a complex psychiatric disease characterized by a deficit in fear extinction,\n      hyperarousal, emotional numbing, and intrusive symptoms that cause the patient to\n      persistently re-experience a traumatic event over a period longer than a month. PTSD is\n      considered chronic when symptoms are present for at least six months. MDMA-assisted\n      psychotherapy is an innovative experimental mode of treatment that combines\n      psychotherapeutic techniques with the administration of MDMA. It may amplify certain aspects\n      of psychotherapy, as the pharmacological action of MDMA is thought to act as an adjunct to\n      psychotherapy. With positive results in two studies and ongoing Phase 2 clinical studies it\n      is important to further characterize the psychotherapeutic processes that occur during\n      treatment sessions conducted according to the manualized method of MDMA-assisted\n      psychotherapy. Changes in physiological status or brain activity that are associated with\n      improvement or recovery in people with chronic PTSD may offer a means of assessing treatment\n      response that relies less on self-report. This may be particularly important in studies with\n      MDMA-assisted psychotherapy where blinding is difficult due to the psychoactive nature of\n      the investigational product. This study is also interested in identifying and categorizing\n      psychotherapeutic processes taking place during MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The sub-study\n      will also examine elements of the experience with a self-report measure of self-compassion.\n\n      This exploratory sub-study will identify psychotherapeutic processes occurring during MDMA-\n      assisted psychotherapy in people with chronic PTSD and assess the feasibility of exploring\n      physiological correlates of clinical outcomes in subjects enrolled in the ongoing clinical\n      trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, NCT #: NCT01211405. The sub-study will be conducted in\n      collaboration with researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC), Smith\n      College and the New School for Social Research.\n\n      To support the clinical outcomes measured by CAPS from the MP-8 study, the sponsor is\n      interested in correlations of outcomes with treatment-related changes in potential\n      biological markers of PTSD, measured by HRV and fMRI. Brain activity while listening to\n      neutral and personalized trauma-related scripts will take place at baseline and after\n      experimental MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with low or medium or full dose MDMA. The fMRI scan\n      will be followed by a Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) scan. After each scanning session,\n      pulse measurements will be extracted as a digital data file from which HRV will be\n      calculated. FMRI scans and HRV measurements will occur at baseline for participants in all\n      conditions, one month after the second experimental session and again after a final\n      experimental session for participants in the low or medium dose condition, and two months\n      after the final experimental session for participants in the full dose condition.\n      Participants will complete the Self-Compassion Scale, a self-report measure of\n      self-compassion at Baseline and after the final MDMA-assisted psychotherapy session.\n      Psychotherapeutic processes will be assessed via observing psychotherapy and sorting a set\n      of 100 therapy-related items as a means of describing the interactions. Trained coders will\n      observe at least one pre-drug psychotherapy session, one experimental (drug-assisted\n      psychotherapy) session and one post-drug psychotherapy session."
