  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For breast cancer patients receiving chemotherapy regimens, the use of a validated emesis
      (nausea and vomiting) risk calculator will provide superior anti-emetic (nausea and
      vomiting) control compared with &quot;standard&quot; anti-emetic regimen. The risk calculator has the
      potential to provide more individualized anti-emetic regimen by decreasing the use of
      toxic/costly anti-emetics in patients at low risk and possibly more importantly enhancing
      the appropriate anti-emetic regimen in patients at high risk.

    <measure>Incidence of change in acute emesis (nausea and/or vomiting) in both study arms</measure>

    <description>The modified FLIE questionnaire is a patient-reported measure of the impact of chemotherapy induced emesis on daily life. It is a short, self administered instrument containing two domains—one for nausea (9 items) and one for vomiting (9 items). The modified FLIE questionnaire will be administered before the initiation of chemotherapy and on days 1 and 6, and prior to each cycle while on study. Responses to each question are scored on a 1- to 7-point scale as described in the FLIE Scoring Manual. For this study, &quot;minimal or no impact of CINV on daily life&quot; is defined as an average score of more than 6 on the 7-point scale. Additional data will be collected to assess physician anti-emetic prescribing habits as compared to published guidelines.</description>

    <description>The standard anti-emetic arm:
In this arm the treating medical oncologist will determine the choice of anti-emetic regimen that they perceive the patient would require and prescribe it. The treating physician will be blinded to result of the personalized composite emesis score. The physician may or may not choose to prescribe an NK-1 inhibitor as the study will not predetermine the type of anti-emetics used. In the event that the patient experienced chemo induced nausea and vomiting (CINV), modifications to the initial anti emetic regimen would be left to the treating physician.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The emesis risk model arm:
Prior to the start of intravenous chemotherapy an emesis risk score will be calculated for both acute and delayed emesis. The anti-emetic prophylaxis treatment will follow the emesis risk score. Whereby either an acute emesis score of ≥7 and/or a delayed emesis score of &gt;16 will be considered high-risk. The anti-emetics will be prescribed reflecting this risk for pre-chemotherapy, 8 hrs post chemotherapy and day 2-3 post chemotherapy. Dexamethasone, Ondansetron and Aprepitant will be given in different combination and doses depending on what score the participant receives based on their responses to the diary. For subsequent cycle the anti-emetic score will be re-calculated prior to each cycle and the choice of anti-emetics adjusted if necessary.</description>
