The limitations of prostate imaging technology affect its contribution to\n      clinical assessment and treatment management of prostate cancer. The high tumor cell\n      proliferation rate and cellular density of prostate cancer leads to overall elevated mobile\n      protein and peptide levels. The protein levels in the prostate can be non-invasively\n      detected by a new molecular imaging technique called amide-proton-transfer magnetic\n      resonance imaging (APT-MRI). APT-MRI will provide efficient measurement for improving our\n      ability to better regionally localize prostate cancer and predict tumor stages. The overall\n      goal of this trial is to evaluate the capability of the APT imaging technique for detection\n      and characterization of prostate cancer. APT-MRI could be an important quantitative marker\n      to better delineate and detect malignant regions of the prostate in the management of\n      prostate cancer patients."

            "textblock": "The goal of this trial is to evaluate the capability of the amide-proton-transfer magnetic\n      resonance imaging (APT-MRI) technique for detection and characterization of prostate cancer.\n      Prostate cancer typically shows a high tumor cell proliferation rate and cellular density\n      that leads to overall elevated mobile protein and peptide levels. An imaging method that can\n      non-invasively measure these mobile protein levels may considerably improve our ability to\n      better regionally localize prostate cancer and predict the degree of malignancies. APT-MRI\n      has recently emerged as a new molecular MRI technique to measure endogenous cellular mobile\n      protein and peptide levels non-invasively, which cannot otherwise be provided by current\n      prostate imaging techniques [Zhou J, Tryggestad E, Wen Z, et al. Differentiation between\n      glioma and radiation necrosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging of endogenous\n      proteins and peptides. Nat Med 2011; 17:130-134]. The preliminary data from 12 prostate\n      cancer patients reveals that the increased APT-MRI signal of mobile proteins and peptides in\n      cancerous regions of the prostate and in higher stage tumors [Jia G, Abaza R, Williams JD,\n      et al. Amide proton transfer MR imaging of prostate cancer: a preliminary study. J Magn\n      Reson Imaging 2011; 33:647-654], indicates that the APT-MRI signal is sensitive to the\n      elevated mobile protein and peptide levels in such malignant regions. These initial\n      observations are the basis for a rigorous validation trial.\n\n      The trial is be implemented within a well-established ongoing collaboration at the James\n      Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute (NCI-designated CCC) at the Ohio State\n      University Medical Center. Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer will be referred and\n      enrolled by urologists performing robotic prostatectomy. A comprehensive imaging scan\n      including APT-MRI will be implemented by radiologists, MR physicists and technologists with\n      a phased array surface coil in order to image the prostate in its natural shape. Our\n      protocol will include micro-MRI of the prostate specimen prior to pathologic evaluation\n      using an ultra-high-field MRI scanner. The prostate specimen will subsequently be cut in a\n      way that allows direct correlation of the specimen to micro-MRI. A dedicated pathology team\n      will delineate the extent of malignant infiltration in the prostate on pathologic slides,\n      which will be co-registered with the clinical and APT-MRI images to allow a targeted\n      assessment with a radiologic-pathologic correlation. The data analysis will be done by the\n      study team and the statistics evaluated by an experienced biostatistician in the subject\n      matter at hand."
