The treatment group will be compared to a control group of 10 adults\n      without diabetes who have sleep apnea and use CPAP but will not use liraglutide.\n\n      Everyone in the study will have two study visits and one overnight sleep study for research.\n      The study visits include fasting blood samples and breathing tests (pulmonary function test\n      and hypercapnic challenge). There will be weekly phone visits that include a questionnaire\n      on sleepiness. The group that takes liraglutide will check their blood sugar two times a day\n      while on the medicine."

Sleep disordered breathing (SDB) consists of nocturnal\n      alveolar hypoventilation and / or obstructive sleep apnea which result from abnormalities in\n      upper airway tone and ventilation during sleep. The development of a new pharmacological\n      treatment for sleep disordered breathing (SDB) could bring a breakthrough discovery that\n      will impact a rapidly growing population of children and adults with this disorder. The\n      investigators hypothesize that GLP-1 plays a central role in the improvement of SDB and that\n      the administration of GLP-1 receptor agonist to patients with OSA will correct or improve\n      SDB.\n\n        -  Hypothesis 1: Administration of Liraglutide to patients with severe OSA defined as\n           apnea hypopnea index \u2265 25 /hr. will result in a mean reduction in the index by a\n           minimum of 10 events /hr. after 4 weeks.\n\n        -  Hypothesis 2: Administration of Liraglutide will result in significant increase in\n           Orexin level, decrease in leptin, decrease in Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) score and\n           increase in carbon dioxide (CO2) chemosensitivity.\n\n      This is an open label, non-randomized, controlled pilot study. Subjects are heavy to obese\n      non-diabetic adults that are newly diagnosed with severe sleep apnea and will be starting\n      CPAP. 10 subjects will be treated with liraglutide for 4 weeks and compared to 10 untreated\n      controls.\n\n      Study time points are baseline and 4 weeks post treatment. Study procedures include pre and\n      post treatment: fasting blood for glucose, hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C), Orexin and leptin; ESS\n      questionnaire; pulmonary function test and hypercapnic challenge. The procedures also\n      include a post treatment overnight research sleep study to measure change in apnea index\n      from diagnostic sleep study done previous to study enrollment."
