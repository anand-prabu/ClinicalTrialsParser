The intervention uses a Family Health Coach model to work with\n      families of youth with diabetes or at high risk of diabetes. Health Coaches visit families\n      in their homes and conduct intervention sessions with both youth and a designated adult\n      'support person' (e.g., parent, guardian, etc).  For Youth Participants, the pilot\n      intervention consists of 12 sessions (45-60 minutes in duration) delivered during a 6-month\n      intervention phase, plus 6 check-ins delivered during a 6-month follow-up phase. There are\n      also 4 optional social support visits for the Youth Participants in order to provide\n      necessary assistance with challenges the youth may be facing. For Support Persons, the pilot\n      intervention consists of 4 family skill building sessions (20-30 minutes in length)\n      delivered during the first 4 months of the Youth Participant's intervention phase. Support\n      Persons will also be welcomed and encouraged to attend any of the Youth Participant\n      sessions. All sessions are designed to be taught at the participant's home, but they may\n      also occur at another location chosen by the participant (e.g. school, study office,\n      clinic). Outcome data will be collected at Baseline, 3 months following Baseline, 6 months\n      following Baseline, and 12 months following Baseline."
