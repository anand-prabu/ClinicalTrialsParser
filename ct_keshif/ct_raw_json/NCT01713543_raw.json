            "textblock": "Background: Falls are the leading cause of injury among older adults in Singapore. However,\n      far from being inevitable, falls among elderly are preventable and risk is predictable.\n      Translating this understanding of falls etiology into an integrated clinical and public\n      health program that is accessible to all elderly persons is a critical health services\n      delivery challenge.\n\n      Hypothesis: An evidence-based program of screening, risk modification and physical therapy\n      delivered in a community setting will reduce falls incidence among a high-risk group of\n      elderly who have been recently transitioned from the hospital to the community.\n\n      Methodology: Randomized controlled trial. Patients transitioning from the hospital to the\n      community will be identified at the Emergency Department. Eligible patients are those who\n      are: 1) more than 65 years old, 2) discharged from the Emergency Department or hospital for\n      a fall or injury related to a fall. The intervention is a multifactorial program of\n      screening, risk modification and physical therapy focused on progressive strength, balance\n      and gait training. It is provided as an individualized program or in a group setting in the\n      community. The primary outcome measure is number of fallers assessed from a falls prevention\n      diary maintained by (or for) each participant."

            "textblock": "Objective:\n\n      To develop and demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of a multifactorial,\n      community-based falls prevention program of screening, risk modification, and progressive\n      physical therapy that targets vulnerable elderly Singaporeans at high-risk of falls.\n\n      Methodology:\n\n      This study is a two-year randomized control trial that tests the effectiveness of a\n      multifactorial, community based falls prevention program targeting vulnerable Singaporeans\n      at high risk of falls. To maximize the likelihood of long-term sustainability, we will\n      engage hospital Physiotherapists (PT)to deliver the home based assessment and intervention\n      and the group exercise program in the community.\n\n      The study will have two arms (intervention and control), and will be divided into three\n      phases: (1) pre-intervention (2) intervention and (3) analysis. In the pre-intervention\n      phase, overseas experts will train local PTs and CHWs on how to administer and deliver the\n      falls prevention program.  The program will be delivered to the intervention arm during\n      phase 2 of the study. The intervention is a multifactorial program of screening, risk\n      modification and physical therapy focused on progressive strength, balance and gait\n      training. It is provided as an individualized program or in a group setting in the\n      community. The primary outcome measure is the number of fallers assessed from a falls\n      prevention diary maintained by (or for) each participant. Data will be analyzed in the third\n      and final phase.\n\n      Procedures:\n\n      All study participants will be given an assessment at baseline which will consist of the\n      measurement of: sociodemographic characteristics, functional status, history of falls,\n      cognitive impairment, depression, quality of life, healthcare utilization and expenditures,\n      and medical history. The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) will be used to assess\n      gait, balance and mobility. Cognitive assessment will be performed using the Montreal\n      Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Presence of depression will be evaluated using the Geriatrics\n      Depression Scale. Subjects in the intervention group will receive a detailed multifactorial\n      falls risk evaluation and tailored physical therapy or group exercise program focused on\n      improving gait, balance and mobility.  Before the start of the physical therapy,\n      participants in the intervention group will need to complete the PAR-Q and a medical\n      evaluation by Physician to recommend that they are fit for physical activity using HPB\n      Medical Advisory Form. For interview assessments, we will use validated Chinese and Malay\n      versions when necessary, as many of the elderly patients are either Mandarin or\n      Malay-speaking.\n\n      The questionnaire at baseline will be conducted by the PTs and the outcome measurements will\n      be collected at 3 months and 9 months by independent blinded assessors.\n\n      The intervention will be divided into two phases: a 3-month \"Active Intervention Phase\" and\n      a 6-month \"Maintenance Phase.\" At the onset of the active intervention phase, those patients\n      in the intervention sites will receive a detailed falls risk assessment at baseline from a\n      physical therapist. The risk factors that will be assessed and the corresponding\n      interventions are as follows:\n\n        1. Poor vision: Referral to ophthalmologist for correction\n\n        2. Polypharmacy: Referral to AIC for management of medications if use of four medications\n           or use of high risk medications such as benzodiazepines, neuroleptics,\n           anti-depressants, anticonvulsants or class 1A antiarrhythmics.\n\n        3. Environmental hazards: Caregiver education and suitable recommendations to modify risk\n           such as removal of rugs, chang to safer footwear, use of non-slip bath mats, additional\n           lighting at night; broadly following the CDC guidelines.\n\n        4. Deficiencies in gait, balance or mobility: Physical therapist supervised program of\n           gait training, balance and strengthening exercises.\n\n      Briefly, the assessments include a review of current drugs for polypharmacy, orthostatic\n      vital signs, vision acuity testing, and a brief environmental assessment. Impairments in\n      gait, balance and mobility will be assessed using the SPPB and a 2 minute walk. Manuals will\n      be developed for physical therapists to guide the evaluation risk factor assessments, home\n      assessments, appropriate referrals, and selection of exercise programs, that will be\n      progressive, challenging and of optimal intensity and durations. Existing protocols and\n      procedures for the OTAGO-type programs will be available. These activities are specially\n      developed for the purpose of this study.\n\n      Based on the SPPB score at baseline assessment, participants will be categorized as either\n      high-risk (SPPB\u22646) or low-to-moderate-risk (SPPB>6) for falls. High-risk patients will be\n      given a PT supervised program of physical therapy that specifically targets impairments that\n      interfere with engaging in exercise in group setting. The goal of the tailored physical\n      therapy sessions is to modify impairments and transition these patients to an evidence-based\n      exercise program. Low-to-moderate risk patients will be directly enrolled into an\n      evidence-based group exercise program. The group exercise programs will be offered in 1-hour\n      sessions, twice weekly over the intervention phase.\n\n      At the end of the active intervention phase (3 months after baseline), participants will\n      transition to a maintenance phase in which they will be encouraged to continue with the\n      exercise on their own and will also be referred to the HPB's STEP program. Patient\n      participation in the program and their falls incidence will be monitored for 9 months after\n      the baseline assessment."
