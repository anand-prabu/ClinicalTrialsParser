  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Docetaxel is the standard, first-line chemotherapeutic agent for castrate resistant prostate
      cancer. While it has clinically useful activity, there is a strong need for substantial
      improvement in its efficacy. Possible ways for improving docetaxel monotherapy would be to
      combine it with an agent that either minimized toxicity (thus allowing higher doses) or
      improves efficacy (by targeting synergistic pathways). Lycopene is an attractive agent for
      combination with docetaxel because of its known accumulation in prostate tissue, its low
      toxicity, and its ability to inhibit signaling through the IGF-1 axis, and to reduce IL6
      levels.  Lycopene is highly synergistic with docetaxel at inhibiting the growth of prostate
      cancer in mice. The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)
      of lycopene given in combination with docetaxel. This dose can then be used for subsequent
      phase II or phase III studies.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must have a histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate and 2
             increasing pre-study PSA values, the last of which must be ≥1 ng/ml, at least 1 week
             apart within 56 days prior to enrollment

          -  Patients must have current or prior evidence of metastatic CRPC. Patients with
             radiographic evidence of disease progression but without PSA progression may also be
             eligible.

          -  Patients must be unresponsive or refractory to androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT), as
             indicated by a rising PSA level above the ADT nadir.

          -  Subjects may have received prior chemotherapy except for a combination of docetaxel
             and lycopene.  Prior chemotherapy must have been completed at least 1 year prior to
             start of treatment under this protocol. Prior biologic therapy, or any
             investigational drug must have been completed at least 28 days prior to start of
             therapy, and the patient must have recovered from toxicities of prior therapy to
             grade 1 or less.

          -  Patients must have been surgically or medically castrated, documented by a
             testosterone level less than 50ng/mL. If the patient is being treated with medical
             castration, he must be willing to continue this treatment for the duration of the
             study.  ADT should not be initiated, terminated, or dose-adjusted during the study.

          -  Prior external beam radiation therapy (to less than 30% of the bone marrow only) is
             allowed.  At least 28 days must have elapsed since the completion of radiation
             therapy and the patient must have recovered from side effects.  Prior treatment with
             samarium-153, radium-223, or strontium-86 is allowed if at least eight weeks have
             elapsed since dosing, and all toxicities have resolved to grade 1.  Soft tissue
             disease which has been radiated in the prior 2 months is not assessable as measurable
             disease.

          -  Patients may have received prior surgery. However, at least 21 days must have elapsed
             since completion of surgery and the patient must have recovered from all side
             effects.

          -  Patient must have adequate hepatic function as defined by 1) a serum bilirubin ≤the
             institutional upper limit of normal (IULN), and 2) SGOT or SGPT ≤2.5 x the
             institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of
             therapy.  Liver function tests should be evaluated prior to each treatment.

          -  Patients must have adequate renal function as defined by a serum creatinine ≤1.5 x
             the institutional upper limit of normal obtained within 14 days prior to start of
             therapy.

          -  Men of child bearing potential must be willing to consent to using effective
             contraception while on treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter.

          -  Age &gt; 18

          -  Patient must have an ECOG performance status 0-2.

          -  Patients must meet the following hematological criteria (minimal values):

          -  Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mcL

          -  Hemoglobin of &gt; 8.0gm/dL,

          -  White blood cell count &gt;2,500/mcL,

          -  Platelets &gt; 100,000/mcL Patients with lower values may participate if, in the opinion
             of the investigator, the cytopenias are the result of bone marrow involvement with
             active prostate cancer.

          -  Patients must be able to take oral medications.

          -  All patients must be informed and must sign and give written informed consent in
             accordance with institutional and federal guidelines. Patients who are unable to
             comply with study and/or follow-up procedures are ineligible.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled brain or spinal cord metastases

          -  History of congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within the previous six
             months.

          -  History of allergy or hypersensitivity to any component of the study drugs

          -  Evidence or history of a bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy, including
             therapy-induced coagulopathy.

          -  Presence of chronic diarrhea (&gt; grade 1 by CTC criteria), short bowel
             syndrome,pancreatic insufficiency, or malabsorption.

             opinion of the investigator, would increase the risk of serious toxicity from the
             study drugs.

          -  Concurrent use of any vitamin, herb, or mineral supplements containing lycopene for
             at least 14 days prior to start of therapy
