The new\n      medication is called quetiapine and it will be compared with a standard medication called\n      haloperidol decanoate.  The study will determine if quetiapine causes fewer problems than\n      haloperidol with side effects such as stiffness and restlessness and whether it costs the VA\n      more or less to treat patients with quetiapine.  In addition, blood samples will be\n      collected every three months to determine if certain chemicals in the blood can influence\n      the outcome of the subjects' illness."
