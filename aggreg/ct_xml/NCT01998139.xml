  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a major global health problem, leading to substantial morbidity and mortality
      despite medical care. The initial diagnosis of sepsis is a clinical challenge, as it is
      based on nonspecific systemic criteria. Excessive endothelial activation is a cardinal
      feature of sepsis and contributes to microvascular leak, edema, circulatory shock and organ
      failure. Activated endothelial cells shed endothelial microparticles (EMPs) which can be
      measured in plasma and are found at low levels in healthy subjects. Elevated EMPs have been
      reported in sepsis, but whether their effect is beneficial or deleterious is unclear. In
      this context, we hypothesize that circulating EMP levels can be assessed as a biomarker
      differentiating sepsis from non-sepsis critical illness, and furthermore, that in septic
      subjects, EMP levels will correlate with 30-day mortality. We propose to measure circulating
      EMPs at ICU admission in subjects with suspected sepsis. Final diagnoses will be adjudicated
      using standard criteria and 30-day mortality ascertained. Subjects determined not to have
      sepsis will serve as the control group. EMP levels will be correlated with diagnosis to
      ascertain the utility of EMP levels as a diagnostic biomarker for sepsis. For those subjects
      with proven sepsis, EMP levels will be correlated to 30-day mortality to assess EMP level as
      a prognostic marker in sepsis.

    <description>To evaluate the hypothesis that EMP level is a predictive biomarker for the diagnosis of sepsis. For the primary objective, a prospective, cross-sectional, case control design will be utilized. EMP levels will be measured at ICU admission in subjects with physician-suspected sepsis. For each subject, the final diagnosis of sepsis or non-sepsis critical illness will be adjudicated using standard criteria, and the subjects determined to have sepsis will serve as the cases while those subjects without sepsis will form the control group.</description>

    <description>To evaluate the hypothesis that EMP level is a predictive biomarker for mortality in sepsis. For the secondary objective, EMP levels will be measured on admission and daily for the first 5 ICU days or until the subject dies or leaves the ICU. While data will be collected prospectively on all subjects, the cohort for analysis for this objective will include only those subjects with a validated diagnosis of sepsis. In these subjects, 30-day mortality will be ascertained, and EMP levels correlated with mortality to determine the utility of EMPs as a biomarker for mortality risk in sepsis.</description>
