            "textblock": "VVZ-149 is a novel analgesic drug candidate that shows a potential analgesic activity\n      inhibiting GlyT2 and 5HT2A simultaneously. There have been many efforts to develop\n      single-target selective drugs to treat pain, but usually unsuccessful due to the lack of\n      efficacy or limitations of single-target approach for new drug discovery. VVZ-149 is\n      expected to have a dual-target activity, demonstrated having a synergism between GlyT2 and\n      5HT2A antagonistic activities to maximize an antinociceptive effect in the in vivo animal\n      models. Now the investigators are developing VVZ-149 as an IV injection to treat\n      post-operative pain.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate a safety, tolerability and\n      pharmacokinetic properties of VVZ-149 injection with placebo in healthy male volunteers.\n      This Phase 1 study consists of a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, single and\n      multiple ascending dose (SAD & MAD) escalation clinical trials."

The planned groups for dose escalations were\n      0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mg/kg groups. As a pilot study for safety in this\n      first-in-human study, only 3 subjects received active drug are allocated to first two groups\n      each, without subjects for placebo. For the following groups, 6 subjects for active drug and\n      2 for placebos are allocated after randomized.\n\n      MAD study is planned that 2 cohorts of 10 healthy male subjects each were administered\n      multiple doses of VVZ-149 injection or placebo. The final doses of VVZ-149 injection will be\n      determined later based on the results of SAD study.
