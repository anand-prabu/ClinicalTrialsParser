Drugs used in chemotherapy,\n      such as carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells\n      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing and may also make tumor cells\n      more sensitive to radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of tipifarnib when\n      given together with radiation therapy after combination chemotherapy in treating patients\n      with stage III non-small cell lung cancer."

Treatment repeats every 28 days for 2\n      courses.\n\n      Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of induction chemotherapy, patients receive oral\n      tipifarnib twice daily for 7 weeks. Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week\n      for 7 weeks beginning 3 days after the start of tipifarnib. After completion of\n      radiotherapy, patients receive oral tipifarnib twice daily for 4 days and then once daily\n      for 4 days.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tipifarnib while receiving radiotherapy\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Beginning 4-6 weeks after the completion of radiotherapy and tipifarnib, patients receive\n      maintenance therapy comprising oral tipifarnib twice daily on days 1-21. Maintenance therapy\n      repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 9-12 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
