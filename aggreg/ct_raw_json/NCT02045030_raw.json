Patients will consent to a needle core biopsy of a liver metastatic lesion\n      prior to starting treatment.

For patients not participating in the Q-CROC-01 study, patients will be\n      required to undergo a liver needle core biopsy of a metastatic lesion before study\n      treatment.\n\n      Biopsies and blood samples will be collected from all study patients. An exploratory\n      pharmacoeconomic analysis will be performed to evaluate productivity loss, quality of life\n      and resource utilization while on treatment with aflibercept.\n\n      A total of 52 patients will be enrolled, primarily at centers participating in the Q-CROC-01\n      study.  The trial will  close enrolment when 42 evaluable pre-treatment tumor biopsy samples\n      have been obtained. Accrual of the total patient population is estimated to take 24-36\n      months with the estimated start date being February 2014."

In pre-clinical assessments, aflibercept results in stronger angiogenesis inhibition than bevacizumab, exhibiting at least 100-1000 times higher affinity to the circulating VEGFs. It is postulated that in vivo, the binding of these ligands to aflibercept results in the blockade of tumor angiogenesis along with pruning of existing tumor vascular elements and reduction of VEGF-driven vascular permeability. The expected outcome is reduced growth of primary and metastatic tumors by impeding the density of tumor vasculature and diminishing the abnormal leakiness of tumor vessels that supply matrix components to the cancer.",
