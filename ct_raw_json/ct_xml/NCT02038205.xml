  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A prospective cohort follow-up study design is undertaken. Both males and females with mild
      to moderate carpal tunnel syndrome will receive standard-of-care wrist splint for 6 weeks
      and undergo follow up studies for data collection. Controls will also be seen for a one time
      visit.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years or older and;

          -  Diagnosis of mild to moderate CTS with median motor latency at 8 cm is greater than
             4.5 milliseconds or Combined Sensory Index &gt; 0.9 where first line therapy is
             indicated to include nocturnal wrist bracing

          -  Control subjects without symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Evidence of severe CTS as seen with electromyographic changes in the body of the
             muscle

          -  Untreated hypothyroidism, Rheumatologic disorders

          -  Diagnosed Severe CTS or Chronic symptoms of carpal tunnel, greater than 1 year, this
             includes wasting of the hand muscles

          -  Undergoing or previously treated for carpal tunnel on affected side. This includes
             surgery (carpal tunnel release), corticosteroid injections, bracing within the last 3
             months while wearing the brace consistently every night, or any other intervention.

          -  Currently pregnant or &lt; 3 months post partum

          -  History of wrist, hand fracture or severe trauma to affected hand and/or wrist

          -  Known tumor, mass or deformity of the hand/wrist

          -  Inflammatory articular disease of the joints or tendons Existing cervical
             radiculopathy or previous surgeries to the neck for radicular symptoms

          -  History of electrodiagnostic evidence of generalized polyneuropathy or evidence of
             denervation

          -  Diagnosed neuromuscular disorders which may complicate CTS diagnosis

          -  Implanted electronic device (pacemaker, intrathecal pump/stimulator)

          -  Any illness that makes it unsafe for the patient to participate in the study

          -  Not fluent in English as NeuroQOL and other subjective information is limited to the
             English language interpretation
