The HPLC technique is used for the analysis of the level of\n      1-hydroksypyrene in urine as the biomarker of PAH exposure (12 and 24 months).\n\n      Exposure to lead, cadmium, mercury in children. Blood and hair are collected for about 100\n      children. Total and inorganic mercury is analyzed using cold vapour atomic fluorescence\n      spectrophotometry.
