      This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give
      reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease. The
      study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical
      signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease.

      This study is to assess whether pasireotide alone and combined with cabergoline will give
      reliefs on patients with recurrent, persistent and newly diagnosed Cushing's disease. The
      study will also assess study drug safety, the changes in Quality of Life and on clinical
      signs and symptoms of Cushing's disease. The study will enroll two groups of patients.
      Pasireotide naive patients at the time of screening (Group 1), and patients receiving
      maximal tolerated dose of pasireotide at the time of screening (Group 2).  Group 1 patients
      will begin study treatment of pasireotide at 0.6mg twice a day for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks,
      if cortisol level is not controlled and the dose is tolerated well, pasireotide will be
      increased to 0.9mg for another 8 weeks. If during or at the end of the 8 week period,
      cortisol level is still not controlled cabergoline will be added at 0.5mg once a day.
      Cabergoline can be increased up to 1.0mg once a day in combination with pasireotide. Group 2
      patients will immediately begin combination treatment by adding cabergoline at 0.5mg once a
      day to the current pasireotide treatment. Cabergoline dose can be increased up to 1.0mg once
      a day if cortisol is not controlled at a lower dose.
