  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patient reported outcomes (PROs) instruments are often used to measure meaningful treatment
      benefit or risk in clinical trials. PROs allow patients    voices to be heard in ways that
      assist healthcare clinicians to address treatment effects and individual patient
      preferences. Unfortunately, infants and young children, especially those with a debilitating
      disease, such as neuromuscular disorders (NMD), may be less able to provide clear and
      concise information about treatment effects. In this case, we often defer to parents and
      guardians (to be referred to collectively as parents throughout protocol) to provide their
      perception of their child   s overall health and wellbeing. Including parents in the
      assessment process recognizes the unique knowledge parents have of their child   s
      development, reinforces their central role in implementing interventions, and aids in their
      ability to make better-informed healthcare decisions [1]. Yet, most parent-reports for young
      children are confined to overall quality of life (QoL). While QoL is an important area of
      assessment, its meaning varies among different ages and populations, and its results are
      often not precise enough to reveal small differences within samples [2]. A more specific
      area of concern in children with NMD is early-onset muscle weakness leading to difficulties
      in motor function.

      The current lack of patient-centered, sensitive measures (based on motor function and item
      difficulty hierarchy) that are suited for repeated assessments in infants and young children
      with NMD represents a major obstacle to the rapid translation of promising therapeutic
      interventions from preclinical models to clinical research studies. Multiple clinical
      outcome measures used at a single time-point for capturing a child   s functional status are
      burdensome, difficult to interpret and do not provide us with comprehensive, meaningful
      information to detect changes following an intervention [3]. Psychometric measures that can
      be completed by parents make it possible to collect a considerable amount of data over many
      time-points rather than being limited to a single clinical observation. Moreover, a
      parent-observational measure that focuses on their child   s functional performance in their
      real-life will maximize the ecological validity of measures of motor development used for
      clinical trials.

      Objective: To develop a parent reported observational measure of motor development in
      infants and young children, which will serve as a complimentary tool to clinical observation
      by reporting motor function as observed in the home setting and which will be used in
      clinical trials.

      Study population: Parents of children aged 0-5 with neuromuscular disease and neuromuscular
      experts in pediatrics.

      Design: Qualitative (parent interviews, focus groups) and quantitative study (analysis of
      newly developed questionnaire)

      Outcome Measures: parental responses to phone interviews, neuromuscular expert responses to
      focus groups, parental responses to cognitive interviews, validity and reliability of newly
      developed questionnaire
