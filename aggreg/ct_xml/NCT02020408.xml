  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use brain imaging technologies to measure several neurotransmitters
      (serotonin and dopamine) that contribute to our abilities to respond to reward or inhibit
      our impulses, and which are known to be altered in the brain of people with anorexia nervosa
      (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN).  Because palatable food stimulates dopamine secretion, we
      propose to use a challenge with brain imaging that will stimulate dopamine release which we
      hypothesize will generate anxiety rather than pleasure in AN, and will help explain why AN
      restrict eating in order to reduce anxiety. This study will help to understand the unique
      puzzling symptoms in eating disorders and contribute to finding better methods for
      identifying effective treatments for these often relapsing and sometimes chronic disorders.

    <textblock>
      Alterations of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) activity may contribute to extremes of
      appetitive behaviours in anorexia nervosa (AN) and bulimia nervosa (BN), through effects on
      inhibitory and reward neural pathways.  To avoid the confounding effects of malnutrition,
      and because they have behaviours and neural circuit alterations relevant for this study, we
      will study 25 recovered (REC) restricting-type AN, 25 REC bulimic-type AN (AN-BN), 25 REC
      BN, and 25 control women (CW). This 5 year study, of women 18 to 45 years old, will employ
      positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with radioligands for the 5-HT transporter
      ([11C]DASB) and DA  D2/D3 receptors ([11C]raclopride).
