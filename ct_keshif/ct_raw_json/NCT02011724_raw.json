Subject with non-VLU-related chronic pain must be on a stable pain medication\n             regimen and must, in the Investigator's opinion, not be anticipated to require a new\n             pain medication for the chronic pain condition during the course of the study.\n\n          -  Subject is not willing to discontinue the use of topical analgesics at the VLU\n             (topical anesthetic is permitted for debridement).\n\n          -  Subject who has arterial disease, as determined by an ankle-brachial index (ABI), of\n             <0.65.\n\n          -  Subject who has received an investigational drug, device, or biological/bioactive\n             treatment within 30 days prior to study enrollment.\n\n          -  Subject who is scheduled to have a vascular intervention on the study extremity\n             during the study.\n\n          -  Subject with a biopsy confirmed active malignancy at the VLU. Also, subject with any\n             active malignancy not at the VLU, with the exception of squamous cell carcinoma or\n             basal cell carcinoma.\n\n          -  Subject who is currently receiving, anticipates receiving, or has received, at any\n             time within 30 days prior to Screening visit, topical corticosteroids at the VLU.\n\n          -  Subject has vasculitis, severe rheumatoid arthritis, and other collagen vascular\n             diseases.\n\n          -  Subject has signs and symptoms of wound infection, cellulitis, or osteomyelitis at\n             the VLU.\n\n          -  Subject has a VLU with an avascular wound bed.\n\n          -  Subject has a VLU with exposed bone, tendon, or fascia.\n\n          -  Subject has other wounds (DFU, surgical, etc.) on the same limb as the VLU.\n\n          -  Subject has a known hypersensitivity to bovine collagen or to the components of the\n             Apligraf agarose shipping medium.\n\n          -  Subject previously treated with Apligraf, or any other cell or tissue-based product\n             at the VLU within 30 days of the Screening visit.\n\n          -  Subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, has a history of alcohol or\n             substance abuse within the previous year that could interfere with study compliance\n             (eg, inability to attend scheduled study visits).\n\n          -  Subject, who in the opinion of the Investigator, for any reason other than those\n             listed above, will not be able to complete the study per protocol."
