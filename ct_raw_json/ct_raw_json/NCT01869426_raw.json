Consequently, various treatment approaches have\n      been tried to alleviate this condition.\n\n      Recent studies have suggested that changes of intestinal microflora of a newborn may play an\n      important role in pathogenesis of infantile colic. Therefore, dietary supplementation with\n      probiotics has been proposed for the improvement of this condition."

The study product will be supplied as a box\n      containing the oil bottle and a powder stick. The product should be stored refrigerated. On\n      the first day of supplementation, the mother will open the sachet, pour the contents into\n      the bottle and shake vigorously. A dropper is provided to count the drops. The suspension\n      must be shaken vigorously before every use. Compliance will be monitored by filling out a\n      diary."
