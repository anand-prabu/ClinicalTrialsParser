The\n      primary objective is to compare the rates of local-regional recurrence (LRR) following\n      attempted breast conserving therapy in a cohort of women with triple negative or HER-2\n      amplified breast cancer randomized to preoperative staging with mammography (control arm) or\n      mammography plus breast MRI (MRI arm). The secondary objectives for this study are:\n\n        1. To compare the re-operation rates following attempted breast conserving therapy between\n           women assessed preoperatively with breast MRI to those assessed without the use of\n           breast MRI\n\n        2. To compare local recurrence rates between women who undergo BCT on the control arm to\n           women who undergo BCT on the MRI arm\n\n        3. To compare the conversion rate to mastectomy secondary to persistent positive margins\n           or poor cosmesis within the first 6 months of attempting BCT (prior to the\n           administration of RT) between women assessed preoperatively with breast MRI to those\n           assessed without the use of breast MRI\n\n        4. To compare the contralateral breast cancer rates in women randomized to preoperative\n           breast MRI to those not receiving pre-operative breast MRI\n\n        5. To compare the disease-free survival rates between women assessed preoperatively with\n           breast MRI to those assessed without the use of breast MRI\n\n        6. To compare breast cancer specific and overall survival outcomes of women assessed\n           preoperatively with breast MRI to those assessed without the use of breast MRI\n\n        7. To estimate the rate of MRI-guided localization assisted surgery\n\n        8. To estimate the rate of multi-centric disease in the index breast for women in the MRI\n           arm\n\n        9. To evaluate the accuracy of index lesion characteristics and other factors in\n           predicting multi-centricity in the cohort randomized to breast MRI\n\n       10. To assess the positive predictive values (PPV) of MRI in detecting ipsilateral\n           multi-centric disease and contralateral disease in women with breast cancer undergoing\n           preoperative breast MRI\n\n       11. To estimate the false positive rate for detection of multiple foci of breast cancer by\n           MRI\n\n      All registered patients will be monitored for relapse and survival for 5 years from the date\n      of surgery. Patients will be followed a minimum of every 4 months for the first 2 years from\n      diagnosis and a minimum of every 6 months during years 3-5. Patients will be monitored for\n      local, regional, distant relapse and vital status."
