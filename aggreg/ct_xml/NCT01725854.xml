  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purposes of this study are to evaluate the acceptability and utility of a mind-body
      intervention on a convenience sample of Soldiers (n=120) who have screened positive through
      RESPECT-MIL for symptoms that may lead to post-traumatic stress and to test the
      effectiveness of this Relaxation Response (RR) intervention designed to decrease the
      physiological and psychosocial effects of stress and trauma. The study aims to enhance the
      psychological health of Soldiers with a RR intervention designed to promote self-awareness
      of physiological responses to stress and the ability to increase relaxation responses.

      Specific Aims:

        1. Demonstrate that trainers can be trained effectively to deliver the intervention, a
           mind-body skills training program based on the Benson-Henry Institute's standard RR
           training curriculum and tailored to a military population.

        2. Evaluate feasibility, acceptability, and compliance to the training program in an
           active duty military population.

        3. Compare outcomes on sleep disturbance, PTSD, stress-related symptoms, quality of life,
           and psychosocial variables related to resilience of Soldiers who receive the 6-week
           training program to promote the Relaxation Response to those Soldiers who do not
           receive the intervention.

    <description>Sleep will be measured pre and post intervention. Sleep will be measured by the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI). The PSQI assesses sleep quality and disturbances during the past month based on seven component scores for sleep quality, latency, duration, efficiency, disturbance, medication use, and daytime dysfunction that sum to a global score. A Sleep Diary will also be used to measure sleep and related factors.</description>

    <description>The Military tailored RR training program will consist of six weekly small group sessions which involve group presentations, in-group skill building exercises, and at-home assignments.  Groups will contain 5-8 participants who are active-duty Soldiers enrolled in either Respect-MIL or the Interdisciplinary Pain Management Center (IPMC).</description>

    <description>Participants randomized to the control group will receive standard care through their providers at Respect-MIL or at the IPMC.  Participants randomized to the control group will remain on the wait list for further standard care.  After the collection of the final data point, these participants will also have the option to participate in an abbreviated, two-hour version of the RR training.</description>

    <description>Behavioral Relaxation Response Training (Benson-Henry Institute Relaxation Response Training) Participants randomized to the intervention group will participate in the six weekly RR sessions. Examples of in-group skill building exercises are mini relaxations, diaphragmatic breathing, introduction to imagery, and eliciting RR through Yoga.  Presentations topics include Introduction to Mind/Body Medicine, Introduction to the RR, Experiential RR Sessions, and Introduction to Cognitive Restructuring.  Home skill building assignments include relaxation focus practice, an appreciation journal, self-monitoring with Biodots (biosensor technology that helps participants to monitor and regulate their psycho-emotional state), physical activity, balanced nutrition, and progress notes.</description>
