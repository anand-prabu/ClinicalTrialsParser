  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. The first part of the study will look at the absorption of
      three different polyphenol preparations into the blood, the variability of their absorption
      and whether their absorption can be enhanced by mixing with pollen shells (pollen shells
      have been shown to enhance lipid molecule absorption). For this purpose 16 healthy
      volunteers will be recruited. All participants will receive all the 3 supplements with and
      without mixing with pollen shells so they will undergo a total of 3 tests. For each test six
      blood samples will be taken over an 8 hour period.

      The second part of the study will look at the absorption of the best absorbed polyphenol
      identified from part 1 to see if absorption is dose linear or may plateau. A total of 30
      healthy volunteers will be recruited. All participants will receive three different doses
      (in random order) of the same polyphenol supplement and then six blood samples will be taken
      over an 8 hour period.
