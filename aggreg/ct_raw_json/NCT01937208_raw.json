In China,the recommend\n      radiation dose of concurrent chemoradiation was 60Gy. The study is a clinical phase III,\n      randomized trial to compare the different radiation dose(60Gy vs 50Gy) of concurrent\n      chemoradiation using 3D-CRT or IMRT in patients with unresectable esophageal carcinoma."
