Patients\n      demonstrating a response by week 10 may receive 3 additional monthly vaccinations initiated\n      within 8 weeks of the fifth dose. Patients demonstrating a response by vaccination 8 may\n      receive 3 additional vaccinations administered at two-month intervals.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
