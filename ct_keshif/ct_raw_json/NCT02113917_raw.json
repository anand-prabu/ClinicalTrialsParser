The study of literature series HLHa shows that these syndromes frequently\n      develop in immunocompromised patients (renal transplant, HIV, collagen in Processing\n      immunosuppressants) in the course of a viral infection. HLH syndrome has also been described\n      as a clinical form of lymphoma or connective disease (lupus). These clinical forms are rare,\n      severe and recurrent suggesting the possibility that immune deficiency could be involved.\n      The study of pediatric forms has definitely established a link between HLH syndrome and the\n      presence of immune deficiency by identifying the nature of the latter. Four genetically\n      determined diseases are manifested by HLH syndrome. These conditions are Family\n      lymphohistiocytosis (LHF) syndrome, Chediak-Higashi CHS syndrome, Griscelli (GS) type 2\n      syndromes and X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP 1 and 2). The mutated genes are respectively\n      perforin Unc 13.4 and syntaxin in the LHF2, 3, 4 (10q locus genetic for LHF 1), CHS1/LYST\n      (Lysosomal Trafficking regulator) in the CHS, in the Rab27a GS type 2, and XIAP and SH2D1A\n      in the XLP. It is now well established that proteins encoded by these genes are necessary\n      for the cytotoxic function of CD8 + and in the absence of these proteins is the cytotoxocity\n      CD8 + deficient. Also, closed clinical and biological characteristics shared by pediatric\n      genetic and adult forms suggest the  existence of immune defects responsible for some or all\n      HLH adult patients."
