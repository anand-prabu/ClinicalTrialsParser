The chemotherapy entails the administration of multiple cycles of infusional\n      doxorubicin, etoposide and vincristine chemotherapy (total of 3), alternating with cycles of\n      high-dose cyclophosphamide (3 cycles).  Patients will be randomized, on a 2:1 basis, to\n      either receive only chemotherapy or to undergo a PBSC harvest with PBSC reinfusion and IL-2\n      following the last cycle of chemotherapy.  In all patients, immunological monitoring for\n      NK/LAK activity, T cell number and function will be performed.  The therapy is specifically\n      targeted for patients who would be candidates for high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell\n      support."
