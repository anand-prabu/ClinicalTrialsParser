Providing a person with a knee\n      brace designed for OA can help unload the arthritic part of the knee, thereby reducing pain\n      and lead to improved function. The purpose of this study is to determine if use of the Rebel\n      Reliever knee brace manufactured by Townsend Design can reduce pain and stiffness, improve\n      strength and balance, and enhance functional activities such as stair and level gait, and\n      ultimately lead to increased participation in the community."
