Secondary\n      objective = the control of IM (internal margin) intra-fraction.\n\n      Step B: primary objective = to evaluate the proportion of the resectable patients after\n      radio-chemotherapy. Secondary objectives = overall Response Rate (ORR); safety profile of\n      combinated treatment;overall survival (OS); local progression free survival (LPFS) and\n      progression free survival (PFS).\n\n      Statistical Considerations:\n\n      Step A:\n\n      Assuming that the probability to observe a toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment\n      discontinuation with the new treatment is less than 20%, 11 patients are to be evaluated for\n      toxicity. If no toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation will be\n      observed in 11 patients, the treatment can be considered safe with a probability > 90%. If 1\n      toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation will be observed, 7 more\n      patients needs to be recruited. If no further toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment\n      discontinuation occurs, the treatment could be considered safe with a probability \u2265 90%.\n\n      If 2 or more  toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation on 11 patients\n      or 2 or more toxicity involving the radiotherapy treatment discontinuation on 18 patients\n      will be observed, the study will be stopped because not safe and another kind of\n      radiotherapy schedule must be designed.\n\n      Step B:\n\n      If the radiotherapy treatment will be considered no toxic, the study will continue in Step B\n      : the goal of this phase II study is to increase the proportion of resectable patients of at\n      least 15% with the new radio-chemotherapeutic treatment. By using the single-stage design\n      (Gehan EA, J Chron Dis 1961) a total of 40 patients is required to be recruited in 2 years,\n      and a further one-year period of follow-up is requested. If at least 7 patients out of 40\n      enrolled will be resectable, the hypothesis that the proportion of resectable patients will\n      be less or equal to P1  (P1=the proportion of resectable patients with the new\n      radio-chemotherapeutic treatment) will be refused and the treatment could be considered\n      active."
