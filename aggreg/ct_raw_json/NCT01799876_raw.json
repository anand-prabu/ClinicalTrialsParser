These cells may encourage healing at the surgical site, although\n      whether or how much they encourage healing is unknown. Determining whether such improved\n      healing occurs is the purpose of this study.\n\n      Some patients will have the fat removed and cells inserted in their knee, and other patients\n      will not have the fat removed or cells inserted.  To which group patients are assigned is\n      determined by a random process, similar to flipping a coin. The surgery is the same in all\n      other ways for all patients.\n\n      Participation will require attending regularly scheduled postoperative visits, having 3 MRI\n      tests, and answering a short survey.  No additional visits other beyond those normally\n      scheduled for postsurgical care are required."
