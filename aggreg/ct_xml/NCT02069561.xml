  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to test Eicosapentaenoic acid's effects on markers relevant to
      colorectal carcinogenesis, RNA and DNA profiles, and the possibility that Eicosapentaenoic
      Acid treatment might be associated with changes of the gut microbiota and metabolomic
      profiles in patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis.

    <description>Five patients undergoing screening colonoscopy and polypectomy using biopsy forceps.  Six biopsies of healthy mucosa will be collected at the time of colonoscopy.

    <description>Twenty patients with long-standing ulcerative colitis undergoing the usual colonoscopic surveillance + biopsy sampling will be recruited. At entry six extra biopsy samples will be collected from the colon. We will also collect blood (for serum, plasma and red cells isolation), urine and stools. Subjects will then receive 2 g/day of Eicosapentaenoic Acid (ALFA ™, SLA Pharma AG, Switzerland) as a supplement for 90 days. At the end of the study each subject will undergo sigmoidoscopy for the collection of 6 biopsies. Blood, urine and stools will be obtained prior to the procedure.</description>
