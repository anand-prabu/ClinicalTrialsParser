  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weight loss achieved through gastric banding will be superior to treatment with metformin in
      preserving or restoring pancreatic beta cell function in people with prediabetes or mild
      type 2 diabetes.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      BetaFat is a 2-arm, unblinded study to compare gastric banding to treatment with metformin
      over a 24-month period in moderately obese adults with pre- or mild type 2 diabetes. The
      primary outcome will be change in β-cell compensation for insulin resistance, which the
      investigators will compare between groups. Secondary analyses will include other potential
      markers of β-cell health and potential mediators of treatment-specific effects. The main
      focus will be on mediators related to obesity. Clinically, the project will serve as a test
      of concept for use of gastric banding relatively early in the spectrum of obesity and β-cell
      disease. Biologically, the results will provide crucial information on potential mediators
      of β-cell failure and its arrest or reversal in the context of obesity. Those mediators will
      guide the development of more effective treatment and monitoring for the β-cell disease that
      causes type 2 diabetes.
