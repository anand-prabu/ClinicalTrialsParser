  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Synera, which is a heated topical patch containing both lidocaine and tetracaine, is
      intended to reduce the pain associated with venipuncture and superficial dermatologic
      procedures by numbing the skin. This study will test the effectiveness of the Synera
      lidocaine/tetracaine patch when administered for 30 Â± 5 minutes to provide dermal anesthesia
      in adult oncology patients undergoing venipuncture as part of their care, for treatment or
      diagnostics (laboratory or imaging).  Compared to the use of the placebo patch, this study
      hypothesizes that the difference of 1 cm on the 0-10 visual analogue scale (VAS) will be
      observed 30 minutes after the use of the Synera patch. Pain intensity will be assessed by a
      0-10 VAS

    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint is the subject's report of pain intensity regarding the venipuncture using a 0-10 VAS. The efficacy endpoints include the degree of pain reduction due to the needle stick experienced following the most recent administration of an analgesic drug, and how satisfied subjects are overall with the treatment provided to reduce pain by using the Global Assessment of Satisfaction with Venipuncture.</description>

    <description>All subjects will receive 2 patch applications during this study:  one Synera, one placebo. The 2 patch applications must be done on separate days.  Only 1 patch will be used per application.  Arm 1 subjects will receive Synera patch for the 1st application, and placebo for the second.  Arm 2 patients will receive placebo patch for the 1st application, and Synera patch for the second.</description>
