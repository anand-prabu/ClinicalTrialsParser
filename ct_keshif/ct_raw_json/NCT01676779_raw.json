By design (phase II) this trial will not be powered to\n      statistically prove a predefined difference between the two study arms (this would require a\n      phase III design). Patients treated in Arm-B will be able to initiate immunotherapy with\n      autologous DC at the time of recurrence that can not be salvaged by local therapy.\n      Documentation of the anti-tumor activity and survival following DC-treatment at recurrence\n      in Arm-B patients will be a secondary objective of this clinical trial."
