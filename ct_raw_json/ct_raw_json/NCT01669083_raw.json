This study will be the first dosing\n      experience with this compound in women. It is important to characterize the pharmacokinetics\n      of GSK557296 in women to determine the most appropriate doses and dosing regimens for future\n      clinical studies.  Understanding the pharmacokinetics of GSK557296 in women will also enable\n      more accurate characterization of any exposure-response relationship in future studies.\n\n      Two previous studies with GSK557296 were conducted in men with oral doses ranging from 10\n      milligram (mg) to 200 mg. GSK557296 is being studied in women for the indication of enhanced\n      embryo and or blastocyst implantation in women undergoing IVF treatment. This is a bridging\n      study to characterize the pharmacokinetics of GSK557296 in women to determine the most\n      appropriate doses and dosing regimens for future clinical studies.\n\n      This is a non-randomized, open label, adaptive design study in healthy female volunteers. A\n      maximum total of 48 subjects, will participate in different cohorts. Subjects in Cohort 1\n      will receive 10 mg single dose followed by repeat dose. A one week break will occur to allow\n      for analysis of the PK data, prior to starting the second Cohort.  Subjects in Cohort 2 will\n      receive 150 mg single dose followed by repeat dose. Cohort 3 and Cohort 4 were adaptive\n      based on the requirement of additional doses to be studies after PK data will be analyzed\n      from each of the first 2 cohorts."
