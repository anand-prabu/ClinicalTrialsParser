Patients with recurrent or refractory\n      atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRT) or malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT) will receive\n      alisertib as a single agent.  Patients with newly diagnosed ATRT or concurrent extra-CNS MRT\n      will receive alisertib as part of age- and risk-adapted chemotherapy.\n\n      Alisertib will be administered as a single agent on days 1-7 of each 21-day cycle in all\n      recurrent patients enrolled on Stratum A.  For the patients on the newly diagnosed strata\n      (B, C or D), alisertib will be administered in sequence with chemotherapy and radiotherapy.\n\n      This study has 3 primary strata:  (A) children with recurrent/progressive ATRT or extra-CNS\n      malignant rhabdoid tumors (MRT), (B) children < 36 months-old with newly diagnosed ATRT, (C)\n      children > 36 months old with newly diagnosed ATRT.  Children with concurrent MRT will be\n      treated according to age and risk stratification schemes outlined for strata B and C and\n      will have additional treatment for local control.  Children with synchronous ATRT will be\n      treated with age and CNS risk-appropriate therapy, and also receive surgery and/or radiation\n      for local control of the non-CNS tumor.\n\n      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES\n\n        -  To estimate the sustained objective response rate of recurrent or refractory pediatric\n           patients with ATRT (atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor in the CNS) (Stratum A1) treated\n           with alisertib and determine if the response is sufficient to merit continued\n           investigation of alisertib in this population.\n\n        -  To estimate the sustained objective response rate of pediatric patients with recurrent\n           or refractory MRT (malignant rhabdoid tumor outside the CNS) (Stratum A2) treated with\n           alisertib and determine if the response is sufficient to merit continued investigation\n           of alisertib in this population.\n\n        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are younger than 36\n           months of age at diagnosis with no metastatic disease (Stratum B1) treated with\n           alisertib in sequence with induction and consolidation chemotherapy and radiation\n           (depending on age) and to determine if the rates are sufficient to merit continued\n           investigation of alisertib in this population.\n\n        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are younger than 36\n           months of age at diagnosis, with metastatic disease (Stratum B2) treated with alisertib\n           in sequence with induction and consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if the rates\n           are sufficient to merit continued investigation of alisertib in this population.\n\n        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are 3 years of age\n           or greater at diagnosis with no metastatic disease  and gross total resection or near\n           total resection (Stratum C1) treated with alisertib in sequence with radiation and\n           consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if the rates are sufficient to merit\n           continued investigation of alisertib in this population.\n\n        -  To estimate the PFS rate of newly diagnosed patients with ATRT who are 3 years of age\n           or greater at diagnosis with metastatic or residual disease (Stratum C2) treated with\n           alisertib in sequence with radiation and consolidation chemotherapy and to determine if\n           the rates are sufficient to merit continued investigation of alisertib in this\n           population.\n\n        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of alisertib in pediatric\n           patients and to relate drug disposition to toxicity.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES\n\n        -  To estimate the duration of objective response and PFS in patients with\n           recurrent/progressive ATRT and MRT (Strata A1 and A2).\n\n        -  To estimate PFS and OS distributions in patients with newly diagnosed ATRT (Strata B1,\n           B2, B3, C1 and C2).\n\n        -  To describe toxicities experienced by patients treated on this trial, specifically any\n           toxicities of alisertib when administered as a single agent or in combination with\n           other therapy over multiple courses and toxicities related to proton or photon\n           radiotherapy.\n\n        -  To describe the patterns of local and distant failure in newly diagnosed patients\n           (Strata B1, B2, B3, C1 and C2).

Newly diagnosed patients (Strata B, C\n      and D) will receive alisertib in sequence with chemo and radiotherapy.  Patients on Stratum\n      B1 and D1 will receive focal RT once they are >12 months of age.  Patients on Stratum\n      B2/B3/D2, with disseminated disease will receive optional central nervous system (CNS)\n      radiation therapy (RT). Patients on Strata C1/C2/D3 will receive risk-stratified\n      craniospinal irradiation (CSI) and boost to primary tumor site followed by adjuvant\n      chemotherapy.  Those patients with concurrent CNS and extra-CNS MRT may undergo irradiation\n      of the extra-CNS MRT according to best clinical management in addition to CNS directed\n      therapy.
