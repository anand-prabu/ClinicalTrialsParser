    <textblock>
      IMMU-114 will be studied at different dose schedules and dose levels in order to assess the
      highest dose safely tolerated.  IMMU-114 will be administered subcutaneously (under the
      skin).  IMMU-114 will be given 1-3 times weekly for 3 weeks followed by one week of rest.
      This is considered one cycle.  Up to 6 cycles will be given.

             rituximab-refractory defined as having less than a partial response to the previous
             rituximab-containing regimen are eligible at any time.  Patients who are
             rituximab-sensitive, defines as having a complete response or partial response to the
             last rituximab-containing regimen, are eligible at least 4 weeks after the last
             infusion of rituximab.

             within 3 days of first study dose.  Female patients who are surgically sterilized or
             who are &gt;45 years old and have not experienced menses for &gt;2 years may have β-hCG
             pregnancy test waived.

             of all therapy.  Patients with active hepatitis B or C infection are not eligible.

          -  Required baseline laboratory data (If the following laboratory studies are abnormal
             secondary to the underlying malignancy as determined by the treating clinician, they

             therapy that will interfere with interpretation of efficacy or toxicity of IMMU-114,
             or limit survival to 2 years.  These patients should be discussed with the sponsor
             prior to enrollment.  Patients with basal or squamous skin carcinoma, cervical
             carcinoma in situ on biopsy, localized breast cancer requiring hormonal therapy or
             localized prostate cancer (Gleason score &lt; 5) do not require discussion.

             1 or less (excluding alopecia).

          -  Patients with substance abuse or other medical or psychiatric conditions that, in the
             opinion of the investigator, would confound study interpretation or affect the
