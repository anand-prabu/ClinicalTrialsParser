  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, acceptability and feasibility of
      delivery of PrEP or PEP as part of combination HIV prevention services for high-risk MSM and
      transgender women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two community-based sites (Los Angeles Gay and Lesbian Center [LAGLC] and The OASIS Clinic)
      will serve as facilities at which participants may present for screening for prevention
      services. At the sites, eligibility criteria will be assessed, HIV, STD and laboratory
      testing will be performed, and HIV prevention service referrals will be initiated.
      Follow-up will be on a monthly basis for the first three months, and then de-escalated to an
      every-3-month interval.

      The program stratifies participants into two cohorts on the basis of sexual risk behavior:
      a low-moderate risk cohort (LM) and a high-risk cohort (H).  Participants in the LM cohort
      will be provided a customized prevention package (CPP) including access to post-exposure
      prophylaxis (PEP) for emergency HIV prevention in the event of unanticipated HIV exposure.
      Participants in the H cohort will be provided a CPP including daily Truvada-based PrEP.  All
      participants will be followed for 48 weeks.  Participants in the LM cohort who, on
      longitudinal sexual risk behavior surveillance, report increased levels of sexual
      risk-taking such that they meet enrollment criteria for the H-cohort will be transitioned to
      the H-cohort.

      At each follow-up visit, a careful safety assessment will be made, including signs/symptoms
      and laboratory assessments.  STI testing will be performed at 3 month intervals.  An
      escalating-intensity adherence intervention will be implemented based on real-time serum
      tenofovir levels.  A computer-assisted self-interview (CASI) will be used to capture
      detailed sexual risk, adherence, and substance use behavior.

High Risk Cohort Criteria (one or more of the following has to be met):
No condom use during anal intercourse with ≥3 male sex partners who are HIV-positive or of unknown HIV status during the last three months.
STI diagnosis during the last 12 months.
Previous PEP use during the last 12 months (* see exclusion criteria)
Has at least one HIV infected sexual partner for ≥4 weeks.</description>

    <description>The intervention medication will be tenofovir + emtricitabine, provided as a fixed-dose combination tablet as Truvada®. Dosing is 1 tablet by mouth once daily. For participants with a a confirmed (i.e. two consecutive) reduction in CrCl to &lt;50 mL/min, Truvada will be dose-reduced to 1 tablet by mouth every other day. For patients with creatinine clearance &lt;30 mL/min, Truvada will be discontinued.</description>
