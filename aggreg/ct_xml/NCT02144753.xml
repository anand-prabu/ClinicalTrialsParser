  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this Phase II trial is to test the NTX-1 Fiber in patients with
      constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and determine if it can reduce symptoms, beneficially
      modify gut microbiota composition, and improve gut milieu in these patients. The
      investigators hypothesis for the Phase II study is that NTX-1 Fiber is better tolerated (i.e
      has less side effects) and is more effective than psyllium (the most commonly used fiber in
      the US) for symptom improvement and is effective in correcting the abnormal colonic milieu
      in those with dysbiosis and low SCFA levels.

      The investigators will conduct an 18-week (2-week initial run-in phase, 12-week treatment
      phase, and 4-week follow up phase), 2-arm, randomized, double-blind, controlled Phase 2
      trial in 120 subjects with IBS-C. A 2-week run in will be completed in order to ensure the
      stability of baseline symptom scores and to ensure that all study subjects have the required
      symptom severity to fulfill the inclusion criteria before randomization and beginning the
      treatment. The investigators selected a 12-week treatment phase because of the adequacy of
      this length of time to clinically see the impact of fiber supplementation (as seen in the
      investigators Phase I trial), and because of the 12-week duration requirement of the FDA for
      all therapeutic intervention/agents for treatment of IBS. The 4-week follow up phase is to
      determine the sustainability of the effects of therapy and to obtain further safety
      data.Potential study subjects will be identified though the Rush University Medical Center
      (RUMC) clinical databases; advertisements on the RUMC clinical trials and GI websites, RUMC
      Facebook and other social media sites; and IRB approved flyers placed in the GI clinic and
      throughout the medical center.  All potential candidates will be interviewed on the phone by
      a clinical coordinator using a structured checklist, at which time the study requirements
      will also be explained. Subjects will be asked for food allergies, including artificial
      sweeteners such as sucralose and ascelfame K. Subjects will also be informed that the fiber
      is made out of corn or psyllium and not other grains. However, it can't be guaranteed that
      it is free of other food allergy-related contaminants. Also, subjects will be asked to limit
      intake of foods containing more than 3 grams of prebiotics. A list of these foods will be
      provided.

      Those who are eligible and are willing to participate will be invited for the first study
      visit. Five visits will be required from each subject.

      Visit 1: After the subject has reviewed and signed the informed consent form, the
      investigators will check to see if they are eligible for this study by a physical exam,
      questionnaires and a blood test. A physician or their assistant will do a physical exam and
      take the subjects vitals (such as height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure).

      The Subject Information Form will be an administered questionnaire related to their health,
      disease, and their family medical history. They will then have 2Â½ tablespoons of blood drawn
      by a certified nurse or medical assistant. They will be reminded in advance to fast 12 hours
      prior to their research visit. The blood tests include: CBC, CMP, CRP, TSH, INR, fasting
      lipid profile and HbA1c. The subject will be given a 3-day food diary and a 14-day IBS
      symptom diary to complete before their next visit. They will also be provided with stool
      collection supplies and instructions to take home. When blood test results are available,
      those who do not fit the criteria will be called within 7 days after Visit 1 stating that
      they are ineligible. Among these blood tests, the fasting lipid profile results will be
      given to the subject after their participation in the study and after completion of the
      study. The rest of the results will be given to the subject at their next visit. If they
      continue to be a candidate in this study based on blood results, the potential subjects will
      fill out the 3-day food diary, continue to fill out the 14-day IBS symptom diary, and
      complete the stool collection the day before or the morning of Visit 2.  The subject will be
      advised to not keep the stool at room temperature longer than 5 hours. If they anticipate it
      to be longer than 5 hours before their visit time, then the stool will be kept in the
      freezer. Both of the diaries and the stool sample are to be brought to Visit 2, which is 2
      weeks after their Visit 1. Visit 1 will be about 3 hours in length.

      Visit 2: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, 14-day IBS
      symptom diary, and stool sample. They will provide the date of stool collection, as well as
      the method of storing the sample. The physician will review their 14-day IBS symptom diary
      and confirm their eligibility. If they continue to be eligible, the physician will do a
      physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood
      pressure). The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires relating to
      their diet (VioScreen Food Frequency Questionnaire), IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life
      questionnaire [IBS-QoL] and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis), sleeping/circadian
      patterns (2 NIH sleep questionnaires, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire, Lark/Hummingbird/Owl
      questionnaire, food timing questionnaire), the Expectancy and Credibility Questionnaire, and
      the 34-item tool asking about their GI symptoms and severity. The subject will then be
      randomized into one of the two groups. Depending on which group they are randomized to, they
      will be provided with a 6-week supply of NTX-1 OR psyllium fiber products in an identical
      appearing sachet along with instructions for taking the fiber. They will be provided with a
      3-day food diary and a daily and weekly IBS symptom diary to fill out prior to Visit 3. This
      visit will be about 3 hours in length. The next visit will be 6 weeks after Visit 2.

      Visit 3: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, the daily and
      weekly IBS symptom diary, and any excess fiber product. The physician will review their IBS
      symptom diary and ensure there are no significant adverse events. The physician will do a
      physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood
      pressure). The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires relating to
      their IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by
      Whorwell and Francis), sleeping/circadian patterns (2 NIH sleep questionnaires, Munich
      Chronotype Questionnaire, Lark/Hummingbird/Owl questionnaire, food timing questionnaire),
      the Expectancy and Credibility Questionnaire, and the 34-item tool asking about their GI
      symptoms and severity.  Next, they will have 2 tablespoons of blood drawn by a certified
      nurse or medical assistant. The following blood tests will be done: CBC, CMP and CRP. The
      subject will be reminded in advance to fast 12 hours prior to their research visit. A copy
      of their blood test results will be given to them at their next visit. Next, they will be
      given another 6-week supply of the fiber product, the 3-day food diary, a daily and weekly
      IBS symptom diary to fill out prior to Visit 4 and stool collection supplies. They are asked
      to collect stool as previously indicated and bring the stool to Visit 4; handling will be
      identical to previous visit. This visit will be about 2 hours in length. The next visit will
      be 6 weeks after their Visit 3.

      Visit 4: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary, the daily and
      weekly IBS symptom diary, and any excess fiber product. The physician will review their IBS
      symptom diary and ensure there are no significant adverse events. The physician will
      complete a physical exam and take their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and
      blood pressure). The subject will then be asked to fill out a series of questionnaires
      relating to their diet (VioScreen Food Frequency Questionnaire), IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality
      of Life questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis),
      sleeping/circadian patterns (2 NIH sleep questionnaires, Munich Chronotype Questionnaire,
      Lark/Hummingbird/Owl questionnaire, food timing questionnaire), the Expectancy and
      Credibility Questionnaire, and the 34-item tool asking about their GI symptoms and severity.
        They will then have 2Â½ tablespoons of blood drawn by a certified nurse or medical
      assistant. Subjects will be reminded in advance to fast 12 hours prior to their research
      visit. The blood tests include: CBC, CMP, CRP, TSH, INR, fasting lipid profile and HbA1c.
      Among these blood tests, the fasting lipid profile results will be given to the subject
      after the completion of the study. The rest of the results will be given to the subject at
      their next visit. They will be provided with a 3-day food diary and a daily and weekly IBS
      symptom diary to fill out prior to Visit 5. Visit 4 will be about 3 hours in length. The
      next visit will be 4 weeks after their fourth visit, which is the subjects' last visit.

      Visit 5: The subject will give the study coordinator their 3-day food diary and the daily
      and weekly IBS symptom diary. The physician will review their IBS symptom diary and ensure
      there are no significant adverse events. The physician will do a physical exam and take
      their vitals (such as weight, waist circumference and blood pressure). The subject will then
      be asked to fill out questionnaires relating to their IBS symptoms (IBS-Quality of Life
      questionnaire (IBS-QoL) and IBS Questionnaire by Whorwell and Francis) and the 34-item tool
      asking about their GI symptoms and severity. Next, they will have 2 tablespoons of blood
      drawn by a certified nurse or medical assistant. Subjects will have been reminded in advance
      to fast 12 hours prior to their research visit. The following blood tests will be done: CBC
      and CMP. A copy of their blood test results, including the two fasting lipid profile tests,
      will be given to the subject via e-mail or mail. This visit will be about 2 hours in length.
