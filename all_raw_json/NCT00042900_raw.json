Courses repeat every 21 days in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of pyroxamide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for resolution of adverse events.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 32 patients will be accrued for this study."
