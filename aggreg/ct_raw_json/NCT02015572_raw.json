A work place modification intervention combined with moderate physical\n      activity is given in the intervention group additional to LBP treatments according to best\n      practice recommendations for general practice.\n\n      The study population consists of patients in self-reported physically demanding, who are\n      sick listed or at risk of sick leave due to LBP. Outcome will continually be collected\n      during the intervention as well as 6 and additionally at 12 months follow up.\n\n      The primary aim is to evaluate if an occupational intervention with focus on early workplace\n      orientated counselling and work place intervention can retain subjects with physically\n      demanding work and LBP in gainful employment to prevent/reduce the sick leave due to LBP.\n\n      The secondary aims are to identify prognostic factors of an occupational intervention using\n      the baseline and follow-up participant-rated outcomes: pain, physically function, generic\n      health status, fear avoidance behaviours, job satisfaction, work-ability, satisfaction with\n      intervention, clinical examination and MRI findings. Among these variables, we also aim to\n      identify subjects, who will benefit from such an occupational intervention, and the\n      subjects, who already have a good prognosis and therefore have no need for a larger scale\n      intervention."
