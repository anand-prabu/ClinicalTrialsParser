            "textblock": "After brain injury, the brain produces certain chemicals that are harmful to the injured\n      tissues. Moderate hypothermia\u2014also called body cooling\u2014may slow or prevent the production of\n      these chemicals. Hypothermia also decreases the amount of oxygen needed by the brain, which\n      may provide some protection during this critical period. Earlier studies have shown that\n      maintenance of moderate hypothermia may have a helpful effect in head injury patients ages\n      16 to 45 who arrive at the hospital with a low body temperature suggesting that very early\n      cooling may be beneficial.\n\n      In this study scientists will initiate hypothermia or body cooling to 35\u02daC within two hours\n      of severe brain injury to determine if body cooling improves functional outcome.\n\n      Patients may enter the study in one of two ways.  They may be evaluated and surface cooling\n      begun at the scene by emergency medical services (EMS) personnel affiliated with the study;\n      or patients who arrive in the emergency department (ED) of the study hospital within 2 hours\n      of injury\u2014and who have not already been evaluated by EMS personnel affiliated with the\n      study\u2014will be evaluated and cooling begun, if applicable, by NABISH study personnel.\n\n      NABISH-trained EMS personnel who reach a patient with a suspected severe head injury within\n      2 hours of injury will induce hypothermia to 35\u02daC at the scene, in transit, or in the ED.\n\n      NABISH study personnel will induce hypothermia to 35\u02daC in the ED in patients with suspected\n      severe head injury who reach the ED within 2 hours of injury if cooling has not already\n      begun.  Patients who meet entry criteria (based upon past studies) for moderate hypothermia\n      for 48 hours will then be cooled to 33\u02daC and then gradually rewarmed after 48 hours at 33\u02daC.\n       Patients initially cooled to 35\u02daC within 2 hours of injury who prove during trauma\n      evaluation to have exclusion criteria for 48 hours of moderate hypothermia will be warmed\n      from 35\u02daC to 37\u02daC.\n\n      This pilot trial ended in July 2005.
