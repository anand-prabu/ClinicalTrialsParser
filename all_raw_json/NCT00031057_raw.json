A lack of vitamin B may be related to the development of hyperlactatemia.  However,\n      no studies have been done to evaluate this. This study proposes that high doses of vitamin B\n      may bring elevated lactate levels back to normal among patients taking NRTIs."

            "textblock": "Hyperlactatemia, with or without lactic acidosis, is a potentially life-threatening\n      condition that appears to be associated with NRTI therapy. The natural history of lactate\n      elevation as a complication of NRTI therapy is not clearly understood; however, some\n      patients receiving these therapies experience a progressive increase in lactate to\n      symptomatic levels. Deficiencies in thiamine (vitamin B1) and riboflavin (vitamin B2) have\n      been implicated as cofactors in producing hyperlactatemia and lactic acidosis in\n      NRTI-treated patients. A nontoxic intervention that could prevent or reverse advancing\n      lactic acidosis and preserve NRTI use would be highly desirable. To date, no controlled\n      studies have been done to examine the potential role of dietary intake, B vitamin\n      deficiency, and B vitamin therapy on the pathogenesis and clinical course on NRTI-associated\n      lactic acidosis. The hypothesis proposed is that high-dose vitamin B treatment can normalize\n      elevated lactate levels among NRTI-exposed individuals with moderately elevated lactate\n      levels.\n\n      This study consists of 2 steps: Step 1 (screening) and Step 2 (treatment). Patients are\n      screened during Step 1 for sustained hyperlactatemia and Step 2 eligibility. Patients with\n      sustained hyperlactatemia but no symptoms that indicate high risk of progression to lactic\n      acidosis and with no plans to change existing NRTI-containing antiretroviral therapy may\n      enter Step 2. A fasting, nonexercise, venous lactate level is obtained at Step 2 entry for\n      use as a baseline measurement, and every patient receives high-dose oral vitamin B1 and B2\n      therapy for 4 weeks. Fasting, nonexercise, venous lactate levels are measured at Weeks 1, 2,\n      and 4 to observe the kinetics of changes in lactate levels on study treatment."
