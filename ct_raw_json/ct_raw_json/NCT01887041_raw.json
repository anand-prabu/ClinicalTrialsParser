Therefore, the issue as to which palliation\n      should be favoured has to be reconsidered."

When postoperatively ascertained that the pancreas head\n      carcinoma is non-resectable, the patient shall be electronically registered and randomly\n      assigned to one of the palliative strategies. Group 1 will be fitted with a biliodigestive\n      anastomosis. Group 2 will continue with the endoscopically inserted drainage. Regardless of\n      which group they belong to, all patients will receive a palliative chemotherapy.\n\n      The primary parameter is the average quality of life over a period of 6 months post-OP, to\n      be analysed monthly using identical questionnaires. The comparison of the randomisation\n      groups will be carried out using a co-variance analysis (ANCOVA) with the initial value,\n      taken directly before the OP, to be used as co-variant."
