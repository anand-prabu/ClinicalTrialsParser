Combining bone marrow transplantation with chemotherapy may\n      allow doctors to give higher doses of chemotherapy and kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving a bone marrow transplant\n      together with chemotherapy and to see how well it works in treating patients with refractory\n      non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or multiple myeloma."

Assess the toxicities, response rate, and duration of response associated\n      with high-dose cyclophosphamide, etoposide, carmustine or high-dose cyclophosphamide and\n      total-body irradiation followed by autologous, allogeneic, or syngeneic bone marrow\n      transplant in patients with refractory or high-risk non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's\n      disease, or multiple myeloma. II. Evaluate any prognostic factors.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients with prior radiotherapy (greater than 2,000 cGy) receive cyclophosphamide\n      IV over 2 hours and etoposide IV over at least 30 minutes on days -7 through -4 followed by\n      carmustine IV over 2 hours on day -3. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation on day 0. Patients with or without prior radiotherapy (less than 2,000 cGy)\n      receive cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -8 through -5 followed by total body\n      irradiation on days -4 through -1. Patients receive allogeneic or autologous bone marrow\n      transplantation on day 0. Prior to autologous bone marrow transplantation and following\n      myeloablative chemotherapy, patients undergo mobilization consisting of cytarabine\n      subcutaneously every 12 hours for 6 doses. Approximately 24 hours later, patients receive\n      sargramostim (GM-CSF) subcutaneously. Peripheral blood stem cells are collected every 1-3\n      days beginning when blood counts recover and continuing until sufficient number of cells are\n      reached.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 40 patients will be accrued for this study."
