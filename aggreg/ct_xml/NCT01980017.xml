  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasing rapidly.  The combination of
      T2DM and smoking is particularly lethal, as smokers with T2DM are significantly more likely
      to develop a number of health related complications.  Community-based diabetes education
      programs (DEPs) have been developed to support patient self-care behaviours (e.g. adherence
      to oral medications, insulin therapy, nutrition management, regular blood glucose
      monitoring, and physical activity); however, specific assistance for smoking cessation is
      rarely provided.  Our investigative team has developed a knowledge transfer and practice
      change process to introduce evidence-based interventions for smoking cessation into clinical
      practice settings.  This process is known as the Ottawa Model for Smoking Cessation (OMSC).
      Investigators believe there is an opportunity to use the OMSC intervention to dramatically
      enhance the effectiveness of DEPs in addressing smoking cessation among smokers with T2DM,
      and in so doing, improve quit rates in this high risk population.

      The purpose of this project is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Ottawa Model for Smoking
      Cessation (OMSC) intervention in multiple diabetes education programs (DEPs) in Ontario.
      Investigators are surveying smokers who attend this clinic before and after implementing the
      new program.  Investigators want to test the impact of the OMSC intervention on quit rates
      among smokers with diabetes and pre-diabetes referred to these programs.

      Investigators will conduct a matched-pair cluster design trial at 18 DEPs in Ontario.  These
      sites will be matched based on baseline rates of assistance with smoking cessation at each
      clinic.  Within each pair, sites will be allocated randomly to either OMSC intervention or
      control groups.  In total, 2,520 participants will enroll in the study at one of the
      eighteen DEPs selected within the Champlain, Toronto Central, or Mississauga-Hamilton Local
      Health Integration Network.  From each participating DEP, a &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; sample of
      70 smokers will be recruited to assess smoking cessation outcomes.  Over a three-month
      period between the before and after samples, strategies to implement the OMSC will be
      carried out at the intervention sites.  The primary outcome will be the
      biochemically-validated 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate six months after an index
      visit to the DEP. Secondary outcomes will include: rates of identification and intervention
      of smokers, and diabetes educators' attitudes, confidence, and perceptions of barriers and
      facilitators to implementing smoking cessation support as part of routine care.

      If proven effective, the OMSC is appropriate for implementation in DEPs across Canada and
      could have profound impacts on patient and community health.

    <description>There is clear evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of smoking cessation interventions, there is a lack of implementation knowledge to inform the design and delivery of these interventions into routine clinical practice.  This study considers an intervention that optimizes the effective use of smoking cessation interventions in 'real life' clinical education settings.</description>
