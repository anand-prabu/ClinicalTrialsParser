Relapse\n      remains a leading cause for treatment failure after hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT)\n      in patients\uff0cso that there is the need to continue to look for alternative therapies.\n      Decitabine, is known to inhibit DNA methyltransferase which results in DNA hypomethylation\n      and expression of silenced genes including those involved in apoptosis. The approval of\n      decitabine for the treatment of MDS and AML has provided an alternative strategy to inhibit\n      disease progression in transplant-eligible patients. To assess the effect of pretransplant\n      decitabine treatment on post transplant outcomes, we recently reviewed our institutional\n      experience with MDS and AML patients."
