    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate the efficacy of ascending doses of
      COR-003 in subjects with elevated levels of cortisol due to endogenous Cushing's Syndrome by
      assessment of reduction in Urinary Free Cortisol (UFC) concentrations and to identify the
      range of safe and effective doses of COR-003 that reduce mean UFC concentrations ≤ULN (upper
      limit of normal) of the assay at month 6 of the maintenance phase of dosing without a prior
      dose increase in that phase.

    <textblock>
      This will be a single period, open-label, dose titration study to assess efficacy, safety,
      tolerability, and PK of COR-003 in subjects with CS. The trial design will identify both the
      minimally effective and maximally tolerated doses in this CS population.  Following an
      initial screening period, this study will be conducted in 2 treatment phases as follows:

        -  Dose titration phase:  approximately 2 to 16 weeks to achieve an effective and
           tolerable maximum dose (the therapeutic dose)

        -  Maintenance phase:  6 months of treatment at the therapeutic dose without a prior dose
           increase following the establishment of the appropriate dose identified in the
           titration phase;

        -  Extended evaluation phase: 6 months of continued treatment after the maintenance phase
           (6 - 12 months); dose adjustments will be allowed as required for treatment

      Efficacy will be assessed by measuring UFC concentrations at specified times as described in
      the clinical protocol.

      Blood samples for the PK determination will be collected at the times indicated in the
      clinical protocol.

      An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) will review the safety of the drug
      throughout the study.  The constituents of the DSMB membership and a adjudication committee
      is specifically described in the clinical protocol.

      Subjects completing the 6-month maintenance phase of the study will remain in the study for
      an additional 6 months for extended evaluations.

      COR-003 will be provided under a compassionate use protocol for subjects who wish to
      continue treatment with COR-003.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subjects eligible for enrollment in the study must meet all the following criteria:

          1. Male or female, ≥18 year of age

          2. Confirmed diagnosis of persistent or recurrent CS (with or without therapy) or newly
             diagnosed disease, if they are not candidates for surgery.  Subjects in whom surgery
             will be delayed beyond 5 months will be permitted to participate.  CS will be defined
             according to the criteria in the guidelines for diagnosis of CS (Nieman 2008).
             Previous medical records will be collected and used to support the diagnosis. The
             diagnostic criteria for appropriateness of inclusion of each subject into the study
             will be reviewed by the Medical Monitor. Diagnosis of the disease will be based on
             the association of clinical features of endogenous CS (see Appendix G in clinical
             protocol), review of past medication history, excluding exogenous sources of
             glucocorticoids, and abnormal values from two of the three following tests:

               -  Elevated 24-hour UFC levels ≥1.5X ULN of assay based on a minimum of 4
                  measurements from adequately collected urine.  Urine may be collected on
                  sequential days.

               -  Abnormal DST: Elevated 8 AM serum cortisol ≥1.8 ug/dL (50 nmol/L) after 1 mg
                  dexamethasone orally at 11 PM the evening prior (if not conducted already in the
                  diagnostic workup of the subject within the previous 6 months; previous test
                  results and details of conduct will need to be available; normal serum cortisol
                  ≤ 1.4 ug/dL)

               -  Elevated late night salivary cortisol concentrations (at least 2 measurements)
                  &gt;ULN at screening

               -  [NOTE: For subjects with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR as
                  determined by MDRD equation &gt;40 and &lt;60 mL/min) a late night salivary cortisol
                  test (≥2 measurements) MUST be conducted in addition to measuring UFC levels to
                  demonstrate evidence of CS.]

          3. Previously irradiated subjects will be allowed as long as the radiation treatment
             occurred ≥2 years ago and they do have stable UFC levels based on 24-hour urine
             collections for at least 6 months.  The total number of previously irradiated
             subjects will not exceed 10.

             • In the vast majority of subjects treated with radiation, efficacy is observed in &lt;2
             years.

          4. Confirmed diagnosis of persistent or recurrent endogenous hypercortisolemia as
             defined by UFC concentrations on repeated determinations (described in Inclusion #2)
             caused by either ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent etiologies.

          5. Subjects on treatment for CS for whom treatment has been inadequate or not well
             tolerated must agree to the following minimum washout periods as determined by the
             nature of their treatment before baseline assessments are performed for participation
             in this study:

               -  Inhibitors of steroidogenesis: 2weeks; subjects on ketoconazole will be
                  considered inadequately treated if they had failed to normalize UFC with a dose
                  lower than or equal to 600 mg/day (also see Exclusion 7 below).

               -  Dopamine agonists:  bromocriptine (2 week), cabergoline (8 weeks)

               -  Octreotide acetate LAR and lanreotide Autogel®: 12 weeks

             child-bearing potential (WOCP) with a negative serum beta human chorionic
             gonadotropin (βhCG) pregnancy test prior to entering the study and who agree to use
             an acceptable method of contraception, for the duration of the study.  Condoms will
             be considered an acceptable form of contraceptive.

          8. 12-lead ECGs show no acute ischemia or clinically significant abnormality needing
             medical intervention

          9. Ability to comprehend and comply with procedures

         10. Agree to commit to participate in the current protocol

         11. Subjects provide written informed consent prior to any study procedures being
             performed (all subjects should be able to understand the informed consent form and
             any other documents that subjects are required to read)

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Subjects will be excluded from the study if any of the following criteria are met:

          1. De novo Cushing´s disease AND a candidate for pituitary surgery

             • If surgery is to be delayed for &gt;5 months, subjects may be allowed to participate

             frequent hospitalizations

         17. Subjects with decreased renal function as defined by eGFR ≤40 mL/min, using Modified
             Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation for estimating renal function (eGFR).

         18. Any other clinically significant medical condition, as determined by the Investigator
             that precludes enrollment and participation in the study through completion (for
             example, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV congestive heart failure).

         19. Known hepatic disease, other than mild to moderate hepatic steatosis consistent with
             fatty infiltration (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis [NASH]), with ongoing sustained
             biochemical activity (subjects with CS would be at risk for NASH)

         20. History of recurrent gall stone attacks or pancreatitis

         21. Positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg) or positive hepatitis C test

         22. Liver function tests (LFT) must not be above the following cut-offs at screening: ALT
             and/or AST &gt;3.0X ULN, alkaline phosphatase (AP) &gt;1.5X ULN and total bilirubin &gt;ULN.
             If all LFTs are within normal limits (WNL) and total bilirubin is elevated,
             examination of direct and indirect bilirubin may be conducted. Subjects with indirect
             total bilirubin up to 3X ULN are presumed to have Gilbert's syndrome and may be

             severe disability)

         24. Compression of the optic chiasm

         25. Abnormal free T4. Subjects with TSH &lt;LLN and normal free T4 are permitted to
             participate in the study.

             of alcohol: 12 oz of beer, 5 oz of wine or 1.5 oz of spirits) or drug abuse. (1.0
             fluid oz (US) = 29.57 ml)

         27. The subject is currently taking any H2 receptor antagonists or proton-pump inhibitors
             (which inhibit absorption of COR-003). Only over-the- counter liquid and tablet
             antacids are allowed which should be used in moderation and taken a minimum of 2
             hours after dosing of COR-003.

         28. The subject is receiving the following concomitant therapies:

               -  Weight loss medications (prescription or over the counter)

               -  Coadministration of COR-003 and drugs primarily metabolized by the cytochrome
                  P450 3A4 enzyme system may result in increased plasma concentrations of the
                  drugs that could increase or prolong both therapeutic and/or adverse effects.
                  Therefore, appropriate dosage adjustments may be necessary.

                    -  Medications with metabolism largely mediated by CYP3A4 and a narrow
                       therapeutic margin include:  cyclosporine, midazolam, triazolam,

                       erythromycin, clarithromycin, loratadine, astemizole, terfenadine,
                       nicotinic acids, resins, orlistat, sibutramine, HIV protease inhibitors,
                       thiazolidinodiones, aliskiren, and spironolactone.

                    -  A complete list of medications metabolized by or with an effect on
                       cytochrome P450 3A4 is provided in Appendix K.  Also see Section 10.2.

               -  Coadministration of strong inducers or inhibitors of CYP3A4 enzyme system that
                  may interfere with COR-003 and cannot be discontinued prior to the start of the
                  study (see Appendix K for the list)

               -  Statins other than pravastatin, fluvastatin and rosuvastatin

               -  Following herbal medicines should be avoided: St John's Wort, yohimbe and red
                  rice yeast

               -  Potent topical steroids, containing urea or salicylic acid, which are applied
                  over 20% of the body

               -  Inhaled steroid medications that exceed minimal to moderate use

               -  Carbamazipine, fenofibrate, carbenoxolone

               -  Excessive ingestion of genuine licorice

         29. Pregnant or lactating women
