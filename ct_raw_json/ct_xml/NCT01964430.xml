      The purpose of this study is to compare whether there is a delay or prevention of recurrence
      or death in subjects with surgically removed pancreatic cancer who then take nab-paclitaxel
      in combination with gemcitabine compared to those who take gemcitabine alone.

      ABI-007-PANC-003 is a Phase 3, international, multicenter, randomized, open-label,
      controlled study that will compare the efficacy of nab-paclitaxel in combination with
      gemcitabine to gemcitabine alone as adjuvant treatment for 6 cycles in patients with
      surgically resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  1. Histologically confirmed resected ductal pancreatic adenocarcinoma with
             macroscopic complete resection (R0 and R1). Subjects with neuroendocrine (and mixed
             type) tumors are excluded.

             2. Pancreatic cancer surgical staging: T 1-3, N0-1, M0. 3. Subject should be able to
             start treatment no later than 12 weeks postsurgery.

             4. ≥18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent form (ICF). 5.
             Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1. 6. Acceptable
             hematology parameters:

               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥1500 cell/mm3

               -  Platelet count ≥100,000/mm3

               -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥9 g/dL 7. Acceptable blood chemistry levels:

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/ Serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT)
                  and Alanine transaminase (ALT)/ Serum glutamic -pyruvic transaminase (SGPT) ≤2.5
                  × upper limit of normal range (ULN)

               -  Total bilirubin ≤ Upper Limit of Normal (ULN) (subjects with Gilbert's syndrome
                  can have bilirubin of up to 1.5 x ULN)

               -  Alkaline phosphatase ≤ 2.5 x ULN

               -  Serum creatinine within upper limits of normal or calculated clearance ≥50
                  mL/min/1.73 m2.  If using creatinine clearance, actual body weight should be
                  used for calculating creatinine clearance (eg, using the Cockroft-Gault
                  formula).  For subjects with a Body Mass Index (BMI) &gt;30 kg/m2, lean body weight
                  should be used instead 8. Cancer antigen (CA)19-9 &lt;100 U/mL assessed within 14
                  days of randomization 9. Acceptable coagulation studies as demonstrated by
                  Prothrombin Time (PT) and Partial Thromboplastin Time (PTT) within normal limits
                  (±15%)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A subject will not be eligible for inclusion in this study if any of the following
             criteria apply:

               1. Prior neo-adjuvant treatment or radiation therapy for pancreatic adenocarcinoma

               2. Presence of or history of metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma

               3. Any other malignancy within 5 years prior to randomization, with the exception
                  of adequately treated in-situ carcinoma of the cervix, uteri, or nonmelanomatous
                  skin cancer (all treatment of which should have been completed 6 months prior to
                  randomization)

               4. Active, uncontrolled bacterial, viral, or fungal infection(s) requiring systemic
                  therapy, defined as ongoing signs/symptoms related to the infection without
                  improvement despite appropriate antibiotics, antiviral therapy, and/or other
                  treatment

               5. Known infection with hepatitis B or C, or history of human immunodeficiency
                  virus (HIV) infection, or subject receiving immunosuppressive or
                  myelosuppressive medications that would in the opinion of the investigator,
                  increase the risk of serious neutropenic complications

               6. History of allergy or hypersensitivity to nab-paclitaxel or gemcitabine or any
                  of their excipients

               7. Serious medical risk factors involving any of the major organ systems, or
                  serious psychiatric disorders, which could compromise the subject's safety or
                  the study data integrity. These include, but are not limited to:

                    1. History of connective tissue disorders (eg, lupus, scleroderma, arteritis
                       nodosa)

                    2. History of interstitial lung disease, slowly progressive dyspnea and
                       unproductive cough, sarcoidosis, silicosis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis,
                       pulmonary hypersensitivity pneumonitis or multiple allergies

                    3. History of the following within 6 months prior to Cycle 1 Day 1: a
                       myocardial infarction, severe/unstable angina pectoris, coronary/peripheral
                       artery bypass graft, New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III-IV heart
                       failure, uncontrolled hypertension, clinically significant cardiac
                       dysrhythmia or ECG abnormality, cerebrovascular accident, transient
                       ischemic attack, or seizure disorder
