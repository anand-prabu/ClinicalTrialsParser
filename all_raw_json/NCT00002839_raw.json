Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy with radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells and allow\n      doctors to preserve the part of the body where the cancer started. It is not yet known which\n      regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil combined with radiation therapy is more effective in\n      treating resectable cancer of the hypopharynx or larynx.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of two regimens of\n      cisplatin and fluorouracil combined with radiation therapy in preserving the larynx in\n      patients who have resectable cancer of the hypopharynx or larynx."

Patients are stratified by performance\n      status, disease site, tumor stage, node stage, and center.\n\n      Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Both groups may receive either\n      conventional radiotherapy in single daily fractions, 5 days per week, for 7 weeks (option 1)\n      or hyperfractionated radiotherapy in 2 daily fractions, 5 days per week, for 4-5 weeks\n      (option 2), according to institutional policy.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive cisplatin and fluorouracil every 3 weeks. Patients with a\n           complete or partial response on day 42 receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy\n           followed by 7 weeks of radiotherapy beginning on day 80. After radiotherapy, patients\n           with a complete remission enter follow-up; those with a partial remission proceed to\n           surgery. Patients with stable or progressive disease proceed immediately to surgery\n           with or without postoperative radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive cisplatin and fluorouracil every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n           Patients treated on radiotherapy option 1 are evaluated 2 months after completion of\n           radiotherapy; those with a complete remission enter follow-up while all others proceed\n           to surgery. Patients treated on option 2 are evaluated on day 42; those with a partial\n           or complete response complete chemoradiotherapy and are then evaluated and treated like\n           option 1 patients. Patients with stable or progressive disease on day 42 proceed to\n           surgery with or without a third course of chemotherapy on week 7.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years and at least every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 564 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
