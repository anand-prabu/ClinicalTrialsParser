Another\n      aim is to examine the safety of low dose ketamine compared to opioids alone.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that low dose ketamine will result in more effective pain\n      control than morphine alone and will not be associated with an increase in adverse events."

Repeat measurements will be taken at 15 minutes, 30 minutes, and hourly following treatment with the study drug, for 6hrs or until the patient leaves the ED. The amount of rescue analgesia will be recorded at each time point.  The ED course will also be reviewed post hoc by the RAs and physician investigators to confirm analgesia received.
