            "textblock": "Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) that fit over the laryngeal inlet have been shown to be\n      effective for ventilating newborns at birth. The LMA may be considered as an alternative to\n      FM for positive pressure ventilation (PPV) among newborns  weighing >2000 g or delivered >34\n      weeks' gestation.\n\n      A recent, quasi-experimental study  provided the feasibility, efficacy and safety of using\n      the LMA in neonatal resuscitation.\n\n      However, studies of LMA use for providing PPV during neonatal resuscitation are still\n      limited. There are no published clinical randomized trials evaluating the LMA compared with\n      the FM for neonatal resuscitation.\n\n      Hypothesis: Our hypothesis is based on the assumption that ventilating newborns needing PPV\n      with a LMA will be more effective than ventilating with a FM by decreasing the proportion of\n      resuscitated newborns needing ETT.\n\n      Objective: To compare the effectiveness of LMA and FM ventilation in newborns needing PPV at\n      birth.\n\n      Design / Methods: An open, prospective, randomized, single center, clinical trial.\n\n      Intervention: PPV will be performed with a LMA (intervention group) or with a FM (control\n      group) in all infant newborns weighing >2000 g or delivered >34 weeks gestation.\n\n      Primary outcome variable: Proportion of newborns needing endotracheal intubation.\n\n      Secondary outcome measures: Apgar score at 5 minutes, heart rate at 60, 90 seconds and 5 and\n      10 minutes, time to first breath, duration of PPV, for proportion of infants needing chest\n      compressions, drugs and death within 1 week and/or presence of HIE, grade II or III,\n      according to a modification of Sarnat and Sarnat.2,10 According to this classification, HIE\n      grade I (mild) includes irritability, hyperalertness, mild hypotonia, and poor sucking;\n      grade II (moderate) includes lethargy, seizures, marked abnormalities of tone, and\n      requirement of tube feeding; and grade III (severe) includes coma, prolonged seizures,\n      severe hypotonia, and failure to maintain spontaneous respiration.\n\n      The following data were collected during resuscitation: (1) Apgar score at 1 min and 5 min\n      after birth; (2) LMA insertion time, the rate of successful insertion at the first attempt,\n      and the number of attempts required to insert the LMA successfully; (3) duration of\n      resuscitation: response time (the time period from starting LMA resuscitation to achieving\n      an effective response), ventilation time; (4) adverse effects during resuscitation."
