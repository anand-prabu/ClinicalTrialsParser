The\n      Africa region currently has some of the world's highest traffic injury rates, with\n      vulnerable road users, including motorcycle riders, bearing a disproportionate share of the\n      injury burden.\n\n      Motorcycles are a rapidly growing form of transport in Africa, both for personal and\n      commercial transportation. Conspicuity measures\u2014factors that increase a motorcycle rider's\n      visibility\u2014for the prevention of motorcycle crash have been previously studied and found to\n      be associated with a decreased risk of crash.\n\n      Motorcycle taxi drivers are a particularly high risk population for motorcycle crash as they\n      operate a motorcycle for several hours a day.  Reflective, fluorescent safety vests are a\n      common article worn by motorcycle drivers in some locations; however, penetration of such\n      clothing in Moshi is currently low.  This study aims to increase use of reflective vests\n      among commercial motorcycle drivers.  We will test whether provision of a free reflective,\n      fluorescent vest increases use of reflective, fluorescent clothing compared to education\n      about wearing reflective, fluorescent clothing alone."
