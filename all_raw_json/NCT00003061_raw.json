Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of methotrexate and cytarabine plus\n      radiation therapy in treating patients who have primary CNS lymphoma."

Determine the efficacy of methotrexate and cytarabine chemotherapy in\n      combination with whole-brain radiation therapy for patients with non-AIDS related primary\n      central nervous system lymphoma. II. Assess the response rate and safety of this\n      chemotherapy regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive the first course of chemotherapy as soon as possible after\n      diagnosis and staging. Methotrexate (MTX) IV is administered over 40-60 minutes on days 1\n      and 15. Cytarabine (AraC) is administered intrathecally on days 1 and 15. The second course\n      of chemotherapy begins on day 29 or after bone marrow recovery. Radiation therapy begins no\n      later than 3 weeks after completing chemotherapy. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued."
