      This randomized phase III trial studies exemestane and entinostat to see how well they work
      compared to exemestane alone in treating postmenopausal patients with hormone
      receptor-positive breast cancer that has spread to nearby tissue or lymph nodes or another
      place in the body. Estrogen can cause the growth of breast cancer cells. Endocrine therapy
      using exemestane may fight breast cancer by lowering the amount of estrogen the body makes.
      Entinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for
      cell growth. It is not yet known whether exemestane is more effective with or without
      entinostat in treating breast cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate whether the addition of entinostat to endocrine therapy (exemestane) improves
      progression-free survival (PFS) and/or overall survival (OS) in postmenopausal patients with
      hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative
      locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have previously progressed on a
      non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (Al).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of entinostat in combination with exemestane, and
      to compare the safety profile to that of endocrine therapy with placebo.

      II. To evaluate the objective response rate of exemestane in combination with entinostat or
      placebo.

      III. To evaluate whether the efficacy of exemestane with entinostat varies with changes in
      acetylation status in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs).

      IV. To evaluate the time to treatment deterioration (as defined by decrease in
      health-related quality of life [HRQL], progression, death) of exemestane + entinostat versus
      exemestane + placebo arms.

      V. To evaluate the differences in overall health-related quality of life (HRQL) between the
      exemestane + entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.

      VI. To evaluate the difference with respect to specific symptoms that are associated with
      entinostat, i.e., fatigue, nausea, anorexia and diarrhea, between the exemestane +
      entinostat versus exemestane + placebo arms.

      VII. To measure adherence to protocol therapy.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To collect archival tumor samples and germline deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to explore
      other potential biomarkers of therapeutic efficacy.

      II. To collect patient ratings of adverse events (AEs) using select Patient-reported
      outcomes (PRO)-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) items to evaluate the
      psychometric properties of PRO-CTCAE items and explore the incorporation of PRO-CTCAE items
      into a phase III double-blind placebo-controlled trial.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM A: Patients receive exemestane orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28 and entinostat
      PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM B: Patients receive exemestane as in Arm A and placebo PO on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.
      Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      In both arms, male patients also receive goserelin acetate subcutaneously (SC) on day 1.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,
      every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually for 5 years.

    <description>The distribution of PFS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula. In the primary analysis of PFS, differences in treatment effect will be tested using stratified log rank tests, stratifying on the randomization stratification factors.

    <description>The distribution of OS will be estimated using the Kaplan- Meier method, with 95% confidence intervals calculated using Greenwood's formula. In the primary analyses of OS, differences in treatment effect will be tested using stratified log rank tests, stratifying on the randomization stratification factors.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Objective response in the two arms will be evaluated by comparing objective response rate (ORR, PR+CR) using a Fisher's exact test on the intention-to-treat patients with one-sided type I error of 2.5%.

    <description>All treatment-emergent and baseline adverse events and hematological/biochemical toxicities based on laboratory measurements, as well as drug related AEs, will be summarized by treatment group and worst grade. The incidence of deaths and treatment-emergent serious AEs (defined as number of patients experiencing the AE divided by all treated patients) will be summarized and compared between treatment arms using Fisher's exact test. Also, the incidence of adverse events leading to discontinuation of investigational product and/or withdrawal from the study will be summarized and listed.</description>

    <description>The distribution of TTD will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier method, and TTD comparisons between treatment arms will be tested primarily using log-rank test.

    <description>The distribution of the percentage change in protein lysine acetylation will be plotted for the two treatment groups and difference will be compared using the Wilcoxon ranks sum test. Tumor response rate will be compared between the patients with percentage change in acetylation being above or below median using Fisher's exact tests in each treatment arm. In all analyses, P-values will be two-sided and a level of 5% will be considered statistically significant.</description>

    <description>Mixed effect models will be constructed to estimate the time profile of HRQL in the two treatment arms and to evaluate treatment-by-time interactions. Time will be included as a continuous variable if there is a linear trend in HRQL over time or a set of dummy variables if non-linear trend exits for HRQL. PROs will be correlated with PFS (prognostic value of PROs) in the study patients. Kaplan-Meier method, log rank test and Cox models will be used to compare PFS between patients with good quality of life (QOL) and those with poor QOL in the overall patient population.</description>

The proportion of high, medium and low adherence to each agent will be calculated along with the binomial exact 95% confidence interval. The proportion of high adherence to entinostat and placebo will be compared between arms A and B using Fisher exact test. The proportion of adherence to exemestane will be compared between treatment arms using Fisher exact test as well.</description>
