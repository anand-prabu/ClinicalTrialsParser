The PRALIMAP trial highlighted the effectiveness of structured screening and\n      care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and obesity in high school\n      adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial aims to investigate whether a strengthened\n      care management (CM) for socially less advantaged adolescents in school in the short and\n      long term has an equivalent effect as a standard-CM on decreasing the prevalence of\n      overweight and obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.\n\n      Intervention: PRALIMAP-IN\u00c9S is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial of 1,250 overweight\n      and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18 years who are attending grade 10 in the 21 state-run\n      high schools of the Vosges department (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013\n      and 2013-2014. Overweight adolescents (including obese) classified as advantaged are\n      allocated to the standard-CM and those less advantaged are randomized to standard CM or\n      strengthened-CM. The standard-CM consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in\n      high school and supervised by a healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity\n      care management for adolescents. The strengthened-CM consists of 5 collective sessions with\n      the same standard operating procedure as the standard-CM with supplementary interventions\n      between each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led\n      educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity\n      practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings. Data on\n      sociodemographics, anthropometrics, physical activity and mental health are collected at 3\n      visits: at the entry to grade 10 (before the intervention=T0), at the end of grade 10 (at\n      the end of the intervention=T1) and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after the\n      intervention=T2). Process evaluation data are also collected during the trial.\n\n      Expected results: To confirm the effectiveness of overweight CM for adolescents in a school\n      setting and to highlight or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions\n      adapted for socially less advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to\n      overweight care."

            "textblock": "Background: The prevalence of overweight and obesity continues to increase in socially less\n      advantaged populations but is stabilizing even is decreasing in socially more advantaged\n      populations. The PRALIMAP trial confirmed major social inequalities in overweight and\n      obesity frequency in adolescents in grade 10. The trial highlighted the effectiveness of\n      structured screening and care management in decreasing the prevalence of overweight and\n      obesity in high school adolescents over 2 years. The PRALIMAP-INES trial  aims to\n      investigate whether a strengthened care management strategy for socially less advantaged\n      adolescents in school in the short and long term (just after the intervention and 1 year\n      later) has an equivalent effect as a standard-care management strategy on decreasing the\n      prevalence of overweight and obesity among socially advantaged adolescents.\n\n      Hypothesis: A strengthened overweight and obesity care management strategy for overweight\n      and obesity (risk factors of cancer) can improve care access for socially less advantaged\n      adolescents and maintain social equality in terms of overweight and obesity prevalence.\n\n      Intervention: PRALIMAP-IN\u00c9S is a mixed prospective and multicenter trial (one randomised\n      part and one non-randomised part) of 1,250 overweight and obese adolescents aged 13 to 18\n      years who are attending grade 10 in the 21 state-run high schools of the Vosges department\n      (northeastern France) for the academic years 2012-2013 and 2013-2014. After a session to\n      detect overweight and obese adolescents, the social status of included adolescents as\n      \"advantaged\" or \"less advantaged\" is determined. Adolescents classified as advantaged are\n      allocated to the standard-care management and those less advantaged are randomized to\n      standard-care management or strengthened-care management. The standard-care management\n      consists of 5 collective sessions of 2 hr each performed in high school and supervised by a\n      healthcare mobile team specialised in overweight and obesity care management for\n      adolescents. The team consists of physicians, dietitians, psychologists and sports educators\n      from the AVRS Association. The content of sessions was validated in the PRALIMAP trial. The\n      strengthened-care management consists of 5 collective sessions with the same standard\n      operating procedure as the standard-care management with supplementary interventions between\n      each session: strengthened solicitation with the adolescent and the family, peer-led\n      educational sessions, motivational interviews, financial support for physical activity\n      practice, cooking classes and multidisciplinary consultation meetings (adjusting the care\n      management according to the social status). Data on sociodemographics, anthropometrics,\n      physical activity and mental health are collected at 3 visits: at the entry to grade 10\n      (before the intervention = T0), at the end of grade 10 (at the end of the intervention = T1)\n      and at the end of grade 11 (1 year after the intervention = T2). T1 measurement allows for\n      evaluating the short-term effect of the intervention and T2, the long-term effect of a\n      1-year break from the intervention. Data on participation and from questionnaires, as well\n      as focus group and activity reports, necessary for evaluation, are collected during the\n      trial.\n\n      Expected results: With this trial, the investigators expect to confirm the effectiveness of\n      overweight and obesity care management for adolescents in a school setting and to highlight\n      or not the effectiveness of specific strengthened interventions adapted for socially less\n      advantaged adolescents to maintain social equality in access to overweight and obesity care."
