  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is one of the leading causes of chronic disability in veterans. Stroke is associated
      with significant loss of mobility, increased risk of falling, cardiovascular disease,
      depression and neuro-cognitive impairment. These deficits negatively impact the independent
      completion of the Activities of Daily Living (ADLs). Task-oriented training has emerged as
      the dominant therapeutic intervention in the rehabilitation of chronic stroke victims. The
      effectiveness of these interventions may be enhanced through facilitation of implicit
      knowledge rather than explicit knowledge. Specifically, implicit learning increases
      retention and improves transfer of the improved motor function outside of the lab
      environment. Moreover, implicit motor control reduces the burden imposed on cognitive
      resources as the skill is performed automatically (i.e. do not have to 'think' about it).
      The amount and type of feedback individuals receive while learning a new task (or relearning
      in the case of rehabilitation) has been shown to influence the type of learning (i.e.
      implicit or explicit). Thus the purpose of the current study is to determine the effect of
      different types of feedback during motor learning on the learning type and the resultant
      impact on functional outcomes (i.e. motor performance, retention, and cognitive workload) in
      chronic stroke patients.

      Someone has a stroke in the US every 45 seconds, resulting in over 700,000 new strokes every
      year and stroke is the leading cause of disability in our veterans (American Heart
      Association Statistics Committee and Stroke Statistics Sub-Committee). The vast majority of
      these cases result in motor impairments, which frequently cause individuals to become
      dependent on others for daily functioning (modified Rankin Scale 3-5, see Lees et al.,
      2006). Specifically, upper extremity hemiparesis is the leading cause of functional
      disability after stroke and upper arm function explains about 50% of the variability in
      reported quality of life (Wyller et al, 1997). As such optimizing upper arm
      neurorehabilitation is a critical problem to address in our aging veteran population.

      &quot;Rehabilitation, for patients, is fundamentally a process of relearning how to move to carry
      out their needs successfully&quot; (Carr &amp; Shepherd, 1987). This statement posits that at its
      core neurorehabilitation is motor learning, but despite this principle, research in motor
      learning has had little impact on stroke rehabilitation (Krakauer, 2006). Recently there has
      been an interest in developing and testing new methods to optimize upper extremity
      rehabilitation. Investigators at the Baltimore VAMC have pioneered task oriented training
      paradigms to improve mobility (Macko et al., 2005) in those with chronic stroke. As part of
      this programmatic approach novel upper extremity robotics training programs have been
      developed to improve reaching, and limb coordination. However, the majority of these
      interventions rely on error-based learning strategies during rehabilitation, which foster
      task-related explicit knowledge. However, a corpus of motor learning research indicates that
      this may not be the best strategy to optimize motor learning, and thus neurorehabilitation.

      Error-based learning involves receiving continual feedback of your movement with the intent
      that the learner will make corrections to the movement in real time. Thus learning occurs
      through a series of repetitions in which the learner continually reduces the discrepancy
      between the ideal behavior and the observation of their own behavior. In other words,
      error-based learning fosters an adaptation to achieve the desired behavior. In contrast,
      operant conditioning learning strategies consists of the learner only receiving feedback
      about the quality of their movement at the end of the behavior. Thus, learning occurs
      through a series of reinforcement of the desired behavior in its entirety, which is more
      model-free than the adaptation incurred during error-based learning. A primary distinction
      between these two learning strategies is that error-based learning fosters explicit
      knowledge of the task, whereas operant conditioning fosters implicit knowledge (Krakauer &amp;
      Mazzoni, 2011). These two types of knowledge have drastic implications for functional
      outcomes (i.e. motor performance, cognitive workload, and retention).

      Prior to stroke, upper arm functions such as reaching and grasping were largely done without
      the use of explicit knowledge. In other words, healthy individuals devote little conscious
      effort about how they are controlling their limbs, they just 'do it'. Although, using
      explicit strategies during learning can facilitate the rate of learning, if given enough
      time, individuals who have limited explicit knowledge will perform equally well (Maxwell et
      al, 1999). Despite a slower rate of learning, the payoff of reducing explicit knowledge of
      the task can be very advantageous during motor performance. Notably, retention of the
      learned behavior is greater in individuals who learned under conditions that inhibit
      explicit knowledge. For example Malone and Bastian (2010) had individuals learn a novel
      walking task (split belt treadmill where the belts move at different rates) and in those in
      which explicit knowledge was limited exhibited learning that persisted longer than those who
      relied on explicit knowledge during learning. In addition, limiting explicit knowledge
      during motor learning may result in reduced cognitive workload and maintained performance
      under conditions of challenge (Zhu et al., 2011). In conclusion, promoting explicit
      knowledge during rehabilitation rather than unconscious control (limiting explicit
      knowledge) reduces sustainability of the newly acquired motor skill, and consumes cognitive
      resources, which need to be available for other demands. As such, automatic control of these
      behaviors is critical to perform our daily activities, suggesting operant conditioning
      (which limits explicit knowledge) as superior to error-based learning.

      Those with stroke are able to learn tasks implicitly, although the rate of learning may be
      delayed as compared to healthy controls (Pohl et al., 2001) and delayed further as a
      function of stroke severity (Boyd et al., 2007). Further, simply providing explicit
      information about an implicit task has been shown to reduce the learning rate and retention
      in those with basal ganglia stroke (Boyd et al., 2004; Boyd et al., 2006) and damage to
      sensorimotor areas (Boyd et al., 2003; Boyd et al., 2006; Winstein et al., 2003). While
      these studies highlight the importance limiting explicit knowledge during learning they were
      done in the context of learning implicit sequences rather than the development of skill,
      which while related, rely on different aspects of motor learning (Krakauer &amp; Mazonni, 2011,
      Yarrow et al., 2009). In the context of functional skill learning, the timing/ type of
      feedback have been robustly shown to affect the learning rate as well as retention and have
      been implicated to affect knowledge type (Levin et al., 2010). Specifically, providing
      feedback about task performance less frequently and after performance rather than during
      (i.e. delayed) have been shown to increase learning retention and likely facilitate implicit
      learning (Cirstea et al., 2006; Winstein et al., 1996). Additionally, feedback about the
      results (knowledge of results) rather than the performance (knowledge of performance) has
      shown to increase retention and limit explicit knowledge (Cirstea el al., 2006; Sidaway et
      al., 2008; Winstein, 1991). Accordingly, the current proposal will attempt to foster
      implicit knowledge during the development of motor skill by manipulating when feedback is
      given and type of feedback.

      The aim of the current study is to determine the effect of error-based learning versus
      operant conditioning learning on critical outcomes of neurorehabilitation (i.e. performance
      after learning, generalizability, cognitive workload imposed by the task, and retention).
