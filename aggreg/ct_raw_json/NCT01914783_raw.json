The\n      investigators will determine blood pressure, heart rate, respiration as well as cardiac\n      output and directly record sympathetic vasomotor tone using the microneurography technique.\n      To elucidate the underlying mechanisms through which particles and ozone affect the\n      autonomic nervous system, the investigators will assess the local and systemic inflammatory\n      response as well as the changes in neurotrophic factors in sputum and blood. In addition,\n      the activation of inflammatory cells in sputum and blood will be analyzed at different\n      points in time after exposures. Changes in sympathetic activity will be correlated with the\n      degree of airway inflammation and oxidative stress assessed in induced sputum and blood.\n      This study will provide important insight in the mechanisms through which air pollution,\n      particularly ultrafine particle exposure, increases cardiovascular risk in human subjects\n      and generate a human model for mechanistic and therapeutic studies."
