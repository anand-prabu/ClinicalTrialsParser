            "textblock": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a potentially reversible neuropsychiatric syndrome\n      characterized by changes in cognitive function, behavior and personality of patients with\n      chronic liver disease or cirrhosis. Increased concentration of ammonia is the main\n      precipitant of encephalopathy and brain astrocytes are the main affected cells in the\n      neuropathology of this disease. The toxicity of ammonia together with the neutrophil\n      dysfunction and oxidative stress and inflammation secondary to infection, result in a\n      progressive decline in quality of life and an increased risk of accidents for patients with\n      this disease.\n\n      About 28% of patients with liver cirrhosis develop encephalopathy during the course of the\n      disease and within this percentage, 84% will develop MHE. Currently, chronic liver diseases\n      are the third leading cause of death in Mexico. The high prevalence suggests that HE could\n      become a public health problem, with the 2020 projected figures of 1.5 million people with\n      cirrhosis, which represents approximately 400 000 to 500 000 people with probable\n      encephalopathy.\n\n      The usual treatment of MHE is the use of antibiotics or pro and prebiotics, these enhances\n      the performance and quality of life of patients who have the disease. The general consensus\n      has been using lactulose or lactitol as the first treatment options for MHE consistent with\n      data from previous studies. However, the rate of adherence to treatment with lactulose and\n      lactitol is low, especially in patients with MHE with no symptoms and lack of specific\n      information about their problems, to adhere to medications that can cause diarrhea and\n      flatulence.\n\n      In the last eight years functional ingredients have been studied as alternatives to the\n      treatment of patients with MHE. In 2004, Liu et al showed that 25% chicory inulin\n      (prebiotic) and this combined with probiotics improve the psychometric function of MHE\n      patients. In similar studies conducted in 2007 and 2009 in which they used a formulation\n      with a symbiotic fructo-oligosaccharides based chicory inulin and B. longum, showed\n      improvement in psychometric tests applied to patients. In 2008, Bajaj et al showed that\n      patients who consumed a yogurt with probiotics, showed significant changes in the degree of\n      MHE.\n\n      As an alternative for treating the MHE we found Agave tequilana Weber fructans, which\n      present prebiotic effect, besides having shown to improve the function of the digestive\n      system, control and induce glycemic effect satiety. Therefore the impact of the fermentation\n      of such prebiotic in the gut may contribute to improving the health and quality of life of\n      patients with MHE."
