  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin A is essential for optimal growth, and development. In the newborn, especially if
      preterm, it is necessary  for the cellular differentiation, for the health of the anterior
      eye,  it is a constituent of visual pigment, and it is essential for surfactant synthesis.
      Immune response Vitamin A supplementation demonstrated to reduces infancy mortality, but
      very low (&lt;1500g birth weight) and extremely low (&lt;1000g birth weight) preterm infants are
      born with low body stores of vitamin A and are at high risk of vitamin A deficiency.
      Nevertheless, optimal vitamin A supplementation for these infants is not clearly defined,
      despite evidence of benefit of an  early supplementation.

      Prematurity is associate to the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) which is a disease
      marked by respiratory compromise associated with high mortality and severe long-term
      morbidity, as well as  prematurity is associate to the risk for retinopathy, a pathology
      that may be related to less rhodopsin quantity which seem dependent on vitamin A
      concentration. Vitamin A can be given enterally, intramuscularly, or intravenously. Recently
      an oral administration as drops is available resulting particularly convenient avoiding the
      pain associated with repetitive intramuscular injections, or the discomfort of parenteral
      administration. Studies of vitamin A in the infant population suggest that plasma retinol
      concentrations &gt;0.7 µM/L indicate vitamin A sufficiency, nevertheless preterm infants have
      lower concentration and concentration &lt; 0.35 µM/L are very dangerous. Vitamin A deficiency
      at this level may constitute a problem for preterm newborn, resulting for example, in
      histological alterations in the respiratory epithelium leading to chronic lung disease,
      retinopathy of prematurity, patency of the ductus arteriosis, and immune competence
      deficiency.

      The aim of the present study is to verify efficacy and tolerability of a new oral
      administration of vitamin A as drops, 3000 IU/kg/die for 4 weeks, in infants &lt; 1500g weight
      at birth, verifying the competence of the supplementation reaching ideal blood concentration
      (≥0.7 µM/L) and relating the blood achieved concentrations of vitamin A to the outcome in
      typical pathologies, as BPD and ROP.
