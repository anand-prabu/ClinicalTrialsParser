Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Combining radiation therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cladribine followed by radiation\n      therapy in treating patients who have malignant glioma."

Assess this regimen in terms of\n      toxicity and survival in these patients. III. Assess the acute neurotoxicity of continuous\n      infusion cladribine in these patients. IV. Assess this regimen in terms of response, local\n      control, and time to progression in these patients. V. Define a dose level of cladribine\n      associated with potentiation of acute and/or delayed radiation toxicity (radiosensitizing\n      dose level).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of cladribine. Patients receive cladribine by\n      continuous IV infusion 5 days a week for 4 weeks and undergo radiotherapy twice a day,\n      beginning 3 hours after initiation of cladribine, 5 days a week for 4.5 weeks. Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6\n      patients receive escalating doses of cladribine until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is\n      determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed at 1 month, then every 3 months\n      thereafter for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12-42 patients will be accrued for this study within 18\n      months."
