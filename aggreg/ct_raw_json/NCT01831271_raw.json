There is a lack\n      of evidence of the best treatment for the patient category. Many patients are sick-listed\n      for long periods of time with different kind of treatment approaches or without any\n      treatment at all. The present study could fill the identified knowledge gap by strengthening\n      of the currently weak scientific evidence for treatment of the patient category. The\n      long-term effects of the study could be to reduce the time for sick leave and improve the\n      rate of patients returning to work and/ or former activity by optimising treatments. Further\n      on, to decrease the number of patients who finally have surgery for their neck problems and\n      thus reducing the mental, physical and social costs."

The current scientific evidence lacks\n      randomised controlled trials to compare surgery with conservative treatment as well as to\n      evaluate different conservative interventions. Most patients are not candidates for surgery\n      and are sick-listed for long time with different treatment approaches or without any\n      treatment at all. The purpose is to evaluate if treatment with neck-specific training and a\n      cognitive behavioral approach improves the outcome compared with prescribed physical\n      activity. Methods: A randomized controlled trial including 144 patients will compare the\n      intervention neck specific training and cognitive behavioural approach with an intervention\n      of prescribed physical activity. The interventions will be led by experienced and\n      specialised physiotherapists and last 14 weeks. Main outcome variable is pain intensity (VAS\n      scale) accompanied with assessments of impairments and subjective health measurements\n      undertaken before intervention and at 3, 6, 12 and 24 months. Implementation: The results\n      will be presented scientifically as well as popularly in publications and professional\n      meetings. Active implementation strategies to change physiotherapists treatment behaviour\n      will be used. The best method will be chosen after surveying the physiotherapists treating\n      patients in the current study regarding experiences, education and organisational context."
