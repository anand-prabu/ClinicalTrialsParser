  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study to determine the safety and feasibility of injections of autologous
      umbilical cord blood (UCB) cells into the right ventricle of HLHS children undergoing a
      scheduled Glenn surgical procedure.

      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if autologous stem cells from
      the individual's own umbilical cord blood can be used to strengthen the muscle of the right
      side of their heart.  This will help determine the safety and feasibility of using
      cell-based regenerative therapy as an additional treatment for the management of HLHS.

    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase I trial to determine the safety of autologous mononuclear cells (MNC)
      derived from umbilical cord blood for intramyocardial delivery into the right ventricle
      during a planned and non-emergent Stage II surgical palliation in subjects with HLHS. This
      is the first critical step towards applying autologous MNC therapy as an add-on regenerative
      intervention for congenital heart disease management. The choice of HLHS as the target
      disease for regenerative therapies in congenital heart disease management is multi-factorial
      and includes the following considerations: 1) Severity of of this incurable disease, 2)
      palliative nature and burden of long-term outcomes with a single right ventricular system,
      3) three stages of planned surgical procedures that provide time points to adjunctively
      intervene, and 4) prenatal diagnosis enabling planned collection of UCB. An emerging goal
      for cardiac regeneration includes the application of cell-based technology to congenital
      heart disease, which is a favorable substrate due to the lack of fibrotic scaring, and the
      presence of a microenvironment that is expected to support ongoing cardiac proliferation and
      growth for functional remuscularization. This Phase I safety study will determine the
      feasibility of collection, processing, and delivery of autologous cells as used in adult
      cardiac regenerative protocols in the setting of HLHS surgical management.

    <description>Upon intramyocardial cell delivery at the time of planned Glenn procedure, signs of cardiac toxicity will be measured according to worsening of ejection fraction by more than 10%, any new cardiac arrhythmias that could be attributed to stem cell therapy based on follow-up electrocardiograms and 24-hr Holter monitoring, and abnormal routine blood chemistry to monitor for evidence of organ failure.</description>

    <description>The secondary analysis is focused on the potential benefit of intramyocardial delivery of the manufactured cell-based product in pediatric hearts at the time of planned surgical palliation for HLHS. The change from baseline to 1, 3, and 6-month follow-up in right ventricular ejection fraction is the primary variable along with secondary variables of change in right ventricle TAPSE and fractional area change.</description>
