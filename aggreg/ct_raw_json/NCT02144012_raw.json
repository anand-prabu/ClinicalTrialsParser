Eligible patients at up to approximately 40 sites\n      in the Asia-Pacific region will be randomized in a 2:1 ratio to receive trastuzumab\n      emtansine (Arm A) and will receive trastuzumab plus docetaxel (Arm B). All study drugs will\n      be administered at in-clinic visits occurring every three weeks during the treatment phase.\n      Trastuzumab plus docetaxel was chosen as the comparator in the control group (Arm B), as it\n      represents a common first-line treatment option used in this patient populat! ion in China\n      and other Asia-Pacific countries."
