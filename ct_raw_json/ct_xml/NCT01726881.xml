  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with SCI (spinal cord injury) can develop chronic pain within months of the injury.
      Up to 80% of the patients will develop chronic pain called &quot;central pain&quot; and describe the
      pain as: burning, stabbing, or &quot;like electricity.&quot; Central pain mechanism is unknown and
      therefore treatment is currently not effective.

      It is hypothesized that chronic pain is associated with impaired function of the systems
      regulating pain, however, this hypothesis has not been tested among SCI patients. Presence
      of such a connection, between the regulating system dysfunction and central pain, will help
      both predicting the risk of central pain and develop a treatment.

      The current research objective is to make several sensory measurements which will measure
      the functioning mechanisms of regulation and control of the pain. These measurements are
      accepted throughout the world and are based on psychophysical assessment of patients. these
      Measurements are designed to assess whether SCI chronic central pain patients demonstrate
      impairment in the regulation of pain. Finding such a link between central pain and impaired
      regulation could shed light on the mechanism of central pain. In addition, these
      measurements are designed to assess whether fresh SCI patients that have not yet developed
      central pain demonstrate impairment in the regulation of pain immediately after the injury.
      By repeated assessments of pain regulation capabilities, which will be made to fresh SCI
      patients during the first months of injury, and comparing the results of these measurements
      between those who will develop center pain and those who will not, we could identify
      indicators for predicting the risk of central pain. Another goal of the study is to
      investigate the efficacy of central pain treatment, using a TENS, when the parameters of the
      TENS treatment will be built according to the level of functioning of the regulating systems
      of the individual.
