  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, blinded, placebo and standard of care controlled study of the efficacy
      of a novel antibiotic containing gel compared to placebo gel in preventing surgical site
      infection after abdominal surgery. patients will be randomized to active or placebo gel in a
      double-blind manner.  The gel will be applied a single time in the incision during closure
      at the end of surgery. A cohort of patients will also be randomized to standard of care,
      saline irrigation at prior to skin closure, in an open manner.  The efficacy, safety and
      tolerability of the active gel will be assessed compared to the control group (combined
      placebo gel and standard of care groups).  Patients will be randomized to DFA-02 active gel:
      placebo gel: standard of care in a 4:1:1 ratio.
