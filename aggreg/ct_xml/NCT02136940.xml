        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adults 30-85 years of age.

          -  Diagnosis of either POAG or OHT in both eyes.

          -  Not receiving medication for IOP, or able to stop such medication for a washout
             period and the duration of the study without significant risk of adverse consequences
             related to glaucomatous disease.

          -  Elevated IOP (≥ 24 and ≤ 33 mm Hg at 8 AM and ≥ 21 and ≤ 33 mm Hg at 10 AM on
             Screening Two visit and Baseline visit in one or both eyes off treatment [after a
             washout phase in those subjects who were receiving ocular hypotensive therapy]).

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Ophthalmic exclusion criteria:

          -  Uncontrolled intraocular hypertension defined as &gt; 33 mm Hg in either eye at either
             of the screening/baseline visits (after a washout phase in those subjects who were
             currently receiving ocular hypotensive therapy).

          -  Receiving more than one medication for IOP in either eye at time of screening.

          -  Abnormal central corneal thickness.

          -  BCVA worse than 20/200 (logMAR 1.0) in either eye

          -  Significant visual field loss.

          -  Acute angle-closure glaucoma or appositional or very narrow anterior chamber angle in
             either eye.
