    <textblock>
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the fourth most common cause of death and
      the only one of the common causes that is still rising. The main effects of the disease are
      the destruction and inflammation of lung tissue rendering breathing difficult. COPD has
      significant effects on the quality of life of sufferers and the disease is predicted to be
      the fifth most common cause of disability in the world by 2020. Patients with COPD are prone
      to periods of worsening disease symptoms, known as exacerbations, which are often caused by
      viral and bacterial infections of the lung and current vaccines appear to have little
      efficacy in limiting these exacerbations. The loss of lung function caused by infectious
      exacerbations is irreversible and patients who frequently exacerbate experience more rapid
      disease progression. Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a major bacterial species
      that colonises the airways and causes exacerbations in COPD. With the development of more
      sensitive molecular techniques it has been possible to ascertain that it is the acquisition
      of new strains of NTHi that correlate strongly with exacerbations. However, not all patients
      with COPD have NTHi in their lungs and the question remains as to why some COPD patients are
      susceptible to such infections. This study aims to answer this question by comparing the
      airways of COPD patients who are colonized by NTHi and those who are not to analyse whether
      the levels of protective antibodies in the lungs and the function of the immune cells in the
      NTHi colonized airway are reduced. Moreover, we aim to correlate this reduction in immunity
      with areas of lung damage ascertained by high resolution computed tomography. The aim of
      this research is to better understand this apparent deficiency in airway immunity as this is
      likely to impact on vaccine efficacy in COPD.

        Volunteers will be recruited from General Practice in the form of patient screening
        clinics,and GP Mailshot. Quitters and pulmonary rehabilitation, would also be approached.
        The Respiratory Centre, patient support groups, and outpatient departments and wards,
        would also be areas of recruitment.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects who the investigator believes can and will comply with the requirements of
             the protocol.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the subject.

          -  Male or female subjects between, and including, 40 and 85 years of age, at the time
             of consent.

          -  Subjects with confirmed diagnosis of COPD (based on postbronchodilator spirometry).
             [GOLD, 2009] with FEV1 of &gt;80% (mild COPD) or &gt;50% but ≤80% (moderate COPD) of
             predicted normal and FEV1/FVC&lt;0.7

          -  Subjects have mild or moderate COPD, according to Global Initiative for Chronic
             Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) staging [GOLD, 2009].

          -  Subjects have a current or prior history of ≥10 pack years of cigarette smoking.
             Former smokers are defined as those who have stopped smoking for at least 6 months.
             Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes per day/20) x number of years smoked.

          -  Subjects with recent COPD exacerbations, in stable condition, and having stopped
             antibiotics, can be enrolled one month post exacerbation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject also has a confirmed diagnosis of asthma (as only cause of obstructive
             respiratory disorder), cystic fibrosis, pneumonia risk factors (e.g., HIV, Lupus,
             Parkinson's, Myasthenia Gravis) or other respiratory disorders (e.g., tuberculosis,
             lung cancer).

          -  Subjects having undergone lung surgery

          -  Subject has a α1-antitrypsin deficiency as underlying cause of COPD.

             with the study findings, such as:

          -  Subject at risk of noncompliance, or unable to comply with the study procedures.

          -  Evidence of alcohol or drug abuse.

          -  Others, as per clinical judgement
