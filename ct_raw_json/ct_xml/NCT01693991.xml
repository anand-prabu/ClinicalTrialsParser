      Research questions: Pilot study research questions: Primary: 1)Can we recruit a sufficient
      number (i.e., at least 60 patients over 9 months) and retain a sufficient proportion of both
      men and women (i.e., at least 80% at 2, 4, or 6 months post-randomization) with advanced
      cancer in all 3 trial arms to allow completion of a full study in 4 years?; 2)Is MMi
      acceptable: to a general ACP? to both men and women?; Secondary: 1)Is it feasible to
      complete the intervention in 3-4 weeks? 2)How long is it feasible to test MMi effects: 2, 4
      or 6 months post-randomization(retention rate=80%)? 3)Which recruitment strategies are most
      helpful? 4)What sample size is needed for a full study? Full-study research questions:
      Primary: Does adding the MMi to usual care (experimental group or EG) enhance meaning in
      life among newly diagnosed ACP, compared with those receiving usual care plus meetings with
      an empathic non-professional visitor (i.e., attention-control group or AC) or usual care
      alone (UC), at x months post-randomization? (time determined in pilot) &quot;Meaning in life&quot;
      (primary outcome) is defined as the belief that one's life has significance and purpose
      (i.e., global meaning) and &quot;newly diagnosed ACP&quot; is defined as the 6 months after first
      occurrence of, progression toward, or recurrence of stage III or IV cancer (TNM
      classification system). Secondary: In our future full-study, we plan to evaluate MMi effects
      on secondary outcomes such as existential wellbeing (MQOL existential wellbeing) and
      posttraumatic growth (Post-Traumatic Growth Inventory). We also plan to test a theoretical
      model where sense of meaning in life has a protective (moderating) effect on tertiary
      outcomes such as physical QoL (MQOL physical subscale), anxiety and depression (Hospital
      Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS)), and overall QoL (MQOL Total) in EG patients.
      Methodology: RCT pilot study with 60 newly diagnosed ACP (stages III or IV) within 2 months
      of referral and 6 months of randomization, assigned randomly to: (1) EG, (2) AC, or (3) UC.
      Patients will complete self-report questionnaires (including outcome measures, as well as
      sociodemographic and medical variables) at 2, 4 and 6 months post-randomization.

PSQ Q#7: Would you recommend those types of meetings to other people in your situation? 1= no, definitively not; 2= no, I don't think so; 3= yes, I think so; 4= yes, definitively PSQ Q#8: Were the meetings acceptable? PSQ Q#9: On the whole, how positive or negative was your experience of the meetings? 1= Totally negative; 2= Very negative; 3= A little negative; 4= Neutral; 5= A little positive; 6= Very positive; 7= Totally positive</description>

Strategies recruiting &lt;5% of participants will be considered unhelpful. All participants will be queried as to how they found out about the study. Recruitment strategies will include: being recruiting directly through the treating team, posted ads in recruiting oncology clinics, use of local media (newspaper and radio interviews), and creation of a website linked with the Jewish General Hospital and the McGill University Health Centre.</description>

    <description>MMi and attention control sessions will take place weekly for 3 weeks at the patient's home or hospital, as the patient prefers. We will try to limit delays to no more than 1 week if needed (e.g., for recovery from treatment side-effects), but because the feasibility of this schedule is one of the research questions, if more flexibility is required we will not withdraw people from the study if the delay is longer, since a longer intervention period could be incorporated in a full-scale RCT. Dates and duration of each session will be tracked. MMi sessions will be conducted by 2 bilingual mental health professionals (nurse, social worker, or psychologist) with at least 1 year of clinical oncology experience and will be initiated within 1 week after randomization.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria: 1) Diagnosed with advanced cancer (stage III or IV --TNM
        classification system; 117); first occurrence, progression or recurrence) of any type of
        solid tumour &lt;2 months at referral and &lt;6 months at randomization. 2) Willing to
        participate in weekly MMi or AC sessions. 3) &gt;18 years. 4) Alert and capable of giving
        free and informed consent. 5) Able to speak and read English or French. Exclusion
        Criteria: 1) Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) score &lt;60 (rated by referring
        oncologists/nurses or Research Coordinator (RC)) or expected survival &lt;6 months according
        to clinical judgment. 2) Currently receiving radiotherapy (Rx) treatment (although these
        patients can be reassessed after Rx). Patients will only be included in the study when
        they have recovered from severe side-effects from Rx and when they feel they can
        participate in the study. Severe side-effects are defined as a score of 3 or 4 on any of
        the site-specific toxicity markers of the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Common
        Toxicity Criteria or with more than 3 markers with a score of 2 (moderate side-effects),
        as evaluated by the treating physician (in consultation with the radiotherapist. 3)
        Suicidal. Present a score of ≥2 on the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) suicide item (item
        #9), administered by the RC or RA during the consent meeting. 4) Known diagnosis of
        schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder. 5) Planning a trip within 2 months that would
        interrupt delivery of the MMi or AC.
