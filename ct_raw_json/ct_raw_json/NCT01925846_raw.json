            "textblock": "Microbial infection of the cornea, also known as microbial keratitis, causes severe corneal\n      inflammation that could result in permanent visual loss.  Contact lens wear is the strongest\n      risk factor related to microbial keratitis in developed countries. The most commonly\n      isolated pathogen of contact lens associated microbial keratitis (CLMK) is Pseudomonas\n      aeruginosa, which accounts for over one third of the cases. Among the various virulence\n      factors involved in the pathogenesis of pseudomonal keratitis, a secretion system known as\n      type three secretion system (T3SS) secretes toxins that damage the host cells. ExoS is a\n      bifunctional exotoxin with GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity and ADP ribosyl\n      transferase (ADPRT) activity.  It results in an invasive phenotype of P. aeruginosa causing\n      a relatively slower host cell death with intracellular invasion and possibly proliferation\n      of bacterium. In contrast, ExoU expressing strains carries a cytotoxic phenotype that causes\n      rapid host cell lysis due to its phospholipase activity. Previously, cytotoxic strains were\n      reported to be more commonly found in patients with pseudomonal keratitis and were highly\n      correlated with multidrug resistance.\n\n      In order to understand the pathogenesis of CLMK, especially pseudomonal related CLMK, we\n      proposed to recruit 180 volunteers who will wear different contact lens materials. We then\n      collect the used contact lens and analyze 1) the microbiota on the used contact lens; 2) the\n      bacterial-contact lens adhesion of wild strains, pscC mutant strains (T3SS needle-comples\n      mutant), cytotoxic strain, and invasive strain P. aeruginosa; 3) the effect of shearing\n      forces on bacterial-contact lens adhesion; 4) the bacteriocidal effect of multipurpose\n      solution on different strains of P. aeruginosa."

Informed consent will be obtained from all enrolled subjects.  This study will\n      be approved by our Institutional Review Board and adheres to the tenets of the Declaration\n      of the Helsinki. A minimal of 12 subjects per group is required to show a difference in the\n      microbiota for one classification level or more at a significance level of 0.05 and a power\n      of 90%. Thus, the goal is to recruit 15 volunteers to wear each type of contact lens and 180\n      subjects totally for this study.\n\n      The recruitment will be divided into three stages. At the first stage, we will test 4 types\n      of silicone hydrogel contact lenses, followed by testing 5 types of color-tinted hydrogel\n      lenses at the second stage and 3 types of hydrogel lenses at the third stage. (T = types of\n      lenses, which equals 4,5 and 3 at stage one, two and three).\n\n      At each stage, we will recruit subjects to certain amount (M) each time (M\uff1dN\u00d7T , N equals\n      1,2,3\u2026to 15). M subjects will then be randomized, equally distributed to wear T types of\n      lenses by the random number method. Until the required case numberis achieved at the first\n      stage, we will proceed to the second and the third stage with the same stratified\n      randomization methods.( required case number, \u03a3M,  equals 60, 75 and 45 at stage one, two\n      and three).\n\n      Subjects are fitted with the soft contact lenses and are expected to wear the lenses for at\n      least 6-8 hour per day. Standardized hand hygiene and lens care regimen are thoroughly\n      explained to each subject to insert the contact lens. Each subject enrolled will be provided\n      with the soft contact lenses without charge. After wear each day, the contact lenses must be\n      returned and collected for material analysis."
