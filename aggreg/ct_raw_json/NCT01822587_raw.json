The investigators will attempt to augment this effect by a) doubling the\n      number of propranolol-medicated cocaine cue exposure (CCE) retrieval sessions and b)\n      increasing the dose of propranolol. It is expected that propranolol treated groups, relative\n      to placebo treated groups, will evidence greater reduction of craving, cue reactivity and\n      cocaine use during follow-up cocaine cue exposures. Also, these effects will be greater for\n      those who receive 80mg of propranolol as opposed to 40mg."

Participants may meet criteria for abuse, but not dependence, for any\n             other substance with the exception of nicotine. Because of the high comorbidity of\n             cocaine and nicotine dependence, excluding nicotine dependence would seriously\n             compromise the feasibility of recruitment (nicotine patch will be provided to\n             participants during the course of their involvement in the laboratory procedures).\n             Although individuals who meet criteria for alcohol abuse will be accepted for study\n             participation, anyone who has a measurable blood alcohol level on the day of testing\n             will be excluded as acute alcohol intake can lower seizure threshold.\n\n          -  Participants must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual\n             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.Exclusion\n             Criteria:\n\n          -  Use of one of the following methods of birth control by female participants: barrier\n             methods (diaphragm or condoms with spermicidal or both), surgical sterilization, use\n             of an intra-uterine contraceptive device, or complete abstinence from sexual\n             intercourse.\n\n          -  Individuals must live within a 50-mile radius of our research program and have\n             reliable transportation.\n\n          -  Individuals must consent to remain abstinent from all drugs of abuse (except\n             nicotine) for 72 hours immediately prior to CTRC inpatient admission.\n\n          -  Individuals must consent to random assignment to one of three study groups (the two\n             propranolol-treated groups or the placebo-treated group).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Women who are pregnant, nursing or of childbearing potential and not practicing an\n             effective means of birth control.\n\n          -  Individuals with evidence of or a history of significant hematological, endocrine,\n             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, gastrointestinal, or neurological disease including\n             diabetes, as these conditions may affect heart rate or skin conductance measurement.\n\n          -  Individuals with significant liver impairment as propranolol is hepatically\n             metabolized.\n\n          -  Individuals with a history of or current psychotic disorder, current major depressive\n             disorder, bipolar affective disorder or a severe anxiety disorder as these may impact\n             cue reactivity.\n\n          -  Individuals currently taking anti-arrythmic agents, psychostimulants or any other\n             agents known to interfere with heart rate and skin conductance monitoring.\n\n          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to propranolol.\n\n          -  Individuals taking medications that could adversely interact with the study\n             medication, including, but not limited to albuterol, insulin, or significant\n             inhibitors of CYP2D6.\n\n          -  Individuals with bronchial asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, as the\n             use of propranolol is contraindicated in these individuals.\n\n          -  Individuals with any physical condition or disability that would compromise optimal\n             sensory processing of the cues (e.g., blindness)."
