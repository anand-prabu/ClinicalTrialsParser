    <textblock>
      This is a study designed to compare the safety and efficacy of 3 different doses of MK-5172
      combined with pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and ribavirin (RBV) in
      treatment-naïve participants with genotype 1 (GT1) chronic hepatitis C (CHC). Participants
      will receive 12 weeks of treatment with MK-5172 combined with PegIFN-2b and RBV, and
      depending on response at Week 4 may go on to receive an additional 12 weeks of treatment
      with PegIFN-2b and RBV.
