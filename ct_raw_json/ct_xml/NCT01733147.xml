      Will oral supplementation with Omega 3 free fatty acids in obese Barrett's esophagus
      subjects downregulate pro-neoplastic and pro-inflammatory pathways in the esophagus to
      anti-inflammatory pathway?

    <description>Subjects will be placed on 3 capsules a day of Omega 3 free fatty acids taken orally for six months. Subjects will take 2 capsules with breakfast and 1 capsule with their evening meal. Active drug will consist of 1000 mg of a ω3 FFA preparation containing 675 mg EPA and 300 mg DHA.</description>

    <description>Subjects with Barrett's esophagus. Baseline assessment: measure waist and hip circumference, height, weight. Complete the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire (RSQ). 10cc of blood drawn after 12 hour fast for serum free fatty acid (FFA) profile. Clinical baseline blood drawn: INR, LDL, AST and ALT. Endoscopy performed: four biopsies obtained from the GE junction and 4 biopsies from the BE mucosa. Randomized to ω3 FFA preparation or placebo for six months. Telephone calls will be made every month to subjects to assess for adverse effects (presence and grade) and reinforce compliance. Compliance will also be assessed by pill counts during monthly call. Subjects will undergo repeat assessment at six months following randomization. This will include anthropometry (similar to baseline), a fasting blood draw for serum FFA profile, LDL, AST, ALT, INR and endoscopy with research biopsies as outlined at baseline. Subjects will also fill out the Reflux Symptom Questionnaire (RSQ).</description>
