PROTOCOL SUMMARY This is a prospective, randomized open-label, 2 arm, 3-phase trial to\n      compare the 48-weeks virological response of two different regimens containing\n      abacavir/lamivudine (abacavir/lamivudine +darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) vs\n      abacavir/lamivudine + raltegravir (RAL) in antiretroviral therapy naive, HIV+ individuals\n      presenting for care with CD4+ counts < 200/mm3.\n\n      1.1 Clinical Objectives: Primary Objective: To compare the 48-week virological response to\n      two different regimens containing abacavir/lamivudine (abacavir/lamivudine\n      +darunavir/ritonavir (DRV/r) vs  abacavir/lamivudine + raltegravir (RAL) in antiretroviral\n      therapy naive, HIV+ individuals presenting for care with CD4+ counts < 200/mm3.\n\n      Secondary Objective:\n\n        1. To compare immunological response at 48 weeks;\n\n        2. To determine the safety and tolerability of the 2 regimens. 1.2 Study population: 350\n           inpatients or outpatients will be randomized 1.3 Outcome Primary Endpoint\n\n             -  Proportion of patients with undetectable viremia (HIV RNA<50 copies/mL) after 48\n                weeks Secondary Endpoints(s)\n\n             -  Change in CD4+ cell count from baseline through week 48\n\n             -  Time to virological rebound Safety endpoints\n\n             -  Incidence of adverse events (AEs)\n\n             -  Incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs)\n\n             -  Discontinuations due to adverse events\n\n             -  Incidence of grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities. 1.4 Study design Multicentre,\n                parallel group, randomised, open label, non-inferiority study 1.5 Planned sample\n                size: The planned sample size for this trial is 350 patients 1.6 Treatment\n                regimens: Arm A: abacavir/lamivudine 1 tablet once a day + raltegravir 400 mg (1\n                tablet twice a day) Arm B: abacavir/lamivudine 1 tablet once a day + ritonavir 100\n                mg + darunavir 800  mg once a day.\n\n      All drugs have been approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Administration: oral The\n      study population will consist of 350 HIV-positive, HLA B5701-negative patients. At baseline,\n      patients will be randomized 1:1 to start abacavir/lamivudine plus either raltegravir or\n      darunavir/ritonavir. Randomization will be stratified on the basis of the screening CD4+\n      cell count (\u2264100 vs \u2265100 cells/\u00b5L), to ensure balance across treatments groups 1.7 Criteria\n      for Safety:  Adverse events and laboratory assessments. 1.8  Statistical analysis: As this\n      is a non-inferiority trial, we will calculate the difference in the proportions of patients\n      experiencing the primary outcome in the two treatment arms and will calculate a 95%\n      confidence interval for this.  Non-inferiority of the raltegravir arm will be demonstrated\n      if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval is greater than -12%. In case\n      non-inferiority will be met, analyses for superiority will be performed."
