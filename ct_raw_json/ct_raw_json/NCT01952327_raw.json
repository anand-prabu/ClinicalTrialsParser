The purpose of the trial is to assess whether the new pleurapump device\n      is safe and effective in the management of patients with MPE. The study will try to identify\n      what kind of problems may arise from using the device, how often they happen, and how severe\n      they are if they occur."

Written informed consent\n\n          5. Ability to comply with study procedures and ability to operate the device\n\n          6. Expected survival of more than 3 months after device insertion\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Haemothorax\n\n          2. Purulent pleural effusion\n\n          3. Significant pleural fluid septation or loculation on thoracic ultrasound or\n             cross-sectional imaging\n\n          4. Obstructive uropathy or any bladder anomaly which might contraindicate implantation\n             of the device.\n\n          5. Pregnant females or females anticipating pregnancy during study period.\n\n          6. Patients currently enrolled in another interventional clinical study\n\n          7. Concurrently implanted with any other Active Implantable Medical Device, including,\n             but not limited to cardiac pacemaker or cardioverter defibrillator.\n\n          8. Major comorbidity which, in the opinion of the principal investigator, is likely to\n             significantly decrease life expectancy, increase anaesthetic risk, or lead to device\n             removal (e.g. moderate to severe congestive heart failure, significant valvular heart\n             disease, persistent immunosuppression, etc.)\n\n          9. Other  contraindication to general anaesthesia\n\n         10. Other contraindication to procedure (e.g. uncorrectable bleeding diathesis, infection\n             or malignant involvement over proposed insertion site)\n\n         11.
