    <textblock>
      This trial is evaluating an intervention to support adolescent girls from marginalised
      communities in northern Karnataka State, South India to complete secondary school, thereby
      reducing their vulnerability to HIV infection from early marriage and entry into sex work at
      young ages. The intervention will test innovations to address both supply and demand side
      barriers to girls' completion of secondary school, and will have long-term educational and
      livelihood benefits, in addition to reducing vulnerability to HIV.

      School-based constraints will be addressed by improving academic outcomes through teacher
      training and academic support to students; addressing gender-related and skill-based gaps
      among teachers; training of local female teachers; and increasing the content knowledge of
      secondary school teachers. Demand side barriers will be addressed by reducing economic
      pressures that households face to withdraw girls' from school; building appreciation and
      value of girls' education; building family and community accountability for school
      attendance; creating safe spaces for girls and strengthening their agency; and engaging boys
      in promoting and supporting girls' education.

      Primary stakeholders will include teachers and students, especially adolescent girls in the
      school (7th to 10 the standard) from marginalized communities. Secondary stakeholders will
      include school development and management committees (SDMCs), families, boys and the
      communities that are served by the schools. The intervention will cover 125 high schools  in
      Bagalkot and Bijapur districts. The intervention will be implemented in collaboration with
      the Department of State Educational Research and Training (DSERT), Karnataka; the Adolescent
      Education Cell, Government College of Teachers' Education (CTE), Jamkhandi; and the
      Institute for Advanced Studies in Education (IASE), Gulbarga.

    <description>Outcomes will be measured through two sequential cohort studies. A total of 1020 adolescent girls age 13 from 68 clusters (34 clusters each in intervention and control arms of the study) will be required. At the beginning of the first academic year, the study will recruit a cohort of 1020 girls who passed out of 7th standard in 68 study villages (about 510 from each study arm). These girls will be interviewed using an interviewer administered questionnaire. The cohort from the intervention sites will be interviewed three times during the study period, once each at the beginning of academic years 1, 2, and 4. The cohort from the control sites will be interviewed only twice during the study period, at the beginning of years 1. To measure changes in subsequent cohorts of girls exposed to intervention, we will recruit another cohort at the beginning of academic year 2 from the intervention sites only. The cohort size will be 510.</description>
