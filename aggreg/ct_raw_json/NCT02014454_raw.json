Cardiovascular and respiratory parameters will be\n      continuously monitored. Blood samplings checking metabolic, renal and liver functions will\n      be performed periodically, as well as cardiac function, in order to verify the treatment\n      safety. Serial ophthalmological evaluations will be planned to monitor the efficacy of the\n      treatment, the ROP progression and the possible complications."
