        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult (≥ 18 years of age) men or women with a diagnosis of ABSSSI
             (cellulitis/erysipelas, wound infection, major cutaneous abscess, or burn infection)
             with at least two signs of systemic infection

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, the subject must require and be a suitable
             candidate for IV antibiotic therapy, and the subject must be able and willing to
             comply with protocol requirements

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  A medical history of significant hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to quinolones,
             beta-lactams, vancomycin, or vancomycin derivatives according to the judgment of the
             investigator.

          -  Women who are pregnant or lactating.

          -  Any chronic or underlying skin condition at the site of infection that may complicate
             the assessment of response, including infection involving a prosthetic joint, human
             or animal bite, osteomyelitis, decubitus ulcer, diabetic foot ulcer, septic
             arthritis, mediastinitis, necrotizing fasciitis, anaerobic cellulitis, or synergistic
             necrotizing cellulitis, myositis, tendinitis, endocarditis, sustained shock, gangrene
             or gas gangrene; burns covering ≥10% of body surface area; severely compromised
             immune system, severely impaired arterial blood supply to an extremity with an
             ABSSSI, deep vein thrombosis or superficial thrombophlebitis, and requiring either an
             amputation or multiple debridement procedures.

          -  Any underlying disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, could interfere with
             the subject's ability to participate in the study including severe cardiac disease,
             known history of liver disease, end-stage renal disease, malignancy, psychiatric
             disorder, ongoing treatment for seizures or untreated history of seizures, or life
             expectancy of &lt; 3 months.
