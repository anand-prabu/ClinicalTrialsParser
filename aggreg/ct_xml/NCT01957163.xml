    <textblock>
      After screening, subjects will enter a 4 week open-label run-in period with fluticasone
      furoate (FF)/vilanterol (VI) 100/25 mcg administered once daily via dry powder inhaler
      (DPI). Subjects will then be randomized to receive any one of the 3 treatments (umeclidinium
      bromide [UMEC] [62.5 mcg] administered once daily via a DPI; OR UMEC [125 mcg] administered
      once daily via a DPI; OR matching placebo administered once daily via a DPI), while
      continuing treatment with open label FF/VI 100/25 mcg during a 12-week treatment period.
      There will be a total of eight scheduled clinic visits at Pre-Screening (Visit0), Screening
      (Visit 1), blinded treatment Day 1(Visit2), 2(Visit3), 28 (Visit4), 56 (Visit5), 84 (Visit6)
      and 85 (Visit7). A follow-up phone contact will be conducted approximately 7 days after the
      last clinic visit. The total duration of subject participation in the study from Screening
      to Follow-up will be approximately 17 weeks.

             been resected for cure is not exclusionary).  Significant is defined as any disease
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, would put the safety of the subject at risk
