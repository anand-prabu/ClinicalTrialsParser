It is not yet\n      known if exemestane is more effective than tamoxifen in preventing the recurrence of breast\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of exemestane with that of\n      tamoxifen in treating postmenopausal women who have undergone surgery to remove early-stage\n      breast cancer."

Patients are stratified\n      according to estrogen receptor (ER)/progesterone receptor (PgR) status (ER positive vs ER\n      negative/PgR positive vs ER positive/PgR unknown), prior chemotherapy (none vs taxane-based\n      vs anthracycline-based vs other), and nodal status (negative vs 1-3 nodes positive vs 4 or\n      more nodes positive). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral tamoxifen once daily\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral exemestane once daily. Treatment in both arms continues\n           for a minimum of 5 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at months 3 and 12 during study.\n\n      Patients are followed at least annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 4,400 patients (2,200 per treatment arm) will be accrued\n      for this study."
