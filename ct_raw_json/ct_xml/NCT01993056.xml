  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to available data the injury rate in male veteran soccer is high. Interventions to
      prevent injuries are requested. The 11+ warm-up program was developed by FIFA-experts and
      consists of several exercises with an overall-length of about 20 min. This study shall
      investigate the influence of 11+ on injury incidence and Functional Movement Screen
      (FMS)-Score in male veteran soccer players. Additionally it is to be examined if there is a
      relationship between FMS-Score and injury incidence. For this purpose the 11+-program is
      accomplished under supervised conditions over one regular season in a randomized-controlled
      study design. Injuries are documented via questionnaires in accordance with the
      FIFA-consensus-statement. FMS-Score is evaluated before and after the interventional period.
