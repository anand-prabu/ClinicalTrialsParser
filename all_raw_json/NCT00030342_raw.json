Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells\n      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with chemotherapy\n      may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy combined with\n      chemotherapy in treating patients who have metastatic kidney cancer or colorectal cancer."

The PBMC are treated ex vivo to form interleukin-12-primed activated T cells\n      (12ATC).\n\n      Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 24 hours on day 6 of week 2 and interferon alfa-2b SC\n      and GM-CSF SC 3 times weekly on weeks 3-5. Patients receive 12ATC IV over 15-30 minutes\n      twice weekly and interferon alfa-2b SC (at least 24 hours after 12ATC infusion) once weekly\n      on weeks 6-8. Patients with complete or partial response or stable disease at 3 weeks after\n      the last 12ATC infusion may receive an additional 8-week course as above.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2 years or at\n      any time when the physical examination or symptoms are suspicious for tumor progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients (30 per stratum) will be accrued for this study\n      within 2-3 years."
