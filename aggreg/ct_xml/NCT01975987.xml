  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to identify patients' features predictive of successful intubation
      using the Bonfils fiberscope.

      Our hypothesis is that some patients' characteristics are predictors of successful
      intubation with the Bonfils fiberscope.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endotracheal intubation is an important act in the practice of anesthesiology. Direct
      laryngoscopy is the most commonly used technique to accomplish this task. Airway
      characteristics predicting difficult intubation with direct laryngoscopy are well defined.
      Physical findings, such as Mallampati classification or measurements of the thyromental
      distance, mouth opening, and neck extension have been validated to help anticipate difficult
      situations. When direct laryngoscopy is strenuous, early conversion to an alternative
      technique might reduce the risk of airway compromise and associated morbidity.

      Many intubation devices are now available and part of the anesthesiologist's task is to
      select the alternative approach best suited to each patient's specific features.   Despite
      its use for both elective and unexpectedly difficult intubation, predictive criteria for
      successful airway management  with the Bonfils fiberscope have not been proposed.

      The purpose of this study is to identify patients' features, if any,  that could predict
      successful intubation when using the Bonfils fiberscope for perioperative orotracheal
      intubation in an elective surgical population.

    <description>To calculate the Intubation Difficulty Score the following variables will be collected:  number of attempts,  number of operators, necessity to use an alternative intubation technique, glottic visualization and effort needed to obtain optimal view of the glottis, necessity of external laryngeal pressure and vocal cords position during intubation.</description>

    <description>Characteristics of patients will be assessed before induction of general anesthesia
Glottic visualization  will be evaluated by direct laryngoscopy.
The endotracheal tube will be loaded onto the scope
Intubation will be performed with the Bonfils fiberscope with the patient in supine position with head and neck in neutral position
Bonfils fiberscope will be inserted from the right side of the patient's mouth, alongside the molars and advanced underneath the epiglottis.  With the tip of the Bonfils in satisfactory position, the endotracheal tube will be advanced into the trachea using gentle rotary motions.  The scope will then be removed.
Accurate positioning of the endotracheal tube will be confirmed by capnography and lung auscultation.</description>
