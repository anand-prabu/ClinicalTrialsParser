             cohorts, only patients with selected hematological malignancies will be enrolled :

                  200mg/24h, or measurable plasmacytoma (not previously irradiated).

          -  Patients &gt; 18 years old.

          -  Off previous therapy for at least 3 weeks, or 5 half-lives of previously administered
             drug, whichever is longer, prior to first study treatment administration, except

             to start study medication.

          -  Recovery from the non-hematological toxic effects of prior treatment to grade &lt; 1, or
             baseline value, according to NCI-CTC classification, except alopecia.

          -  Calculated creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min (Cockroft &amp; Gault formula, or MDRD
             formula for patients aged &gt; 65 years). For patients with MM, a creatinine clearance &gt;
             30mL/min is accepted).

          -  Adequate LFTs: Total bilirubin &lt; the institutional upper normal limits (UNL);
             ALAT/ASAT and AP &lt; 3 x UNL (or &lt; 5 x UNL in case of liver involvement).
