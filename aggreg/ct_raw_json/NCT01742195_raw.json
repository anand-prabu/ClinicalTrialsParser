Most centers perform linear EBUS via the oral route\n      given the larger diameter of the bronchoscope used. However, the feasibility and the\n      diagnostic accuracy of linear EBUS performed through the nose have not been reported.\n      Furthermore, the two routes of insertion have never been compared in terms of patient\n      satisfaction and comfort.\n\n      In order to compare the two routes of insertion, consecutive patients referred for a linear\n      endobronchial ultrasound will be recruited. Participants will be randomized to either oral\n      or nasal insertion. All participants will be sedated and will receive local anesthetics in a\n      similar manner. After the procedure, patients will fill a questionnaire regarding their\n      comfort and satisfaction with the procedure."
