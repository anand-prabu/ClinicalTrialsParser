Secondary objectives include: (1) in those randomized to being a\n      mentee, explore mentor characteristics associated with improved HbA1c.\n\n      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial. Outcomes to be measured\n      include glycosylated hemoglobin, blood pressure, direct LDL, diabetes quality of life and\n      depression.\n\n      The trial has two phases. In phase one, patients with poorly controlled diabetes are\n      randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring. In phase two, poorly controlled\n      diabetics are randomized to usual care or receiving peer mentoring from former mentees.\n      Former mentees from phase 1 are also randomized such that they will have a 50% chance of\n      becoming a mentor."
