            "textblock": "The \"hardening of the arteries\" observed with aging raises blood pressure and contributes to\n      poor brain blood flow and loss of cognitive function (i.e. attention, memory, solving\n      problems, making decisions). Cognition is the most important determinant of overall health\n      status, quality of life, functional ability and independence in older adulthood.\n      Nutraceutical strategies have received considerable attention as they may improve\n      cardiovascular health with far fewer side effects compared to drugs. In this regard, dairy\n      products are particularly attractive. Higher dairy consumption is associated with lower\n      blood pressure and improved memory in adults. Milk proteins have natural blood pressure\n      lowering effects. Studies conducted in animals have demonstrated that whey protein (a\n      component of milk protein) may also increase artery elasticity. This is important given the\n      strong association between artery elasticity, brain blood flow, and risk for cognitive\n      decline.\n\n      The investigators propose to conduct a randomized double-blind placebo controlled study\n      comparing the effects of whey protein supplementation or carbohydrate placebo on measures of\n      artery elasticity, brain blood flow, and cognitive function in older adults.  Whey protein\n      may be a novel dietary therapy to improve both artery health and brain health in older\n      adults."
