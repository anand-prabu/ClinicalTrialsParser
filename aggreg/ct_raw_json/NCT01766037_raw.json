This is done through a tube placed through the abdomen into the stomach with a\n      small valve attached at the surface of your skin. An aspiration system will attach to that\n      valve after each major meal of the day and allow you to remove a portion of that meal.\n\n      During this study you will also be provided with Lifestyle therapy which includes behavioral\n      therapy, diet and physical activity education.  This Lifestyle therapy will also be provided\n      to the participants who do not receive the AspireAssist so that the two groups can be\n      compared and the benefit of aspiration for weight loss can be determined."
