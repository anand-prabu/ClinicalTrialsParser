  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single patient investigative treatment study. The patient was diagnosed with a
      retinal tumor in one eye. In the last 2 years, the patient has been treated with all
      available and conventional therapies, including intraocular injections of Avastin and
      Lucentis, steroids, and photodynamic therapy. Any positive results were short-term, and
      caused an eventual decline in central vision. Aflibercept has been shown to be effective
      against the growth of new vessels, secondary to macular degeneration. This study proposes
      that it may also be more effective in treating this particular patient and case. The study
      treatment plan is for 6 months initially, with the intention to continue treatment.

  <detailed_description>

      The treatment plan will be to administer aflibercept 2.0 mg intravitreally every two to four
      weeks for at least six consecutive injections. Prior to initiation of therapy and at each
      study visit, a full ophthalmic examination, best-corrected visual acuity, and a complete
      review of systems to monitor for any toxicity will be performed.  In addition, the
      investigators will perform fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography at baseline and
      obtain color fundus photographs as well as spectral domain OCT images to properly document
      the extent and degree of activity of the vascular tumor at baseline and at all study visits.
