      1. Summary

           Growing evidence suggests that a significant proportion of in-hospital patient deaths
           occur after serious adverse events (SAE's). Concerns have been raised that too often
           patients' acute deteriorations, particularly on surgical and medical wards outside
           critical care settings, are identified too late and corrective actions taken too
           slowly. Many initiatives have been taken to prevent unexpected death by timely
           recognition, intervention and resuscitation efforts such as Rapid Response Systems
           (RRS's). RRS's have been introduced with the intention to prevent SAE's and to improve
           patient outcome by facilitating early detection of warning signs for clinical
           deterioration. These systems have four components (1) an afferent limb for detection
           and response triggering, (2) an efferent limb with medical or nursing response to
           prevent deterioration (3) a process improvement limb and (4) a governance and
           administrative structure. It remains uncertain which elements of RRS's contribute most
           to patient outcomes such as unplanned (re-) admission to the intensive care unit,
           shock, cardiac arrest and unexpected death. In addition, previous studies found that
           nurse observation, assessment and communication (afferent limb) are crucial to achieve
           better patient outcomes, but how to achieve afferent limb sustainability in hospitals
           is not clear.

           A previous study investigated 23 hospitals in Flanders (Belgium) about how nurses
           observe, assess, detect and communicate deteriorating and critical patients in
           surgical, medical and geriatric wards. Wide variation between hospitals was identified
           about critical patient intervention procedures, strategies and Do Not Attempt
           Resuscitation (DNAR) orders as well as between nurses about the use and knowledge of
           critical vital signs and call criteria for physician clinical advice and support.
           Nurses of hospitals with structured observation and communication protocols were better
           informed and perceived their communication and collaboration with physicians more
           favorable in compared to other hospitals. Based on these results conclusions and
           recommendations for further initiatives were formulated. The proposed Afferent Limb and
           Response Method intervention study will implement these recommendations guided by a
           robust scientific research approach to offer evidence to the nursing and medical
           practice community.

           The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of the Afferent Limb Ascertainment and
           Response Method intervention or ALARM intervention in medical and surgical nursing
           wards of acute care hospitals on the prevention of SAE's such as in-hospital unexpected
           death, unplanned ICU-admission and cardiac arrest.

        2. Study hypothesis

      Optimizing and supporting the process of observation, use and interpretation of vital signs,
      detection, assessment, escalation and communication with a higher level of care in
      deteriorating patients can prevent serious adverse events (in-hospital unexpected death,
      unplanned ICU admission and cardiac arrest) in acute care hospitals.

      - What does the study involve?

      The study is based on the application of training and tools: the training of nursing and
      medical staff about the observation, detection, assessment and communication of
      deteriorating and critically ill patients and the introduction of a standardized observation
      and communication protocol on medical and surgical wards (tools). A training team will offer
      standardized training sessions.

      - When does the study take place?

      From October 1st 2013 till September 30th 2015.

      - Where does the study take place?

      Belgium.

      - What are the risks to participants?

      Patients will not be exposed to complementary risks if they partake in this study. No
      additional investigations will be performed for the purpose of this study since the aim of
      the intervention is to optimize existing processes that are already used in a hospital.
