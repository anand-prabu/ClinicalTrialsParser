Those in the\n      AO condition will be re-randomized after the treatment phase to either RP or CPT.\n      Individuals will be assessed pretreatment, immediately post-treatment, 3-, 6-, 9-, and\n      12-months post-treatment and will monitor symptoms daily throughout treatment."

To address this research gap, the investigators will\n      evaluate two widely accepted treatments for each respective disorder; Cognitive Processing\n      Therapy (CPT) an effective PTSD treatment and Relapse Prevention (RP), a widely used\n      effective AUD treatment.\n\n      The investigators will build on our prior work using a daily telephone Interactive Voice\n      Response (IVR) system to test models of self-medication and the sequence of symptom change\n      for both primary and secondary symptom targets associated with each therapy.\n\n      Creating a more comprehensive model of symptom change in PTSD and alcohol use with widely\n      used selective treatments is critical in testing theories of PTSD/AUD, evaluating these\n      treatments for use with PTSD/AUD, and implementing these therapies with PTSD/AUD patients in\n      standard clinical practice"
