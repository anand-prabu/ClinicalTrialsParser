      The purpose of this study is to determine the maximum tolerated dose of RX-3117 in subjects
      with advanced or metastatic solid tumors.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a dose-finding, open-label, single agent study of RX-3117.  Subjects will be treated
      for up to 8 cycles of therapy.  A cycle will be 4 weeks.  RX-3117 dosing will be 3 times
      each week for 3 weeks follow by 1 week off treatment.  All subjects will be followed for at
      least 30 days after the last dose of RX-3117.
