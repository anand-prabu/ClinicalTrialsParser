Patients who will not obtain at 30min a pain score < 1/10 will be excluded\n      (epidural analgesia not functional). The upkeep of analgesia will be provided by an\n      automatic pump and randomized in: classic pump and new pump. The mixture used will be the\n      same in the 2 groups: Levobupivacaine 0.0100% + Sufentanil 0.5\u00b5g/mL. The classic pump\n      administers AL with a continuous output (8mL/h)even though the new pump administers AL in\n      bolus (8mL every hour; beginning 1h after the induction). The classic pump is a pump CADD\n      SMITHS PCEA (Patient Controlled Epidural Analgesia) with the programming: continuous output\n      8mL/h; Additional bolus if necessary: 8mL; Maximal dose by hour: 24mL.\n\n      The new pump is a pump CADD SMITHS called PIEB (Programmed Intermittent Epidural Bolus) with\n      the programming: intermittent bolus 8mL every hour; Additional bolus if necessary: 8mL; Ban\n      period during 10min between patient bolus and automatic bolus; Maximal dose by hour: 24mL.\n\n      In case of the pain reappears and which is not calmed with 2 successive patient bolus, the\n      anaesthetist will be called for the evaluation and administration of a doctor bolus if\n      necessary (Levobupivacaine 0.125% 5mL associated with 50\u00b5g of Clonidine).\n\n      Collected data will be demographic data, data about the obstetrical labor proceedings, data\n      about pain, motor block, maternal satisfaction, total quantity of administered analgesia,\n      number of patient and doctor bolus wich are asked and administered and neonatal data.\n\n      Endpoints will be collected by a doctor in blind of the type of pump (the 2 pumps are the\n      same extern aspect, only the intern programming is different).\n\n      In case of caesarean during the labor, patient will be excluded of the study. When a\n      decision of extraction will be taken, patient will receive a bolus of AL according to the\n      anaesthetist decision but not accounted for the dose calculation."
