Rate of delayed reactions per\n      injection will be compared between the two groups.\n\n      BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE\n\n      Immunotherapy is one of the most effective therapies for allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, but\n      the protocol dosing during pollen season is based on limited data.  Immunotherapy is given\n      in increasing dosage during the build up phase in order to build tolerance.  After the build\n      up phase, there is a maintenance phase that is used for the remainder of therapy.  At this\n      time, there is little data to support the common practice of not increasing the dosage of\n      immunotherapy during pollen seasons.\n\n      The recent allergen immunotherapy practice parameter references 2 articles that have noted\n      no increased systemic reactions to SCIT during pollen season. ,  In one prospective study,\n      it was concluded that there was no direct correlation of reactions to SCIT and pollen\n      season.3 They did note a correlation between the mean monthly mold counts in August to\n      October and the rate of systemic reactions. The other study referenced is a prospective\n      study which did not observe a statistically significant difference in the rate of systemic\n      reactions to grass or ragweed pollen during their respective pollen seasons.4 However, the\n      conclusions of these studies are conflicted by another study which consists of surveys\n      retrospectively sent to members of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology.\n      The surveys in this study identified 46% of near fatal reactions to SCIT as occurring during\n      peak allergy season.   Though the immunotherapy standard parameters are not defining pollen\n      season as a contraindication, we will consider it more that minimal risk for this study.\n\n      It is still common practice to stop the buildup phase and not escalate SCIT dosing during\n      pollen season due to the conflicting available data and limitations in study design of many\n      of the studies (retrospective, questionnaire based).  A further look into SCIT dosing during\n      pollen season will allow for more standardized practice and potentially improved patient\n      outcomes."
