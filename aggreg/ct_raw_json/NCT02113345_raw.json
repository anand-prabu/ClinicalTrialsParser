To evaluate the reliability and validity of the Chinese Metamemory Scales\n\n        2. To explore the relationship between metamemory and memory of elders\n\n        3. To evaluate the effectiveness of a metamemory cognitive intervention on Mild Cognitive\n           Impairment (MCI) elders who have low memory self-efficacy\n\n      Research Hypotheses:\n\n      Study 1: The Chinese Metamemory Scales will show acceptable psychometric properties.\n\n      Study 2: There is a positive correlation between metamemory (subjective memory) and memory\n      (objective memory) and this relationship is mediated by stereotyped beliefs about memory\n      ageing.\n\n      Study 3: Comparing to Control Group, the Intervention Group will yield the following\n      expected results:\n\n        1. There is an improvement in objective memory measures post-training.\n\n        2. There is an improvement in subjective memory measures post-training.\n\n        3. There is an improvement in mood measures post-training."
