  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of unresectable and obstructive  gastric cancer patients ranges in the
      literature from 5 to 30 % . In such cases, gastro-entero anastomosis is traditionally
      performed and can improve the quality of life by relieving the symptoms of impaired oral
      intake without having a high surgical risk. Unfortunately, up to 25% of these patients may
      develop impaired gastric emptying syndrome.  Gastric partitioning was originally described
      by Devine in 1925 as a method of antral exclusion and complete division of the stomach
      accompanied by a gastro-entero anastomosis in the proximal gastric pouch for the management
      of difficult duodenal ulcers. This procedure has been modified along the years and was
      adopted for the palliative treatment of gastric cancer. The advantages of the partitioning
      includes: better gastric emptying, avoidance of direct tumor invasion of the gastro-entero
      anastomosis, less contact between the ingested food and the tumor with less blood lost and
      improved survival. Retrospective not randomized studies have been published demonstrating
      the effectiveness of the procedure.

      The first group (Group A) will be considered the control group in which patients will
      undergo gastro-entero anastomosis. The anastomosis will be pre-colic, along the posterior
      wall of the stomach with the length of at least 5 cm. The first jejunal loop approximately
      40 cm from the angle of Treitz will be used. The anastomosis can be performed manually or
      with staplers.

      The second group (group B) will be considered the intervention group in which patients will
      undergo gastric partitioning plus gastro-entero anastomosis. The gastric partitioning is
      done 5 cm proximal to the lesion along the greater curvature towards the lesser curvature
      above the incisura using linear cutting stapler. The partitioning is performed horizontally
      and preserve a narrow tunnel along the lesser curvature that is calibrated with a orogastric
      tube gauge 32. Subsequently, a pre-colic gastro-entero anastomosis is performed in the
      proximal gastric chamber created by the partitioning. The anastomosis is done along the
      posterior wall, with at least 5 cm of length using the first jejunal loop approximately 40
      cm from the angle of Treitz. The anastomosis can be performed manually or with staplers.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with distal obstructive gastric tumors without indication of curative or
             palliative resection.

          -  Obstruction is defined as GOOSS (Gastric outlet obstruction score system) of 2 or
             less, associated with early vomiting and bloating if the patient try to keep the
             usual volume of food intake.

          -  Confirmation that obstruction is gastroduodenal by imaging and Upper Digestive
             Endoscopy ( EDA )

          -  Absence of other points of obstruction distal to the gastric tumor

          -  Histological diagnosis of cancer confirmed by biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Refusal to sign the informed consent form

          -  Tumors with indication of curative or palliative resection

          -  Proximal gastric tumors located above the incisura along the lesser curvature

          -  Tumors that invade the greater curvature above the middle third of the stomach

          -  Patients with low clinical performance - ECOG (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group) 3
