      This observational safety follow-up study will enroll subjects from the 802-247-09-032 study
      with the investigational product HP802-247 for venous leg ulcers who received at least one
      application of HP802-247 or Vehicle (Placebo). This study is being done for the following
      purposes:

        1. to identify new adverse events,

        2. to examine ongoing adverse events not resolved in subjects who participated in the
           802-247-09-032 trial,

        3. to record wound status, and

        4. to determine if there are differences in Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL)
           associated with the treatment assignment from the 802-247-09-032 Trial.

      About 440 subjects will participate depending upon subject enrollment from the previous
      study, 802-247-09-032. The study is going to be conducted in approximately 50 sites in
      Europe

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study expects subjects to transition immediately upon exit from the
      802-247-09-032 trial into a longer period of observation, ensuring a total of 12 months of
      safety and wound status data are obtained from the time of the first application of
      HP802-247. This study provides consecutive visits at intervals of 8 weeks until a total of
      12 months of safety follow-up has been achieved, using the date of first application of
      Investigational Medicinal Product as reference start date and the exit from the
      802-247-09-032 trial to determine the number of follow-up visits needed in this study to
      total 12 months of follow-up. Specifically, this study examines all new and unresolved
      ongoing adverse events.
