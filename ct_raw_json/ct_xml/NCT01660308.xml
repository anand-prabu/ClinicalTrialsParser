  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblast froth factors (FGFs) are humoral factors identified by their ability to stimulate
      cell proliferation1. They play different roles in the regulation of cell proliferation,
      differentiation and function. Most FGF family members act as paracrine factors. But FGF19
      subfamily members, including FGF19, 21, and 23, work as endocrine factors to regulate bile
      acid, carbohydrate and phosphate metabolism2. Of these, FGF23 plays an important role in
      phosphate and bone metabolism3. FGF23 gene encodes 251 amino acids, including a 24-amino
      acid signal peptide4. The secreted FGF23 is a protein consisted of 227 amino acids. It works
      by binding to a Klotho-FGF receptor 1c (FGF1c) complex5. FGF suppresses the expression of
      type 2a and 2c sodium-phosphate cotransporters, which mediate phosphate reabsorption in
      proximal tubules.6 FGF23 decreases 25-hydroxyvitamin D-1α-hydroxylase expression and
      enhances 25-hydroxyvitamin D-24-hydroxylase expression6. Therefore, FGF23 reduces serum
      1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D〔1,25(OH)2D〕, which stimulates intestinal calcium and phosphate
      absorption. FGF23 decreases serum phosphate through the above mechanisms FGF23
      over-expression might result in hypophosphatemic rickets and osteomalasia.

      Tumor induced osteomalasia (TIO) is a paraneoplastic syndrome usually caused by benign
      phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors. Symptoms are nonspecific, such as general weakness,
      fatigue, and bone pain. Sometimes fracture may occurs. The responsible tumors are sometimes
      small and difficult to detect. Tumors secrete FGF23. FGF23 reduced phosphate reabsorption in
      the proximal tubules and decrease 1,25(OH)2D levels, which result in hypophosphtemia and
      then osteomalasia.

      The investigators would like to observe the changes of FGF23 in patients who receive
      operation or medical treatment and hope this will benefit future treatment.
