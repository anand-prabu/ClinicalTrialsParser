No study\n      was done in humans with alcoholic liver cirrhosis. The researchers investigated the\n      anti-fibrotic effect of BM-MSCs in alcoholic cirrhosis as Phase II clinical study.\n\n      Methods: Eleven alcoholic cirrhosis patients (M:F = 10:1) with Child-Pugh's class B and\n      maintenance of alcohol abstinence at least 2 months were enrolled. At baseline, all patients\n      received liver biopsy, hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) measurement and serologic\n      tests. BM-MSCs were isolated from each patient's BM and amplified for one month and injected\n      two times at 4, 8week through Rt. hepatic artery. 5x106cells/mL of BM-MSCs were injected in\n      each session. Follow up biopsy, HVPG and relative expression of tissue transforming growth\n      factor-1 (TGF-\u03b21), \u03b1 smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and collagen-1 by real time RT PCR were\n      measured after 12weeks from 2nd BM-MSC injection. The primary outcome was improvement in\n      patients' histology Aim :\n\n      The researchers aimed to evaluate safety and effectiveness of new therapy with bone marrow\n      derived autologous mesenchymal stem cell for hepatic failure caused by alcoholic liver\n      cirrhosis."
