      This is a multi-center, single-arm, non-randomized, prospective clinical study.  The
      clinical study is designed as a non-inferiority study to assess the effectiveness of the
      Aurora Endometrial Ablation System compared to an objective standard.  Safety will be
      evaluated by determining the number and percentage of subjects who experience one or more of
      serious adverse events.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Refractory menorrhagia with no definable organic cause

          2. Female subject from age 25 to 50 years

          3. Uterine sound measurement of 6.0cm to 10.0cm (external os to internal fundus)

          4. One of the following criteria:

             A. Documented history of menorrhagia secondary to dysfunctional uterine bleeding
             (DUB).

             B. If a pictorial blood loss assessment chart (PBLAC) scoring systems is used; a
             minimum PBLAC score of ≥150 for 1 month prior to study enrollment; C. If AH system is
             used a minimum of 160ml/blood loss for 1 month prior to study enrollment

          5. Premenopausal at enrollment as determined by FSH measurement ≤ 40 IU/ml

          6. Not pregnant and no desire to be pregnant in the future

          7. Patient agrees not to use hormonal contraception or any other medical intervention
             for bleeding during the study

          8. Able to provide written informed consent using a form that has been approved by the
             reviewing IRB/EC

          9. Subject agrees to follow-up exams and data collection, including ability to
             accurately use menstrual diaries for PBLAC analysis or the collection of used
             sanitary product for AH analysis

         10. Subject who is literate or demonstrates an understanding on how to use menstrual
             diaries or how to collect and provide used sanitary products for analysis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnancy or subject with a desire to conceive

          2. Endometrial hyperplasia as confirmed by histology

          3. Presence of active endometritis

          4. Active pelvic inflammatory disease

          5. Active sexually transmitted disease (STD), at the time of ablation. Note: Treatment
             of STD documented in the chart serves as sufficient evidence of infection resolution.
             Patient may be considered for study enrollment.

          6. Presence of bacteremia, sepsis, or other active systemic infection

          7. Active infection of the genitals, vagina, cervix, uterus or urinary tract at the time
             of the procedure

          8. Known/suspected gynecological malignancy within the past 5 years

          9. Known clotting defects or bleeding disorders

         10. Untreated/unevaluated cervical dysplasia (except CIN I)

         11. Known/suspected abdominal/pelvic cancer

         12. Prior uterine surgery (except low segment cesarean section) that interrupts the
             integrity of the uterine wall (e.g., myomectomy or classical cesarean section)

         13. Previous endometrial ablation procedure

         14. Currently on medications that could thin the myometrial muscle, such as long-term
             steroid use (except inhaler or nasal therapy for asthma)

         15. Currently on anticoagulants

         16. Abnormal or obstructed cavity as confirmed by hysteroscopy or SIS, specifically:

               1. Septate or bicornuate uterus or other congenital malformation of the uterine
                  cavity

               2. Pedunculated or submucosal myomas distorting the uterine cavity

               3. Polyps likely to be the cause of the subject's menorrhagia

               4. Intramural or subserosal myomas that distort the uterine cavity

         17. Presence of an intrauterine device (IUD) which the patient is unwilling to have
             removed at the time of the operative visit

         18. Presence of an implantable contraceptive device (e.g. Essure or Adiana).

         19. Subject currently on hormonal birth control therapy or unwilling to use a
             non-hormonal birth control post-ablation (including a Mirena device).

         20. Subject who is within 6-weeks post partum.

         21. Any general health condition which, in the opinion of the Investigator, could
             represent an increased risk for the subject

         22. Any subject who is currently participating or considers future participation in any
             other research of an investigational drug or device.
