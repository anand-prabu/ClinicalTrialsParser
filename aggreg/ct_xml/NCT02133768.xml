      To describe the need for re-catheterization and incidence of urological complications of
      routine use of perioperative fixed urinary catheter (KAD)  for up to 24 hours of fast-track
      THA and TKA

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative urinary retention (POUR) is a well known complication of fast-track total hip
      (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA), and even though medical options have been attempted,
      bladder catheterisation remains the only well-documented capacity to prevent and / or treat
      POUR.

      It was previously standard to use fixed urinary catheter (KAD), the first 24-48 hours
      postoperatively to prevent POUR by THA and TKA, while more recent studies now recommend
      intermittent urinary catheterization in the postoperative period.

      However, there are no detailed studies with adequate follow-up, describing the consequences
      of using either one or the other treatment regimen of POUR by fast-track THA and TKA.

      Purpose:

      To describe the need for re-catheterization and incidence of urological complications of
      routine use of perioperative fixed urinary catheter (KAD,catheter a demure)  for up to 24
      hours of fast-track THA and TKA

      End Points:

        1. The number of patients in need of re-catheterization due POUR

        2. The number of patients in which the removal of KAD was not carried out within 24 hours.

        3. The number of urinary tract infections from surgery to postoperative day (POD) 30

        4. The number of patients with new-onset urinary discomfort at POD 30 (Increase in IPSS
           score).

        5. The number of urological-related readmissions (including urosepsis) within POD 30

        Participating patients may help to clarify the consequences of using fixed bladder
        catheterisation of patients undergoing planned deployment of an artificial hip or knee.
        This will provide a basis to compare the effects of these practices with other treatment
        regimens, such as. intermittent once-bladder catheterisation in the postoperative period,
        which may contribute to the prevention and treatment of POUR can be optimized for all
        patients.

        The study is conducted as a non-interventional, observational study and all participants
        will receive the department's standard treatment.
