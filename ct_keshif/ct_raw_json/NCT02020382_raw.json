Difficulties in the management of IBD are related to the need for\n      invasive tests for the diagnosis of IBD (endoscopy), partly explaining the delay in\n      diagnosis, and the inability to distinguish early colonic Crohn's disease of ulcerative\n      colitis (UC) in 10-30% of cases.\n\n      Recently, we identified real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), from healthy colonic\n      mucosa of IBD patients, a molecular signature of IBD involving 10 microRNA (miRNA) Common\n      (miR26a, miR29a, miR29b, miR126 * miR15a, miR127-3p, miR324 -3p, miR30c, miR185, miR196a)\n      and 15 colic chronic disease (MC) and ulcerative colitis (RCH) discriminating microRNA\n      (miR-142-3p, miR-142-5p, miR-146a, miR-146b-5p, miR150, miR-181d, miR-182, miR199a -3p,\n      miR199a-5p, miR199b-5p, miR-203, miR223, miR-299-5p, miR320a, miR-328).\n\n      TYPE OF STUDY : multicenter diagnostic evaluation Study\n\n      MAIN PURPOSE OF THE STUDY : To evaluate the diagnostic value of microRNA in colonic IBD\n      (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease) in adults as compared to healthy controls (and\n      non-IBD colitis)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES :\n\n        -  assess the ability of microRNA to discriminate a colic chronic disease (MC)  of\n           ulcerative colitis (RCH) in adults\n\n        -  evaluate the diagnostic value of microRNA in inflammatory colitis child\n\n        -  explore the possibility of measuring miRNA of interest in the stool\n\n      PRODUCTS OF THE STUDY diagnostic kit of IBD in quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)\n\n      NUMBER OF PATIENTS : 6 groups of 50 patients each will be included\n\n        -  Group 1: Crohn adult colic\n\n        -  Group 2: ulcerative colitis (RCH) adults\n\n        -  Group 3: Witnesses healthy adults\n\n        -  Group 4: Witnesses adults with non-IBD inflammation\n\n        -  Group 5: Children with colitis\n\n        -  Group 6 : Witnesses healthy children\n\n      INCLUSION LENGTH 30 months\n\n      DURATION OF THE STUDY 30 months"
