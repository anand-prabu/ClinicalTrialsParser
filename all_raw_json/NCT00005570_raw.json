Blood samples will also be stored if separately agreed to by the\n      patient for analysis of genes that might affect platelet production.  At a single outpatient\n      clinic visit, patients will have a medical history taken, and blood samples drawn for\n      testing.  Results from this study may help further understand the control of platelet\n      production in patients with ITP, and suggest new therapeutic approaches."
