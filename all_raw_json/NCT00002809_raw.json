Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy together with bone marrow transplant may\n      allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving bone marrow transplant from an\n      unrelated donor together with cyclophosphamide and total-body irradiation works in treating\n      patients with hematologic cancer."

Patients then undergo allogeneic bone marrow transplantation.\n      Filgrastim (G-CSF) is given after transplant to accelerate engraftment. Sargramostim\n      (GM-CSF) may be given in case of graft failure.\n\n      All patients receive graft-versus-host-disease (GVHD) prophylaxis with tacrolimus,\n      methotrexate, and gamma globulin. Established GVHD is treated with corticosteroids and, as\n      necessary, antithymocyte globulin.\n\n      Patients are followed at 100 days, 6 months, and 1 year after transplant, then annually\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10 patients per year will be accrued for this study over 5\n      years."
