            "textblock": "Removable false teeth (called removable partial dentures (RPDs)) are commonly made for\n      people with missing teeth.\n\n      RPDs are made out of a framework and the replacement teeth/gum. The framework sits on the\n      teeth and the gums and can be made out of different materials, metal or non-metal, with\n      different properties. The plastic teeth and gum sit on the framework.\n\n      A common framework material is cobalt chromium, a rigid, non-precious metal alloy. Other\n      framework materials include titanium and non-metal materials such as medical grade\n      polyetheretherketone (PEEK).\n\n      A review of the literature shows that no research has been reported investigating how\n      different RPD framework materials impact on a person's oral health related quality of life\n      (OHQoL). The sensation that different frameworks have in the mouth can be quite varied\n      between people, and it would be relevant to be able to tell patients which type of framework\n      is better tolerated based on research evidence.\n\n      We hope to conduct an un-blinded randomised crossover pilot trial investigating the\n      difference in patient preference and oral health related quality of life measured by patient\n      centred outcomes in a group of patients due to receive tooth supported removable partial\n      dentures at the Charles Clifford Dental Hospital."
