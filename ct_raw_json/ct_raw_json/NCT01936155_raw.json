Stimulation is to be applied every 20 seconds over a period of 90 minutes. Its affect on oedema reduction, joint mobility and skin oxygenation will be assessed both before and after its application."

The\n      participant will be allowed to ramp up the stimulus level themselves to get used to the\n      sensation and determine their maximum tolerated stimulus level.\n\n      A goniometer will be used to assess mobility at the knee and ankle joints. Transcutaneous\n      oxygen measurements (tcpO2) will be assessed using the PERIMED Periflux System 500 tcpO2\n      monitor.\n\n      The level of oedema will be measured using the figure of eight measurement, tape\n      circumference measurement and water displacement measurement.\n\n      Comfort will also be assessed by use of a 100mm non-hatched visual analogue scale (VAS).\n      Each participant will be asked to indicate their level of comfort following the application\n      of NMES. VAS pain scores of 30 mm or less will be categorised as mild pain, between 31 and\n      69 mm as moderate pain, and scores of 70 mm or greater as severe pain."
