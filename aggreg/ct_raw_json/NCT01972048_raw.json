Using the Fogg Behavioral Model this study\n      proposes to develop a mobile phone-based intervention designed to motivate KA women to\n      undergo an annual mammogram (mMammogram). The overall study aim is to develop and assess the\n      feasibility and effectiveness of a 7-day long mMammogram intervention designed to persuade\n      KA women to undergo breast cancer screening."
