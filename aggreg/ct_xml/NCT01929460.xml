  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that a single dose of antibiotics at time of EUS-guided pancreatic cyst
      aspiration is equally effective to the usual regimen of 3 days of post-procedural
      antibiotics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the increased use of cross sectional imaging, there appears to be an increasing
      prevalence of pancreatic cysts being incidentally discovered.

      A critical step in the workup of pancreas cysts is to determine whether the cyst is mucinous
      or non-mucinous, through a procedure called endoscopic ultrasound - fine needle aspiration
      (EUS-FNA).

      Current guidelines suggest the use of antibiotics in cyst aspiration, usually 3 days after
      the procedure.  However, these recommendations are based on limited data from over 15 years
      ago.  More recent retrospective observations suggest equivalent safety when little, or even
      no antibiotics are given.
