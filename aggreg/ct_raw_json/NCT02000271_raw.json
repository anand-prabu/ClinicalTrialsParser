Patients often complain of discomfort associated with the packing or its\n      removal.\n\n      This randomized controlled trial seeks to document differences in subjective impressions of\n      pain in women undergoing vaginal repairs treated with and without packing.  The\n      investigators also aim to assess differences in postoperative fluid collection in those with\n      and without packing."
