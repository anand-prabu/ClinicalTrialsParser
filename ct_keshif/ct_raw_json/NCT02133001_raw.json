It has particular utility as an indirect indicator of suicidal risk in depressed examinees or individuals who have made suicide attempts. It consists of 20 true-false items that examine the respondent's attitude over the past week by either endorsing a pessimistic statement or denying an optimistic statement; 9 are keyed false and 11 are keyed true. These items fall within 3 domains: (1) feelings about the future; (2) loss of motivation; and (3) future expectations. For every statement, each response is assigned a score of 0 or 1. The total BHS score is a sum of item responses and can range from 0 to 20, with a higher score representing a higher level of hopelessness. Total scores that range from 0 to 3 are considered within the normal range, scores 4 to 8 identify mild hopelessness, scores 9 to 14 identify moderate hopelessness, and scores greater than 14 identify severe hopelessness.",
