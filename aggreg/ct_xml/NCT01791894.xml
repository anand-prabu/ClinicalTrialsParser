      This pilot clinical trial studies arsenic trioxide in treating patients with basal cell
      carcinoma. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as arsenic trioxide, work in different ways to
      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stop them from dividing

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether administration of arsenic trioxide (ATO) to patients with basal cell
      carcinoma is associated with a reduction in Gli messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) and
      protein levels in tumor biopsy samples, when compared to baseline levels.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether there is evidence of tumor size reduction of ATO against basal cell
      carcinoma in humans.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive arsenic trioxide intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on days 1-5. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
