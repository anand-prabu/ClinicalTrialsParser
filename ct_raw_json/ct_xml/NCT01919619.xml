      The goal of this clinical research study is to study the safety of REVLIMID® (lenalidomide)
      when given with YERVOY® (ipilimumab) after a stem cell transplant.  Researchers also want to
      find out if lenalidomide given with ipilimumab may help to control leukemia and lymphoma.

      Study Groups:

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose level of
      lenalidomide based on when you join this study and whether any intolerable side effects were
      seen in previous participants. Two (2) dose levels of lenalidomide will be tested. The first
      group of 3 participants will receive the higher dose level of lenalidomide.  If intolerable
      side effects are seen in the first 3 participants, the remaining participants will receive a
      lower dose of lenalidomide.

      All participants will receive the same dose of ipilimumab.

      Study Drug Administration:

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      Lenalidomide:

      On Days 1-21 of Cycles 1 and 3, you will take lenalidomide by mouth once a day. You should
      take lenalidomide at the same time each day.  You should swallow the lenalidomide capsules
      whole with water.  Do not open, crush, or break the lenalidomide capsules.  If you touch a
      broken lenalidomide capsule, wash the area of your body with soap and water.

      On Days 22-28 of Cycles 1 and 3, you will rest (not receive lenalidomide).

      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, and it has been less than 12 hours since your regular
      dose time, take it as soon as you remember. If it has been more than 12 hours, just skip
      your missed dose. Do not take 2 doses at the same time.  If you take too much lenalidomide,
      call your healthcare provider right away.  If you vomit after any dose, do not take another
      dose.

      Ipilimumab:

      About 1 to 3 days after the 7-day rest period after your last dose of lenalidomide in Cycles
      1 and 3, you will receive ipilimumab by vein over 90 minutes.  About 4 weeks after each
      ipilimumab infusion, you will start taking lenalidomide as described above.

      You will be given a study drug diary.  You will use this diary to write down what time you
      take each dose of lenalidomide.  You need to bring the study drug diary to every study visit
      so the study staff can review it.

      You will be given standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may ask the
      study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.

      Study Visits:

      Before Cycles 1 and 3:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to your kidney and
           liver function.

      On about Day 14 of Cycles 1 and 3, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine
      tests.

      Before Cycles 2 and 4:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal
           gland, pituitary gland, kidney, liver, and thyroid function.

        -  You will have an eye exam to check for side effects, if your doctor thinks it is
           needed.

        -  If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of
           graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). You were told about GVHD at the time of being
           prepared for transplant.  GVHD may cause skin rashes, diarrhea, abdominal cramping,
           and/or damage to the liver, lung, eyes, mouth, skin, joints, gastrointestinal tract,
           and/or muscles.  It may result in jaundice (yellowing of the skin and/or eyes).

      Pregnancy Tests:

      If you can become pregnant, you will have pregnancy counseling and testing as long as you
      are taking lenalidomide.  Blood (about ½ teaspoon) or urine will be collected for a
      pregnancy test at the following times:

        -  around 10-14 days before your first dose of lenalidomide

        -  up to 24 hours before your first dose of lenalidomide

        -  one (1) time a week for the first 4 weeks that you take lenalidomide

        -  one (1) time every 4 weeks after that

      If your periods are irregular, blood (about ½ teaspoon) will be drawn for a pregnancy test 2
      weeks after your first dose of lenalidomide and again 28 days after your last dose of
      lenalidomide.

      Length of Study:

      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 4 cycles.  You may be taken off the study
      drugs early if the disease gets worse, if you have any intolerable side effects, if you are
      unable to follow study directions, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or if
      the study is stopped.

      Your participation on the study will be over after the follow-up visits.

      Follow-up Visits:

      After your last dose of ipilimumab, and then about 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months later:

        -  You will have a physical exam.

        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to check your adrenal
           gland, pituitary gland, kidney, and liver function.

        -  If you received an allogeneic stem cell transplant, you will be checked for signs of
           GVHD.

      This is an investigational study.  Ipilimumab is FDA approved and commercially available for
      the treatment of melanoma.  Lenalidomide is FDA approved and commercially available for the
      treatment of myeloma. The use of ipilimumab in combination with lenalidomide after a stem
      cell transplant for leukemia and lymphoma is considered investigational and is being used
      for research purposes only.

      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson.
