            "textblock": "Procrastination is defined as a voluntarily delay of an intended course of action despite\n      expecting to be worse-off for the delay, and is considered a persistent behavior pattern\n      that can result in major psychological suffering. About one-fifth of the adult population\n      and half of the student population are presumed having substantial difficulties due to\n      recurrent procrastination in their everyday life. However, chronic and severe\n      procrastinators seldom receive adequate care due to preconceptions and the lack of\n      understanding regarding procrastination and the treatment interventions that are assumed\n      beneficial. Cognitive behavior therapy is often deemed treatment of choice, although the\n      evidence supporting its use is scarce, and only one randomized controlled trial has been\n      performed. The primary aim of the current study is therefore to test the efficacy of\n      cognitive behavior therapy delivered as either a group intervention or via the Internet.\n      Participants will consist of students recruited through the Student Health Centre at\n      Karolinska Institutet. A randomized controlled trial with a sample size of 100 participants\n      divided into two conditions will be employed; a ten week Internet-based cognitive behavior\n      therapy intervention, and an eight week group intervention based on cognitive behavior\n      therapy. The current study is believed to result in two important findings. First, different\n      interventions inherent in cognitive behavior therapy are assumed to be helpful for people\n      suffering from problems caused by procrastination. Second, both a group intervention and an\n      Internet-based cognitive behavior therapy intervention are presumed suitable for\n      administering treatment for procrastination, which is considered highly important as the\n      availability of adequate care is limited, particularly among students. The current study\n      will increase the knowledge regarding the efficacy of different treatments of\n      procrastination, as well as enhance the overall comprehension of the difficulties related to\n      dilatory behavior."
