Given the synergism of taxanes with gemcitabine, fluoropyrimidines and\n      platinating agents the role of nab-Paclitaxel in a 4-drug regimen will be explored.\n\n      The aim of this trial is to determine the recommended dose of nab-paclitaxel in combination\n      with cisplatin, capecitabine, and gemcitabine, PAXG regimen (Phase I), and to evaluate the\n      feasibility and the activity of the PAXG regimen in patients with stage III and IV\n      pancreatic cancer."
