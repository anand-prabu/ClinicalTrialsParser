            "textblock": "Increasing evidence suggests pancreatic islet beta-cell regeneration occurs throughout the\n      course of the disease in patients with type 1 diabetes. Therefore, decreased beta-cell mass\n      in type 1 diabetes may be improved through inhibition of beta-cell destruction and\n      stimulation of proliferation, even after prolonged duration of disease.\n\n      Physical activity improves insulin secretion via unknown underlying mechanisms. We recently\n      observed that Interleukin-6 induces glucagon like Peptide (GLP)-1 production and release\n      from the islet alpha-cell and the intestinal L-cell. Furthermore, exercise induces release\n      of Interleukin-6 from skeletal muscle resulting in elevated circulating Interleukin-6\n      levels. Therefore we hypothesize that exercise-induced Interleukin-6 promotes glucagon like\n      peptide-1 secretion from the islet \u03b1-cell and the intestinal L-cell, thereby providing a\n      mechanism how physical activity can help maintain and improve beta-cell function in patients\n      with type 1 diabetes. This mechanism can be enhanced by concomitant dipeptidyl peptidase-IV\n      inhibition.\n\n      Physical activity is also known to enhance insulin sensitivity and to attenuate the immune\n      system activity.\n\n      Therefore by combining physical activity and dipeptidyl peptidase-IV inhibition we aim to\n      allow for beta-cell regeneration in a interventional randomized open-label study."
