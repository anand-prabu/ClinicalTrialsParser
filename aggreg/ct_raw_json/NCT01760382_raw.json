From 2011 a regional STEMI network have\n      been formally activated in Piedmont. The aim of our registry is to monitor the activity of\n      the STEMI network in the large suburban area of Novara (population of about 800.000\n      subjects).\n\n      Novara STEMI network depends on the 118 service (the same of 911 in USA). When a call for\n      suspected MI is processed, an Ambulance capable of transmitting a 12D ECG to the Hub Center\n      is sent to the patient domicile. If the ECG and history suggest STEMI and transport time\n      <90min, the patient is given aspirin and sent to Hub Hospital for primary PCI. If transport\n      time is estimated >90min thrombolysis with TNK is performed in ambulance and the patient is\n      sent to Hub Hospital for rescue PCI or re-evaluation in case of reperfusion.\n\n      Inclusion criteria: all patients with STEMI admitted to Novara Hospital (3rd level Hub with\n      Cardiac Surgery Facility). No exclusion criteria.\n\n      Patients will be divided for comparisons in 2 groups (Group A: people admitted to hospital\n      through the STEMI network. Group B: people admitted for STEMI through the Emergency\n      department of the Novara Hospital or via secondary trasports regulated by Spoke Hospitals).\n\n      Quality factors: recording of time from symptoms onset and 1st medical contact, time from\n      1st medical contact and coronary angiography (door to needle time) and time from 1st medical\n      contact and mechanical reperfusion (door to balloon time), angiographic indexes of\n      reperfusion (baseline and postprocedural TIMI flow, blush grade, corrected TIMI frame\n      count), trends for ST elevation resolution,trends for troponin and CK-MB dismission,\n      baseline and postprocedural echocardiography. Clinical outcomes will be successful\n      reperfusion, in-hospital cardiac mortality, in-hospital reinfarction and in-hospital stent\n      thrombosis. Moreover patients will be followed up clinically for at least 1 year (outcomes:\n      cardiac mortality, reinfarction, symptoms/ischemia driven target vessel revascularization)."
