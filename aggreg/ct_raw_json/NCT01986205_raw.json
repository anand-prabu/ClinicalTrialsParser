These individuals will be randomized\n      to receive either oxygen or air in a pressurized hyperbaric chamber. Participants will\n      receive 40 daily hyperbaric chamber sessions.\n\n      Participants will have a series of tests and questionnaires before they begin their chamber\n      sessions, after they complete 40 sessions, and 12 months after they joined the study. These\n      tests include computer-based and pencil-and-paper questionnaires and thinking tests, brain\n      imaging, a neurological examination, and an eye exam. Participants will also be asked to\n      provide blood for future research."

Chamber sessions\n      will be provided Monday through Friday, excluding holidays, and participants will have up to\n      12 weeks to complete their 40 sessions.\n\n      Participants will be evaluated before the chamber sessions, at 13 weeks, and at 12 months.\n      Assessments include self-administered questionnaires, neuropsychological function,\n      neuroimaging, a brief neurological examination, and a neuro-optometry evaluation.  These\n      outcome tools will measure symptoms and deficit at the time of enrollment and subsequent\n      evaluations, and provide insight into whether hyperbaric oxygen can play a role in recovery\n      from mild traumatic brain in-jury.\n\n      Participants will be asked to provide blood for long-term storage of serum, plasma, and DNA\n      for future investigations."
