  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of an introduction to the
      occupation-based theory (MOHO) on the clinical reasoning of therapists working with cancer
      clients.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will occur at MDACC, a comprehensive cancer center in the Texas Medical Center
      (TMC) in Houston. The center is the largest freestanding comprehensive cancer center in the
      world. The facility provides inpatient and outpatient services and supports research and
      education.

      The facility has more than 50 buildings in the greater Houston area and in central Texas.
      The setting for this study will be the rehabilitation services area on the main campus in
      the TMC.

      There are private offices, conference rooms and treatment areas where video chats and
      monthly meetings will occur.

      The study is projected to occur over a one year period. Sessions will be videotaped (video
      chats - initial and follow ups and monthly group meetings) for further review. Analysis of
      the tapes will provide data for further research and education presentations. Sessions will
      also be audiotaped and transcribed for further review and data analysis purposes. Neither
      the videotapes nor audiotapes will be shared with anyone at the facility or any uninvolved
      parties. Audiotapes and videotapes will be stored in locked file cabinets and password
      protected computers will be used to view and analyze the audio and video tapes. Only the
      research team will have access to the stored data locked in the file cabinet.

    <description>The study will begin with a video chat (20-30 minutes) to attain a baseline of participants understanding of MOHO. An initial video chat interview guide (Appendix B) will be used to facilitate the chat session and a training session on MOHO concepts (4-8 hours) will also be held (Appendix F). The training session is a 6 part overview of the MOHO framework. All following video chats will be conducted using the follow up video chat interview guide (Appendix C). There will be 8 follow up video chat sessions (20-30 minutes) occurring every 6 weeks after the initial training session on MOHO concepts. Video chat sessions will be facilitated by a research team member. There will be 12 monthly group meetings (60-90 minutes) with all participants to allow a time to discuss use of MOHO in practice and troubleshoot issues and offer support in a formal manner. The monthly group meeting will be facilitated by the PI and/or an onsite collaborator. The maximum possible time commitment stands at 1830</description>

        Participants will be outpatient-focused therapists working within the MD Anderson Cancer
        Center. Participants must have worked in this setting for at least 90 days before the
        study begins and will self-select to participate in the study. Recruitment of therapists
        at the MDACC will involve an introduction of the study by an onsite collaborator. The
        onsite collaborator will gather the names of individuals interested in participating in
        the study. Then, an onsite collaborator and PI will work together to determine if the
        therapists meet the inclusion criteria for the study. Once the therapists are determined
        to meet inclusion criteria, an invitation for participation will be extended by an onsite
        collaborator.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        No training in MOHO constructs,English speaking.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Training in using MOHO concepts in practice, highly skilled in use of MOHO, and
        non-English speaking. If a therapist is skilled and knowledgeable of the constructs of
        MOHO, there will be no way to determine if introduction of the model has impacted a
        therapist's clinical reasoning. All the materials used for the study will be in English
        and analysis of data will be conducted by English speaking individuals, therefore the
        study participants must speak English.
