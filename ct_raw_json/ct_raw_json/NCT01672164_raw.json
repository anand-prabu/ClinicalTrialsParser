Researchers will examine\n      blood, urine, and tissue samples and try to identify markers for certain conditions such as\n      rejection, response to therapy, and scarring of the liver.  Additionally, researchers would\n      like to identify biomarkers that can detect damage to the native kidneys before blood levels\n      of creatinine rises.  By studying gene expression, researchers hope to be able to diagnose\n      these conditions earlier and improve liver survival."
