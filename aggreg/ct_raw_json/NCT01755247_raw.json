The test product will be applied to the forehead of\n      healthy volunteers once daily for 3 days.  One group of subjects will have a moisturizer\n      applied to the same area 15 minutes after the test gel was applied and one group of subjects\n      will be treated with the gel vehicle which does not contain the active product.   The\n      hypothesis is that the application of moisturizer will not effect safety or local\n      tolerability."
