Patients with low-risk disease are assigned to group\n      A, while patients with high-risk disease are assigned to group B.\n\n      Group A (low-risk group):\n\n        -  Patients receive 3 courses of the CODOX-M chemotherapy regimen comprising\n           cyclophosphamide IV on days 1-5, vincristine IV on days 1 and 8, doxorubicin IV on day\n           1, and methotrexate (MTX) IV over 24 hours on day 10. Patients over age 65 receive\n           reduced-dose MTX on day 10. All patients receive leucovorin calcium (CF) IV once at\n           hour 36 after initiation of MTX infusion, once every 3 hours between hours 36-48, and\n           continuing once every 6 hours until blood levels of MTX are safe. Patients also receive\n           filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) once daily beginning on day 13 and continuing\n           until blood counts recover.\n\n        -  During all 3 courses of the CODOX-M regimen, patients receive CNS prophylaxis\n           comprising cytarabine (ARA-C) intrathecally (IT) on days 1 and 3, MTX IT on day 15, and\n           oral CF (24 hours after IT MTX) on day 16.\n\n      Group B (high-risk group):\n\n        -  Patients receive the CODOX-M chemotherapy regimen (as above) alternating with the IVAC\n           chemotherapy regimen (as defined below) for a total of 4 courses given in the following\n           sequence: CODOX-M, IVAC, CODOX-M, and IVAC. The IVAC chemotherapy regimen comprises\n           ifosfamide (IFF) IV over 1 hour and etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and ARA-C IV\n           over 3 hours on days 1 and 2. Patients over age 65 receive reduced-dose IFF and ARA-C.\n           Patients also receive G-CSF SC once daily beginning on day 7 and continuing until blood\n           counts recover.\n\n        -  During IVAC, patients without CNS disease receive MTX IT on day 5 and oral CF (24 hours\n           after MTX). Patients with proven CNS disease receive intensified IT therapy throughout\n           the first two courses of CODOX-M/IVAC chemotherapy.\n\n      For patients in group B with CNS disease at diagnosis, radiotherapy is only considered in\n      the presence of a cerebral mass documented by CT scan or MRI. Patients in group A or B who\n      develop isolated CNS recurrence (documented by malignant CSF pleocytosis, cranial nerve\n      palsies, or both) at any time after the first course of study therapy receive the same CNS\n      treatment (as above) as patients with proven CNS disease in addition to whole brain\n      irradiation for 3 weeks.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 4 months, every 2 months for 8 months, every 3 months for\n      1 year, every 4 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 120 patients (30 with low-risk disease and 90 with high-risk\n      disease) will be accrued for this study within approximately 3-4 years."
