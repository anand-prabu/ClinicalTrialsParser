This study will evaluate the effect of three\n      doses of GSK1265744 on the QT duration corrected for heart rate (QTc) interval as compared\n      to placebo. Moxifloxacin will be used as a positive control in order to validate the\n      sensitivity of the study in detecting QTc change. This study consists of three treatment\n      periods (each separated by 21 day washout period) followed by follow-up visit 10 to 14 days\n      post last dosing. The total duration of study including follow-up visit will be\n      approximately 62 days.
