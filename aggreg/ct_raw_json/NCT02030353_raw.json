            "textblock": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among African American women in the\n      United States, and in North Carolina (NC), African American women are more likely to die\n      from breast cancer compared to women of other races/ethnicities. Given this disparity and\n      with approximately 90,000 African American breast cancer survivors in NC, it is important to\n      identify modifiable factors that can help improve survival among this population. Behavioral\n      interventions that promote weight management among breast cancer survivors can help reduce\n      risks for prevalent comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, and\n      potentially improve prognosis and survival. While lifestyle interventions have shown promise\n      in improving body weight in breast cancer survivors, none have focused on weight gain\n      prevention in African American breast cancer survivors, nor evaluated the use of frequent\n      self-weighing as a self-regulation strategy.\n\n      Regular self-weighing has been effectively used as an approach for weight maintenance that\n      helps individuals monitor daily weight fluctuations and make small changes in energy balance\n      behaviors. Given that the frequency of self-weighing among breast cancer survivors is\n      unknown, and the importance of self-regulation behaviors for weight maintenance is well\n      established, extending previous work to prevent weight gain among breast cancer survivors is\n      a critical next step for optimizing cancer outcomes. It is unknown whether self-weighing and\n      activity monitoring is a feasible strategy for breast cancer survivors to monitor weight\n      changes and regulate their energy balance. Thus, this three-arm, pilot randomized controlled\n      trial will evaluate two behavioral self-regulation interventions for weight gain prevention\n      (self-regulation or self-regulation plus activity monitoring) compared to a delayed control\n      group among 45 female African-American post-treatment breast cancer survivors. Participants\n      will be randomly assigned to one of three groups: Self-regulation intervention with activity\n      monitoring (n=15); Self-regulation intervention (n=15); and Delayed control (n=15)."
