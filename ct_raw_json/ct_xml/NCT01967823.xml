    <textblock>
      Background:

      The NCI Surgery Branch has developed an experimental therapy for treating patients with
      cancer that involves taking white blood cells from the patient, growing them in the
      laboratory in large numbers, genetically modifying them, and then giving the cells back to
      the patient. In a previous study the NCI Surgery Branch used the anti-ESO-1 gene and a type
      of virus (retrovirus) to make these tumor fighting cells (anti-ESO-1 cells). About half of
      the patients who received this treatment experienced shrinking of their tumors.  In this
      study, we are using a slightly different method of producing the anti-ESO-1 cells which we
      hope will be better in making the tumors shrink.

      Objectives:

      The purpose of this study is to see if these tumor fighting cells (genetically modified
      cells) that express the receptor for the ESO-1 molecule on their surface can cause tumors to
      shrink and to see if this treatment is safe.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults 18 years old and older with cancer that has the ESO-1 molecule on their tumors.

      Design:

        -  Work up stage: Patients will be seen as an outpatient at the NIH clinical Center and
           undergo a history and physical examination, scans, x-rays, lab tests, and other tests
           as needed

        -  Leukapheresis: If the patients meet all of the requirements for the study they will
           undergo leukapheresis to obtain white blood cells to make the anti ESO-1 cells.
           {Leukapheresis is a common procedure which removes only the white blood cells from the
           patient.}

        -  Treatment: Once their cells have grown the patients will be admitted to the hospital
           for the conditioning chemotherapy, the anti-ESO 1 cells and aldesleukin.  They will
           stay in the hospital for about 1-2 weeks to recover from the treatment.

        -  Patients will return to the clinic for a physical exam, review of side effects, lab
           tests, and scans about every 1-3 months for the first year, and then every 6 months to
           1 year as long as their tumors are shrinking.

      PRECIS

      Background:

        -  We have constructed a single retroviral vector that contains both    and  &lt;= chains of
           a murine T cell receptor (mTCR) that recognizes the NY-ESO-1 (ESO) tumor antigen, which
           can be used to mediate genetic transfer of this TCR with high efficiency.

        -  In co-cultures with HLA-A2 and ESO double positive tumors, anti-ESO mTCR transduced T
           cells secreted significant amounts of IFN- &gt;= with high specificity.

      Objectives:

      Primary objectives:

      -To determine whether the administration of anti-ESO mTCR-engineered peripheral blood
      lymphocytes (PBL) plus high-dose aldesleukin following a non-myeloablative lymphoid
      depleting preparative regimen may result in objective tumor regression in patients with
      metastatic cancers that express the ESO antigen.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine the in vivo survival of mTCR gene-engineered cells.

        -  Determine the toxicity profile of this treatment regimen.

      Eligibility:

      Patients who are HLA-A*0201 positive and 18 years of age or older must have

        -  Metastatic cancer other than melanoma whose tumors express the ESO antigen;

        -  Patients must have previously received and have been a non-responder to or recurred
           after receiving standard care for metastatic disease;

      Patients may not have:

      -Contraindications for high dose aldesleukin administration.

      Design:

        -  PBMC obtained by leukapheresis will be cultured in the presence of anti-CD3 (OKT3) and
           aldesleukin in order to stimulate T-cell growth.

        -  Transduction is initiated by exposure of cells to retroviral vector supernatant
           containing the anti- ESO mTCR genes. This mTCR targets the exact same epitope as the
           hTCR.

        -  All patients will receive a non-myeloablative lymphocyte depleting preparative regimen
           of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine.

        -  On day 0 patients will receive anti-ESO mTCR gene-transduced PBMC and then begin high
           dose aldesleukin.

        -  A complete evaluation of evaluable lesions will be conducted 6 weeks (+/- 2 weeks)
           following the administration of the cell product.

        -  The study will be conducted using a phase II optimal design (Simon R, Controlled
           Clinical Trials 10:1-10, 1989). The objective will be to determine if the combination
           of high dose aldesleukin, lymphocyte depleting chemotherapy, and anti-ESO TCR-gene
           engineered lymphocytes is able to be associated with a clinical response rate that can
           rule out 5% (p0=0.05) in favor of a modest 20% PR + CR rate (p1=0.20).

        -  A total of up to 43 patients may be enrolled (41, plus allowing for up to 2
           non-evaluable patients).

             Note: Patients may have undergone minor surgical procedures within the past 3 weeks,
             as long as all toxicities have recovered to grade 1 or less or as specified in the
             eligibility criteria.

          6. Six weeks must have elapsed from the time of any antibody therapy that could affect
             an anti cancer immune response, including anti-CTLA 4 therapy, at the time the
             patient receives the preparative regimen to allow antibody levels to decline.

        Note: Patients who have previously received ipilimumab and have documented GI toxicity
        must have a normal colonoscopy with normal colonic biopsies.

        INCLUSION CRITERIA

        PATIENTS WITH MALIGNANT MENINGIOMA

          1. Histologically proven recurrent meningioma or aggressive meningioma

             Note: Confirmation of ESO expression and pathology is not required in patients with
             definitive radiologic evidence of meningioma who are unresectable, and in whom
             radiation therapy without biopsy is the standard treatment

          2. Recurrent disease/progression after receiving all standard treatments, which must
             include the following:

               -  surgical resection, if possible;

             imaging

             in the blood

          8. Serology:

               -  Seronegative for HIV antibody. (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
                  this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who are HIV
                  seropositive can have decreased immune-competence and thus be less responsive to
                  the experimental treatment and more susceptible to its toxicities.)

                  If hepatitis C antibody test is positive, then patient must be tested for the
                  presence of antigen by RT-PCR and be HCV RNA negative.

          9. Women of child-bearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus.

               -  Serum creatinine less than or equal to 1.6 mg/dl

               -  Total bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 mg/dl, except in patients with Gilbert
                    s Syndrome who must have a total bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dl.

        EXCLUSION CRITERIA

          1. Women of child-bearing potential who are pregnant or breastfeeding because of the
             potentially dangerous effects of the treatment on the fetus or infant.

          2. Any form of primary immunodeficiency (such as Severe Combined Immunodeficiency
             Disease).

             the cardiovascular, respiratory or immune system, myocardial infarction, cardiac
             arrhythmias, obstructive or restrictive pulmonary disease.

          4. Concurrent opportunistic infections (The experimental treatment being evaluated in
             this protocol depends on an intact immune system. Patients who have decreased immune
             competence may be less responsive to the experimental treatment and more susceptible
             to its toxicities).

          5. Concurrent systemic steroid therapy.

          6. History of severe immediate hypersensitivity reaction to any of the agents used in
             this study.

          7. History of coronary revascularization or ischemic symptoms

          8. Documented LVEF of less than or equal to 45%. Testing is required in patients with:

               -  Clinically significant atrial and/or ventricular arrhythmias including but not
