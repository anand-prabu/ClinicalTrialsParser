  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Low levels of cardiorespiratory fitness are associated with high risk of
      non-communicable diseases and all-cause mortality. Physical activity level is the primary
      determinant of cardiorespiratory fitness in adults. However, knowledge on how to motivate
      people to engage in physical activity and maintain an active lifestyle is lacking. This
      study aims to investigate whether a motivational, individual, and locally anchored exercise
      intervention, in primary care, can improve cardiorespiratory fitness in 30 to 49 year olds
      with a low or very low cardiorespiratory fitness.

      Design: Randomised controlled trial with 6 and 12 months follow-up. The primary outcome is
      cardiorespiratory fitness. Secondary outcomes include biochemical parameters (HbA1C, HDL-
      and LDL-cholesterol, and triglyceride), physical activity level (measured by accelerometer),
      self-reported physical activity, anthropometric parameters and health-related quality of
      life.

      Methods: Cardiorespiratory fitness will be estimated via a maximal incremental exercise test
      and expressed as the index of maximum oxygen uptake per minute divided by body weight (ml
      O2/kg/min). A total of 236 participants, classified with a very low or low cardiorespiratory
      fitness at a local health check programme, (corresponding to ≤ 39 and ≤35 ml O2/kg/min. for
      30-39 and 40-49 year-old men respectively and ≤33 and ≤31 ml O2/kg/min. for 30-39 and 40-49
      year-old women respectively), will be randomised into two groups. The intervention group
      will receive 4 motivational interviews, six months membership to a sport club, and a global
      positioning watch to upload training activity to a social media. The comparison group will
      receive standard care: a one hour motivational interview.  In addition to an
      Intention-to-treat analysis a per-protocol analysis will be performed. Effect of the
      intervention will be estimated by evaluating the differences in mean changes in
      cardiorespiratory fitness between the two groups.

      Discussion:In new and innovative ways the focus of this study will be to improve
      cardiorespiratory fitness among a 30-49 year-old at-risk group using social media,
      GPS-technology, on-going personal support and individually tailored physical activity.

    <description>The outcome is measured by an indirectly standardized and validated max imalergometer bicycle test. The bicycle is cycled at 100 watt (women 70 watt). Every second minute the load is increased by 35 watt until the load causes fatigue.  The highest load achieved, the time spent cycling at the highest load and the weight of the participant are put into a formula and the CRF is estimated</description>
