  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic exposure to (cigarette smoke) CS causes biological changes, including airway
      remodeling and changes in baseline gene expression profiles at the level of the epithelium.
      Our own data indicate that chronic exposure to CS suppresses the ability of epithelial cells
      to enhance antiviral gene expression in response to influenza infection and activate host
      defense responses. While there is a large body of evidence supporting the notion that
      exposure to CS causes significant changes in host defense responses, which may be linked to
      permanent changes in epithelial cells at the genomic level, it is not known whether new and
      emerging tobacco products have similar or distinct effects.

      Using live attenuated influenza virus (LAIV) inoculation in human volunteers, this study
      will compare influenza-induced responses in non-smokers (NS), cigarette smokers (CS), hookah
      smokers (HS), and Little Cigar smokers (LCS) in vivo. This will be done by analyzing nasal
      viral titers, antiviral defense responses, inflammatory mediator production, and markers of
      immune responses for LAIV-induced responses between the different groups of volunteers.

    <textblock>
      Cigarette smoke (CS), hookah smoke (HS), and Little Cigar smoke (LCS)-exposed populations
      will be stratified based on their responses to a smoking diary, protocol questionnaire, as
      well as urine cotinine levels (which should be present in all three groups). We are aware
      that many current smokers are poly-tobacco product users (i.e. smoke cigarettes in addition
      to non-cigarette products), which could be confounding our observations. This will be
      controlled for by having potential volunteers complete a smoking diary and provide daily
      urine samples for 1 week prior to enrolling in the study. Based on this diary, subjects will
      be grouped as CS (cigarettes only), HS (hookah smokers and smoking less than ½ pack of
      cigarettes per week), and LCS (Little Cigar Smokers and smoking less than ½ pack of
      cigarettes per week). Individuals with mixed exposures that exceed those described above
      (i.e. smoking more than ½ pack of cigarettes per week in addition to smoking hookah or
      Little Cigars) will be excluded from the studies. Potential subjects will then complete a
      questionnaire regarding their smoking history, and will undergo urine collection for
      measurement of cotinine for 7 consecutive days. Subjects will be assigned to the different
      groups as followed: Group NS (no routine exposure to tobacco smoke, and average log10 urine
      cotinine/creatinine ratio &lt; 1.0), Group CS (active cigarette smoker and log10 urine
      cotinine/creatinine ratio &gt; 4), Group HS (active routine hookah smokers and average log10
      urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4), or Group LCS (active routine Little Cigars smoker and
      average log10 urine cotinine/creatinine ratio 1-4).

      Study protocol outline:

      Screening visit (2-4 weeks prior to Day 0): Obtain informed consent, history (including
      smoke exposure questionnaire), physical examination, vital signs, blood draw (for
      anti-influenza antibody titer, HIV and T cell stimulation with flu antigen), urine (for
      cotinine), nasal lavage (NL, for differential cell count, viral culture and antigen
      detection, cytokine panel), nasal epithelial biopsy (NBx) #1, pregnancy test for females of
      child bearing potential. In addition, smokers will undergo spirometry.

      Subjects will return to the research lab daily the for the week prior to D0 to provide a
      urine sample for cotinine. Subjects will given a daily smoking/exposure diary during this
      time to continue throughout the study.

      Day 0 (Monday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine. Administer FluMist

      Day 1 (Tuesday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, NBx #2 at Day 1 or Day 2 (single naris)

      Day 2 (Wednesday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, and possibly NBx #2

      Day 3 (Thursday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine

      Day 4 (Friday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine, blood draw, NBx # 3 (single
      naris-contralateral to naris used for Day 1 or Day 2 sample)

      Day 9 +/- 1 day (Tues-Thursday): Obtain vital signs, NL, urine

      Day 21 +/- 7 days: Obtain vital signs, blood draw, collect completed smoking/exposure diary
