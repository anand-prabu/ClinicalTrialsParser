There is current\n      evidence that ROS are common activators of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB), a factor that\n      initiates a systemic inflammatory process by promoting the synthesis of cytokines,\n      interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and expression of\n      intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM-1).\n\n      To maintain balance of the oxidative state, the human body possesses intracellular\n      antioxidant enzyme systems, including superoxide dismutase (SOD, glutathione peroxidase\n      (GPx), and catalase (CAT), which is located mainly in peroxisomes and cytoplasm of the cell.\n\n      The epidemiology of preeclampsia, which is more common among poor women, had previously\n      suggested that nutrients may be involved in the disorder, unfortunately, the nutritional\n      data obtained from women with the syndrome has been poorly defined.\n\n      The objective of this paper was to provide an overview of the biological plausibility and\n      potential mechanisms underlying associations among maternal nutrition, oxidative stress in\n      placenta and the risk of preeclampsia."
