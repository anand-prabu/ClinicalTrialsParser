  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator plans to assess enrollment rates among two different enrollment methods,
      while providing a behavioral economic intervention to enhance the uptake of home-health
      monitoring devices to lower hemoglobin A1C among patients with uncontrolled diabetes. The
      study is focusing on enrollment methods since the standard randomized control trial only
      reaches 15% of the population. The study is seeking to understand the effectiveness of a
      behavioral intervention, when rolled out in a larger population.

    <description>The primary objective is to obtain preliminary evidence regarding whether or not patients opt-into a research study, as opposed to enrolling by default, will affect participation in the program and the effectiveness of the intervention, among high-risk patients. The primary outcome is to measure enrollment rates.  The investigators will also measure participation in the program through device usage.</description>

    <description>Every day of the 91 day intervention period participants will be asked to use each of their biometric devices. A daily lottery will be conducted automatically by the study website. Participants must use each of their two devices daily to be eligible for the lottery the following day. Winning lottery numbers will be identified by a fixed-position match between the automatically generated winning number and a participant ID number, which each participant will pick at enrollment.</description>
