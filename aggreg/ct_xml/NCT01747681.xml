  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Articular cartilage lesions are commonly occurring. In a prospective study of 1,000 knee
      arthroscopies focal chondral or osteochondral defects were found in 19% of the patients
      (Hjelle 2002). Chronic articular cartilage defects do not heal spontaneously. However, acute
      traumatic osteochondral lesions or surgically inflicted lesions extending into subchondral
      bone, e.g. by drilling (Pridie 1959), spongialization, abrasion or microfracture with an
      angled awl (Rodrigo 1994) causing the release of  pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells from
      the bone marrow, may heal with repair tissue consisting of fibrous tissue, fibrocartilage or
      hyaline-like cartilage.  The microfracture technique causes little damage to the subchondral
      bone plate and the risk of heat necroses caused by drilling or abrasion is eliminated. The
      quality of the repair tissue after these bone marrow stimulating techniques depends on
      various factors including the species and age of the individual, the size and localization
      of the defect, the surgical technique, e.g., how the subchondral bone plate is treated, and
      the postoperative rehabilitation protocol. Microfracture has been used in small traumatic
      defects in young sporting individuals (Steadman 2003) as well as in larger osteoarthritic
      lesions in older patients (Miller 2004, Steadman 2007). The purpose of the present study was
      to investigate the long-term clinical outcome 10 to 14 years after microfracture of
      articular cartilage defects in the knee and possible predictors of good and poor outcomes.
