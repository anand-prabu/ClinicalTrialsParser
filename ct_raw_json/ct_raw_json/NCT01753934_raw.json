Sixty to 80 children between the ages\n      of 4 to 17 years with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will have neuropsychological testing and a\n      non-sedated MRI scan of the head performed.  The investigators will compare this to a\n      control group of 30-40 children between the ages of 4 to 17 years without Type 1 diabetes\n      mellitus.  The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus will not have any changes made to\n      their current diabetes regimen.  The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus should continue\n      to check blood glucose values as required by your doctor and bring their meter(s) for\n      downloading to each visit.  The children with Type 1 diabetes mellitus should also tell your\n      doctor about the frequency of severe low and high blood glucose values."
