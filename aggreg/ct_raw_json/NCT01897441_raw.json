Drugs used in chemotherapy, such\n      as doxorubicin hydrochloride, cyclophosphamide, and paclitaxel, work in different ways to\n      stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different\n      ways. Some block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help\n      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Giving doxorubicin hydrochloride,\n      cyclophosphamide, paclitaxel and trastuzumab may kill more tumor cells. Collecting and\n      storing samples of tissue from patients with breast cancer to study in the laboratory may\n      help doctors learn more about how well patients will respond to treatment."
