    <textblock>
      This randomized pilot study will be conducted in men with metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 3 months of initiating abiraterone or enzalutamide.  The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a 12 week exercise intervention in
      mCRPC patients who have recently started on additional androgen suppression therapy.

      This randomized pilot study will be conducted in men with metastatic castration resistant
      prostate cancer (mCRPC) within 3 months of initiating abiraterone or enzalutamide.  The
      purpose of this pilot study is to evaluate the effects of a 12 week exercise intervention in
      mCRPC patients who have recently started on additional androgen suppression therapy. The
      investigators will also explore the effects of the exercise training on biomarkers of
      inflammation-hormonal status and their potential association with changes in lean mass and
      function.
