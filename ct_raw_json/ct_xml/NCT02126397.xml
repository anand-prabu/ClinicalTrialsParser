  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hysteroscopy today is considered the gold standard for the diagnosis and treatment of
      endometrial polyps. In recent years we have used the bipolar energy for resection of polyps
      by hysteroscopy, becoming a routine clinical practice and universally accepted.

      Resection of endometrial polyps laser energy has recently begun to be used with satisfactory
      results, so studies are needed to analyze these results and compare it with the usual
      techniques .

      This time in advance of medicine, it is appropriate to introduce minimally invasive
      procedures , allowing resection of endometrial polyps on an outpatient basis without
      anesthesia and acceptable to most patients.

      These procedures assume a lower cost and are associated with a lower surgical risk due to
      their realization without anesthesia .

      Hypothesis: Resection of polyps outpatient laser diode has a similar or superior to that of
      the bipolar electrode tolerability. The diode laser is a viable , quick , simple technique
      with a high percentage of resection and high degree of satisfaction of patients

      Main objective: To assess the tolerability of diode laser in the treatment of endometrial
      polyps using a visual analogue pain scale.

      Secondary objectives:

        -  Determine if complete resection of polyps is achieved with both methods.

        -  Compare the time spent on the removal of the polyp in each of the hysteroscopic
           methods.

        -  To evaluate the safety of the laser diode with respect to the bipolar electrode (vagal
           syndrome, uterine perforation, infection, bleeding).

        -  Assess the recurrence of polyps after 3 months of resection (via hysteroscopy).

        -  Compare the degree of patient satisfaction with the different methods.

      Design: randomized single blind clinical trial corresponds to an experimental analytical
      study. The patients randomly into 2 groups will include: Group A bipolar electrode treatment
      Versapoint and Group B diode laser treatment. Randomization was performed using a random
      table with 2 groups, generated in Microsoft Office Excel. The sample size needed to detect a
      difference in visual analog pain scale of a point with respect to the laser diode bipolar
      electrode is calculated; assuming a standard deviation of 1.75, a sample size of 49 patients
      in each group (98 would be needed in total), to a level of significance of 5% (0.05 α) with
      a power of 0.80 (beta 0.20). Assuming a loss of individuals from 5 to 10%
