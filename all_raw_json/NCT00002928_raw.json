Evaluate the activity of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly schedule to\n      patients with advanced ovarian cancer who have failed paclitaxel on a 3 or 24 hour infusion\n      schedule. II. Evaluate the toxic effects of paclitaxel when administered on a weekly\n      schedule in this patient population. III. Correlate response with quality of life outcomes,\n      including symptom distress, performance status, and global quality of life.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a single center, open label study. Paclitaxel is administered intravenously\n      every week as a 1 hour infusion. Patients receive prophylactic anti-allergy premedication\n      prior to paclitaxel.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 25-30 patients accrued per year."
