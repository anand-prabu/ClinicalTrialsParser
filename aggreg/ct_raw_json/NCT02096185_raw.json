            "textblock": "Patients who are diagnosed with breast cancer will have surgery to remove the tumour. Where\n      this is a local excision not mastectomy, the tissue removed is sent for x-ray imaging to\n      assess that the abnormality has been removed and give an estimation of the distance from\n      lesion to specimen edge. This allows the surgeon to decide whether to remove more tissue or\n      not at the time. This study is designed to compare whether more accurate information about\n      lesion to margin measurement can be obtained using 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging\n      compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging which is the type of imaging\n      currently used. This has the potential to prevent some patients requiring a second operation\n      to remove more tissue if the margins of the specimen are still involved with tumour.\n\n      The study involves x-raying the specimen under both conditions when it arrives from theatre.\n      Only the 2D image will be reviewed at the time as is current practice. The 3D image will be\n      reviewed later and the measurements for lesion to specimen margin compared. The lesion to\n      margin measurement as recorded by the pathologist will be taken as the 'gold standard' and\n      the imaging measurements will also be compared to that.\n\n      In theory, the use of 3D tomosynthesis should allow more accurate lesion to margin\n      measurement because 3D can provide better visualisation of the lesion edges by removing the\n      effect of superimposed tissue.\n\n      The hypothesis states that the use of 3 dimensional tomosynthesis imaging should provide\n      better lesion visualisation compared to 2 dimensional conventional digital imaging thus\n      allowing more accurate lesion to margin measurement."
