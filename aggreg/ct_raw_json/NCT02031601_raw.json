All patients were continued to receive TKI until progression or\n      unacceptable to toxicity or death. The primary endpoint was progression-free survivial\n      (PFS).\n\n      Expected results: PFS of combination therapy group will be prolonged to nineteen months\n      while PFS of TKI alone therapy group is ten months. Overall survival (OS) of combination\n      therapy group will be prolonged to 36 months while OS of TKI alone therapy group is 26\n      months.\n\n      Hypothesis: Platinum-based chemotherapy plus intercalated TKI combination therapy as\n      first-line treatment will prolong PFS and OS for patients with NSCLC."
