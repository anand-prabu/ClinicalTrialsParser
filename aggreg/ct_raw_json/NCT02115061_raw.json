The window can be puncture\n      through the distal esophagus or directly in the gastric varix via retroflexion to the\n      fundus. Another advantage of this technique is its use in the presence of bleeding, when\n      large amounts of blood in the stomach hinders the injection of the cyanoacrylate, by\n      pricking the distal esophagus that difficulty decreases. The first study of this technique\n      was performed by Binmoeller et al (21) and had good results with 100% hemostasis and low\n      rebleeding rate (16%), but more studies are needed to prove the safety and efficacy of this\n      technique."
