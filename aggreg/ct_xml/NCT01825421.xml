  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Unnecessary and prolonged antibiotic therapy in newborn babies can have serious consequences
      including development of necrotizing enterocolitis (a serious, potentially life-threatening
      gastrointestinal illness in premature babies), late-onset infections, resistance to
      antibiotics, increased length of hospital stay, and death.

      Starting and continuing antibiotic therapy for blood culture-negative infections in the
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) is fairly common with numbers of such patients varying
      from 20%-90% of infants undergoing a sepsis evaluation in the NICU.

      While blood culture results are the gold standard, there is usually a delay of up to 48-72h
      before the results are known.  Hence, initiation and continuation of antibiotic treatment
      are usually based on clinical evaluation and blood count criteria which do not possess high
      specificity or sensitivity, and may be unreliable in the first few hours after birth or in
      the early stages of infection.

      Since the investigators found that neutrophil CD64 (a type of protein found on the surface
      of a type of white blood cell that can be detected quickly in a very small amount of blood
      sample) has high accuracy for early detection of blood culture-proven infections in newborn
      babies, with extremely high negative predictive value (can identify babies definitively with
      no infection), the investigators will use this test to decide whether to stop or continue
      antibiotics in the NICU.

      The investigators hypothesis is that neutrophil CD64 values can be safely used to
      discontinue antibiotics in newborns suspected of having infections.

      The investigators aims are to utilize sequential measurements of CD64 values to stop
      antibiotics early in neonates being investigated for both early and late-onset infections in
      the NICU.

      This is a prospective, randomized, controlled (RCT) trial.  The study population will be
      derived from the sub-set of all newborn infants who have undergone investigations for
      presence of infection in the NICU.
