Patients with histologically confirmed\n      malignant glioma receive interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin interstitially over 96 hours\n      beginning on day 1. Patients with a residual enhancing mass undergo repeat catheter\n      placement on day 56 and then receive a second interstitial infusion beginning on day 57 in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of interleukin-13 PE38QQR immunotoxin until\n      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of\n      6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Additional patients are treated at the MTD.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 30 patients will be accrued for phase I of the study within\n      6 months and a total of 12-35 patients will be accrued for phase II of the study within\n      10-12 months."
