      -  Although many different oral antidiabetic agents are currently available, approximately
           50% of treated Type 2 diabetic subjects do not reach currently accepted goals for
           HbA1c(Oral communication, American Diabetic Association, 2008)

        -  Subjects are frequently prescribed agents which can cause hypoglycemia, and/or weight
           gain. Metformin does not usually have these unwanted effects, and it is the standard
           first line therapy in treating type 2 diabetic mellitus in European union.

        -  Nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies revealed that MP-513 effectively improves glucose
           tolerance in animal models of type 2 diabetes, whilst the compound has very little
           potential to cause hypoglycaemia, the most commonly reported adverse event with many
           currently marketed products.

        -  The nonclinical studies also suggested that the inhibitory effect of MP-513 on DPP-Ⅳ is
           more potent and durable than other DPP-Ⅳ inhibitors in development. The result in
           safety pharmacology and toxicology also revealed that MP-513 has a relatively wide
           margin for safety.

        -  Thus, MP-513 is expected to have good efficacy and tolerability in subjects with type 2
           diabetes mellitus by once-daily administration.

             screening visit (This does not preclude a subject from being re-screened for this
             study at a later date within the 12 week period, provided they were not randomised )

             are planning to become pregnant during the study

             diabetes or its complications during the study after the screening visit

         13. The subject has a clinically significant liver disease with
             aspartate-amino-transferase (AST) and alanine-amino-transferase (ALT) &gt;2.5 times the
             upper limit of normal (ULN) at the screening visit

         14. The subject has diastolic blood pressure &gt;100 mmHg and/or systolic blood pressure
             &gt;180 mmHg at the screening visit

         15. The presence of any other condition that leads the investigator to conclude that the
             patient is inappropriate for inclusion in the clinical study
