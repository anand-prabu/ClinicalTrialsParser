            "textblock": "Importance This will be a proof of concept study - whereby we hypothesize that Repigel may\n      represent a paradigm shift in global acne treatment.\n\n      Historically, there has been a dearth of clinical evidence in this use of povidone-iodine\n      for inflammatory acne. This is likely due to staining related to iodine use, which is not\n      acceptable to consumers.\n\n      The trial drug, Povidone Iodine, however, becomes colourless and odourless in a matter of\n      seconds after application on the skin.\n\n      This represents an ideal product for which we may perform testing to look at its efficacy in\n      the management of acne.\n\n      A mainstay in the pathogenesis of acne involves the overgrowth and proliferation of skin\n      micro-organisms, primarily proprionibacterium Acnes. Long term antibiotic therapy is usually\n      prescribed for a period of 3 to 6 months or more.\n\n      Previous studies have revealed this form of antibiotic therapy is ineffective, patients are\n      usually poorly compliant, and also results in the formation of antibiotic resistant\n      micro-organisms,which in turn reduces treatment efficacy.\n\n      Potential Benefits\n\n      As such, Povidone Iodine with its antiseptic property represents a promising avenue for the\n      elimination of Proprionibacterium Acnes without the associated problems of long term\n      antibiotic use, and the development of antibiotic-resistance. It is cosmetically acceptable,\n      affordable, and easy to use."
