            "textblock": "-  Patients with spinal cord injury (SCI) usually breathe without any mechanical\n           assistance, but significant breathing problems occur often during sleep, either because\n           the upper airway closes (obstructive sleep apnea; OSA), or because of\n           weakness/paralysis of the breathing muscles.  These problems often go unrecognized, as\n           SCI patients face logistical barriers that cause them to refuse appropriate testing in\n           sleep laboratories.  We have devised a strategy for diagnosing sleep-disordered\n           breathing in the patient's home, using placement of noninvasive devices that monitor\n           breathing overnight.  This project is designed to test the feasibility and utility of\n           this strategy.\n\n        -  After collecting baseline data on symptoms and medical events for four months, the\n           home-based studies are performed noninvasively with FDA-approved devices: a type III\n           sleep system and a recording oxygen saturation/ transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitor.\n           If these studies identify sleep-disordered breathing, noninvasive ventilatory support\n           is prescribed according to standard clinical practice.  Over the following twelve\n           months, the subjects monitor their symptoms daily, and answer quality-of-life\n           questionnaires every three months. After 3, 6, and 12 months, blood tests are performed\n           to measure blood sugar and cholesterol/lipids.  Data is downloaded from the ventilator\n           device to monitor compliance and ventilator performance.  This study is designed to\n           determine the prevalence of sleep-disordered breathing in SCI, the feasibility of\n           home-based testing to establish the diagnosis, and the short term effects on symptoms,\n           quality-of-life, and associated conditions (glucose intolerance, blood lipid\n           disorders)."
