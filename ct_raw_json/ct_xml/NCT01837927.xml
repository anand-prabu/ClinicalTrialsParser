        Inclusion:

          -  Men and women aged 40 years or over.

          -  History of current or former smoking of at least 10 pack-years

          -  Cooperative outpatients, with a COPD diagnosis established by the measurement of
             FEV1/FVC &lt; 0.7 post-bronchodilation in basal spirometry (without use of medication or
             post-washout). Moderate to severe stage patients will be included, with
             post-bronchodilator FEV1 between 30 and 80% of the normal value according to GOLD
             2011 since the inclusion criteria in this trial will be based on spirometry results.

        Exclusion:

          -  Pregnant women or nursing mothers

          -  History of asthma at visit 1 indicated by, but not limited to:

               -  Onset of respiratory symptoms suggestive of asthma (such as coughing, wheezing,
                  shortness of breath) before the age of 40.

               -  History of diagnosed asthma

          -  History of respiratory tract infection within six weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  History of hospitalization or emergency care for a COPD exacerbation in the 3 months
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Subjects who require use of home oxygen therapy.

          -  Patients in the active phase of an assisted pulmonary rehabilitation program and

          -  Patients who in the investigator's judgment have an abnormality or significant
             medical condition such as: unstable ischemic heart disease, left ventricular failure,
             history of myocardial infarction, arrhythmia (except chronic stable atrial
             fibrillation), history of malignancy of any system (including lung cancer) treated or
             not within the last 5 years, glaucoma, prostatic hyperplasia, moderate to severe
             renal impairment, urinary retention, any other condition that might compromise
             patient safety or compliance, interfere with the evaluations, or prevent the
             termination of their participation in the study.

          -  Patients with contraindications to tiotropium or ipratropium treatment or who have
             experienced undesirable reactions with inhaled anticholinergic agents or patients
             with a history of an undesirable reaction with sympathomimetic amines or inhaled
             medication with any of those components, or a history of hypersensitivity to any of
             the study medications, including rescue medication, or similar classes of medication.

          -  Patients using tiotropium, long-acting anticholinergics, short-acting
             anticholinergics, fixed combinations of inhaled beta agonists and inhaled
             corticosteroids, theophylline. In these cases, the patient is allowed, after agreeing
             to participate in the study, to enter a washout period from Visit

          -  Patients using inhaled steroids, alone or as an exchange in a fixed combination at
             equivalent doses, unless on a stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to
             randomization

          -  Patients using nonselective beta-blockers.

          -  Patients using cromoglycate, nedocromil, ketotifen and leukotriene antagonists unless
             on stable treatment for at least 1 month prior to randomization .

          -  Patients who used oral prednisone (or equivalent) over a long period, defined as ≥ 10
             mg/day for at least 1 month prior to Visit 1

          -  Patients who used intramuscular depot corticosteroids within 30 days from Visit 1.

          -  Patients with a history of long QT Syndrome or with prolonged QTc (&gt; 450 ms) measured
             at Visit 1 (Fridericia Method).

          -  Patients who, in the opinion of the investigator, have clinically significant
             abnormalities on ECG. These patients should not be re-screened.
