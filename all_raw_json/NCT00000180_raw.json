            "textblock": "AIT-082 is a novel small molecule that crosses the blood-brain barrier to enhance nerve\n      function by increasing levels of neurotrophic growth factors and encouraging nerve sprouting\n      in the brain. Preclinical studies in animals have shown that AIT-082 improves memory in aged\n      animals and in animals with neurological deficits.\n\n      This study was a double-blind placebo-controlled safety study that was designed to study\n      whether AIT-082 may delay age-related mental decline. Eight healthy older volunteers at two\n      clinical sites were given single, weekly, rising doses of AIT-082 or placebo for 5 weeks;\n      were tested for side effects and absorption; and underwent a battery of neuropsychological\n      memory tests, including word and number recall tests."
