The specific aims of the project are as follows:\n\n      Specific Aim 1: Determine the validity and reliability of 4 clinical methods for assessing\n      LLI.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Determine differences in static and dynamic foot postures between longer and\n      shorter limbs.\n\n      Specific Aim 3: Assess the feasibility of conducting a specific lift therapy intervention\n      among individuals with a LLI and knee or hip pain, refining procedures as needed.\n\n      Public Health Impact: Results from the proposed research will be used to: 1) improve\n      diagnosis of LLI by providing evidence on the various assessment methods for the clinicians\n      who most frequently use clinical methods (i.e., physical therapists, chiropractors,\n      podiatrists, and primary care physicians), and 2) develop and test new\n      non-pharmacologic/non-invasive intervention strategies aimed at reducing pain and improving\n      function in individuals with osteoarthritis and LLI."

They will be contacted weekly to be reminded to increase their lift height and identify when they have achieved their optimal lift height.",
