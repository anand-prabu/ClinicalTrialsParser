Although these conditions are common, there is very\n      little data from high quality studies to support a particular treatment method in affected\n      patients.  The purpose of this study is to compare three different treatments for these\n      types of apophysitis.  The investigators plan to compare two types of home exercise program\n      (HEP), one involving active elongation exercises and one utilizing static stretching, with\n      symptomatic treatment consisting of icing, over-the-counter medications and relative rest.\n      The investigators hypothesize that the active elongation HEP will result in improvement in\n      pain and earlier return to athletic activities when compared to the static stretching HEP\n      and symptomatic care.  This pilot study will recruit subjects at the Ann & Robert H. Lurie\n      Children's Hospital outpatient sports medicine and orthopaedic clinics with any of the\n      following types of lower extremity apophysitis: OSS, SLJ or Sever's disease.  Subjects will\n      complete a baseline evaluation and questionnaire and will be randomized into one of the\n      three treatment groups.  At 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks, subjects from all groups will use a secure\n      website to complete an online survey to complete questions regarding current pain level,\n      compliance with their home exercise program, if applicable, use of other forms of treatment\n      or pain management (e.g. splinting, icing, rest from activities) and current activity level.\n      The investigators will compare results from each group to determine which treatment(s)\n      resulted in the largest improvements in pain scores and the highest rates of participation\n      in sports and recreational activities."
