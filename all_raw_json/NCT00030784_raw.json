Treatment repeats\n      every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ifosfamide until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression and then every 12 weeks\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-24 patients will be accrued for this study."
