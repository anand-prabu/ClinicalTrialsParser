To better characterize patients with co-occurring ATS and heroin dependence (with\n           regard to disturbances of mood, impulse control, executive functioning and patterns of\n           drug use during MMT) and to evaluate the effects of atomoxetine on mood, impulsivity,\n           and executive functioning (including attention, concentration, memory, and\n           decision-making characteristics).\n\n        3.
