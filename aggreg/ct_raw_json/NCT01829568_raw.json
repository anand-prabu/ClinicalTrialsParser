Lenalidomide may stimulate the immune system in different\n      ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Ibrutinib may stop the growth of cancer cells by\n      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      rituximab, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer cells\n      to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing\n      substances to them. Giving lenalidomide and ibrutinib together with rituximab may be an\n      effective treatment for follicular lymphoma."
