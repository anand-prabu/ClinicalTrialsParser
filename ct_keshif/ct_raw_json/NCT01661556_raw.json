Miconazol has antimelanotic properties and can be used as treatment for\n      melasma patients. The estimated number of subjects to be recruited and randomized for the\n      study is at least 30.  The purpose of this study is determine if there is a difference in\n      the effectiveness of these two agents. Melasma Area and Severity Index (MASI) score will be\n      assessed at the beginning of the study and at weeks 4, 8, and 12. Photographs, colorimetry\n      and histological assessment will be also evaluated. Occurrence of adverse effects will also\n      be recorded."

Treatment\n      with depigmenting compounds such as hydroquinone, are still the gold standard in this\n      condition. Miconazol has depigmented properties that could be used as part of the treatment\n      in melasma patients. This effect is exerted by inhibiting the tyrosinase enzyme. So, the\n      primary objective of this study is to compare the depigmenting activity of miconazole\n      against hydroquinone.\n\n      Patients who are included in the study will be randomly assigned to receive one of the\n      treatments, which should use for 12 weeks. The medications should be applied in the affected\n      regions twice a day.\n\n      The evaluation of clinical improvement will be done in a blinded modality by means of the\n      MASI score, the Global Physician Assessment, as well as colorimetry and histological melanin\n      content. Evaluations will be held on visits at 4, 8 and 12 weeks. Skin biopsy will be taken\n      at onset and at 12 weeks.\n\n      At the end of the study, data will be compared concerning the former parameters.
