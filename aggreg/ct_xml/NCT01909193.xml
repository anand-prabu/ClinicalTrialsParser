  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adults with Social Anxiety Disorder will be pseudo randomly assigned to either an individual
      cognitive behavior therapy, attention bias modification treatment, emotion focused
      intervention or positive psychology interventions (allocation ratio - 3:1:1:1).

      Outcome measures will be social anxiety symptoms and severity as measured by gold standard
      questionnaires as well as diagnosis of social anxiety disorder derived from structured
      clinical interviews based on DSM-IV criteria.

      The investigators expect to find significant reduction in social anxiety symptoms in all of
      the groups, with the cognitive behavior therapy group showing greater reduction in symptoms
      than the other groups. Mechanisms of change in all of the groups will be examined via
      measures of cognitive biases, affect, and other common and specific factors.
