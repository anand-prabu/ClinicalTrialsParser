    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if the combination of ruxolitinib and
      azacytidine can help to control myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic
      syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic syndrome.

      Ruxolitinib is designed to block a pathway that has been found to be overactive in human
      cancers and myelofibrosis.

      Azacytidine is designed to block certain proteins in cancer cells that stop the function of
      the tumor-fighting proteins.  By blocking the &quot;bad&quot; proteins, the tumor-fighting genes may
      be able to work better.

      Study Treatment:

      A. For patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib 2
      times every day by mouth. If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the
      dose.

      Beginning with Cycle 4, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days) , you will receive azacytidine either under
      the skin or through a needle in your vein.

      Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      You will be given a drug diary and asked to write down what time you take the study drugs.
      Bring in any unused study drugs and bottles to each study visit.

      Each cycle is 28 days.

      B. For patients with myelodysplastic syndrome:

      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will take ruxolitinib 2
      times every day by mouth. If you miss or vomit your dose of ruxolitinib, do not make up the
      dose.

      Beginning with Cycle 1, on Days 1-5 (+/-6 days) , you will receive azacytidine either under
      the skin or through a needle in your vein.

      Your dose of ruxolitinib and/or azacytidine may be raised, lowered, and/or delayed if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      Study Visits:

      Each study visit may be performed at +/- 7 days than the day stated.

      On Day 1 of Cycles  1-7, Day 1 of Cycle 9, and Day 1 of Cycle 12 and Day 1 of Cycle 13

        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.

        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your vital signs and weight.

        -  Your spleen and liver will be measured.

        -  You will complete 2 questionnaires about how you are feeling.

      On Day 1 of Cycles 1-6 and then every 3 cycles, your complete medical history will be
      recorded.

      A. Patients with myelofibrosis or myelodysplastic syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm will
      have blood draws once a week during Cycles 1, 2, 4, and 5, every 2 weeks during Cycles 3 and
      6, and then 1 time each month after that. Blood (about 2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for
      routine tests.

      After Cycles 6 and 12, you will have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the
      disease. Routine blood draws and  bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often if the
      doctor thinks it is in your best interest.

      B. Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome will have blood draws twice a week during Cycles
      1, 2, 4 and 5; every week during Cycles 3 and 6; and every 2 weeks after that. Blood (about
      2-3 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. After Cycles 3, 6, 9, and 12, you will
      have a bone marrow aspiration to check the status of the disease. Routine blood draws and
      bone marrow biopsies may be done more or less often  if the doctor thinks it is in your best
      interest.

      Research Blood Tests:

      Extra blood  will be drawn for pharmacokinetic (PK) testing and pharmacodynamic (PD). PK
      testing measures the amount of study drug in the body at different time points. PD testing
      measures how the level of study drug in your body may affect the disease.

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PK testing:

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours
           later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours
           later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you
           receive the study drug, and then 1, 2, and 5 hours later

      Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons each time) will be drawn for PD testing:

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 1, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 3, before you receive the study drug

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 6, before you receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 9, before you receive the study drug

        -  On Day 1 of Cycle 12 (or at the end of study if you go off study early), before you
           receive the study drug and then 2 hours later

      Length of Study:

      You can take up to 15 cycles of ruxolitinib and 12 cycles of azacytidine. After 15 cycles of
      ruxolitinib, if your doctor thinks it is in your best interest, you may continue taking it
      off study. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.

      You will be called about 30 days after you go off study and asked if you have had any side
      effects and/or any new treatment(s).

      This is an investigational study.  Ruxolitinib is FDA approved and commercially available to
      treat myelofibrosis. Azacytidine is FDA approved and commercially available for
      myelodysplastic  syndrome. The combination of ruxolitinib and azacytidine to treat
      myelofibrosis and myelodysplastic  syndrome/myeloproliferative neoplasm and myelodysplastic
      syndrome is investigational.

      Up to105 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson.
