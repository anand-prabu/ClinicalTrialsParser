            "textblock": "Unrelieved cancer pain at the end of life is a major health problem and is inconsistent with\n      patient-centered goals for their last days. Building on a successful approach researched in\n      outpatient oncology settings, the investigators propose a study testing PAINRelieveIt, a\n      system-level intervention of computerized tools with patient-reported pain outcomes (in\n      English, Spanish, Chinese languages), decision support for clinicians (English) and\n      multimedia education tailored to each cancer patient and lay caregiver.\n\n      Using  a 1-week pre-test/post-test randomized design in patients receiving home level\n      hospice care provided by two Chicago-area hospices, we will compare effects of usual hospice\n      care with PAINReportIt Summary and usual hospice care with PAINRelieveIt on pain outcomes.\n      The tablet-based PAINRelieveIt includes valid and reliable pain tools (PAINReportIt), a\n      summary of the patient's pain data with decision support for hospice nurses to obtain\n      recommendations for algorithm-based analgesic therapies (PAINConsultN), and multimedia\n      education tailored to the patient's and lay caregiver's pain management misconceptions\n      (PainUCope). Patient's/caregiver's answers are automatically stored in an electronic\n      database, from which the system generates a PAINReportIt Summary (usual hospice care control\n      group); PAINConsultN and PainUCope (experimental group). All patients will receive usual\n      hospice care. All patients/caregivers will complete PAINReportIt at pretest and 1-week later\n      (posttest); patients also complete parts of PAINReportIt daily. Via daily e-mail updates,\n      the control-group hospice nurses will receive a PAINReportIt Summary and experimental-group\n      hospice nurses will receive a PAINConsultN. Additionally, experimental group\n      patients/caregivers will view multimedia educational materials via PAINUCope to help\n      patients report pain and adhere to prescribed analgesics.\n\n      Specific aims are to compare usual hospice care and PAINRelieveIt groups for effects on:\n\n        1. Patient outcomes (analgesic adherence; worst pain intensity, satisfaction, and\n           misconceptions) and lay caregiver outcome (pain misconceptions) in a diverse sample of\n           250 cancer patient-caregiver dyads receiving hospice care.\n\n        2. Nurse outcomes (obtained appropriate analgesics for patient) in a sample of hospice\n           nurses.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that at posttest, controlling for pretest data and compared to\n      the usual care group, the PAINRelieveIt group will: a) report decreased scores for worst\n      pain intensity and pain misconceptions; b) have increased analgesic adherence (primary\n      outcome); and c) have a larger proportion who report satisfaction with pain intensity and\n      whose nurses obtained appropriate analgesics for the patients' pain.\n\n      Findings will guide future system-level research to implement PAINRelieveIt in a multi-site,\n      longitudinal trial that will test the effect of disseminating this technology on clinical\n      decisions for managing pain and patient/caregiver pain outcomes in a national sample of\n      hospices.
