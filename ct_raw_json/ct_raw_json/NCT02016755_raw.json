Subjects, who had successful tumor resection or\n             radio-chemotherapy of breast cancer more than 10 years prior to inclusion in the\n             study, and with no recurrence, may be enrolled in the study. Subjects, who had\n             successful tumor resection or radio-chemotherapy of all other tumor types and have\n             been in remission for more than 5 years prior to inclusion in the study, and with no\n             recurrence, may be enrolled in the study.  A dermatological exam will have ruled out\n             any skin cancer.\n\n          -  Subjects who have proliferative retinopathy, or moderate or severe non-proliferative\n             retinopathy, from any cause (ETDRS Score > 35), clinically significant macular oedema\n             or previous panretinal photocoagulation therapy\n\n          -  Subjects with severe renal disease defined as significant renal dysfunction evidenced\n             by an estimated creatinine clearance of <30 mL/minute (calculated using the Cockcroft\n             Gault formula), or receiving chronic hemodialysis therapy.\n\n          -  A Stroke, TIA or MI within 3 months of entry into the study.\n\n          -  Subjects with known liver disease (e.g., hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis of the liver).\n\n          -  A subject with HIV, AIDS, or severe uncontrolled ulcerative colitis or Crohn's\n             disease.\n\n          -  Subjects with a current, uncorrected history of alcohol or substance abuse.\n\n          -  Subjects that have been administered rhPDGF (e.g, becaplermin) or other growth\n             factors locally within one month of randomization.\n\n          -  Subjects who have received another investigational drug within 30 days of\n             randomization or have previously received any gene transfer therapy within 3 years of\n             entering the study."
