Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Combining rituximab with chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of rituximab plus combination chemotherapy\n      in treating patients who have HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 6\n      courses. Patients also receive rituximab on days 14, 21, 28, and 35. Patients who achieve\n      complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses of chemotherapy after CR.\n\n      Patients are followed every 1-2 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-20 patients will be accrued for this study."
