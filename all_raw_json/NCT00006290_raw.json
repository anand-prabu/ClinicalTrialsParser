By learning this, a set of questions can be created to help\n      understand how changes in body build and image affect people living with HIV infection.\n\n      A set of questions used to measure body image might be useful in future HIV studies. It may\n      help doctors understand patient concerns about their body image and why some patients stop\n      taking their anti-HIV medications."

Separate groups are run for men and women, and male groups are segmented by sexual\n      orientation. A moderator leads discussions about patients' perceived changes in body habitus\n      and body image. Group interviews are audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative\n      interview data are sent electronically to the Data Management Center, where they are\n      thematically analyzed using qualitative data analysis (content analysis) techniques. Salient\n      focus group findings are used to construct questionnaire items."
