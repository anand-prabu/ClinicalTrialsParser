Assess the safety and tolerability of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 in patients with\n      previously treated non-Hodgkin's lymphoma expressing the antigen recognized by Hu1D10.\n\n      II. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 in these patients.\n\n      III. Evaluate the pharmacokinetics, compare the pharmacology at different dose levels, and\n      determine the optimal biological dose of this drug in these patients.\n\n      IV. Evaluate any antilymphoma effects of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study.\n\n      Patients receive monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 IV over 2-4 hours on days 1, 8, 15, and 22.\n      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts\n      of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of monoclonal antibody Hu1D10 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, an additional cohort\n      of 3-6 patients receive Hu1D10 IV over 2-4 hours on days 1-5.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks, 50 days, and periodically thereafter until disease\n      progression."
