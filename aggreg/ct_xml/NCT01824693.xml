    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and
      melphalan or busulfan and fludarabine phosphate before donor hematopoietic cell transplant
      works in treating younger patients with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia. Giving
      chemotherapy before a donor hematopoietic transplant helps stop the growth of cancer cells.
      It may also stop the patient's immune system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the
      healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient, they may help the patient's
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. It is not
      yet known whether giving busulfan, cyclophosphamide, and melphalan or busulfan and
      fludarabine phosphate before a donor stem cell transplant is more effective in treating
      juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To compare - in a randomized fashion - the day 100 treatment related mortality (TRM)
      incidence for two myeloablative conditioning regimens, busulfan-fludarabine (fludarabine
      phosphate) (BU-FLU) and busulfan-cyclophosphamide-melphalan (BU-CY-MEL), prior to
      hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) for children with juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia
      (JMML), in order to determine the preferred regimen for future trials.

      II. To compare - in a randomized fashion - the 18-month event-free survival (EFS) following
      two different myeloablative conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL) prior to HCT for
      children with JMML, in order to determine the preferred regimen for future trials.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the 18-month relapse incidence (RI) following two different myeloablative
      conditioning regimens busulfan-fludarabine phosphate(BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL) prior to HCT for
      children with JMML.

      II. To determine the graft failure rates following two different myeloablative conditioning
      regimens (BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL) prior to HCT for children with JMML.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the rates of severe toxicities (grade 3/4) at day 100 post-HCT between the
      two myeloablative conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs. BU-CY-MEL).

      II. To determine the rates of acute and chronic (at 18 months post-HCT) graft-versus-host
      disease (GVHD) following HCT using two different conditioning regimens (BU-FLU vs.
      BU-CY-MEL) in children with JMML.

      III. To create a JMML-specific pre-HCT index to allow better risk-stratification of future
      patients.

      IV. To determine the feasibility of assessing post-transplant disease burden by donor
      chimerism measurements and allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in mononuclear
      and sorted cell subsets.

      V. To validate gene expression and methylation classifiers predictive of relapse in patients
      with JMML.

      VI. To comprehensively assess genetic and biochemical alterations amongst patients with JMML
      who are treated on this transplant protocol.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      BU-CY-MEL (HCT conditioning regimen with busulfan, cyclophosphamide, melphalan):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) once daily (QD), twice
      daily (BID), or four times a day (QID) over 2-3 hours on days -8 to -5, cyclophosphamide IV
      QD over 60 minutes on days -4 and -3, and melphalan IV over 15-30 minutes on day -1.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic HCT on day 0.

      Patients receive tacrolimus IV then orally (PO) on days -1 to 98 (related donor) or 180
      (unrelated donor) and mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours TID then PO on days 1-30
      (related donor) or 45 (unrelated donor).

      BU-FLU (HCT conditioning regimen with busulfan, fludarabine phosphate):

      CONDITIONING REGIMEN: Patients receive busulfan intravenously (IV) once daily (QD), twice
      daily (BID), or four times a day (QID) over 2-3 hours on days -8 to -5, and fludarabine
      phosphate IV over 1 hour on days -5 to -2.

      TRANSPLANT: Patients undergo allogeneic HCT on day 0.

      Patients receive tacrolimus IV then PO on days -1 to 98 (related donor) or 180 (unrelated
      donor) and mycophenolate mofetil IV over 2 hours TID then PO on days 1-30 (related donor) or
      45 (unrelated donor).

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 5 years.
