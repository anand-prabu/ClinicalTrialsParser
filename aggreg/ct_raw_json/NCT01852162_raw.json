Many patients on dual\n      antiplatelet therapy in this setting may be affected by other thromboembolic conditions, in\n      particular atrial fibrillation, therefore having an indication to also receive oral\n      anticoagulation for stroke prevention. Thus, a considerable percentage of patients are under\n      \"triple therapy\" which consists of aspirin plus clopidogrel plus an oral anticoagulant.\n      Although this combination therapy allows a reduction of atherothrombotic and thromboembolic\n      events, patients on triple therapy are at an increased risk of bleeding complications.\n\n      Dabigatran, a synthetic, reversible direct thrombin inhibitor, has been studied as an\n      alternative to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation and has been shown to be at\n      least as efficacious with a favorable safety profile. In particular, dabigatran at a dose of\n      110 mg is associated with rates of stroke and systemic embolism similar to warfarin, with\n      lower rates of major hemorrhage, while a dose of 150 mg is associated with lower thrombotic\n      events with similar rates of bleeding events. These findings have led the Food and Drug\n      Administration (FDA) to approve dabigatran for use in atrial fibrillation patients in\n      December 2011 and this has also been implemented in practice guidelines to be a superior\n      strategy to warfarin. However, the FDA only approved the 150mg formulation.\n\n      Dabigatran has high affinity and specificity for its target serine protease thrombin, and\n      one small study shows that dabigatran produced potent inhibition of thrombin-induced\n      platelet aggregation in vitro. However, there are no studies assessing the ex vivo\n      pharmacodynamic effects of dabigatran in patients on dual antiplatelet therapy. The ever\n      raising population with CAD warranting triple therapy and the growing number of patients\n      being treated with dabigatran underscores the importance of understanding the\n      pharmacodynamic effects of this treatment regimen."
