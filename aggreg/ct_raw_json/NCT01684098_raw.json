Patient must be 18 years of age or older.\n\n               2. Patient must have known or strongly suspected recurrent or metastatic cancer\n                  from a solid tumor with at least one identifiable lesion > 1.5 cm as diagnosed\n                  by conventional imaging.\n\n               3. Patient must have adequate kidney function defined as serum creatinine of < 1.5\n                  X ULN.\n\n               4. Patient must have adequate liver function defined as transaminases (SGOT and/or\n                  SGPT) may be up to 2.5 X ULN if alkaline phosphatase is <ULN or alkaline\n                  phosphatase may be up to 2.5 X ULN if Transaminases are < ULN. If alkaline\n                  phosphatase is outside of these parameters and is due to bone metastases\n                  verified by assessment of isoenzymes, then the subject is eligible.\n\n               5. Patient must provide written informed consent prior to enrollment.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients must be excluded in any of the following conditions are present:\n\n               1. Patient is pregnant or breastfeeding.\n\n               2. Patient is simultaneously participating in another investigational drug study,\n                  excluding the follow-up phase.\n\n               3. Patient has received an investigational agent within 7 days prior to enrollment.\n\n               4. Patient is unable to tolerate conditions for radionuclide imaging.\n\n               5. Patient has been administered another radiopharmaceutical that would interfere\n                  with the assessment of Technetium Tc 99m EC20."
