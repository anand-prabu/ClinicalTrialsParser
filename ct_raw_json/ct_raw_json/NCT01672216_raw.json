Anxious patients trained at first only in the biofeedback mode. The stimulation was introduced after four weeks for these patients. Patients were instructed to carry out the training at home, with an alternating combination in the morning and with EMG-triggered stimulation in the evening, each for 20-minute periods. Apart from this, the protocol of the active treatment group was identical to that of the control group."

The core of the task was to pull the plug-electrode upward inside the anal channel, like a lift, and to hold it there during varying periods of tension. This can only be done successfully if the perineum rises and at the same time the puborectal muscle is activated. Just squeezing the sphincter muscles does not produce this lifting effect."

The number of randomized controlled\n      trials is low with in part significant systemic deficiencies. However, the results from the\n      previous study with 3T treatment in patients with obstructed defecation syndrome (ODS) are\n      so promising that a further randomized controlled trial appears useful to demonstrate a\n      higher degree of evidence. The purpose of this study is to determine whether triple target\n      treatment (3T) or EMG-Biofeedback alone are effective in the treatment of chronic\n      obstipation and if the duration of treatment (3, 6 or 9 months) influence the efficacy."
