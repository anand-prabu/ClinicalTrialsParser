The purpose of this randomized,\n      prospective, study is to determine if brachial plexus blockade with general anesthesia is\n      superior to general anesthesia alone in immediate and long-term pain control in patients\n      undergoing operative fixation of distal upper extremity fractures."

            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to compare two (2) different types of anesthesia treatments\n      that are used during surgery for broken arms for post-surgery pain relief. One group will\n      receive general anesthesia (state of total unconsciousness) the other group will get\n      sedation (medicine injected into patient's vein that helps patient fall asleep), and a nerve\n      block (injection of anesthetic drug into the nerves going to patient's arm in order to make\n      patient's arm numb).\n\n      Both forms of anesthesia are used for a variety of surgeries to the arm including shoulder\n      and elbow surgeries. Currently it is thought that there are advantages and disadvantages to\n      both types. The advantage of not using the nerve block in addition to general anesthesia\n      (current standard or care) is that it decreases the potential risk for bleeding, infection\n      and nerve injury. Alternatively, the advantage of using the nerve block with sedation\n      (research-related procedure) is that it can potentially offer better post-operative pain\n      control. This study will examine whether there is added benefit with the addition of nerve\n      block for anesthesia for decreasing pain after surgical treatment of lower arm fractures."
