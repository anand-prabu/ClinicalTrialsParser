The QTc should be based on single or averaged QTc values of\n             triplicate ECGs obtained over a brief recording period.   It is essential that the\n             same method for calculating QTc that was used at a subjects baseline visit be used\n             for that subject for all subsequent visits.\n\n          -  The subject has QRS duration <70 and >110 msec for a minimum of first 10 subjects\n             completed; QRS duration <70 and up to >120 msec for subjects thereafter, pending\n             review. Note: ECG data from a minimum of first 10 subjects that complete the study\n             treatment will be reviewed.  If no safety concerns emerge, the upper limit of QRS\n             duration may be increased to a maximum of 120 msec without a formal protocol\n             amendment.

A subject enrolled as a failure of a previous antibacterial treatment\n             regimen must: Show lack of improvement or worsening in signs and symptoms of\n             infection, including continued or worsening purulence, erythema with or without\n             induration, fluctuation, heat/localized warmth, and pain/tenderness and/or continued\n             or worsening systemic markers of infection; Have a wound/abscess culture or rapid\n             diagnostic skin swab positive for Staphylococcus aureus (taken at the Day 1 visit\n             from the wound under study).
