            "textblock": "The rationale underlying this project is the fact that HA is a very common compensatory\n      interven\u00action within municipality health care, undertaken to support an independent living\n      in the own home. In addition, MD are frequently prescribed and used among HA clients in\n      order to compensate for declined body functions. In spite of this, knowledge of their\n      effects for the individual and the society is still scarce. In particular, systematic,\n      evidence-based strategies based on clear-cut conceptual definitions and descriptions of\n      procedures are lacking. Such strategies are crucial in order to evaluate the effects of HA\n      and MD.\n\n      The overarching aim is to investigate outcomes of HA on aspects of home and health for\n      sub-groups of persons with disabilities.\n\n      The specific aims are to:\n\n        -  Investigate the effects of HA on home and health related outcomes, i.e. usability, fear\n           of falling, activity/participation and health-related quality of life for different\n           subgroups of persons, e.g. MD users and non MD-users\n\n        -  Investigate the use of a new practice strategy for HA on home and health related\n           outcomes for subgroups of persons with disabilities in terms of differences between\n           municipalities\n\n        -  Investigate societal level outcomes of HA and MD, i.e. costs and quality adjusted life\n           years\n\n        -  Gain a deeper understanding of the processes behind changes in outcomes We hypothesise\n           that using a structure strategy for housing adaptation and mobility devices case\n           management in ordinary practice in Swedish municipalities increase activity,\n           participation, the usability of the home, and reduces societal costs."
