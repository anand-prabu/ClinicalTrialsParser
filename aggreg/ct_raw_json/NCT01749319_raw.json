All subjects will\n      receive a dose of oral baclofen and a dose of IV baclofen on separate study days.  Whether\n      the oral or intravenous form is given on the first study day will be randomized in a 1:1\n      manner.\n\n      The pharmacokinetic and tolerability information gained from this study will support the\n      development of further studies to assess the use of IV baclofen to prevent or treat baclofen\n      withdrawal syndrome."
