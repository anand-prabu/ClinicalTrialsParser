  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mitral valve reconstruction commonly requires the use of an anuloplasty device to assure
      long-term durability of the repair. Among mitral anuloplasty devices, varying from rigid to
      complete flexible ring substitutes, the most recent ones are aimed to restore the natural
      saddle shape of the mitral annulus, in order to decrease the stress tension on both mitral
      leaflets and chordal attachments. So far, even for flexible ring devices, the sustained
      flexibility of the device remained unproven, probably by cicatricial fibrotic tissue
      ingrowth after implantation.

      Due to specific structural characteristics based on a nitinolstent with carbofilm-coating,
      the MEMO 3D ring device of SORIN claims preservation of the ring flexibility during the
      cardiac cyclus. Consequently, mitral anuloplasty with this device is expected to decrease
      the stress during the systolo-diastolic movements of the valve, and so, improve the late
      durability of the repair.

      Echocardiography is the first-line technique for mitral valve assessment after surgical
      repair, for both intra-operative evaluation and serial follow-up of valve function.
      Recently, three-dimensional echocardiography has been introduced into clinical practice,
      affording qualitative and quantitative measurement of mitral valve function and size during
      the cardiac cycle.This method allows to quantify precisely the excursion of the mitral
      annulus between systole and diastole.

      The aim of this study is to analyse the systolo-diastolic movement of the mitral annulus
      after the use of an anuloplasty with the SORIN MEMO 3D device, after surgical implantation
      and its sustainability, 1 year after implantation.

      This hypothesis is tested in a case-controlled comparison with a standard used rigid ring
      device.

      Therefore, 3-D echocardiography will be performed at the time of surgical repair, and after
      1 year, to define the size and surface change of the mitral anuloplasty device during the
      cardiac cycle.

      Based on a sample size calculation, 10 patients in each comparison group will be included,
      suggesting a study cohort of 20 patients eligible for mitral valve repair.
