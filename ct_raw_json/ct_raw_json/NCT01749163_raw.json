Studies in\n      vitro and in vivo have shown that these incretin hormones also have functional effects in\n      other tissues independent of the insulin secretory response. Both GLP-1 and GIP stimulate\n      insulin secretion in a glucose-dependent manner, however the glucose-dependency of their\n      extra-pancreatic effects has not been examined in vivo. By using pancreatic clamp\n      methodology during euglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions we will test the hypothesis that\n      extra-pancreatic effects of GLP-1 and GIP are glucose-dependent."
