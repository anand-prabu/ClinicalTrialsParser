Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells. Sometimes the\n      transplanted cells are rejected by the body's normal tissues. Drugs such as cyclosporine may\n      prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have chronic myelogenous\n      leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome."

Determine the incidence of nonrelapse mortality at 100 days after allogeneic\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia\n      (CML) or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) treated with fludarabine and busulfan. II. Determine\n      the incidence of donor stem cell engraftment in patients treated with this regimen. III.\n      Determine the incidence and severity of acute graft-vs-host disease in patients treated with\n      this regimen. IV. Determine the incidence of persistent or recurrent CML or MDS in patients\n      treated with this regimen. V. Determine the safety of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive a conditioning regimen comprising fludarabine IV on days -9 to -6\n      and oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -5 to -2. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral\n      blood stem cell transplantation on day 0. Patients receive graft-vs-host disease prophylaxis\n      comprising methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, 6, and 11 and cyclosporine orally or IV twice daily\n      on days -1 to 100 followed by a taper until day 180. Patients are followed every 6 months\n      for 2 years and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1.5 years."
