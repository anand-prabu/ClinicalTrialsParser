A medical professional will see each patient at least once per month while on the device for toxicity assessment, compliance evaluation via downloading of the log-file on the device by the Novocure technician (which involves the technician simply attaching the device to a computer via USB where software reads how many hours per day on each day the device was used), and physical examination. Extent of disease evaluations will occur at baseline, 8 weeks, and then every 8 weeks thereafter. These evaluations will include MRI of the brain with and without contrast and perfusion (or CT head if a patient cannot undergo MRI)."

This study is being done because currently there are no\n      proven effective medical treatments for a progressive meningioma that has failed surgery\n      and/or radiation. The study uses an experimental device called NovoTTF-100A. NovoTTF-100A is\n      \"experimental\" because it has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration\n      (FDA) for this type of tumor, although it has been approved for a different type of tumor."

The scan must be performed within\n             14 days of registration.\n\n          -  Patients must be on a stable or decreased dose of steroids for at least 5 days prior\n             to baseline imaging\n\n          -  Patients with recent resection for recurrent disease must have recovered from the\n             effects of surgery and should not start treatment for at least 28 days after surgery.\n\n          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least 1cm x 1 cm of contrast\n             enhancing disease.\n\n          -  Patients must have received prior radiotherapy for meningioma. Patients may have\n             received standard external beam radiation, interstitial brachytherapy, or\n             radiosurgery in any combination. An interval of > 4 weeks (28 days) must have elapsed\n             from the completion of radiotherapy to study entry and there must be subsequent\n             evidence of tumor progression. Patients with prior interstitial brachytherapy or\n             stereotactic radiosurgery must have confirmation of true progressive disease rather\n             than radiation necrosis based on PET, MR-perfusion, MR-spectroscopy, or surgical\n             documentation of disease. If there is any question, investigators should discuss with\n             the MSKCC PI.\n\n          -  Prior therapy: there is no limit on the number of prior surgeries, radiation therapy\n             treatments, radiosurgery treatments, or chemotherapy.\n\n          -  All patients must be able to provide  informed consent indicating that they are aware\n             of the investigational nature of the study.

Supportive care trials or\n             non-treatment trials (i.e. Quality of life) are allowed.\n\n          -  Pregnancy or breast feeding. Patients must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal, or\n             agree to use effective contraception during the period of therapy. The definition of\n             effective contraception will be based on the judgment of the principal investigator\n             or a designated associate. Male patients must be surgically sterile or agree to\n             effective contraception. Female patients of child bearing potential (ages 11-55) must\n             have a negative B-HCG pregnancy test documented within 14 days prior to registration.\n\n          -  Implanted  medical device such as a pacemaker, defibrillator, deep brain stimulator,\n             or vagus nerve stimulator, or documented significant arrhythmia at the discretion of\n             the investigator.\n\n          -  Evidence of increased intracranial pressure (midline shift >5mm, clinically\n             significant papilledema, vomiting and nausea, or reduced level of consciousness).\n\n          -  Infratentorial meningioma (patients may have infratentorial meningioma if there is\n             concurrent growing supratentorial meningioma that serves as the target lesion)\n\n          -  Coagulopathy (as evidenced by PT or APTT >1.5 times upper limit of normal in patients\n             not undergoing anticoagulation)\n\n          -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count <100x10^3/uL) Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count\n             <1x10^3/uL)\n\n          -  Severe acute infection\n\n          -  Skull defect with missing bone\n\n          -  Ventricular shunt/catheter\n\n          -  Presence of a foreign body intracranially such as a bullet fragment"
