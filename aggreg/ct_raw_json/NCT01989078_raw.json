            "textblock": "Sickle cell nephropathy (SCN) is a progressive complication of sickle cell disease (SCD)\n      that begins in childhood and results in renal (kidney) failure and early mortality in nearly\n      12% of adults with hemoglobin SS (HbSS). The potential for prevention and reversal of kidney\n      damage in SCD is not known.  Albuminuria is a commonly used biomarker of glomerular damage;\n      however the correlations of albuminuria with specific measurements of glomerular function\n      and pathophysiology have not been determined.  The investigators hypothesize that in\n      patients with persistent albuminuria despite treatment of SCD with hydroxyurea, losartan\n      will reverse kidney dysfunction in early stage nephropathy and ameliorate progressive kidney\n      dysfunction in more advanced nephropathy.  The primary aim is to study the acute and\n      longer-term effects of losartan (study drug) on specific glomerular functions in children\n      and adults with SCD who have persistent albuminuria. Research glomerular function tests will\n      be done at study entry (prior to losartan), 1 month, and 1 year after starting losartan\n      therapy. In addition, subjects are seen each month in clinic and assessed by their regular\n      clinical team. The second aim is to assess the correlation of changes in albuminuria after 1\n      month of losartan with changes in direct measurements of glomerular function at 12 months,\n      thus determining if the magnitude of the initial decrease in albuminuria in response to\n      losartan predicts sustained improvements in renal function."
