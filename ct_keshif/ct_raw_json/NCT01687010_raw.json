Inappropriateness of\n      initial antibiotic treatment is an important risk factor for mortality and effective\n      antimicrobial administration within the first hour of documented hypotension was associated\n      with increased survival to hospital discharge in adult patients with septic shock. However,\n      the early treatment based on early diagnosis.But it is very difficult to diagnosis because\n      of lack of specific clinic symptom and sign.When severe sepsis occur, biomarker could be\n      helpful to diagnosis. Unfortunately, the diagnostic value of single biomarker is limited.\n      Therefore, combine several biomarkers could enhance the diagnostic value."
