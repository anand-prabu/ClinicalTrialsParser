            "textblock": "Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. They\n      account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all young people and are the only risk group\n      with an increasing number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden,\n      current HIV prevention programs focus primarily on adults and heterosexual youth. As such,\n      there is an urgent need for evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM. Because\n      issues affecting sexual health decisions among AMSM are unique, intervention programs cannot\n      be translated from heterosexually focused interventions. Instead, they need to be designed\n      from the ground up to ensure appropriately tailored content that resonates with the target\n      population. Evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM are urgently needed.\n\n      The Guy2Guy (G2G) intervention is a text messaging-based HIV prevention program designed for\n      the specific needs of adolescent males who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer (GBQ)\n      and are between the ages of 14-18 years.  The intervention will be tested in a randomized\n      controlled trial against an attention-matched control group which receives text messages\n      about healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition). A total of 184 GBQ adolescent males\n      will be into the study using an online recruitment strategy. The study is being conducted by\n      researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Northwestern University.\n\n      The primary efficacy outcome measure is unprotected anal sex acts at 3-months follow-up. The\n      investigators hypothesize that those in the G2G intervention will be significantly more\n      likely to be engage in HIV preventive behavior (i.e., use condoms when having anal sex) at\n      3-months follow-up compared to the attention-matched control group. Secondary efficacy\n      outcomes include sexual abstinence, and an increase in HIV testing rates.\n\n      If effective, G2G has promise to be quickly and cost-effectively implemented to scale to\n      help to curb the spread of HIV infection among AMSM long into adulthood."
