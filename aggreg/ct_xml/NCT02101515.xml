  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that extending the second stage of labor beyond current ACOG
      suggestions can reduce the cesarean delivery rate. The cesarean delivery rate in the United
      States is around 30 percent. This is a number that continues to be increasing over the last
      few decades and will continue to climb. Cesarean section is the most common surgery
      performed in the United States. Each subsequent cesarean section put the mother and baby at
      increased risk for postpartum hemorrhage, bowel and bladder injury, abnormal placentation,
      febrile morbidity and death. The most common reason for a cesarean delivery is a repeat
      cesarean delivery. One way to reduce this number is to prevent the first cesarean. The aim
      of this study is to reduce the primary cesarean delivery rate, without increasing perinatal
      morbidity.

      1. Consent at the time of admission or in the office

        2. 2nd stage starts at full dilation.

        3. Randomization occurs at 2 hours without epidural, 3 hours with epidural Randomize
           according to a predetermined computer-generated block randomization scheme with block
           sizes of 6,8 and12 (random blocks). Sequentially numbered and sealed opaque envelopes
           prepared according to the randomization scheme and delivered to a secure container in
           labor and delivery suite to maintain concealed treatment allocation. At the 3 hour
           mark, the next number envelope is pulled and opened by the physician/nurse to reveal
           the designated group. At this point the patient is considered randomized.

        4. When time is ended, provider preference for cesarean delivery, operative vaginal
           delivery, continued pushing, with intention-to-treat analysis

        5. Those that require cesarean delivery - usual perioperative management (surgical skin
           preparation with povidone-iodine solution and prophylactic antibiotics).

        6. Early termination criteria: emergency cesarean delivery, category 3 fetal heart tracing
