In\n      the second treatment arm, patients are further randomized to receive HU beginning at\n      Baseline, when ABC/EFV/ddI is started, or at Week 8. Delaying HU may help offset the\n      cytopenic effect of HU, as reflected in a blunted CD4 cell response. Patients are stratified\n      according to their screening plasma HIV-1 RNA level (400 to 10,000 copies/ml and more than\n      10,000 to 100,000 copies/ml). Participants in the study receive study-related exams, lab\n      tests, and study medications at no cost over the 48-week treatment period. The safety and\n      effectiveness of the non-protease inhibitor rescue therapy is evaluated routinely by\n      measuring viral load and the CD4 cell count, as well as the side effects caused by the\n      medications. All of the medications are approved by the FDA and are not considered\n      investigational."
