The study will also examine impact of test results on subsequent\n      clinical decisions regarding choice of therapy.  The planned duration of the study is at\n      least 2 years with 1 year for patient recruitment and a minimum 1-year follow-up period for\n      each patient.  Any patient  for whom the treating physician has ordered a FoundationOne\u2122\n      test and a report is delivered is eligible for participation on the study. Eligible patients\n      from participating sites will be enrolled sequentially during the 1-year enrollment period.\n      Sites will be required to maintain an enrollment log of all patients for whom the\n      FoundationOne\u2122 test has been ordered and document patient disposition and reasons for\n      non-participation. All treatment decisions and clinical assessment will be made at the\n      discretion of the treating physician per usual care and are not mandated by study design or\n      protocol.  Informed consent will be obtained from eligible patients prior to study entry."

            "textblock": "Molecular testing of tumors, using techniques such as next-generation sequencing (NGS),\n      facilitates an individualized approach to cancer treatment by sub-classifying diseases on an\n      individual basis.  Physicians can utilize an in depth understanding of disease at a\n      molecular level to optimize therapy by selecting the most appropriate drugs and therapeutic\n      targets.  Genomic profiling has identified multiple genomic aberrations that are predictive\n      markers for treatment response with targeted therapeutics.\n\n      FoundationOne\u2122 is a commercially available molecular diagnostics test, for all solid tumor\n      types, that analyzes routine clinical specimens for somatic alterations in relevant\n      cancer-related genes.  This validated  in vitro diagnostic test, is performed in a single\n      Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified and College of American\n      Pathologists (CAP) approved laboratory at Foundation Medicine, Inc.  It provides\n      individualized, potentially actionable information regarding a patient's molecular cancer\n      subtype  that can be used by physicians to tailor treatment options.\n\n      With the recent commercial availability of the FoundationOne\u2122 test, knowledge gaps exist\n      regarding practice patterns associated with the use of this test in routine clinical\n      practice and  the impact of this test on clinical decision making.  There is limited\n      information regarding physician and patient characteristics that determine which patients\n      receive the test, rationale for patient selection, and how physicians interpret and use the\n      test results.  Findings from this study will help to optimize patient selection and maximize\n      the clinical impact of the test in terms of guiding therapy."
