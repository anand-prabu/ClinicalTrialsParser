  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a sex hormone called progesterone is helpful
      in reducing cigarette smoking and craving for cigarettes. This study also includes brain
      imaging to measure possible effects of progesterone on certain neurochemicals. These
      neurochemicals are called gamma-aminobutyric acid (or GABA for short) and glutamate. Both
      nicotine and progesterone affect these brain chemicals.

      Individuals wishing to participate in this study must be medically healthy men or women who
      smoke at least 10 cigarettes per day or greater. Participants must not suffer from a mental
      illness or use drugs other than nicotine. Participants cannot have any implanted metallic
      devices such as pacemakers, orthodontic braces, or shrapnel. Participants must not have
      peanut allergies and must never have had a reaction to progesterone. Finally, participants
      cannot be taking any medications for anxiety, depression or insomnia.

      Women: Female participants cannot have taken a hormonal contraceptive in the past six
      months.

    <description>Occipital cortex GABA and glutamate concentrations pre and post placebo administration. GABA and glutamate concentrations will be obtained using the non-invasive neuroimaging method of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS) both before and after placebo administration and smoking abstinence. In total subjects will undergo 6 1H-MRS scans.
The 6 1H-MRS scans take place over a period of approximately 1-2 months. Each paradigm (placebo/progesterone) takes approximately one week, with a two-week wash in between paradigms for men and a 1 month wash in between paradigms for women. The subject will undergo a smoking session on Test Day #1 and Test Day #5, MRS scans are conducted on Test Day #2 (2 scans) and Test Day #5 (1 scan).</description>

    <description>Withdrawal symptoms will be measured using the Nicotine Withdrawal Symptoms Checklist (NWSC). Craving will be assessed using the Brief Questionnaire on Smoking Urges (BQSU) and the Tiffany Questionnaire for Smoking Urges and mood will be assessed using a variety of ratings including the Profile of Mood States (POMS), the Visual Analogue  Scale (VAS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Scales (PANAS). Effects of nicotine will be assessed using the Nicotine Effects Questionnaire (NEQ). Premenstrual syndrome symptoms will be assessed daily during the screening and study phases using the Daily Record of Severity of Problems (DRSP).</description>
