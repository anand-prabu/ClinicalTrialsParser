A superior efficacy in PFS,ORR and OS of FOLFOXIRI has\n      been reported with acceptable toxicity. Moreover,evidence suggests that continuous dosing\n      metronomic chemotherapy may be more efficacious than interval-chemotherapy.\n\n      Therefore, a way to improve the outcome of metastatic colorectal cancer patients could be to\n      administer a maintenance first-line regimen containing the three active agents."
