In the Phase II randomized study, patients are treated with the melanoma\n      peptide vaccine alone, with CTLA-4 antibody, or with CTLA-4 antibody combined with IL-12 at\n      30 ng/kg with alum. The peptides are tyrosinase 368-376 (370D); gp100 209-217 (210M); and\n      MART-1 26-35 (27L) which are emulsified with IFA. The dosing schedule for both trials are at\n      1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 months; then at 9 and 12 for a total of 8 vaccinations."
