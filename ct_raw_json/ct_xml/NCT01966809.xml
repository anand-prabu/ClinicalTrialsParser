  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be aimed at investigating the effectiveness of a treatment for brain tumors
      called Photodynamic Therapy, or PDT. Briefly, a subject will receive a light-sensitive drug,
      called Photofrin®, the day before a tumor removal surgery. The next day, after the tumor is
      removed, red light from a laser will be shone into the tumor cavity through a
      light-diffusing sphere. This light will activate the photosensitizer, and possibly kill any
      tumor cells that may be left.

      We plan to measure how long the subject may go without a new tumor regrowth, and overall how
      long subjects survive. We will compare these results to typical results to see if we are
      seeing any improvements.

      Objective: To define the antitumor activity of Photofrin® and laser light activation within
      the confines of a Phase II study.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a well-known treatment for other type of tumors; however it is
      an experimental treatment for brain tumors. There is much we do not know about the
      effectiveness of PDT in patients with brain tumors. The purpose of this study is to define
      the antitumor activity of Photofrin® and laser light activation.  Photofrin® is a
      photosensitizing drug (a dye that is activated by light) used in PDT. We want to test the
      activity of PDT and to see what are the effects (good and bad) on you and your brain tumor.
      We also want to learn if this treatment will cause brain tumors to shrink and whether it
      will help patients with brain tumors to live longer.

      PDT is a cancer treatment that involves giving a photosensitive dye (Photofrin®), into your
      vein through a tube (called an IV). This dye will go inside of the cancer cells more than it
      will go inside the normal, healthy cells. PDT using Photofrin® is an approved treatment in
      patients with certain types of cancer such as lung, and esophageal (from the mouth to the
      stomach) cancers.

      Everyone in this study will receive Photofrin® (porfimer sodium) for injection (Pinnacle
      Biologics, Inc., Bannockburn, IL, USA), and be treated with red light emitted by a red
      laser. The light will be sent from the laser to the surface of the brain where the tumor is
      located using a light transmitting fiber. The fiber will have  a knob at the end that
      spreads the light out evenly in all directions.

      Previous studies have shown that patients with malignant brain tumors called gliomas had a
      good response to PDT. The patients in these studies lived longer than they were expected to
      live. In one study of adults with brain tumors in Australia, patients given PDT had greatly
      improved survival rates. Fifty seven percent (57%) of the patients with gliomas called
      anaplastic astrocytoma survived for 36 months. Thirty seven percent (37%) of the patients
      with gliomas called glioblastoma multiforme survived for 36 months. Froedtert Hospital, in
      Milwaukee WI, has been involved in PDT studies in adults in the past. This current study is
      is being done in a very similar way to the study done in Australia, and will use increased
      Photofrin®) and light doses than our previous study.

    <description>The subjects will receive a dose of 2.5 mg/kg of Photofrin intravenously 24 hours before planned surgical resection. Tumor resection will be carried out in the standard fashion in order to achieve the maximum tumor resection compatible with preservation of neurological function. After resection, Intralipid will be infused into the craniotomy and kept for approximately 45 min, while PDT will be performed. The illumination time will be calculated from the power density (mW) emitted by the laser and the radius (r) of the cavity to deliver a total light dose of 240 J/cm2 at a using the following formula:
Treatment Time (sec) = Light dose (J/cm2) x Cavity surface (cm2) x 1000 Power density (mW) Cavity Surface (cm2) = 4 x 3.14 x r2 The optical fiber will be placed in the center of the surgical cavity and photoillumination will commence. After PDT, the Intralipid solution will be removed and the wound will be closed. The subject will be sent to the intensive care area for recovery.</description>
