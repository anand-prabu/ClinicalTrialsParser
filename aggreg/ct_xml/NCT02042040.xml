  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a lack of safety data regarding the combination of radiation and vemurafenib.  The
      lack of data is due to the early and late stage clinical studies with vemurafenib excluding
      concomitant or closely scheduled radiation therapy.   There have been anecdotal observations
      of increased radiotoxicity when giving full doses of radiation therapy concomitantly with
      vemurafenib.  The rate of these reactions is presently not known nor is the mechanism,
      though the toxicity may be due to radiation enhancement.  Therefore, there is a pressing
      need for information and guidance for a clinical scenario that will become very common now
      that vemurafenib is approved by the FDA and widely used in the community.  Furthermore,
      future studies in melanoma using radiation combined with BRAF inhibition will be possible
      only after good safety data are established.

      Although highly successful in creating tumor responses in BRAFV600 mutant metastatic
      melanoma, the progression free survival remains, on average, 6 months with vemurafenib.  A
      very common emerging problem exists when patients have had a dramatic tumor response to
      vemurafenib at multiple sites, but later progress in a few areas which may be symptomatic;
      this scenario can be defined as oligoprogressive disease.  Of those vemurafenib treated
      patients who have progressive disease, the percentage of patients who progress in this way
      is approximately 45%.  A common and widely used approach to treat oligoprogressions for
      melanoma patients on other chemotherapy or immunotherapy is to treat the progressive or
      symptomatic areas with radiation or surgery, while continuing on a systemic treatment which
      has overall clinical benefit to the patient.  Small numbers of patients with
      oligoprogressions on vemurafenib have been treated with radiation and/or surgery and have
      enjoyed significant progression free survival.  In fact those eligible for this approach had
      a median overall survival of &gt;9.1 months vs. 3.4 months for those who did not undergo local
      therapy and resume vemurafenib due to multiple progressing areas.  Furthermore, the patients
      in the oligoprogressive population (73% Stage IV M1c), had a median OS of &gt;25.5 months which
      is more than would be expected for patients with disease this advanced.  The longer term
      follow up of these patients will be reported soon.  These preliminary data suggest that
      treating oligoprogressions with local therapy followed by continued vemurafenib will be
      advantageous.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  Diagnosis of BRAFV600 mutated Stage IV or unresectable Stage III melanoma

          -  Actively receiving treatment with vemurafenib as single agent and tolerating at least
             720 mg bid for one cycle (28 days).

          -  In the opinion of the investigator, patients who are progressing in an area where
             radiation may provide benefit from either:

               -  Symptom control

               -  Oligo-progression, defined as progression in up to 3 areas where focal treatment
                  would provide benefit.

          -  Patients with brain metastases will be allowed provided they meet all of the
             following criteria:

               -  Small, &lt; 1cm metastases which are untreated are allowed so long as in the
                  opinion of the investigator they do not require immediate treatment by radiation
                  or surgery

               -  Asymptomatic, treated brain metastases which are stable for 4 weeks prior to
                  study entry are allowed

               -  If patients are requiring steroids for their brain metastases, they must be on a
                  stable dose for two weeks prior to study entry, and maintain that steroid dosing
                  during the radiation treatments

          -  Adequate bone marrow function as defined by: ANC &gt; 1.0 k/uL, Platlets &gt; 100 k/uL,
             Hemoglobin  &gt; 9 g/dL

          -  Adequate hepatic function: Total bilirubin &lt; 1.5 times the institutional upper limit
             of normal, ALT/AST &lt; 2.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal

          -  Adequate renal function as defined by serum creatinine &lt; 1.5 times the upper limit of
             normal.

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test at screening for women of child bearing potential
