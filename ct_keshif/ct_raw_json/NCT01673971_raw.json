            "textblock": "Infantile hemangiomas (IH) are common vascular growths that frequently arise in infants. The\n      clinical presentation is variable, and some hemangiomas have the potential to cause\n      disfiguring and even lifethreatening complications. While there is no FDA approved treatment\n      for IH, certain medications have been shown to be effective in shrinking the growths.\n      Unfortunately, there is no objective tool to monitor IH or to guide treatment. Such a tool\n      would improve the management of these patients. A new handheld wireless device uses diffuse\n      optical imaging (DOI) technology to measure blood flow characteristics.\n\n      The device has been used in studies to assess patients with breast cancer.  Optical\n      tomography has also been increasingly used to assess neurological function and pathology in\n      newborn infants.\n\n      The goal of the investigators' study is to assess the utility of DOI for characterizing and\n      monitoring IH. Fifteen IH will be assessed at three points in time as part of this study,\n      comprising two groups: 'Natural History' and 'Treatment'. DOI measurements will be\n      correlated with clinical findings and existing ultrasound measurements of the IH."
