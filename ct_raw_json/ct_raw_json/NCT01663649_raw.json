All participants receive\n      free-of-charge online access to deprexis either immediately or with a six month delay.\n\n      At three time points (1. prior to intervention, 2. after completion of the intervention nine\n      weeks later and 3. at follow-up six month later), both groups are assessed via an anonymous\n      online survey, which was implemented using the software package OPST\u00ae.\n\n      The survey consists of different questionnaires. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)\n      represents the primary outcome (IIT analysis for pre versus post). It is assumed that the\n      severity of depressive symptoms will improve to a significantly greater extent in the\n      deprexis than in the wait-list control condition in the course of nine weeks and will be\n      maintained in a six month follow-up."

The ten modules are framed by one introductory\n      and one summary module. Communication is carried out online via simulated dialogues.\n      Patients have to respond to narrative text messages from the virtual therapists in\n      multiple-choice response fashion, enabling them to express doubt, to affirm a particular\n      message or to request more information. Text messages are aided with drawings, photographs\n      and animations. The program is adaptive and selects exercises and contents on the basis of\n      the subject's response. The modules are sequential and each module refers and builds upon\n      previous one. Modules can (and should be) repeated within the intervention period."
