      The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of T-817MA as measured by ADAS-cog and
      ADCS-CGIC.

      The secondary objectives are:

        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of T-817MA measured by clinical safety
           laboratories, physical examinations, ECGs and solicitation of adverse events.

        -  To evaluate the efficacy of T-817MA as measured by ADCS-ADL, FAQ, Neuropsychiatric
           Inventory (NPI) and Mini-mental State Examination (MMSE).
