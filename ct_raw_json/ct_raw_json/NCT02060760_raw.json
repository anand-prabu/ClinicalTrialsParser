Investigators will\n      assess the assay's ability to diagnose AMI earlier and to rule out AMI earlier. The\n      sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of the\n      hs-cTnI assay will be evaluated with both a universal cut off as well as with gender and\n      potentially age derived 99th percentile upper reference limits (URL).\n\n      Investigators will evaluate delta hs-cTnI values (pre-specified absolute concentration and\n      percent changes over time) for their ability to contribute to the negative predictive value\n      and hence potentially lead to an earlier rule out of AMI (improved specificity).\n      Additionally, investigators will assess delta changes of the hs-cTnI assay for their\n      potential contribution to the clinical differentiation of type 1 and type 2 (supply demand\n      mismatch) MIs.\n\n      Lastly, investigators will compare the diagnosis of AMI based on the currently used\n      contemporary assay to the hs-assay, to assess both the incidence of AMI as well as for the\n      time to diagnosis."
