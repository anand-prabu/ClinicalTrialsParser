    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to find out what effects (good or bad) the drugs
      auranofin and sirolimus have on patients with lung cancer; to find out if auranofin and
      sirolimus can stop or slow the growth of the lung cancer; to learn more about how auranafin
      and sirolimus work against lung cancer by testing blood and tissue samples.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the progression-free survival at four months of patients treated with
      maintenance auranafin plus sirolimus after non-progression on first line platinum based
      chemotherapy for stage IV squamous histology non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the overall survival in this population in comparison to recent historical
      controls (exemplified by survival of the squamous histology cohort of the Scagliotti et al
      trial of cisplatin with pemetrexed or gemcitabine for advanced NSCLC).

      II. To determine the adverse events (AE) profile and safety of the regimen. III. To
      determine the overall response rate, per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
      (RECIST) criteria, and duration of tumor response in this population in patients with
      measurable disease.

      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the relationship between molecular correlates and progression free survival
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), response and toxicity.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive auranofin and sirolimus orally (PO) on days 1-28 of each cycle. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3-6 months for up to 2
      years.

    <description>A patient is considered to be a 4-month progression-free survivor, or success, if the patient is 4 months from registration without a documentation of disease progression. The proportion of successes will be estimated by the number of successes divided by the total number of evaluable patients. Confidence intervals for the true success proportion will be calculated using the properties of the binomial distribution. Additionally, an estimate and confidence interval for the 4-month progression-free survival rate incorporating censoring may be computed using the method of Kaplan-Meier.</description>
