            "textblock": "The most common communication complaint of older adults with impaired hearing is that they\n      can hear speech, but can't understand it.  This is especially true where there are competing\n      sounds in the background.  Previous experiments performed under laboratory settings using a\n      novel word-based auditory-training regimen have demonstrated substantial improvements in\n      open-set recognition of words and sentences in noise.  The current proposed study will\n      investigate the effectiveness of the training regimen when used in a patient's home setting\n      with their own hearing aids.    All testing for the screening, baseline speech testing,\n      training system orientation, and the outcomes portions of this project will be conducted in\n      the Audiology Research Laboratory (ARL) of the Speech and Hearing Center located at 200\n      South Jordan Avenue.  The use of the training program will be done at the subject's home.\n\n      Subjects will first come to the ARL for either one session for a hearing aid follow-up and\n      instruction in the use of the training system (Session 1) or for one session for an initial\n      screening to determine eligibility (Screening) followed then by Session 1. Subjects will\n      then take home a training system that includes a tablet computer that has the training\n      program loaded onto it, a portable loudspeaker, and some accessories. There will be three\n      groups of subjects: (1) Hearing aid alone--no training (passive control); (2) Hearing aid\n      plus auditory training (training); and (3) Hearing aid plus audio book use (active control).\n       Each group will include 40 subjects. Those subjects in the training group and active\n      control group will complete two five-week cycles of training and  return to the lab for\n      outcome measures after 10 weeks of training for the primary and secondary outcome measures.\n      The hearing aid alone group will return for the same outcome measures as the training and\n      active control groups, but will have no intervention between these follow-up sessions."
