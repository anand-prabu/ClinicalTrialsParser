Patients may be eligible\n                  if there are definite or equivocal findings of persistent or metastatic disease\n                  as long as those findings do not meet RECIST criteria for measurable disease\n\n          -  Patients may have had one or more prior therapies for melanoma.\n\n          -  Patients may have had multiple primary melanomas.\n\n          -  Patients who have had brain metastases may be eligible if they meet the following\n             criteria\n\n          -  Patients with less than or equal to 5 metastases may be eligible as long as the\n             following 3 criteria are true:\n\n          -  The brain metastases have been completely removed by surgery or have been treated\n             completely by stereotactic radiotherapy.
