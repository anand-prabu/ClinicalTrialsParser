The study objectives are to evaluate feasibility of the treatment and to\n      examine effectiveness of CPT and smoking cessation treatment combined compared to smoking\n      cessation treatment without CPT. Fifty Veteran smokers with PTSD will participate in\n      fourteen study sessions, ending with the final follow-up session six months after the\n      scheduled quit date."

            "textblock": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and cigarette smoking are both associated with\n      significant impairment in Veterans and cost to the Veterans' Affairs (VA) system. Though\n      naturalistic and laboratory studies suggest smoking is linked with PTSD symptoms, existing\n      smoking cessation treatments targeting PTSD smokers have not utilized standardized,\n      evidence-based PTSD treatment. The most effective smoking cessation approach to date for\n      PTSD smokers, Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC), relies on delivery of smoking\n      cessation treatment by the individual's PTSD treatment provider. In a recent trial comparing\n      ICSC to VA specialty Smoking Cessation Clinic care, ICSC produced significantly better\n      prolonged smoking abstinence. However, ICSC was associated with only modest improvements in\n      PTSD symptoms, with no difference between ICSC and smoking cessation treatment alone,\n      suggesting a likely avenue for improving ICSC. We have developed an intervention that\n      combines evidence based treatment for PTSD [cognitive processing therapy (CPT-C)] with\n      evidence based smoking cessation for PTSD [Integrated Care for Smoking Cessation (ICSC)] and\n      a mobile text messaging program. The primary aim of the proposed study is to evaluate the\n      integration of CPT-C and smoking cessation treatment in an individual 12-session PTSD\n      protocol as compared to a protocol including the same smoking cessation treatment for\n      individuals with PTSD, but without CPT-C. This intervention will be evaluated with the\n      following hypotheses:\n\n        1. Compared to the smoking cessation alone protocol, the smoking cessation + concurrent\n           CPT-C protocol will result in reduced frequency and intensity of PTSD symptoms.\n\n        2. Compared to the smoking cessation alone protocol, the smoking cessation + concurrent\n           CPT-C protocol will result in reduced depressive symptoms.\n\n        3. The smoking cessation + concurrent CPT-C protocol will result in decreased smoking\n           rates, relative to published data on VA smoking cessation usual care.\n\n        4. Greater PTSD symptom reduction during the smoking cessation + concurrent CPT-C\n           treatment will result in longer duration to smoking lapse and relapse.\n\n        5. Exploratory research question: Will candidate genes described earlier predict treatment\n           response in smokers with PTSD?\n\n        6. Exploratory research question: Will use of automated text messaging as an adjunct to\n           smoking cessation be feasible, and will it impact quit rates?\n\n      The development of a combined CPT-C/ICSC intervention with established empirical support\n      would benefit the many Veterans with PTSD who smoke by providing them with treatment of two\n      pervasive problems with significant associated impairment. In addition, this treatment could\n      substantially reduce the cost of administering two individual treatments separately by\n      administering them in combination."
