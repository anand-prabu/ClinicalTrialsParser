  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Treponema pallidum, the bacterium that causes syphilis, invades the central nervous system
      in about 40% of patients with syphilis. This happens early after infection. Patients with
      neuroinvasion are at risk of developing serious neurological complications, including vision
      or hearing loss, stroke and dementia. Because neuroinvasion can happen without symptoms, the
      only way to identify it is by performing a lumbar puncture (LP) to examine cerebrospinal
      fluid (CSF).The overall hypothesis to be tested in this study is that a strategy of
      immediate LP, followed by therapy based on CSF evaluation, results in better serological and
      functional outcomes in HIV-infected patients with syphilis who are at high risk for
      neuroinvasion.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Males and females age 18 years or older

          2. Current syphilis defined as:

             • Reactive serum Rapid Plasma Reagin (RPR) test with a) no history of syphilis; or b)
             most recent prior RPR or Venereal Diseases Research Laboratory (VDRL) test
             nonreactive; or c) a 4-fold increase in RPR titer, and d) a reactive treponemal
             serological test

          3. Documented HIV infection

          4. Primary language is English or, if English is a second language, it was acquired at
             age ≤5 years

          5. Able to provide informed consent

          6. If treated with benzathine penicillin G (BPG), it must have occurred less than 14
             days before the entry visit (before the first visit if there is more than one entry
             visit)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Provider plans neurosyphilis (NS) treatment regardless of whether the patient has an
             lumbar puncture (LP)

          2. Receipt of antibiotic treatment that would be effective for NS (for example, IV or
             intramuscular (IM) beta-lactam antibiotics [other than BPG]) within one month before
             study entry

          3. Allergy to penicillin or lidocaine

          4. Contraindication to LP, including untreatable coagulation disorder, use of
             anticoagulants that cannot be temporarily discontinued, thrombocytopenia, focal
             neurological examination

          5. Other known cause of central nervous system (CNS) infection in the last year,
             including that due to bacterial, fungal, protozoal or viral agents, such as
             tuberculosis, Cryptococcus, toxoplasmosis or herpes zoster that could confound
             interpretation of CSF results

          6. Unlikely to be able to comply with study requirements or complete the study, for
             example, planning to leave the area &lt; 6 months after enrollment

          7. Subjects will not be allowed to re-enroll in this study with a new episode of
             syphilis
