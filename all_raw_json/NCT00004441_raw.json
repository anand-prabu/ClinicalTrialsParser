Twenty-four patients are randomized\n      to receive one of three different doses of TUDCA for 3 months.\n\n      Objective II:  This part of the study is a double-blind crossover study to compare optimized\n      doses of TUDCA with optimized doses of ursodiol in 15 patients stratified according to age\n      (less than 10 vs 10-20 vs more than 20 years).  Patients are randomized to receive either\n      TUDCA or ursodiol orally for an initial 3 month period, followed by a 3 month washout period\n      in which no drug is administered.  Patients then receive the alternate drug for 3 months."
