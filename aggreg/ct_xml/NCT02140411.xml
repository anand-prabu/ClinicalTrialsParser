  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lucentis® (ranibizumab) is a humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)
      monoclonal antibody fragment approved in Chile by the Instituto de Salud Pública for the
      treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME), retinal vein occlusion and age-related macular
      degeneration.

      Currently, there is limited epidemiologic information in Chile regarding the incidence of
      DME and limited experience of anti-VEGF hospital therapy. This study will evaluate the
      efficacy of intravitreal ranibizumab in Chilean DME patients, to investigate the anatomical
      and functional improvement following this treatment and to increase the local experience
      regarding the use of anti-VEGF in the treatment of diabetic macular edema.

    <description>Best-Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) letters was measured using Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (EDTRS)-like chart while participants were in a sitting position at a testing distance of 4 meters. The range of EDTRS is 0 to 100 letters. A positive change from baseline of BCVA indicates improvement.</description>

    <description>VFQ-25 scores are grouped into 12 subscales or domains: 11 of which are related to vision general health, global vision rating, ocular pain, difficulty with near vision activities, difficulty with distance vision activities, limitations in social functioning due to vision, mental health symptoms due to vision, role limitations due to vision, dependency on others due to vision, driving difficulties, limitations with color vision and limitations with peripheral vision. The final subscale is a single-item rating of general health. An overall composite score is also computed.</description>
