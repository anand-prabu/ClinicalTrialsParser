      Researchers at Arkansas Children's Hospital Research Institute are conducting a study about
      mitochondrial function in children. The study involves 2 visits to Arkansas Children's
      Hospital with fasting blood draws and behavioral assessments.

      Patients may be eligible to participate if he or she is between the ages of 0‐17 years

      And falls into one of the following groups:

        -  Is Typically Developing with no known problems   OR

        -  Has a history of Developmental Delay   OR

        -  Has been diagnosed with an Autism Spectrum Disorder   OR

        -  Has a history of a Mitochondrial Disease.

      There is no cost for visits or study‐related exams. Participants will receive gift cards as
      compensation for their time.

      For further information, please contact the program manager, John Slattery, at

      Objective: The main objective of this proposal is to develop a minimally-invasive biological
      assay that can be widely used to identify variations in mitochondrial function and
      dysfunction in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This assay will allow the
      investigators to determine the true range of mitochondrial function and dysfunction across a
      population of children with ASD. The relationship between mitochondrial function and
      dysfunction in ASD, redox metabolism and core ASD symptomology will also be investigated. To
      understand the true variation in mitochondrial function and its relationship to cognitive
      development and autism symptoms, participants will be evaluated at two time points to
      understand the within subject variation of mitochondrial measurements.

      Specific Aims: 1) To develop a minimally-invasive assay that can accurately identify
      children with ASD/MD from the general ASD population. 2) To establish whether there is
      simply an ASD/MD subgroup or whether mitochondrial dysfunction occurs on a spectrum from
      mild to severe in ASD. 3) To determine the relationship between mitochondrial function and
      redox metabolism in children with ASD. 4) To evaluate the effect of mitochondrial
      dysfunction and glutathione redox status on language and social development and ASD
      symptoms.

      Study Design: Using the Seahorse Analyzer, investigators will develop profiles of
      mitochondrial function for individuals with ASD and known MD (ASD/MD) and individuals with
      ASD known not to have MD (ASD/NoMD). These two groups will serve as the two ends of the
      spectrum of mitochondrial function in children with ASD and will be compared to profiles
      from TD children. Investigators will then examine the profiles of mitochondrial function in
      a general population of individuals with ASD to determine how these individuals fall into
      this spectrum defined by the ASD/MD and ASD/NoMD groups, as well as DD and no ASD/MD.
      Glutathione redox metabolism will be measured in all participants. The relationship between
      mitochondrial function, redox metabolism and core ASD symptoms will be studied in the ASD
      groups with particular attention to whether ASD symptoms, language ability and adaptive
      behavior are directly related to mitochondrial function or indirectly related to
      mitochondrial function through its effect on redox metabolism.

      Study Population: Investigators will recruit several groups of children for this study: 50
      children with ASD who have MD (ASD/MD); 50 children with ASD who do not have MD (ASD/NoMD);
      50 no ASD/MD; 50 no ASD/no MD but DD; 50 TD controls; and a general population of 150
      children with ASD.

      Children with ASD with and without MD will be identified in the autism multispecialty clinic
      (AMC), as well as the ATN and other medical clinics that evaluate children with ASD in
      outpatient clinics in Arkansas.  When a child is identified, the study coordinator will
      contact the parents and describe the study. If the parents are interested, the coordinator
      will screen by asking inclusion/exclusion criteria questions. If the child qualifies, the
      coordinator will schedule the visit and mail consent forms to the parents for their review.
      During the visit they will undergo a blood draw for metabolic testing. The child will then
      be sent to breakfast since the blood tests require collection prior to breakfast. After
      breakfast the participant will undergo further language and behavioral assessment while the
      parent will be interviewed for the Vineland and other questionnaires. The parents will be
      provided questionnaires for the teacher to fill out and mail in an addressed, postage paid
      envelope.

      For the TD participants, these children will be recruited in several ways including using
      social media through Arkansas Children's Hospital, flyers posted in the community (i.e.
      primary pediatric clinics), as well as referrals from pediatricians. When a child is
      identified, the study coordinator will contact the parents and describe the study. If the
      parents are interested, the coordinator will screen by asking inclusion/exclusion criteria
      questions. If the child qualifies, the coordinator will schedule the visit and mail consent
      forms to the parents for their review. During the visit they will undergo a blood draw for
      metabolic testing.

    <description>Children with ASD will be differentiated from all other cohorts and have a specific pattern of mitochondrial dysfunction that will be different from and comparable to other groups of children in the study (e.g. mitochondrial disease without autism, typically developing, autism with mitochondrial disease, and developmental delay). It is hypothesized that these children will have a more pronounced delay in their development and will have a higher probability for poor developmental and behavioral outcomes. This will be evaluated using a Seahorse VR flux analyzer to generate a maximal reserve capacity value.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Inclusion Criteria for ASD children

          1. Autism Spectrum Disorder (As defined by a gold standard measure for ASD diagnosis:
             the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, Autism Diagnostic Interview, and/or the
             minimum Arkansas state requirement for autism classification, as defined by a
             consensus diagnosis of ASD by a medical doctor, speech pathologist, and
             psychologist.). In an event where sufficient diagnostic information is lacking, and
             the PI believes that the clients meet all other inclusion criteria and a prospective
             diagnosis of an ASD is clinically warranted, and a formal diagnosis is scheduled to
             occur within a reasonable time frame from the date of study entry, then the client
             may be considered as potentially eligible.
