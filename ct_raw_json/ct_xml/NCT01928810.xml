  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical activity (treadmill) prior to in-vivo exposure supports the effect of cognitive
      behavioural therapy in patients with panic disorder and agoraphobia.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients receive a 12-session manualized cognitive behavioural therapy, implemented over 7
      weeks and followed by two booster sessions. Five sessions consist of in-vivo exposures.
      Prior to these sessions patients undergo a training of physical activity. Half of the
      patients complete training on a treadmill at 70% of their maximal oxygen uptake while the
      other half complete training at 30%.
