  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled Trial to evaluate effect of a culturally and linguistically
      tailored, telephone-delivered behavioral intervention on adherence to recommended assessment
      and treatment of sleep apnea in Blacks with Metabolic Syndrome. The investigators believe
      low awareness of Sleep Apnea and the risk it imposes to an individual health plays an
      important role in underdiagnosis and low adherence to treatment among Blacks. Hence,
      culturally and linguistically tailored health education will decrease the knowledge gap and
      improve adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep Apnea. the investigators
      believe the effect of adherence to treatment of Sleep apnea is shown to improve the
      components of Metabolic syndrome and hence promote well control of Hypertension, Diabetes,
      weight, triglyceride and cholesterol.

      Primary aim: To evaluate effect of a culturally and linguistically tailored,
      telephone-delivered behavioral intervention, versus an attention-control condition, on
      adherence to recommended assessment and treatment of sleep apnea.

      Secondary aims: 1) To evaluate the maintenance of intervention effects on adherence 6 months
      post-intervention; and 2) To assess treatment effects on components of the metabolic
      syndrome (waist circumference, blood pressure, lipid level, and fasting plasma
      glucose/HbA1C).

      Exploratory aim: To identify the mediators of adherence to recommended sleep apnea
      assessment and treatment following exposure to the intervention.
