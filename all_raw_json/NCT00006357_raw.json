Determine the pharmacokinetic\n      profile of this treatment regimen in these patients. III. Determine the objective response\n      and duration of response in these patients with this treatment regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation and dose efficacy, multicenter study. In the dose\n      efficacy portion, patients are stratified according to disease type (gastrointestinal\n      stromal tumor vs all other soft tissue sarcomas). Phase I: Patients receive oral STI571\n      daily for a maximum of 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-8 patients receive escalating doses of STI571 until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6-8\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicities. The recommended phase II dose is defined as\n      the dose preceding the MTD. Phase II: Patients receive the recommended phase II dose of\n      STI571 as in phase I. Patients are followed every 8 weeks until disease progression, and\n      then every 16 weeks thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 47-72 patients (7-32 in phase I and 40 in phase II) will be\n      accrued for this study."
