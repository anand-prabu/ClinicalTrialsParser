There are also reports using higher doses of intranasal\n      dexmedetomidine. The investigators compared the sedative effect of 1ug/kg intranasal\n      dexmedetomidine with those of 2 ug/kg for ophthalmic examinations in children aged 2\n      months-10 years and hypothesised that the higher dose would produce satisfactory sedation in\n      more children at the time of anaesthetic induction."
