            "textblock": "The colonic microbiome is essential in human health and disease. Clostridium\n      difficile-associated diarrhea (CDAD), a highly morbid form of infectious diarrhea, is caused\n      by antibiotics which perturb the microbiome and allow C. difficile to proliferate. Proton\n      pump inhibitors (PPIs) are powerful suppressors of gastric acid and among the most common\n      medicines in the United States. Dozens of observational studies show that longterm PPI use\n      is associated with CDAD. However, the mechanism by which PPIs cause CDAD is unknown. We\n      believe that PPIs cause CDAD by inducing alterations in the human colonic microbiome. We\n      will confirm or refute the hypothesized mechanism for the association between PPIs and CDAD\n      using an unblinded, single-armed study design. We will use pyrosequencing of the\n      hypervariable V4 region of the bacterial 16S ribosomal subunit gene in human fecal samples\n      to describe the colonic flora. We will collect fecal samples from volunteers before and\n      after PPIs given for different durations and test the microbiome to determine 1) whether\n      PPIs diminish overall diversity, 2) whether PPIs diminish relative abundance of\n      Bacteroidetes, 3) whether increased duration of PPIs affects diversity, and 4) whether there\n      is recovery of diversity after completing a defined course of PPIs. We believe that PPIs\n      will cause a pattern of diminished overall microbiome diversity and reduced anaerobes \u2014 the\n      same pattern seen after use of antibiotics. Furthermore, we believe that increased PPI\n      duration will further diminish diversity and that the microbiome will return to pre-PPI\n      levels of diversity after PPIs are stopped. These results will facilitate biologically-based\n      clinical interventions to reduce rates of CDAD among patients who require acid suppression."

Subsequently, subjects will be randomized to receive an additional 4 weeks\n      of PPIs or no therapy.
