  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute Bacterial Rhinosinusitis (ABRS) is a respiratory inflammation commonly seen in
      clinical practice, which has with respiratory symptoms including nasal congestion,
      rhinorrhoea, postnasal discharge and cough and is associated with headache, cheek pain,
      facial pressure and other conditions. The principal bacterial pathogens in causing ABRS
      include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella (Branhamella)
      catarrhalis. These three bacteria account for approximately 90% of ABRS in children less
      than or equal to 5 years of age. Combination of Potassium Clavulanate (CVA) and Amoxicillin
      (AMPC) produces higher antibiotic activity against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria. The
      present study is designed to assess the clinical efficacy, bacteriological efficacy and
      safety of CVA/AMPC (1:14) administered in children aged from 3 months to less than 15 years
      with ABRS. It is an open-label study consisting of a 7-day treatment phase and a
      post-treatment follow-up phase for 7 to 14 days.

    <description>Clinical assessment of ABRS by the investigator (or subinvestigator) at the follow-up (Day 15) as; Cure: Sufficient improvement of the signs and symptoms such that no   additional antibiotic therapy is needed. Failure: No change of the signs and symptoms, or additional antibiotic therapy is needed. Unable to determine: No information is available on signs and symptoms, or despite improvement of the signs and symptoms, use of a non study antibiotic, which means a protocol deviation.</description>

    <description>The investigator (or sub-investigator) will use the sample collected at the start of study treatment to isolate and identify the pathogenic bacteria.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Child with ABRS with inflammation as bacterial infection who has the following
             symptoms/signs on the day of or the day before the first dose of the investigational
