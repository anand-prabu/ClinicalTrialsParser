The treating physician will determine the appropriate course of treatment based on the physician's current practice or experience using Iridium-192 or Cesium HDR after-loaders to administer cervical brachytherapy treatments.\nSubjects enrolled will be treated with approximately 80-90 Gy total treatment dose over 4-6 fractions.  Examples of commonly used dose regimens in the US are listed in section 7.6.7. This study will include data collection from the initiation of EBRT through administration of the final Xoft Axxent treatment fraction, and at one (1) month and three (3) months."
