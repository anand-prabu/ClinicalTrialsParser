The evaluation of\n      digital photograph of each research participant will be performed by the classification\n      assigned to the decrease of devitalized area and tissue e repair related to the time of\n      healing and observed the formation of granulation tissue and epithelialization from\n      standardized photographs.\n\n      Evaluation by PUSH Scales:\n\n      In order to provide an evaluation instrument of PUs in Brazil, so that satisfies the\n      simplicity of the use in different clinical scenarios keeping its measurement properties, as\n      previously attested from its original version, the PUSH scale was adapted into Portuguese.\n\n      The PUSH Scale considers three parameters or sub - scales of the wound healing process and\n      treatment outcomes: wound area, amount of exudate present on the wound, appearance of the\n      wound.\n\n      Retention of Records:\n\n      The investigator shall retain all documentation of the study over a period of at least five\n      years from the end of the study. The Sponsor or its designee will provide a list of all\n      documentation which should be kept by the Investigator.\n\n      Monitoring:\n\n      All aspects of the study will be carefully monitored by Crist\u00e1lia Pharmaceutical Chemicals\n      Ltda. or designated representative of it (Clinical Research Organization - CRO) for\n      evaluations related to good clinical practice and applicable local regulations.\n\n      Case Report Forms:\n\n      The Monitor will be available if the investigator, or other person of his team, needs\n      information and guidance.\n\n      The Monitor of the study should have permanent access to all documentation and it is his\n      obligation to ensure that the Case Report Forms are complete and completed correctly, as\n      well as checking if the data are described according to the source documents, in order to\n      eliminate interferences that may compromise the accuracy of the data generated in the\n      clinical trial.\n\n      Audit and Inspections:\n\n      Authorized representatives of the Sponsor or designees, regulatory authority or the Ethics\n      Committee of the institution may conduct audits or inspections during or after the study\n      conclusion.\n\n      Collecting Data:\n\n      The information corresponding to the data of interest from the study will be collected and\n      recorded in Case Report forms provided by Sponsor, and filled from the information contained\n      in the source documents.\n\n      Documents are considered sources for study: medical records used by the professional at the\n      time of the visits, diagnostic tests or image.\n\n      Informed Consent of Trial:\n\n      The Principal Investigator will ensure that the research participant receive verbally and in\n      writing all relevant information about the nature, purpose, the test drug, the possible\n      risks and benefits of the study.\n\n      Research participants will be notified that they are free to discontinue the study at any\n      time. That they will have the opportunity to ask questions and to have sufficient time to\n      consider the information received.\n\n      Formation of the database:\n\n      The database of the study will be assembled with the data from the Case Report Forms. Doubts\n      and discrepancies will generate questions (queries) written to the Principal Investigator."
