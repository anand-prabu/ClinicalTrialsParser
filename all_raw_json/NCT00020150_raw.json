Treatment continues every 28 days for up to 12 courses in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Sequential dose escalation of O6-BG is followed by sequential dose escalation of\n      temozolomide. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of O6-BG and temozolomide\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which at least 2 of 3 or 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline and prior to courses 1, 3, 6, 8, and 12.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-48 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-2\n      years."
