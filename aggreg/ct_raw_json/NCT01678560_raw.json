Positive airway pressure (PAP) is used to treat sleep apnea and\n      studies have shown a poor adherence to treatment.  The investigators hypothesize that using\n      wireless technology will lead to early detection of problems of treatment use and will\n      translate into early remedial action which will improve the use and effectiveness of\n      treatment, and markedly reduce cost to the VA system.  The investigators will compare two\n      technologies; storing the data on secure digital cards to follow the patient versus  using\n      secure wireless technology to gather the data, a cloud system to store the data, and staff\n      that would be notified in the event of anomalies in treatment use or effectiveness."
