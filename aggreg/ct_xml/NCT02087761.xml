    <textblock>
      The ARIES Flu Assay is a real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based qualitative in
      vitro diagnostic test for the direct detection and differentiation of respiratory viral
      nucleic acid in nasopharyngeal swabs specimens from patients with signs and symptoms of
      respiratory tract infection in conjunction with clinical and laboratory findings.

      The objective is to establish the diagnostic accuracy of ARIES Flu Assay through a
      multi-site, method comparison on prospectively collected, left-over, and de-identified,
      nasopharyngeal swab specimens. Diagnostic accuracy will be expressed in terms of clinical
      sensitivity (or positive agreement) and specificity (or negative agreement).
