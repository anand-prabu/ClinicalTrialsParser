            "textblock": "Genistein is an isoflavone that has antioxidant and neuroprotective effects on Alzheimer's\n      disease (AD).\n\n      A few years ago our group reported that genistein increased PPARg (peroxisome proliferator\n      activated receptor gamma) levels. By the way, activation of retinoid X receptor (RXR)-PPARg\n      dimer, will make overexpressing apolipoprotein E (apoE), which mediates the degradation of\n      amyloid beta (AB). Therefore, we believe that if this phytoestrogen administration increases\n      the availability of the transcription factor, it can increase apoE, and also AB degradation.\n\n      The main aim of this study is to determinate the effect of 60 mg BID of genistein\n      administration, during 180 days, compared to placebo group, in AD patients."
