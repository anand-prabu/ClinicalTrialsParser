            "textblock": "N-3 PUFA are important for human health and nutrition. Due to the increasing world\n      population, overfishing of the seas and generally low amounts of n-3 PUFA in major oil\n      crops, there is a demand for new sources of n-3 PUFA.\n\n      One approach involves searching for potential vegetable sources of n-3 PUFA; especially\n      those rich in ALA and SDA. The conversion of ALA to SDA in humans depends on the\n      rate-limiting \u22066-desaturation. Plant-derived SDA is therefore a promising precursor\n      regarding endogenous synthesis of n-3 LC-PUFA in humans. The enrichment of n-3 LC-PUFA in\n      human lipids during the supplementation of ALA- and SDA-rich Echium oil will be compared\n      with SDA-rich soybean oil.\n\n      Eighty volunteers will be recruited and allocated into four study groups depending on age\n      and BMI. Three groups (each n=20) will receive daily ca. 20 g Echium oil ( group 1 and 2:\n      mean BMI < 25, with mean age: 25 or 55 years; group 3: mean age 55 and BMI > 25). One group\n      (n=20) will receive SDA soybean oil ( dose with comparable amount of SDA; BMI < 25; mean age\n      25 and 55). The double-blind, randomized, parallel-designed study will start with a\n      two-weeks run-in period, followed by an eight-weeks supplementation period. After the run-in\n      period, one week and eight weeks of oil supplementation blood will be drawn and 24-h urine\n      will be sampled."
