Baseline demographic and clinical\n      variables will be examined between both groups with an independent Student t-test for\n      continuous data. Separate 2x3 model ANOVA with time (baseline, 10 weeks and 15 weeks) as the\n      within-subjects factor, group (experimental, control) will be to determine the effects of\n      the treatment."
