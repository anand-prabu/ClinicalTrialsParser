For the treatment group, the leads will be\n      placed and stimulated intraoperatively to assess proper placement and stimulation parameters\n      needed to achieve change in penile length and/or circumference.  One week post operatively,\n      the leads will be connected to an external stimulator device and activated.  Subjects will\n      be instructed to stimulate each lead by turning on the device each day for up to six weeks.\n      The leads will be removed at six weeks post operative and subjects will be followed for up\n      to two years.\n\n      Patients assigned to the control group will not have the electrical leads implanted during\n      surgery but will followed with questionnaires and penile sensory and thermal testing at\n      similar time points."
