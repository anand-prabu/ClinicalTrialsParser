  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve the clinical care of women with pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding due to
      benign uterine conditions including leiomyomas (uterine fibroids) and adenomyosis by
      evaluating the accuracy of radiology diagnostic exams (MRI(magnetic resonance imaging),
      ultrasound and ultrasound with elastography).
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently benign conditions of the uterus are frequently underdiagnosed or misdiagnosed.
      This project will help determine which diagnostic radiology exams are most helpful to the
      clinician in providing accurate diagnosis and we will also evaluate which exam patients
      prefer over another exam.

    <description>We are trying to improve the clinical care of women who have pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding due to certain uterine conditions including uterine fibroids (leiomyomas) and adenomyosis.
We are asking subjects to evaluate patient preference between MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) and ultrasound.</description>

    <intervention_name>ARM 1: Evaluation of MRI, US for pelvic and uterine conditions</intervention_name>
    <description>You will undergo a pelvic ultrasound with transabdominal and transvaginal imaging, performed by a female technologist. The transvaginal ultrasound will include elastography (TVUS-E). An ultrasound probe will be inserted into your vagina and gently placed up against your cervix. Sound waves will be emitted from the probe that will bounce off various structures in your body and bounce back to the ultrasound machine to create the ultrasound images.
You will have a pelvic MRI performed if you have not had one within the last 6 months. The MRI is performed with IV gadolinium-based contrast (MultiHance Â®).
The MRI scan will take approximately 60 to 90 minutes to complete. We will also ask you to participate in a survey that includes questions about your pelvic symptoms and the imaging tests you just had done.</description>

    <description>Subjects may take part in ARM 2 because they have recently had a MRI performed and scheduled for, or have recently undergone a pelvic ultrasound.
The pelvic ultrasound will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.
Subjects will also be asked to complete a survey that will state their preference with regards to examination/imaging.  This will be done over the phone and will take no longer than 30 minutes to complete.</description>
