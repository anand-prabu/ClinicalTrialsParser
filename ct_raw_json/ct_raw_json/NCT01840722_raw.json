This project has potential to make a significant contribution to science by\n      providing knowledge about the health, risk behaviors, and service utilization of a\n      vulnerable and understudied group of women during a time of emerging and significant public\n      health risk in a rural Appalachian setting. Successful completion of the aims of this\n      project will advance the delivery of a low-cost, potentially high impact intervention with\n      implications for a number of other real world settings (such as criminal justice venues)\n      where other disadvantaged high-risk drug users can be identified and targeted for\n      intervention."

This aim will be accomplished through\n      the random selection of high-risk rural women drug users from rural jails, screening and\n      assessment for high-risk behavior, and random assignment to the HIV-Ed or MI-HIV\n      intervention conditions. Follow-up interviews at 3, 6, and 12 months in the community\n      post-release will examine changes in high-risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV\n      participants will report significantly greater reductions in risky injection drug use\n      practices, other drug use, and sex risk behaviors than women who participate in the HIV-Ed\n      condition.\n\n      Specific Aim 2: Examine MI-HIV Intervention engagement as a predictor of community health\n      and behavioral health service utilization (including drug treatment and mental health) at\n      follow-up among disadvantaged, drug-using rural women at high risk for HIV and HCV. This aim\n      will focus on community service utilization during the follow-up period by the intervention\n      and education comparison group, and how health and behavioral health service utilization\n      relates to patterns of HIV/HCV risk behavior. It is expected that MI-HIV participants will\n      utilize more services due to increased motivation for treatment and treatment planning\n      following the brief intervention."
