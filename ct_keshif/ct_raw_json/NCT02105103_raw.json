Subjects\n      must have beenn on intensive insulin therapy for at least siz months  i.e. either on CSII or\n      MDI.All Subjects will receive training in the preparation, programming and daily use of the\n      Accu-Chek Insight Insulin pump.In addition, subjects previously on MDI may receive more\n      training in order to be comfortable with the use of an insulin pump.The study will be\n      conducted in 10-12 sites in Austria, France and the United Kingdom.  A total of 80-95\n      subjects will be enrolled in this study."
