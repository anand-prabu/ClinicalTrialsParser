After, patients receive a 10-page illustrated book, a logbook of diabetes control. 2 weeks after the second education session, each participant will receive 5 calls every 15 days in 2 months.

In\n      Lebanon, the incidence of diabetes is estimated at 12%, it is expected to double by the year\n      2025. Given the increasing prevalence of diabetes in Lebanon, the evolution of complications\n      of this disease and the lack of studies at this level, it is appropriate to conduct a study\n      that aims to evaluate the effects an education program for people with type 2 diabetes on\n      their sense of self-efficacy and their ability to self-manage their disease to make them the\n      most optimal therapeutic adherence possible. The design of this study is experimental type\n      before / after randomization by diabetic patients. Education program delivered to the\n      experimental group is the \"Accu-Chek Education Program\" of Roche. Membership will be\n      assessed using a biomarker HbA1c should be <7%, and a questionnaire (Summary of Diabetes\n      Self-Care Activities Measure), which measures self-care behaviors. Self-efficacy is measured\n      using the Diabetes Management Self-Efficacy Scale. And this before the intervention and 3\n      months later. The sample will be 240 diabetic patients T2. Recruitment will be in outpatient\n      diabetology a Hospital located in Beirut. Statistical analyzes used for descriptive\n      variables are measures of central tendency, dispersion and frequency distribution. T-test\n      and chi-square will be used to compare the socio-demographic characteristics of the 2\n      groups, experimental and control. To test hypotheses and determine the difference in the\n      results of the dependent variables of the 2 groups, analysis of variance and covariance are\n      used. The data will be processed using SPSS version 14.0."
