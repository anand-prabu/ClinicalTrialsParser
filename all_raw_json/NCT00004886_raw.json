On day 1 of the 2nd\n      course, patients receive MS-209 orally followed by docetaxel IV over 1 hour. Treatment is\n      repeated every 3 weeks for 4-7 courses (including course with docetaxel alone). Treatment\n      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of MS-209 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 3 or 3 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 3-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
