A high flow catheter delivers a higher volume of saline during the procedure.  The\n      low flow catheter delivers a lower volume of saline during the procedure.  The patient will\n      be consented and randomized to one of the 2 groups using a computer generated randomization\n      chart.  Those that are put in the low flow catheter group will be considered the\n      experimental group.  All data will be collected before and after the procedure and each\n      patient will act as their own control within each group. The hypothesis is that using a\n      lower flow catheter will cause less hemodynamic, electrolyte, and electrophysiologic\n      derangements resulting in better patient outcomes and fewer complications"
