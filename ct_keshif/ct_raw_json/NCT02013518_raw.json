The treatment will be conducted by experienced health staff (nurses,\n      psychologist, doctors) with formal training in Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, and knowledge\n      about Alzheimer's Disease. Furthermore, the health staff will be familiarised with the\n      manual before study inception, participate in a two-day training seminar and will regularly\n      be supervised.\n\n      The control condition will be offered treatment as usual at the participating the memory\n      clinics.\n\n      The hypothesis is that the participants in the intervention group will report less\n      depression and increased self efficacy as compared with the control group.\n\n      We conducted a pilot study with 10 patients, 5 in each group, from March to June 2013 to\n      examine the feasibility of the study protocol and do want to include these patients in the\n      study population."
