This protocol aims to expand upon the growing body of knowledge\n      concerning early changes in tumor neovascularity as a potential biomarker of therapy\n      efficacy. It further aims to address the trend towards more refined treatment stratification\n      for lower risk tumors to avoid morbidity from potentially unnecessary radiation,\n      chemotherapy or even radical surgery, by assessing the earliest changes that occur in\n      microvasculature, perfusion and diffusion of water molecules and metabolic constituents such\n      as choline and lactate during this treatment to see if these can be predictive of long-term\n      efficacy of therapy."
