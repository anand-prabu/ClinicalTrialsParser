Attacks most often occur in the fingers,\n      but may occur in other extremities as well.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      Randomized.  Patients were assigned to one of four treatment groups: slow release\n      Nifedipine, a calcium channel blocker; pill placebo; temperature biofeedback; or\n      electromyograph biofeedback from the frontalis muscle.  The primary endpoint was reduction\n      in number of vasospastic attacks.  Other endpoints included: other measures of Raynaud's\n      attacks including frequency, severity, duration, response to laboratory-based cold\n      challenge, and quality of life."
