Assess the plasma pharmacology of this drug, its ability to inhibit proteasome function\n      and to accelerate apoptosis in circulating blasts in this patient population.\n\n      III. Assess the antileukemic effects of this drug in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.\n\n      Patients receive PS-341 IV bolus twice weekly for 4 weeks followed by 2 weeks of rest.\n      Treatment continues for a maximum of 12 courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or\n      disease progression.\n\n      Cohorts of 2 patients receive escalating doses of PS-341 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined.  The MTD is defined as the dose level associated with toxicity\n      probability closest to 0.2 after 30 patients are treated."
