      The goal of this study is to demonstrate Or-Nim's CerOx monitor ability to monitor changes
      in cerebral blood flow and oximetry during CEA surgery.

      Procedures include:

      Screening:

      ECG, blood draw, neurological assessment, NIHSS

      study: CerOX and TCD clock during CEA procedure, data collection from the medical
      record/monitors, neurological assessment, NIHSS

      30 day follow-up

        Patients scheduled to undergo a CEA procedure that have consented to participate in the
        study will be included in this observational study.

        Research Subjects: Indications for monitoring include patients scheduled for CEA that
        comply with the inclusion and exclusion criteria.

        Inclusion Criteria

        To be considered eligible to participate in this study, a patient must meet the inclusion
        criteria listed below:

        1. Consenting patients over 18 years, undergoing elective carotid endarterectomy at Barnes
        Jewish Hospital.

        Exclusion Criteria

        To be eligible for entry into the study, the patient must not meet any of the exclusion
        criteria listed below:

          1. Emergency surgery

          2. National Institute of health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) score &gt;=10

          3. Sub-cutaneous hematoma at the ipsilateral intended area of the CerOx probe location.

          4. Laceration or scalp injury at the ipsilateral intended area of the CerOx probe
             location which contraindicates placement of the adhesive on the skin.

          5. Patient with implants located in the intended area of the CerOx probe location.

          6. Prisoners

          7. Non-consenting patient Or non-participating surgeon schedule of assessments and
             procedures

          8. Pregnant or lactating women
