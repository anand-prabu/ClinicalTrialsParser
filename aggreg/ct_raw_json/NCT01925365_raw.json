Furthermore, several large epidemiological studies and a number of\n      recent meta-analyses of nutritional interventions have reported a positive association\n      between increased whole grain intake and reduced risk of developing a range of chronic\n      diseases.  Recognising the important role of the gut microbiota in metabolism and metabolic\n      disease risk, we examined the impact of whole grain oats on the human gut microbiota and\n      cardio-metabolic risk factors.\n\n      The main aims of this human study is to determine the effectiveness of a low GI whole grain\n      oats breakfast cereal compared to a high GI, refined breakfast cereal to beneficially\n      modulate gut microbiota and its metabolic output, plasma lipids, gut satiety hormones and\n      inflammation markers in an at risk of cardio-metabolic disease population"
