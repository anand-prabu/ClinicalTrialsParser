      The purpose of this study is to determine whether staining of the gastric mucosa increases
      the number of detected (pre)malignant foci of intestinal and  diffuse type gastric cancer,
      in first degree relatives of individuals with familial gastric cancer.

      Rationale:

      Familial gastric cancer (FGC) concerns about 10% of all gastric cancers. It has an
      impressive impact on both emotional and physical wellbeing of first degree relatives of
      patients with (early) onset of gastric cancer. FGC can in  1-3% be attributed to one single
      hereditary syndrome, the hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). HDGC is associated with a
      CDH1 mutation in about 40 % of the cases. In case there is no CDH1 mutation, referred to as
      familiar diffuse gastric cancer (FDGC), it remains uncertain how to guide and/or screen
      family members. The same applies for the rare familial intestinal type gastric cancer
      (FIGC).

      Aim:

      In this study we want to determine the value of endoscopic screening in members of families
      with FGC, both FDGC and FIGC. Also, we will analyze the associations of life style factors,
      including dietary habits with the development of FDGC, to be able to built preventive
      strategies. Finally, we want to assess the psychological impact of our screening protocol.

      Objective:

      Primary, to determine whether staining of the gastric mucosa increases the number of
      detected (pre)malignant foci of diffuse type gastric cancer, in individuals from families
      with FDGC as well as dysplastic, adenomatous and early intestinal cancers in individuals
      from families with FIGC. Secondary:  A  To determine the optimal pathological work-up the
      detection rate of (pre-)malignancy. B  To determine clinical and life style factors that are
      associated with the two types of FGC. C  To determine the psychosocial impact of the
      screening protocol in this population.  D To develop a strategy for screening individuals
      from FGC families and creative advise for preventive measures.

      Study design:

      A randomized controlled trial included in a prospective cohort analysis.

      Study population:

      All (first degree) relatives , from 18  years and older from patients who fulfill the
      criteria for a FGC.  These are; 1] all first degree relatives of an individual with diffuse
      gastric cancer, without proven CDH1 mutation, or  members from families with 2] 2 or more
      individuals with gastric carcinoma, at least one &lt; 50 yrs, or 3] 3 or more individuals  with
      gastric carcinoma, any age, any type, or 4] 1 individual with any type gastric carcinoma &lt;
      40 yrs.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine the association of clinical and life style factors with the two type of Familial Gastric Cancer, partly assessed from the patients'clinical files (eg BMI), partly by assessment of possible risk factors in blood (eg Helicobacter Pylori).</measure>
