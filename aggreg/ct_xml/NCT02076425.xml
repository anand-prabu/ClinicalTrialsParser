    <textblock>
      Parent Child Interaction Therapy Emotion Development (PCIT-ED) will be conducted with a
      sample of preschoolers who exhibit symptoms of depression compared to a wait list (WL)
      control after which participants will receive the active treatment. PCIT-ED is an expansion
      of PCIT, a well-known, widely used and proven effective treatment for preschool disruptive
      disorders. To address early disturbances of mood and affect, a novel ED module was added
      based on empirical data in emotion development. The ED module targets parent emotion
      learning skills with the goal of training the parent to serve as a more effective emotion
      teacher and coach to the child. The goal of the ED module is to enhance the child's capacity
      for emotion recognition and regulation or &quot;emotional competence.&quot; In order to test the
      efficacy of PCIT-ED, to estimate accurate effect sizes and to investigate mediators and
      moderators of treatment response participants will complete comprehensive pre-, interval,
      and post-assessments.

      Compared to those randomized to the WL, preschoolers who undergo PCIT-ED will show
      significantly increased rates of remission, greater reductions in MDD symptoms, and
      decreases in impairment; and will show significantly greater increases in emotional
      competence measured by the ability to accurately identify emotions in themselves and others
      and the ability to effectively regulate intense emotions. Compared to those on the WL,
      parents who undergo PCIT-ED will show significantly greater increases in emotion skill
      learning and reductions in MDD symptoms and parenting stress.

    <description>The K-SADS-EC is a semi-structured diagnostic interview designed to assess current and past episodes of psychopathology in children according to DSM criteria. Probes and objective criteria are provided to rate individual symptoms. Primary diagnoses assessed include: Major Depression, Dysthymia, Mania, Hypomania, Bipolar, Agoraphobia, Separation Anxiety, Simple Phobia, Social Phobia, Generalized Anxiety, Obsessive Compulsive, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity, Conduct, Oppositional Defiant, Post-Traumatic Stress, and Adjustment Disorders. Revisions include adjusting/adding questions and threshold anchors reflecting developmentally appropriate symptom and diagnostic criteria for 3-6 year old children, removing sections less applicable to young children, editing probes to use parent-directed wording, and providing directions for clarifying symptom severity and genesis where necessary. The KSADS-EC was adapted from the KSADS-PL by Michael S. Gaffrey, Ph.D. and Joan L. Luby, M.D.</description>

    <time_frame>completion of therapy (average of 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The PFC is a validated screening checklist with favorable sensitivity and specificity designed to capture preschoolers at high risk for MDD. The PFC-Scale, a 23 item measure adapted from the PFC, is a scale version of this measure designed and validated to capture changes in young child depression severity (similar to the Child Depression Inventory).</description>

    <measure>Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF)</measure>
    <time_frame>completion of therapy (average of 20 weeks)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The BRIEF (ages 6-18) and BRIEF-P (ages 2-6) is a parent rated measure of executive function.  It has five scales: Emotional Control, Inhibit, Shift, Working Memory, and Plan/Organize.  The Emotional Control scale assesses the child's ability to modulate emotional responses.  The remaining scales provide information regarding the child's self-awareness and ability to control behavior.  The BRIEF has favorable psychometric properties.</description>
