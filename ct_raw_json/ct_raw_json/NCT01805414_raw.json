This concern is particularly pertinent to the\n      breakfast meal, which often contains mainly CHO. Clinical observations suggested that such\n      diets elevate pre-lunch blood glucose (BG) values. The study team compared standard hospital\n      \"no concentrated sweets (NCS)\" breakfast meals with more balanced meals.  The study team\n      hypothesized that a balanced breakfast would improve pre-lunch BG values.\n\n      This 8-week pilot study was conducted at Duke Hospital on two non-ICU cardiology wards. Ward\n      A consisted mainly of patients with a primary diagnosis of coronary artery disease (CAD).\n      Ward B consisted mainly of patients with a primary diagnosis of congestive heart failure\n      (CHF). The intervention breakfast menu included 5 choices containing 40-45g of CHO. All\n      patients on Ward A (with and without diabetes) were given the intervention breakfast for the\n      first 4 weeks of the study, while those on Ward B received standard menus (60-75g CHO in NCS\n      meals). After 4 weeks, the standard and intervention wards were switched. Data were\n      collected only on patients with diabetes who were able to consume meals."
