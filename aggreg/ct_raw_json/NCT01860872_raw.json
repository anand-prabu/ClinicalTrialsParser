The study will involve one magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) using an intravenous (IV) contrast dye called gadolinium. The\n      research also includes lung tests called spirometry and blood samples to look at\n      inflammation.\n\n      For the CF subjects, enrollment will be timed to coincide with routine scheduled\n      computerized tomography (CT).  The MRI will be compared to CT images of the lungs. The goal\n      is to develop better imaging that does not use radiation."

            "textblock": "Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by\n      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually\n      results in respiratory failure.  There is strong evidence that in CF abnormally low vascular\n      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary\n      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might\n      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Knowledge remains limited\n      to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of\n      pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and\n      destruction of lung tissue. Recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance\n      Imaging (MRI) of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. Studies\n      demonstrate that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and\n      in surrogate measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early\n      in the course of CF. The newly developed therapeutics in the last decade which altered\n      dramatically the course of patients suffering from pulmonary vascular disease provide\n      opportunities to understand the role of pulmonary vasculature in CF lung disease.\n\n      This pilot study (Pilot 3) will assess the relationships between pulmonary perfusion, serum\n      markers of pulmonary inflammation and vascular remodeling, and hemodynamic measures\n      consistent with pulmonary hypertension. This study will establish MRI as a readily\n      obtainable modality to be used in the CF population to obtain measurements of pulmonary\n      perfusion; pulmonary arterial hemodynamic, dimension, and flow measures; and ventricular\n      mass and function measures.\n\n      The primary goal of this study is to improve the understanding of pulmonary vascular disease\n      in CF by examining pulmonary perfusion abnormalities and their association with markers of\n      pulmonary inflammation and pulmonary vascular remodeling, the severity of obstructive\n      airways disease, and pulmonary hemodynamic abnormalities in CF.\n\n      This study will include a single MRI of the pulmonary circulation on about 36 pediatric and\n      adult patients with CF and about 12 non-CF controls. MRI will be performed with gadolinium\n      contrast. CF patients who are scheduled for clinical chest CT will be enrolled and the\n      scheduling of the MRI will be coordinated with the clinical CT. Other study procedures\n      include pulmonary function tests (PFT) and blood specimen for serum biomarkers.  Specimens\n      will be analyzed for a panel of inflammatory markers."
