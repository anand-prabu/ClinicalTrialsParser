We\n      will enroll 50 subjects in each of 3 groups: keratoconus, post-PK, and post-DSAEK. The\n      Optovue anterior segment OCT prototype will be used to perform 3-D corneal scans. These\n      scans will be used to measure corneal thickness (pachymetry), corneal topography (anterior\n      and posterior) and epithelial thickness maps. The ultrahigh-speed MIT OCT prototypes will\n      also be used when they become available. A comprehensive eye examination, Placido-ring\n      corneal topography, ultrasound pachymetry, and Scheimpflug camera imagery, will be performed\n      for comparison. In some post-PK and post-DSAEK cases, vision will be primarily affected by\n      regular astigmatism, myopia, or hyperopia, rather than HOA. These cases can be corrected by\n      standard PRK (not OCT guided) with adjunctive mitomycin C treatment to prevent haze\n      formation.107, 108 In these cases PRK will be performed according to the standard of care\n      and will not be a part of the study protocol. The postoperative results will be observed at\n      the 3-4 month visit with UCVA, manifest refraction, BSCVA, OCT scanning, Placido topography,\n      ultrasound pachymetry, and Scheimpflug camera imagery"
