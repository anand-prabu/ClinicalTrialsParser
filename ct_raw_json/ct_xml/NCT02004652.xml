    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect and safety of prucalopride on recovery
      of gastrointestinal function in patient undergoing major gastrointestinal surgery. The
      investigators hypothesize that patients who take prucalopride after major gastrointestinal
      surgery will have shorter duration of postoperative ileus.

    <textblock>
      Postoperative ileus (POI), an interruption of bowel motility function, virtually occurs in
      all patients undergoing major gastrointestinal(GI) surgery. This functional impairment
      persists for a variable duration, usually resolving within 1 day in the small intestine, 1
      to 3 days in the stomach and 3 to 5 days in the colon. Therefore, time of return of colonic
      function is the the major determinant of duration of POI. Attempts to reduce the duration of
      POI have prompted the implementation of fast track surgery including early removal of the
      nasogastric tube, early feeding, alvimopan, gum chewing, and prompt ambulation. However, it
      is still reported to be more than 4-5 days in most of the randomized trial. Therefore,
      methods specifically aiming at promoting postoperative colon motility may further enhance
      the GI function recovery, and prucalopride may be one of the options.

      Prucalopride, a substituted benzamide with selective 5-HT4 agonist activity, has been shown
      previously to significant improve colon motility and transit, but it only has mild effect on
      gastric or small bowel transit. The drug is well tolerated with no significant adverse
      effects. Recently, prucalopride has been approved in Europe and America for the symptomatic
      treatment of chronic constipation in women in whom laxatives fail to provide adequate
      relief. However, its usage in the postoperative period has not been tested. This study will
      test the ability and safety of prucalopride given 24hrs after GI surgery to hasten the
      recovery of GI function.
