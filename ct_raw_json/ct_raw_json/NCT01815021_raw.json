As\n      results, the burden of taking high doses of calcium supplementation along with the side\n      effects of the standard therapy (gastrointestinal discomfort and hypercalciuria) will be\n      reduced.\n\n      Testing serum CA and urine calcium values in subjects with hypoparathyroidism may provide a\n      straightforward method to test this hypothesis.\n\n      The study is designed to be conducted with extra precaution in order to avoid disturbing the\n      fragile balance between CA levels in serum and calcium levels urine. The crossover design of\n      phase II of the study allows a more accurate and reliable comparison of results attributable\n      to the specific treatment within the same individual. In addition, the subjects will\n      continue consuming all their routine medication throughout the trial. The subjects in the\n      control arm will consume their routine calcium supplement doses thus, will be treated with a\n      standard of care."
