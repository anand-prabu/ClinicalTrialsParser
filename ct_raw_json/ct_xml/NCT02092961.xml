  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a sub-study of the OSKIRA-4 study, (D4300C0004, NCT01264770) to explore alternative
      and more sensitive modalities for measuring the beneficial effects of syk inhibition with
      fostamatinib in patients with active RA. This MRI sub-study was reported later than the main
      study due to recruitment delays at specialist imaging sites and so is registered and
      presented entirely separately to the main study results.

      This study will investigate the impact of treatment on joint activity and damage by
      assessing synovitis, osteitis, bone erosions and joint space narrowing.

      Sub-study to OSKIRA-4: A Phase IIB, Multi-Centre, Randomised, Double-Blind,
      Placebo-Controlled, Parallel Group Study of the Efficacy and Safety of Fostamatinib Disodium
      Monotherapy Compared with Placebo or Adalimumab Monotherapy in Patients with Active
      Rheumatoid Arthritis: Magnetic Resonance Imaging Sub-Study Date: 21 March 2011 Version: 1
      Primary objective: Assess the efficacy of fostamatinib in reducing joint synovial disease
      activity as measured by: - Change from baseline to Week 6 (versus placebo) in OMERACT RAMRIS
      synovitis score.
