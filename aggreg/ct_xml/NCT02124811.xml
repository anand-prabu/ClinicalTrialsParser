  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Schizophrenia is a major mental illness characterized by a variety of different symptoms
      including hallucinations, paranoia, difficulties with formulating and expressing thoughts,
      feelings similar to depression, and problems with cognitive processes. Individuals with
      schizophrenia are usually treated with a class of medications called anti-psychotics, which
      typically help alleviate some of the symptoms of the disorder. In general, anti-psychotic
      medications do not completely cure the disorder, and many patients are left with some degree
      of ongoing symptoms. Furthermore, it is estimated that 20-30% of individuals with
      schizophrenia are considered treatment refractory or resistant and do not respond to
      anti-psychotic medications. The Food and Drug Administration has approved one antipsychotic
      medication for use in patients who are considered to have treatment resistant schizophrenia
      (TRS). This medication, clozapine, has been shown to be beneficial for patients with TRS,
      though as many as 40-70% of patients fail to respond or are partially responsive to
      treatment with clozapine.  In an extensive search of the medical and psychiatric literature,
      we have been impressed by the potential of minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, as an
      adjunctive therapy in patients with schizophrenia based on its reported neuroprotective and
      anti-inflammatory effects. It is a fairly inexpensive drug, well tolerated, and two
      randomized clinical trials have demonstrated favorable results in early-phase schizophrenia.
      Only one case series with two patients has investigated minocycline in patients with
      schizophrenia on clozapine. Minocycline is also an interesting medication for augmentation
      with clozapine, as we are interested in previous findings of increased inflammation in the
      brains of patients with schizophrenia and the potential role of inflammation in treatment
      resistant schizophrenia. Though there are many markers of increased inflammation in the
      brain, for this current study, we are interested in a general marker of inflammation called
      C-Reactive Protein (CRP).  We hypothesize that some patients may have increased levels of
      inflammation in the brain, as measured by the CRP level (drawn from peripheral blood), and
      that those patients with increased levels of CRP may respond better to augmentation with
      minocycline. The proposed pilot study will compare minocycline augmentation with clozapine
      to placebo augmentation with clozapine. Within both the minocycline and the placebo group,
      we plan to further divide the groups by those with high CRP levels and those with low CRP.
      We hypothesize that minocycline will be well tolerated, and compared to placebo, will result
      in an improvement in the symptoms of schizophrenia, cognition, as well as improve the
      quality of life for patients. We plan to use a variety of different scales to measure
      improvement in the varying symptoms of schizophrenia as well as cognitive function, which
      will be administered to patients at three week intervals for a total study time of twelve
      weeks.  We hypothesize that minocycline could prove to be an effective, well tolerated, and
      inexpensive medication for treatment resistant patients with schizophrenia whom have
      particular difficulties with social interactions, obtaining and maintaining employment, and
      overall quality of life. Furthermore, we hypothesize that the data obtained in this study
      will contribute to the ongoing exploration of the role of inflammation in the brain of
      patients with schizophrenia  and help understand and target the role of various inflammatory
      markers in the pathophysiology and treatment of treatment resistant schizophrenia.
