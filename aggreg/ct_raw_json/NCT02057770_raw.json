When a\n      patient cannot find a donor who exactly matches their tissue type, half-matched related\n      (haploidentical) donors, who are first degree relatives such as siblings, children, or\n      parents, may be used. In the past, people who have undergone haploidentical stem cell\n      transplant have been more likely to experience complications such as rejection of the stem\n      cell transplant or severe graft-versus host disease (GVHD). Giving cyclophosphamide after\n      haploidentical stem cell transplant may improve the outcomes of the transplant."
