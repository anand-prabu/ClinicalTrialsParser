After baseline measurements are\n      taken, patients will be randomized in a 2:1 fashion to either undergo radiofrequency\n      catheter ablation or receive antiarrhythmic drug therapy (amiodarone or sotalol). The\n      in-clinic appointments include: enrollment, baseline, intervention, and follow-up every\n      three months for one year post-ablation. At each follow-up visit, electrogram (ECG) and\n      Holter monitoring tests will be performed to measure any episodes of ventricular\n      tachyarrhythmia. Furthermore, interrogation of the patient's implantable cardioverter\n      defibrillator (ICD) will be performed at all follow-up visits to detect any episodes of\n      ventricular tachyarrhythmia that required antitachycardia pacing (ATP) or shocks."
