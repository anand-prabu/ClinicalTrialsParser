Postconditioning is applied by introducing\n      reperfusion/ischemia via the cardioplegia line while the aorta is still cross-clamped\n      thereby preventing the risk of additional neurological complications. All patients > 20\n      years eligible for aortic or aortic valve surgery and not affected by exclusion criteria,\n      will be included.\n\n      The study is carried out as a randomised controlled multicenter study including 5-6 heart\n      surgery centers."
