      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and efficacy of switching from Remicade to
      the biosimilar treatment Remsima in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis,
      psoriatic arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease and chronic plaque psoriasis

    <description>A disease worsening in RA and PsA is defined as an increase in DAS28 of ≥ 1.2 from randomization and a minimum DAS score of 3.2.
A disease worsening in AS/SpA is defined as an increase in ASDAS of ≥1.1 from randomization and a minimum ASDAS of 2.1.
A disease worsening in ulcerative colitis is defined as an increase in Partial Mayo score of ≥ 3 points from randomization and a minimum partial Mayo score of ≥ 5 points.
A disease worsening in Crohn's disease is defined as an increase in HBI of ≥ 4 points from randomization and a minimum HBI score of 7 points.
A disease worsening in psoriasis is defined as an increase in PASI of ≥ 3 points from randomization and a minimum PASI score of 5.
If a patient does not fulfill the formal definition, but experiences a clinically significant worsening according to both the investigator and patient and which leads to a major change in treatment this should be considered as a disease worsening but recorded separately in the CRF.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A clinical diagnosis of either rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthritis, psoriatic
             arthritis, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease or chronic plaque psoriasis

          2. Male or non-pregnant, non-nursing female

          3. &gt;18 years of age at screening

          4. Stable treatment with innovator infliximab (Remicade) during the last 6 months

          5. Subject capable of understanding and signing an informed consent form

          6. Provision of written informed consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Major co-morbidities, such as severe malignancies, severe diabetic mellitus, severe
             infections, uncontrollable hypertension, severe cardiovascular disease (NYHA class 3
             or 4) and/or severe respiratory diseases

          2. Change of major co-medication during the last 2 months prior to randomization:

             RA, SpA and PsA: Initiation of systemic corticosteroids or synthetic DMARDs or other
             medication which according to the investigator would interfere with the stability of
             the disease.

             UC and CD: Initiation of systemic corticosteroids or an immunosuppressant or other
             medication which according to the investigator would interfere with the stability of
             the disease Psoriasis: Initiation of synthetic DMARDs or other medication which
             according to the investigator would interfere with the stability of the disease

          3. Inadequate birth control, pregnancy, and/or breastfeeding

          4. Psychiatric or mental disorders, alcohol abuse or other substance abuse, language
             barriers or other factors which makes adherence to the study protocol impossible

          5. Change in treatment with innovator infliximab (Remicade) during the last 6 months due
             to disease related factors, not including dose/frequency adjustments due to drug
             concentration measurements
