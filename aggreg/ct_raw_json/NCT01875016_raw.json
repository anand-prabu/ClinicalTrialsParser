The patient is not eligible for/failed/refused alcohol ablation\n\n          5. The patient is not eligible for/failed/refused myectomy\n\n          6. The patient is willing to participate in the study and has signed informed consent\n\n          7. The patient or legally authorized representative has been informed of the nature of\n             the study, agrees to its provisions and has provided written informed consent,\n             approved be the appropriate medical ethics committee.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Pregnant or nursing patients Female patients of child-bearing potential must have a\n             negative pregnancy test done within 7 days prior to the index procedure per site\n             standard test\n\n          2. Patient has history of or known impaired renal function (Serum creatinine >2.0 mg/dL\n             or 177 \u00b5mol/l) or on dialysis\n\n          3. Patient has a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom\n             anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated\n\n          4. Patient has a known hypersensivity or contraindication to aspirin, both heparin and\n             bivalirudin, clopidogrel and/or contrast sensitivity/allergy that cannot be\n             adequately pre-medicated\n\n          5. Patient has other medical illness not related to the hypertrophic cardiomyopathy\n             (e.g., cancer, known malignancy, or cognitive heart failure) or known history of\n             substance abuse (alcohol, cocaine, heroin etc.) that may cause non-compliance with\n             the protocol, confound the data interpretation or is associated with limited life\n             expectancy (i.e., less than 1 year)\n\n          6.
