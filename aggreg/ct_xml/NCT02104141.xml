      The purpose of this combination retrospective and prospective post market study is to
      examine the short term safety and efficacy of the ROI-A® interbody fusion device with
      VerteBRIDGE® plates to treat single and two-level degenerative disc disease between L2 and
      S1, with a focus on fusion rates and patient outcomes.
