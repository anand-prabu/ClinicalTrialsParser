The aim of each session was to have the patient cycle for 20 mins at an individually adjusted intensity level. Patients were placed in a comfortable position in between the supine and the semirecumbent position. In sedated patients, cycling was performed in a passive manner for 20 consecutive minutes at a \ufb01xed pedaling rate of 20 cycles/min."

However, some patients require prolonged MV (PMV)\n      and are deconditioned due to respiratory insufficiency caused by underlying disease, adverse\n      effects of medications, and prolonged immobilization. Patients in the intensive care unit\n      (ICU) are often confined to their beds, which results in inactivity, immobility, and severe\n      osteomyoarticular system dysfunction. Our hypothesis is that an early mobilization protocol\n      improves peripheral muscle strength, perceived functional status, duration of mechanical\n      ventilation, ICU length of stay of the critically ill patient.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of implementation an early mobilization\n      protocol in critically ill patients in the Intensive Care Unit of the University Hospital of\n      Santa Maria."
