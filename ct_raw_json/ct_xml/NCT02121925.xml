    <textblock>
      This registry is intended to measure the effect of myPlan Lung Cancer™ test has on treatment
      decisions of Surgeons when added to standard clinical-pathological parameters in patients
      with early stage NSCLC.The sponsor is conducting two parallel registries, with one directed
      at Surgeons (ONC003) and the other at Oncologists (ONC006).This registry is specific to
      Surgeons (ONC003).
