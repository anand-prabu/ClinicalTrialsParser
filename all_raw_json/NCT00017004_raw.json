Compare the quality of life\n      of patients treated with these regimens.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      This is a randomized study.  Patients are stratified according to stage (IIB vs IIIB vs\n      IVA), method of brachytherapy (low-dose vs high-dose), and surgical staging of para-aortic\n      nodes (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I: Patients undergo radiotherapy comprising pelvic external beam radiotherapy daily five\n      days a week for 5 weeks, followed by either 1 or 2 implants of low-dose rate intracavitary\n      brachytherapy or 5 fractions of high-dose rate intracavitary brachytherapy, followed by 3-5\n      days of parametrial boost radiotherapy. Patients receive cisplatin IV concurrently with\n      pelvic external beam radiotherapy on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, and once during the week of\n      parametrial boost radiotherapy.\n\n      Arm II: Patients undergo radiotherapy and chemotherapy as in arm I. Additionally, patients\n      receive epoetin alfa subcutaneously once weekly concurrently with radiotherapy and\n      chemotherapy. Quality of life is assessed at baseline, during weeks 3 and 6, within 1 week\n      of last brachytherapy, and every 3 months for 2 years. Patients are followed every 3 months\n      for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 460 patients will be accrued for this study within 3.5 years."
