Filgrastim (granulocyte colony-stimulating\n      factor) is given subcutaneously on days 5-21 and 33-42. The course is repeated every 6\n      weeks.\n\n      Patients with a complete or partial response after 1 course of treatment receive two\n      additional courses, but lomustine is omitted in the second course. Patients with partial\n      response or stable disease receive radiation therapy and/or continued chemotherapy. Patients\n      failing to respond after 1 course are removed from the study.\n\n      Patients will be followed every 3 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 16 evaluable patients will be accrued."
