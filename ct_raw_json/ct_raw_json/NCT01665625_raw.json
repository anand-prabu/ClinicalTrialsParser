Gemcitabine has been used as the first-line drug for advance pancreatic\n      cancer for over two decades and combinations of gemcitabine with different chemotherapeutic\n      drugs have been investigated to improve the outcomes of pancreatic cancer. However, no\n      substantial improvement in patient survival has been achieved. Locoregional chemotherapy via\n      intra-arterial perfusion or chemoemoblization takes advantage of the increasing local drug\n      concentrations and reducing systemic toxicities. In this study, the investigators hypothesis\n      that artery infusion chemotherapy had a better antitumor effect than systemic chemotherapy.\n      The investigators will analyze and evaluate the effect and safety of an implanted\n      percutaneous left subclavian artery port-catheter drug delivery system for regional\n      chemotherapy of inoperable pancreatic carcinoma."
