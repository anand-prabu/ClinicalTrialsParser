Our monthly cesarean section audit, focusing on discussing\n      the indications of cesarean section, began from July 2008. Clinical data, indications of\n      cesarean section, and perinatal outcomes were compared between the cases of before and after\n      the audit. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors affecting\n      cesarean section rate."
