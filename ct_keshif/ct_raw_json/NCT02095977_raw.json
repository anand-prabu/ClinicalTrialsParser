Exposed cables or conductors were present in 32\n      leads and six leads had melted cables, presumably due to one or more high voltage shocks. 22\n      of the 43 leads assessed (51.2%) also had abraded ETFE cable coating exposing the conductor.\n      Noise and other sensing issues were the most common signs of failure.

A recent case report\n      suggested that changes in lead parameters might be transient and may be missed.
