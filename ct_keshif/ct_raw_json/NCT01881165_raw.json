We expect cranberry supplement to have better results than the\n      placebo. Subjects will not know which supplement they are taking. The primary outcome is the\n      number of UTIs over 12 months."

Participants will also record any side effects. They will be phoned each\n      month to encourage participation and adherence. At 8 weeks and 6 months, they will be asked\n      to return to the clinic to complete a midline questionnaire which will ask about any\n      recurrent UTIs experienced. More supplements will be provided at their 6-month visit. At 12\n      months, participants will return to the clinic to complete an endline questionnaire. They\n      will return any leftover supplements, calendar and side effect diary. If participants\n      withdraw from the study, they will still be encouraged to return at 12 months to complete\n      the survey to allow for intent-to-treat analysis."
