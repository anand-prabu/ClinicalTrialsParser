It is not yet known which regimen of\n      radiation therapy is more effective for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy to the\n      involved area with or without total-body irradiation in treating patients who have low-grade\n      stage I or stage II non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that has not previously been treated."

Patients are stratified according to\n      participating center, stage (I vs II), performance status (0-1 vs 2), lactate dehydrogenase\n      elevation (yes vs no), histological subtype (small lymphocytic lymphoma vs\n      lymphoplasmacytoid lymphoma vs follicular lymphoma), and, for stage I patients, presence of\n      measurable mass (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients undergo involved-field radiotherapy daily five days a week for 2.5-4\n           weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients undergo low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) daily 5 days a week on\n           weeks 1 and 4. At 4 weeks after completion of TBI, patients undergo involved-field\n           radiotherapy as in arm I.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed before treatment, at 4 weeks after completion of involved-field\n      radiotherapy, every 6 months for 5 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 344 patients will be accrued for this study within 6 years."
