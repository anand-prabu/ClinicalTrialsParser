      The purpose of this interview study is to learn why adults would join a walking program.
      This study involves interviews with persons who are 65 years of age or older. The interview
      takes approximately 25 minutes. A total of 132 people will be enrolled. This study will
      examine the utility or value of various potential features of an incentive-based walking
      program. These data will enable us to monitor and improve upon enrollment of incentive-based
      walking programs.
