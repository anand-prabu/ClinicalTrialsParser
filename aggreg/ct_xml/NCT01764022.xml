    <textblock>
      BCD-022-02 is a double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing efficacy of BCD-022 (INN:
      trastuzumab) and paclitaxel to Herceptin and paclitaxel in HER2-positive metastatic breast
      cancer with pharmacokinetics substudy. The purpose of the study is to demonstrate the
      non-inferiority of efficacy and safety of BCD-022 compared to Herceptin. Also study includes
      pharmacokinetics assessment.
