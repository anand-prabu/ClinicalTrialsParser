      Background:

      - The drug 18F-VM4-037 is being tested for use in cancer imaging studies. It may help tumor
      tissue show up more clearly during scans. Researchers want to see how well it works for
      scans for people who have kidney cancer.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of 18F-VM4-037 during imaging studies of kidney
      cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Adults at least 18 years of age with kidney cancer that will be treated with surgery.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected.

        -  Participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET) scans of their kidneys.
           They will have the scans before and after receiving an injection of 18F-VM4-037. The
           scans will take about 2 hours to complete.

        -  About 3 weeks after the PET scans, participants will provide tumor tissue samples from
           their kidneys.

        -  This is a scanning study only. Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      BACKGROUND:

        -  Carbonic Anhydrase IX (CA IX) is a hypoxia-inducible enzyme regulated by the VHL
           protein that is commonly overexpressed in certain malignancies including renal cell
           carcinoma (RCC) and may have prognostic significance.

        -  The VHL gene is commonly mutated or inactivated in RCC tumors and VHL activity
           regulated the expression and activity of not only CAIX but also CAXII as well as other
           genes critical for tumor angiogenesis such as VEGF, GLUT1, GLUT 3 and PDGF.

        -  18F-VM4-037 is an imaging drug product formulation which binds to the active site
           ligand of CA-IX and also binds to CAXII. Wepropose to evaluate 18F-VM4-037 as a PET
           radiopharmaceutical for the in vivo detection of CA-IX and CAXII in renal tumors.

      STUDY OBJECTIVES

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:

        -  To evaluate the biodistribution of 18F-VM4-037 within tumor and non-tumor tissues.

        -  To assess safety of 18F-VM4-037 in patients with primary or metastatic RCC.

      ELIGIBILITY:

        -  Subject is greater than or equal to 18 years old, ECOG 0-2.

        -  Subject must have confirmed primary RCC (greater than or equal to 2.5cm) in diameter on
           conventional imaging modality or extrarenal/extrahepatic RCC lesion (greater than or
           equal to 1cm).

      DESIGN:

      - Twenty subjects with primary RCC greater than or equal to 2.5cm in diameter or
      extrarenal/extrahepatic lesion suspicious for metastatic RCC (greater than or equal to 1cm
      in diameter) scheduled for clinically indicated surgery or biopsy will undergo dynamic
      18F-VM4-037 PET/CT imaging. Results will be compared with pathology.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Subject is greater than or equal to18 years old.

          -  Subject must be scheduled to undergo surgery or biopsy for primary RCC greater than
             or equal to 2.5cm in diameter or extrarenal/extrahepatic metastatic RCC lesion
