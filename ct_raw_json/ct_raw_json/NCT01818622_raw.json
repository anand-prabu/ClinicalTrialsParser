            "textblock": "Recent discoveries in neurophysiology has shown that \"virtual darkness\" is achievable by\n      blocking blue wavelengths of light (Phelps, 2007). A newly discovered retinal photoreceptor\n      called the Intrinsically photoresponsive retinal ganglion-cell (IpRGC) whose fibers directly\n      synapses with the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), responds only to a narrow band of\n      wavelengths with highest sensitivity between 446 and 484 nm (Brainard et al., 2001; Berson\n      2007). Amber tinted goggles preserve normal nocturnal melatonin levels in light\n      environments, which means that blocking of the blue wavelengths is perceived as virtual\n      darkness to the SCN (Kayumov, 2005; Sasseville, 2006).\n\n      In this randomized controlled study we will investigate the effect of blue-blocking goggles\n      or screens (virtual darkness therapy) on manic symptoms in bipolar disorder compared to\n      placebo. The general feasibility of the method both in research and treatment will be\n      evaluated. This is a multi-site study covering Helse Fonna Local Health Authority's\n      catchment area wich serves a population of 120000 adults. This 3-armed study includes 2\n      patient-groups and a non-bipolar control-group. The main hypothesis is that virtual darkness\n      therapy is effective as additive treatment in mania.Other hypotheses are that virtual\n      darkness therapy has significant effects on sleep, motor activity, circadian rhythm and mood\n      also in the non-bipolar control-group. The study may contribute to develop a supplement to\n      the current treatment in mania and may also generate new hypotheses about the underlying\n      pathophysiological mechanisms in bipolar disorder."
