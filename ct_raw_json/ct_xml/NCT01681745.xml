        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or female, 18 to 70 years old

          -  Subject is willing and able to give written informed consent.

          -  Subject is committed to undergo an abdominoplasty procedure independent of this
             study.

          -  Subject is willing and able to comply with study instructions and commit to all
             visits for the duration of the study.

          -  Subject is in good general health and free of any disease state or physical condition
             that might impair evaluation or which in the investigator's opinion, expose the
             subject to an unacceptable risk by study participation.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or a device study that
             specifically targets the abdominal area.

          -  Subject currently smokes.

          -  Subject has a clotting disorder and/or has used an anticoagulant (e.g., warfarin,
             clopidogrel, etc.) within seven (7) days prior to administration of the device.

          -  Subject has used oral or inhaled steroids in the last 14 days and/or has been a
             chronic user of inhaled or oral steroids in the past such that the investigator feels
             subject may have compromised wound healing.

          -  Subject has used topical steroids in the abdominal area within the last 30 days.

          -  Subject is on any systemic immunosuppressive therapy.

          -  Subject has had prior surgery and/or treatment that alters the subcutaneous anatomy
             of the target treatment sites: liposuction, cryolipolysis, or high-intensity focused
             ultrasound.

          -  History of abdominal hernia.

          -  Subject has any of the following conditions:

          -  Allergy or intolerance to lidocaine,

          -  Other local skin condition (e.g., skin infection) at target treatment site,

          -  Any physical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's opinion would
             prevent adequate study participation.

          -  Chronic medical condition or use of medication that in the investigator's opinion
             would affect study participation or wound healing (such as diabetes, hepatitis, HIV,
             etc.).

          -  Subject is known to be noncompliant or is unlikely to comply with the requirements of
             the study protocol (e.g., due to alcoholism, drug dependency, mental incapacity) in
             the opinion of the investigator.
