  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the long-term effects of a prescription of exercise
      versus a group-based training program on aerobic fitness, muscle strength and metabolic
      variables in subjects with poor physical fitness. The participants are further stratified
      for a family-history of type 2 diabetes. The number of subjects in each group of
      intervention is planned to be 150, aged 30-70 years and non-diabetic.

      Intervention: All study subjects take part in two individual sessions for exercise
      prescription aiming at moderate exercise of 30 minutes at least 5 days a week. The
      prescription group perform exercise by themselves, while the training group will be offered
      supervised physical training, including both endurance training and training in gym twice a
      week during 12 months.

      The subjects will be followed up at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years after the basal visit.

      Methods of follow-up: At the study visits physical fitness will be measured by a 2 km
      walking test, glucose tolerance by oral glucose tolerance test with measurement of glucose
      and insulin. Lipids will be measured. Questionnaires will be used to follow lifestyle,
      physical activity, cardiovascular disease and medication.

      In the training group 30 subjects with and 30 subjects without a family history of type 2
      diabetes will participate in a sub-study including muscle- and fat-biopsy before the start
      of the study, after 1 and 5 years.
