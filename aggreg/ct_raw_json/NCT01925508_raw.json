            "textblock": "The hypertensive disorders in pregnancy affect approximately 5-8% of pregnant women\n      worldwide, contributing significantly to serious maternal and fetal complications. There are\n      various forms of hypertensive disorders that occur during pregnancy and among them are\n      pre-eclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed preeclampsia. These two disorders\n      present with high blood pressure and proteinuria, which leads often to hospitalization of\n      these women. It is believed that with such an accent hospitalization occur in pain\n      conditions that often affect pregnant women. Given these complications, this study aims to\n      evaluate the effectiveness of a physical therapy protocol used in pregnant women with\n      preeclampsia admitted with respect to blood pressure levels, responses maternal-fetal and\n      perinatal, and measure an expected improvement in quality of life in the reduction of\n      reported pain and anxiety. The study will include the participation of women with\n      preeclampsia and chronic hypertension with superimposed pre-eclampsia, hospitalized, with no\n      significant complications that may hinder the normal progress of pregnancy. Pregnant women\n      will answer questionnaires about quality of life, anxiety and scales to identify\n      musculoskeletal discomfort. Monitoring will be done both the pregnant woman and the fetus\n      through imaging and laboratory, in addition, pregnant women carry the exercise protocol\n      previously proposed work. This is expected to achieve satisfactory results in the\n      improvement of maternal and fetal hemodynamics in aspects of muscle discomfort and quality\n      of life in a secure way for these women."
