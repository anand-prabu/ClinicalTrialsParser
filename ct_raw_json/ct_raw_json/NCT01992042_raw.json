Use of natural medicines thought to have endocrine effects on prostate cancer (e.g.\n             saw palmetto and St. John's Wort) 4 weeks prior to enrollment.\n\n         11. Use of any drug listed in Prohibited Medications List\n\n         12. Mental incapacity or language barrier precluding adequate understanding or co\n             operation\n\n         13.
