Intermittent claudication (IC), defined as leg\n      pain with walking that is relieved with rest, is the most frequent clinical manifestation of\n      PAD.\n\n      In a proposal that was just funded by the National Institute of Health (NIH) National Center\n      for Advancing TRanslational Sciences (NCATS) the investigators pose to test the \"reuse\" of\n      zibotentan (ZD4054, an Asta-Zeneca compound), an orally active, endothelin receptor A (ETA)\n      antagonist in patients with IC.  The study will seek to confirm the safety and tolerability\n      of 10mg of ZD4054 in patients with intermittent claudication (Rutherford II or III) and, in\n      parallel, establish the capacity of ZD4054 to change calf  muscle perfusion, as assessed by\n      contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging, functional treadmill performance, and quality\n      of life indicators.\n\n      The study will be a 1:1 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 44 subjects\n      with intermittent claudication with randomization stratified based on the entry calf muscle\n      perfusion.  The investigators will use magnetic resonance imaging to quantify changes in\n      blood flow to the ischemic limb from baseline to week 12 between those randomized to drug\n      vs. placebo.  Based on the prior experience and the known tolerability of ZD4054, the\n      experience of the investigative team with a mechanistically appropriate end-point measure\n      that is part of other NIH funded projects, the investigators will proceed directly to this\n      Phase II trial.  The primary endpoint of the study will be the change in absolute perfusion\n      in the index calf muscle from baseline to follow-up, after 12 weeks on the 10 mg dose or\n      placebo.  Additional outcome measures will be: a) ability of patients with PAD to tolerate\n      10 mg dose of ZD4054 vs. placebo; b) freedom from unexpected serious adverse events; c)\n      change in peak walking time from baseline to 12 weeks between 10 mg of ZD4054 and placebo\n      groups; d) change in ankle-brachial blood pressure index (ABI) from baseline to 12 weeks\n      between 10 mg of ZD4054 and placebo groups, and; d) change in quality of life measure\n      between 10 mg of ZD4054 and placebo groups."
