            "textblock": "Background: Portable oxygen concentrators (POCs) featuring the latest integrated oxygen\n      conserving devices (OCDs) provide greater patient accessibility and mobility during\n      ambulation and travel. Recent POCs are compact, lightweight, battery-operated, and require\n      no refill-time, thus meeting patients' clinical and lifestyle needs. There is, however, a\n      lack of research on the clinical performance of the latest POCs that could help to determine\n      their ability to maintain patients' oxygen saturations \u2265 90 % during exercise.\n\n      Aim: The purpose of this study is to compare the ability of three POCs, with maximum oxygen\n      production capabilities of 950 to 3000 ml per minute, to maintain oxygen saturations \u2265 90 %\n      in patients with chronic lung disease during exercise.\n\n      Method: Six minute walk tests (6-MWTs) will be administered in order to measure oxygen\n      saturations by pulse oximetry (SpO2) in up to 20 patients with a diagnosis of either Chronic\n      Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), or Pulmonary Fibrosis (PF) with documented exertional\n      oxygen desaturations of \u2264 85% on room air. All participants will participate in 4 different\n      6-minute walk tests: the first will be a control walk performed with the participants'\n      current oxygen system set at their prescribed exertional flow rate. Then, the participants\n      will perform a walk test with each of the three POCs set at the units' maximum pulse dose\n      setting. The order in which the participants use the POCs will be randomly assigned using a\n      sequence generator.\n\n      Hypothesis: It is hypothesized that all three POCs will provide oxygen saturations \u2265 90 %\n      during exercise in patients with chronic lung disease with moderate to severe exertional\n      oxygen desaturation."
