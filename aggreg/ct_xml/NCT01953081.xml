  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being conducted to evaluate the safety, tolerability and early efficacy of IV
      TD 8954 compared to metoclopramide in critically ill subjects, aged 18 to 85 years, who are
      admitted to the intensive care  require mechanical ventilation, and are intolerant to
      enteral feeding.
