      The purpose of this study is

        1. To estimate the association between prenatal exposure to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)
           and the risk of asthma during childhood.

        2. To estimate the association between prenatal exposure to H2-receptor antagonists
           (H2RAs) and the risk of asthma during childhood.

        All women aged 18-45 years and with at least one pregnancy between 1 January 1995 and 31
        December 2010 who have been enrolled with their PCP (Primary Care Physician) for at least
        1 year and have had a health contact in the year prior to the last menstrual period (LMP)
        of the respective pregnancy. The final study population will include pregnancies that can
        be unequivocally linked with live birth(s) and only the first pregnancy ascertained during
        the study period for each woman will be retained
