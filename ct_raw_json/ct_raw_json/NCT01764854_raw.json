The study consists of a 2 week\n      treatment-free run-in period where entry criteria are verified, a 4-week treatment period,\n      of which the first week of treatment will be performed as an in-patient study in a clinical\n      pharmacology unit (CPU) and the remaining three weeks of treatment will performed as an\n      out-patient study, and a 2-week treatment-free follow-up period.\n\n      Safety assessments will be performed at regular intervals and will include clinical and\n      vital signs, clinical laboratory evaluations, ECGs, and AE monitoring. Pharmacodynamic\n      assessments will include, but are not limited to, interdialytic weight gain (IDWG), blood\n      pressure, and stool sodium excretion. Pharmacokinetic assessments will include blood\n      sampling for measurement of study drug plasma concentrations."
