Patients with histologically confirmed cancer of the cervix or endometrium.\n\n               1. In patient with cervix cancer, there must be confirmation of invasive disease;\n                  FIGO stage 1B1 or higher FIGO stage demonstrated clinically and/or on MRI. In\n                  patients with advanced disease being considered for chemoradiotherapy treatment,\n                  patients may be considered for entry if nodal lymphadenectomy is being used to\n                  inform radiotherapy planning;\n\n               2. In patients with endometrial cancer, a) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any\n                  higher stage and grade 3 b) stage 1A with myometrial invasion or any other\n                  higher stage and serous papillary or clear cell sub-types\n\n               3. stage II disease or above and any histology grade The MDT decision may be based\n                  on the combination of tumour characteristics on histology, clinical and imaging\n                  findings.\n\n          3. No contra-indication to FDG-PET/CT, FEC-PET/CT or MRI.\n\n          4. Fit for surgical lymphadenectomy, as determined by the local MDT. The patient should\n             also be considered fit for extended field radiotherapy in cases where lymphadenectomy\n             is being undertaken to inform radiotherapy planning.\n\n             The extent of lymph node dissection will be made by the local multidisciplinary team,\n             based on the presence of risk factors for lymph node metastases, according to the\n             protocol. Patients must be considered fit to undergo lymph node dissection.\n\n          5. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with the study\n             protocol procedures\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Known contra-indication to MRI or PET/CT scan.\n\n          2. Known allergy to FDG or FEC.\n\n          3. Not considered fit for lymphadenectomy (open or laparoscopic) or, where appropriate,\n             radiotherapy, as determined by the local MDT.\n\n          4. If the patient is pregnant or breast-feeding.\n\n          5. Females of childbearing potential must be willing to use an effective method of\n             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control) from the time consent is\n             signed until 6 weeks after the last PET/CT scan unless undergoing hysterectomy.\n\n             Note: subjects are not considered of childbearing potential if they are surgically\n             sterile (they have undergone bilateral tubal ligation or bilateral oophorectomy) or\n             they are postmenopausal\n\n          6. Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test within three\n             weeks prior to being registered for the study.\n\n          7. Participation in another Clinical Trial of an Investigational Medicinal Product\n             (CTIMP).  If patient's have recently completed a CTIMP trial they must have had their\n             last dose(s) of study drug prior to their first imaging procedure on the MAPPING\n             study.\n\n          8. Participation in another clinical trial (CTIMP or non-CTIMP) where the protocol\n             contains imaging procedures that would occur during the MAPPING study.\n\n          9. Medical or psychiatric illness, which makes the patient unsuitable or unable to give\n             informed consent."
