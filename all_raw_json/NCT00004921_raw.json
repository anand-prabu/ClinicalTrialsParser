Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is most effective for ovarian epithelial cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying high-dose chemotherapy to see how well\n      it works compared to standard chemotherapy in treating patients with stage III or stage IV\n      ovarian epithelial cancer that has been removed during surgery."

Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive 5 courses of sequential high-dose chemotherapy as follows:\n\n             -  Courses 1 and 2: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cyclophosphamide\n                IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by peripheral blood stem cell (PBSC) collection.\n                Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously (SC) beginning 24 hours\n                following chemotherapy and continuing until target number of PBSC are reached.\n\n             -  Courses 3 and 4: Patients receive paclitaxel as in courses 1-2 and carboplatin IV\n                over 4 hours on day 1. At 72 hours following completion of carboplatin, patients\n                receive PBSC infusion. Beginning one day following PBSC infusion, patients receive\n                G-CSF SC until blood counts recover.\n\n             -  Course 5: Patients receive paclitaxel as in courses 1 and 2 and carboplatin as in\n                courses 3 and 4 and melphalan IV over 15 minutes on day 2 or 3. Patients receive\n                PBSC and G-CSF as in courses 3 and 4.\n\n             -  Treatment repeats every 3-4 weeks.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive standard chemotherapy consisting of carboplatin (or cisplatin)\n           and paclitaxel IV over 3 hours every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Patients may receive\n           doxorubicin or epirubicin in addition to the standard chemotherapy every 4 weeks.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed prior to therapy, at 4-6 weeks following completion of therapy,\n      and then at 3 months, 9 months, and 15 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 208 patients (104 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
