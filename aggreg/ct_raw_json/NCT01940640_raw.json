We try to deepen into the effect on the neuronal and\n      visual development and to study, for the first time, the effect on the oxidative damage,\n      pro- and antiinflammatory citoquines activity and bone metabolism in this group of newborn\n      babies."

In addition, all the groups will be underwent to a nutritional\n      surveillance (a follow-up of 48 hours and a questionnaire of frequency of consumption) and\n      will be given nutritionally-balanced diets, insisting especially in the suitable consumption\n      of fish (4 portions/week). Blood samples will be obtained in all the groups at the birth\n      moment, at the week 40 of gestational age corrected in the groups of premature babies and at\n      the end of the lactation in all the groups (minimum 3 months).We will obtain samples of\n      mother\u00b4s milk (colostrum, transition and mature milk). In these samples we will study bone\n      turnover biomarkers, pro - and anti-inflammatory citoquines and markers of aggression\n      oxidative damage. In addition, we will perform psychomotor and visual development tests in\n      the newborn children."
