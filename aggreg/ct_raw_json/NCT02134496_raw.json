This is an randomized controlled trial between two groups with assessment of\n      normal (Aldrete) PACU discharge criteria with or without assessment of the motorfunction.\n      The study hypothesis is that it is safe to be discharged from the PACU to a ward without\n      assessment of motor function.T The main outcome is length of hospial stay (LOS) in days and\n      re-admission within the first 90 days after surgery .\n\n      Secondary outcomes include adverse events up to 24 hours after surgery, and minuttes spent\n      in the PACU after surgery.\n\n      Participants will be monitores for adverse events for the first 24 hours after surgery and\n      reported. The total number of minuttes spent in the PACU will be recorded and reported."
