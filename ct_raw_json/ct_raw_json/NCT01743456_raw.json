            "textblock": "Post-Operative Cognitive Decline (POCD) is common after cardiac surgery and associated with\n      increased morbidity and mortality. The pathophysiology of POCD is only poorly understood.\n      Causes include hypoperfusion, microemboli and the systemic inflammatory response, which\n      result in a reduction of cerebral oxygen delivery.\n\n      Cerebral oxygenation can be monitored non-invasively by measuring frontal lobe oxygen\n      saturation (rSO2).\n\n      The bispectral index (BIS) of the electroencephalogram is widely known to measure depth of\n      anaesthesia, and there is a high correlation between BIS, a dimensionless calculated number\n      between 0 and 100, and clinical criteria of sedation. With BIS below 60 recall is extremely\n      low.\n\n      The investigators demonstrated recently that inappropriately high levels of anaesthesia may\n      be associated with poorer long-term outcomes in cognition after non-cardiac surgery (Ballard\n      et al. 2012). Whether optimisation of the depth of anaesthesia and cerebral oxygenation has\n      an effect on postoperative cognitive function in patients undergoing cardiac surgery is\n      unknown.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the incidence of POCD in elderly patients (> 65 years\n      old) at 6 weeks is less with mildly deep anaesthesia (BIS 50 +- 10) and optimised rSO2\n      (interventions when rSO2 drops below 15% of baseline reading) when compared with current\n      practice (BIS blinded anaesthesia, reflecting moderately to highly deep anaesthesia and\n      blinded rSO2 measurements)."
