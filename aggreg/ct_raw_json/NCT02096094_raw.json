Nowadays single-use products are a new\n      option for prevent cross-infections. Nevertheless, traditional bed bathing is a tightly\n      established practice among nursing staff.

The aim of this study is to determinate if\n      bed bathing with 2% chlorhexidine impregnated wipes has a similar effect that a placebo."
