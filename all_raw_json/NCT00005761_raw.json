Those enrolled will represent a range of diabetic retinopathy from\n      minimal to severe.  Participants will undergo the following procedures:\n\n        -  medical history\n\n        -  thorough eye examination\n\n        -  photographs of the eye\n\n        -  blood tests to measure blood lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides) and serum\n           creatinine (for kidney function)\n\n        -  blood tests to measure levels of blood factors (cell adhesion molecules, chemokines and\n           vascular endothelial growth factor) that may be related to the progression of diabetic\n           retinopathy\n\n        -  blood pressure measurement\n\n        -  urinalysis\n\n      This study may lead to a better understanding of how diabetic retinopathy develops and\n      progresses."
