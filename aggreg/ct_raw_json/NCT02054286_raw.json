HAART will be resumed one\n      week after the second injection. 15 weeks after resumption, HAART will be interrupted.\n      Patients will then be monitored every 2 weeks for CD4+ T cell counts and viral load as well\n      as for thorough assessment of the elicited immune response. Stringent anti-HIV treatments\n      resumption criteria have been implemented, based on the CD4+ T cell counts and the viral\n      load.\n\n      End of study will occur once the 36th patient has reached his visit at Week 36 (i.e. 36\n      weeks after having received the first administration)."
