  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to determine if using weekly romiplostim injections will improve the patient's
      platelet count more effectively than simply waiting for the platelets to improve on its own,
      and if romiplostim will also allow the patient to receive at least 2 further cycles of
      chemotherapy without thrombocytopenia.

    <description>All patients randomized to the experimental arm will begin weekly romiplostim at 2 mcg/kg, subcutaneously. The romiplostim dose will be titrated on weekly CBC/platelet counts. For titration purposes, the target platelet count is 150,000- 200,000/mcL.</description>

    <description>Patients will be monitored with weekly CBCs, after enrollment. Supportive transfusion will not be withheld if considered necessary, but will result in removal from the study. If patients in the control cohort do not spontaneously achieve adequate platelet correction &gt;100,000/mcL by the 3-week primary endpoint, they can then be crossed-over to romiplostim treatment. For those patients who cross-over to romiplostim, monitoring and romiplostim dose titration is to be performed as above for the initial romiplostim cohort.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1. Patients (18 years of age or greater) with active non-hematological cancer:

        A. The patients have previously received a chemotherapy regimen including one or more of
        the following agents:

          1. Nucleoside Analogue, including gemcitabine and fluorouracil

          2. Carboplatin or cisplatin

          3. Anthracycline

          4. Alkylating agent

          5. Other chemotherapy agents with thrombocytopenia as known common toxicity.

        2. Patients who have not had any cytotoxic chemotherapy within 14 days of beginning the
        study.

        3. Thrombocytopenia:.

        A. Defined as platelet count &lt;100,000/mcL.

        B. The patient will have had at least 2 CBCs with platelet counts &lt;100,000/mcL separated
        by at least 4 weeks, and no platelet count &gt;100,000/mcL in the prior 6 week period,
        despite (1) delay, or (2) modification of chemotherapeutic regimen.

        C. Patients have undergone bone marrow aspirate and biopsy in the prior 2 weeks without
        evidence of leukemia or myelodysplasia by fluorescent in situ-hybridization (FISH)FISH.
        Dysplastic changes, based on morphology only, will not exclude the patient if FISH panel
        for MDS is normal.

        4.KPS &gt; 50 or ECOG performance status &lt;2 .

        5.Ability to provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with history of hematologic malignancies, including leukemia, myeloma,
             myeloproliferative disease, lymphoma, or myelodysplastic diseases.

          2. Anemia (Hgb &lt;8.0 gm/dl) or leukopenia (absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;1,000/mcL).
             Use of red cell transfusions, erythropoietin, or G-CSF, as ordered by the managing
             oncology service, is acceptable and does not preclude participation.

          3. Patients with underlying liver disease, such as cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, will
             be excluded if ALT/AST &gt;3X ULN or Total Bili &gt;3X ULN. In the presence of liver
             metastasis, but no known cirrhosis or chronic hepatitis, patients will be excluded if
             ALT/AST &gt;5X ULN or Total Bili &gt;5X ULN

          4. Patients with a history of a prior symptomatic venous thrombotic event (i.e. DVT,
             pulmonary embolus, MI, CVA, TIA).

          5. Serious concomitant medical condition that could interfere with the conduct of the
             clinical trial, such as unstable angina, renal failure requiring hemodialysis, or
             active infection requiring IV antibiotics

          6. Pregnant women/lactating mothers

          7. Patients unwilling to use contraception.
