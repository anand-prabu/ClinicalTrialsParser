    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multi center study of treatment-naive non-cirrhotic subjects with
      genotype 1 chronic Hepatitis C Virus.  All subjects will receive telaprevir (TVR) in
      combination with sofosbuvir (SOF) for 12 weeks.

    <textblock>
      Starting on Day 1 and for up to 12 weeks, you will receive Telaprevir (TVR) and Sofosbuvir
      (SOF).

      You will take one (1) 400 mg tablet of SOF and 3 tablets (1125 mg each) of TVR.  You should
      take these together by mouth every morning. You will take another 3 tablets (1125 mg each)
      of TVR by mouth 12 hours after you take your morning dose.
