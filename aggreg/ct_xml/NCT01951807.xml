  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Subjects that have received medical treatment for ovarian cancer can be both physically and
      emotionally demanding for patients. The purpose of this study is to determine whether two
      common pyschological interventions (Communication Skills Intervention and Supportive
      Counseling) may improve the well-being of ovarian cancer patients compared to usual care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Very little is known in the psycho-oncology literature about why psychological interventions
      are effective or for how long these interventions exert an impact. Given many cancer
      patients experience recurrence and/or progression, it is important to know whether our
      relatively brief interventions facilitate how patients cope with this most-feared medical
      event. From a theoretical perspective, the study will advance our understanding of the
      mechanisms for change for two common treatment approaches, supportive and cognitive
      behavioral therapies.

      Subjects will be enrolled and upon completion of a baseline survey, randomized to into one
      of three arms - Communication Skills Intervention, Supportive Counseling, and Usual Care.
      Subjects will complete surveys during the course of the interventions.
