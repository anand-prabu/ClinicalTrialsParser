    <textblock>
      This study is designed to determine if magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measures can be used
      to diagnose and monitor the progression of Parkinson's disease (PD) while distinguishing
      between PD and parkinsonisms [conditions that are PD look-a-like diseases such as
      progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or multiple system atrophy (MSA)] when combined with
      changes in certain proteins in body fluids that are related to iron (Fe).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The lack of in vivo biomarker(s) reflecting Parkinson's disease (PD)-related cell loss and
      associated pathoetiological/physiological processes in nigrostriatal structures has hindered
      discovery research and limited the ability to evaluate disease-modifying therapies. Recent
      research has generated excitement for using DTI and R2* MRI measures as biomarker(s) for
      PD-related pathology in nigrostriatal pathways, but they fall short by the lack of
      understanding of their clinical implications and biological/pathological underpinnings.
      Working closely with the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS)
      Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers Program (PDBP), the proposed work will investigate multimodal
      MRI techniques in combination with fluid-based iron (Fe) protein profiles to serve as in
      vivo markers for PD-related nigrostriatal pathology that can be used as biomarkers for
      diagnosing PD, following its progression, and gaining mechanistic understanding of PD
      pathoetiology and pathophysiology.

    <description>Postmortem brain analysis on patients who succumb to their disease during the study will be performed in order to inform the relationship of the biomarkers to clinical diagnosis (PD, PSP, MSA) and clinical milestones as well as to inform the pathological underpinnings of the R2* and DTI measures. In addition to standard postmortem diagnostic tests (alpha-synuclein, beta-amyloid, tau, and ubiquitin), total Fe staining, ferritin, hepcidin, tyrosine hydroxylase positive neurons, myelin and glial derived growth factors (glial cell markers) will be assessed in nigrostriatal structures in order to correlate these levels with MRI measures.</description>
