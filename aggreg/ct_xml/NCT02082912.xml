    <textblock>
      Disability after a stroke is common, leaving 65% of patients unable to use their affected
      hand in daily activities after 6 months.  Frequently, these limitations can cause a
      decreased quality of life.   This study is about arm and hand recovery 3 months post-stroke.
         The purpose of this study is to focus on enhancing upper limb recovery in patients
      post-stroke by using robotic-assisted therapy in combination with a drug to improve learning
      new motor skills.

      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups.  No matter what group patients
      are assigned they will receive 3 weeks of therapy.  However, one group will receive a drug
      that may improve learning new motor skills while the other group will receive a sugar pill.
      The robotic therapy will last 2 hours per day for 2 consecutive weeks.  The hand robot helps
      participants move the wrist up and down with activities that require varying levels of wrist
      control and are aimed at increasing the active range of motion of the wrist. This type of
      training is thought to provide patients with challenging, intensive and meaningful practice
      using the arm that was most affected by their stroke. The overall intent of this type of
      training is to improve participants' skill and confidence in using the arm that was most
      affected.

      The drug (called D-cycloserine) is approved for use in people by the FDA.  It may enhance
      certain features of motor skill learning, by improving memory while doing motor skills. The
      memory effect can be coupled with robotic-assisted physical therapy to improve the function
      of impaired limbs to a greater extent and at a faster rate than may occur without the drug.

      It has been shown that an alteration or change in a specific gene has been associated in
      methods related to movement recovery after stroke. These same genes may also be important to
      recovery from stroke in humans.

      This study asks how these genes and patients' recovery following therapy may have an effect
      on outcome after stroke. Genetic testing (done by swabbing the inside of the mouth with a
      q-tip) will be done at the initial visit to test for the presence/absence of these
      hereditary markers in the saliva. A change in behavioral measures (as seen by the two
      testing sessions) may show a relationship between the presences of selected forms of genetic
      variation.

      Therefore, the purpose of this study is to understand the important factors in
      rehabilitation therapy that help improve arm function after stroke.  This information may
      help to ultimately reduce disability and improve quality of life in patients with stroke.
