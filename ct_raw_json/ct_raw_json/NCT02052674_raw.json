The\n      difference between the two catheters is that one catheter is vented (the study catheter) and\n      the other is a standard non-vented catheter.  The vented catheter may drain urine better\n      than a standard non-vented catheter.\n\n      If a vented catheter drains the bladder better than a non-vented catheter it may lower the\n      risk of retained urine in the bladder which could help prevent urinary tract infections."
