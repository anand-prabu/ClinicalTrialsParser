Patient;s who are asked to participate int his study have a growth (mass) in the\n      bile duct that needs a biopsy so a diagnosis can be made.  Standard of care includes\n      performing 5-7 biopsies in the bile duct and sending the tissue to the lab for testing to\n      make a diagnosis.  Using this method the investigators can establish a diagnosis only about\n      50% of the time.  The investigators believe that if a pathologist is available in the\n      endoscopy suite during the procedure, the investigators can improve the test results.  The\n      purpose of this study is to compare the two methods for processing biopsies obtained from\n      the bile duct."

This translates to\n      the need for performing repeat procedures to establish a diagnosis and therefore delays\n      patient treatment. The biopsy specimen obtained at cholangioscopy are  usually processed in\n      an offsite pathology lab. We believe that if a pathologist can assess the tissue sample\n      during the procedure itself (onsite) and provide feedback, the diagnostic accuracy rate will\n      improve. This translates to better (faster) diagnosis and early treatment.  Therefore, we\n      will be comparing onsite versus offsite evaluation of bile duct biopsy specimens to\n      determine which method yields a better diagnosis."
