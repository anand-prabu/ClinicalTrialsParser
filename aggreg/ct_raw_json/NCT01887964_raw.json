People with\n      metabolic syndrome are at increased risk for heart diseases. Research shows benefits of\n      regular fiber intake in  metabolic syndrome. However, due to altered taste and texture of\n      the high fiber foods, long term intake of fiber is a challenge for metabolic syndrome\n      patients. This study is designed to find if blinded-substitution of  regular wheat flour in\n      domestic kitchen with wheat flour enriched by an adaptable type of fiber (resistant\n      starch-4),  minimizes metabolic syndrome symptoms. this special type of fiber is also\n      obtained from wheat."
