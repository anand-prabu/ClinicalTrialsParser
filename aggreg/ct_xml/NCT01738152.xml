      The purpose of this study is to see whether it is feasible to conduct a study to determine
      if the use of hyaluronic acid (HLA) vaginal gel (HyaloGYN®) improves vaginal health.

      This study aims to look at whether or not it is effective in women with a history of hormone
      receptor positive cancer and experiencing vaginal symptoms of estrogen deprivation following
      their breast and endometrial cancer treatment.

    <description>This is a single arm prospective longitudinal clinical trial investigating the feasibility of a hyaluronic acid (HLA) vaginal gel (HyaloGYN®; Cebert Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; Birmingham, Alabama) to improve estrogen deprivation vaginal health symptoms in post-menopausal women with a history of hormone-receptor positive cancer with estrogen deprivation symptoms of vaginal dryness and discomfort.</description>

    <intervention_name>HLA vaginal gel (HyaloGYN®),</intervention_name>
    <description>Each participant will receive a HLA vaginal gel (HyaloGYN®), which is an over-the-counter, colorless gel to be administered as a vaginal gel for hydration and lubrication of the vaginal epithelium for women suffering dryness. Participants will be instructed to insert the HLA gel into the vagina (with applicator) daily for the first 2 weeks, and then 3 times per week for 10 weeks.Participants will also be asked to keep a moisturizer diary. In it they will record the date and time the gel is used. The initial PhD/NP visit and subsequent NP visits, including completion of the Clinical Assessment Form and the pelvic exam performed by the NP are all part of the standard treatment plan that all patients receive at the Female Sexual Medicine Program. PhD follow-up visits can be based upon the treatment plan of the patient and is not always necessary within the specified study time points.</description>

    <description>Assessment Form as part of routine clinical care. Participants will be asked to complete questionnaires at the baseline initial evaluation, 4-6 weeks, 12-14 weeks, and 22-24 weeks. The study information collected will be found in the standardized Clinical Assessment Form that patients complete as part of routine clinical care, along with an additional survey pertinent to the aims of the study. At 24 weeks, participants will complete an additional questionnaire that will ask questions regarding their experience with HyaloGYN® and their acceptability of and satisfaction with the product. Study participants must see the NP for the targeted exams at the study follow-up time points (4-6 weeks, 12-14 weeks, 22-24 weeks). PhD follow-up visits can be based upon the treatment plan of the patient. The study questionnaires (Appendix II-Follow-Up and Appendix IV) and moisturizer diaries (Appendix III) will be completed and collected during the NP follow-up appointments.</description>
