After applying local anesthesia, 0.2 ml hyaluronic\n      acid gel will be injected at the affected areas. This procedure will be repeated 3 times for\n      the evaluated areas. Photographs will be taken before injection this material, and at 3 and\n      6 months following the intervention."

The loss of papilla can cause cosmetic\n      deformities (black triangles), phonetic problems, and food debris accumulation. Often the\n      loss of papilla is a consequence of periodontal disease because of gingival inflammation,\n      attachment loss and interproximal bone height resorption.\n\n      Several reasons also lead to absence of interdental papillae including:\n\n      1) Plaque associated lesions, 2) Traumatic oral hygiene procedures, 3) Abnormal tooth shape,\n      4) Improper contours of the restoration, 5) Spacing between teeth, 6) Loss of teeth."
