With the prescription software Cato-PAN\u00ae (by Cato software\n      solutions) exact valid prescriptions for ordering parenteral nutrition solutions for\n      premature infants are compared. Each PN solution is prescribed individually as well as with\n      Numeta. Prescriptions were mirrored  with respect to weight, venous approach, total volume\n      and amount of enteral feeding, 24h medication and  flipped vice versa. The key nutrient for\n      calculating Numeta prescriptions was protein. The results of PN prescriptions were compared\n      with each other/ESPGHAN recommendations. The investigators hypothesize that nutrimental\n      content of Numeta prescriptions is equal to individually prescribed .parenteral nutrition\n      solutions"
