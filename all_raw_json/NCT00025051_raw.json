Participants are\n      randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Participants receive oral celecoxib twice daily for approximately 120 days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Participants receive oral placebo twice daily for approximately 120 days.\n\n      Skin biopsies of UV-exposed sites are evaluated.\n\n      Participants are followed for up to 5 weeks post-treatment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 participants (18 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 8 months."
