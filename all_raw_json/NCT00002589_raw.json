After cellular production, the autologous lymphocytes are\n      reinfused over at least 30 minutes. Treatment repeats monthly for 6 months and then every 3\n      months for 6 months in the absence of unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then\n      annually for 5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 10-90 patients will accrued for this study within 3 years."
