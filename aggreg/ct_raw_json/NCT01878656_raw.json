Postoperative pain is also associated with emergence\n      agitation. Although there is a lot of studies about emergence agitation in children, there\n      is a few in adults, furthermore, no data about comparison of emergence agitation between\n      sevoflurane and desflurane anesthesia in adults. Therefore, the investigators would like to\n      compare the incidence and severity of emergence agitation between sevoflurane and desflurane\n      anesthesia in adults after orthognathic surgery."
