            "textblock": "Over the last few years the chance of dying from a heart attack in England and Wales has\n      reduced dramatically. Even so, there remain huge differences in mortality between hospitals.\n      For example, up to a third of patients with a heart attack who attend hospitals in England\n      are more likely to die than would be expected. That is, the type of treatment and the risk\n      of death depends upon where a patient lives and which hospital they attend. In part, the\n      variation in death may be due to the services available at the hospital or to factors such\n      as socioeconomic deprivation. It may also relate to other factors such as depression,\n      cardiac rehabilitation and whether patients take their medication after discharge from\n      hospital. Using powerful statistical approaches that include measures of quality of life, we\n      propose to examine data about heart attacks in England and investigate the 'postcode lottery\n      of care'. Our aim, using regional data about heart attacks is to identify and measure the\n      effects of hospital care. This research will identify hospital qualities that promote\n      improved patient care. In doing so, best practice will be highlighted and healthcare policy\n      changed so that all patients will have an equal chance of surviving a heart attack."
