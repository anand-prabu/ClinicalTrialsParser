This agent is called\n      Eovist. It has been marketed since 2004 and used in many countries all over the world.\n\n      The baby will have blood tests before and after the imaging is done to make sure that there\n      are no unexpected findings before and after the imaging. Also 3 blood samples up to 8 hours\n      after the injection will be obtained in order to measure how much of the dye is in the\n      blood. The baby will have an intravenous line which can be used for the blood samples and\n      will not need to be stick for the blood samples. Several radiologists will evaluate the\n      images. The family doctor will be contacted to find out what was the diagnosis and treatment\n      after the results of the MRI were known. Six months after the study, the parent(s)/legal\n      guardian(s) will be contacted to make sure the that baby did not have any problems,\n      especially with the skin, joints and eyes."
