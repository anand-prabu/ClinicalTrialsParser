  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can be used to evaluate whether parts of the heart
      muscle are alive but receiving inadequate blood supply.  This study involves the use of two
      radiotracers that will measure whether heart muscle cell are alive and quantify the blood
      supply to the heart muscle.

    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) scans can be used to evaluate whether parts of the heart
      muscle (myocardium) are alive but receiving inadequate blood supply. This information can be
      helpful in identifying the best course of treatment. This type of study involves the use of
      two radiotracers: rubidium-82 (to measure blood flow) and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose or FDG (to
      measure whether heart muscle cells are alive).  Currently, each of these radiotracers is
      imaged at separate times, several hours apart.  The purpose of this study is to evaluate
      methods that could allow the entire study to be performed at one time.

    <description>Study subjects will undergo a Cardiac PET scan that will take approximately 20 minutes to complete.  In addition to standard clinical rubidium-82/18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET imaging, during a separate imaging session, participants will be infused with a second dose of the radio-tracer rubidium-82 during FDG imaging scan that will take an additional 10 to 15 minutes to complete.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. 18 years of age or older

          2. Patients referred for clinically indicated positron emission tomography (PET)
             viability assessment with rubidium-82 rest perfusion imaging and
             18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) metabolic imaging.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Need for stress perfusion imaging

          2. Claustrophobia which would prevent positron emission tomography (PET) imaging.

          3. Inability to lie flat with arms positioned next to the head for approximately 20
             minutes.

          4. Clinical instability such as uncontrolled, potentially life threatening arrhythmias
             or heart failure requiring mechanical support or infusions of inotropic or
             vasopressor agents.
