The study will consist of 4 study visits which will take place\n      over the duration of 1 year. At the first visit (ie, Week 0), eligibility for the study will\n      be determined (it will be screening and baseline visit). At each subsequent visit (Weeks 16,\n      28, and 52), exposure to ustekinumab will be recorded, questionnaires for efficacy will be\n      completed, and information about adverse events and concomitant medications will be\n      collected. As many patient reported outcome questionnaires as possible will be administered,\n      depending on the availability of validated translations. Safety will be assessed by\n      monitoring of adverse events, vital signs and physical examination."
