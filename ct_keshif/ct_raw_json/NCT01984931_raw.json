All patients will be assessed using\n      the simplified risk score of Apfel et al. to determine who have the risk factors for PONV.\n      The episodes of nausea and vomiting will be recorded taking note of its intensity and\n      frequency on the said three time frames. Nausea is defined as a subjectively unpleasant\n      sensation associated with an awareness of the urge to vomit; vomiting is defined as the\n      forceful expulsion of gastric contents through the mouth. As retching is similar to vomiting\n      in all aspects, except for the expulsion of gastric contents, it was considered as vomiting.\n      The efficacy of anti-emetic medication (NEWBUTIN 300 mg/tab) will be assessed by monitoring\n      the frequency and severity of nausea, vomiting, and PONV (which was regarded as the primary\n      outcome). The severity of nausea will be graded on a four-point scale, where 0= no nausea,\n      1= mild nausea, 2= moderate nausea, and 3= severe nausea.Then the frequency will be assessed\n      by monitoring how often the patient experienced these episodes (nausea and vomiting)during\n      the said time frames."
