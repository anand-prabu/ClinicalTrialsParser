  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this application are to determine if the selective ERβ agonist
      LY500307, when added to antipsychotic medications, improves negative and/or cognitive
      symptoms in patients with schizophrenia.  The specific hypotheses to be tested are to
      determine if LY500307 is safe and well tolerated in this population and whether it elicits a
      sufficient efficacy signal to be advanced for further testing in schizophrenia.  A single
      seamless, two-staged, Phase 1b/2a adaptive design will be used.  The purpose of Stage 1is to
      evaluate two LY500307 doses (25 mg/day and 75 mg/day) to determine which dose should be
      advanced to Stage 2 for efficacy assessment.

      Specific Aim 1: To determine if one dose of LY500307 is superior to placebo for one or more
      of the primary efficacy endpoints: negative symptoms (Negative Symptom Assessment Scale -
      16-item total score), working memory (the composite score for the Letter Number Sequencing
      and Spatial Span tests) and verbal memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test).

      Specific aim 2: To determine if either LY500307 dose reduces total testosterone plasma
      concentrations, which is indicative of loss of selectivity for ERβ and engagement of ERα,
      using the following criteria:  Decrease in total testosterone plasma concentrations of 50%
      from baseline in 50% of subjects treated with LY500307 in Stage 1 of the trial.

      Both positive signal detection in any one of the three primary efficacy outcome measures and
      a negative (i.e., suppressing) effect on testosterone levels will be used as Go/No Go
      criteria to determine transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 of the adaptive trial.

      Secondary aims are to assess LY500307 effects on regional brain activation and connectivity
      during working (2-Back visual-verbal working memory task) and episodic (scene encoding and
      recognition)and memory tasks, and to evaluate electrophysiological indices of auditory
      sensory processing and working memory (auditory steady state responses, mismatch negativity
      (MMN) and auditory P300).  It is predicted that LY500307 will produce greater increases than
      placebo in brain activity in prefrontal cortex and hippocampus during the working memory and
      episodic memory tasks, respectively, connectivity during resting fMRI, as well as increases
      in power of the auditory steady state response, MMN amplitude and P300 amplitude.  The fMRI
      and electrophysiological measures will provide evidence of target engagement of LY500307 in
      schizophrenia and will be assessed as potential biomarkers for future clinical trials.
      Additional secondary aims will include assessing the effects of LY500307 on safety, positive
      symptoms, depression, social functioning and quality of life.
