The pill diary forms will be turned into the research staff at the end of each treatment cycle.\nDoses will be escalated from 50mg PO Q 12 hr to 800mg PO Q 12 hr following dose escalation guidelines in response to any dose-limiting toxicities experienced on study."

            "textblock": "Cancer continues to be a major global health burden. In the United States of America (USA),\n      it is the second most common cause of death after heart disease, accounting for nearly 1 in\n      every 4 deaths (American Cancer Society, 2011). The 5-year survival rate for all cancers\n      diagnosed between 1999 and 2006 is 68%, which is 18% higher than the rate reported between\n      1975 and 1977, likely reflecting progress in diagnosing certain cancers earlier and\n      improvements in treatment (American Cancer Society, 2011). Unfortunately, despite\n      indisputable progress in the treatment of cancer, there continues to be an unmet medical\n      need for more effective and less toxic therapies, especially for those patients with\n      advanced disease that do not respond or have become resistant to existing therapies. One\n      aspect of the growth and spread of cancer cells is overcoming the immune response from the\n      affected individual. The mechanisms for this are multiple. One aspect is the existence of a\n      preexisting state of functional tolerance towards tumor antigens. Another is the ability of\n      tumors to avoid or suppress immune responses directed towards them. One immune regulatory\n      pathway, the IDO pathway, has emerged as an important part of the immune evasion by cancers.\n      IDO plays a predominant role in regulation of the acquired local and systemic immune\n      tolerance towards the tumor. Therefore, IDO is an attractive target in therapeutic\n      interventions aimed at restoring the immune response towards the tumor, and drugs that\n      inhibit the enzymatic activity of IDO, like NLG919 are expected to bring a significant\n      benefit to an active immunotherapy regimen.\n\n      This protocol provides a first in human study to evaluate the safety and toxicity of NLG919\n      in advanced solid tumors for which no standard therapy exists."
