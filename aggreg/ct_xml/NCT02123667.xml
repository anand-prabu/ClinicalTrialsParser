      -	Optional bronchoscopy with endobronchial and trans-bronchial biopsy will be applicable in
      selected sites only in EU and US. Total number of inflammatory cells and quantification of
      specific cells including eosinophils, T cells and macrophages will be performed. Gene
      expression profiles (including RNA) will be performed at a later date for future analysis on
      the pathobiology of asthma which will be defined in future specific protocols

        900 subjects divided into 800 asthmatic patients and 100 healthy controls will be
        included. Recruitment will be balanced, at the extent possible, in order to achieve at
        least &gt; 150 patients each for steps 1 - 4 and &gt; 50 patients for step 5 as indicated in the
        international guidelines (GINA 2012) on the basis of their previous therapy. The 150
        healthy controls will be recruited on the basis of absence of respiratory symptoms, airway
        obstruction and hyper responsiveness.

        Asthmatic patient inclusion criteria

          1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years, who have signed an Informed Consent
             form prior to initiation of any study-related procedure.

          2. Clinical diagnosis of asthma for at least 6 months confirmed by a chest physician
             according to international guidelines (GINA 2012) supported by objective evidence of
             any of the following at the baseline visit or in the previous 5 years.

               1. Positive response to methacholine challenge test [PC20 &lt; 8 mg/mL or PD20 &lt; 0.7
                  mg for those subjects not using inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), and PC20 &lt; 16
                  mg/mL or PD20 &lt; 1.4 mg for subjects using ICS] or

               2. Positive response to a reversibility test, defined as ΔFEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL
                  over baseline FEV1, within 30 minutes after administration of 400 μg of
                  salbutamol pMDI administered with or without Spacer or

               3. Peak Flow variability (i.e. highest - lowest PEF over the day/mean value of the
                  two, × 100) &gt; 20%, measured over a follow-up period of 7 days or

               4. Documented response (defined as ΔFEV1 ≥ 12% and ≥ 200 mL) after a cycle (e.g., 4
                  weeks) of regular maintenance anti-asthma treatment.

          3. Patients with stable asthma, on any previous regular asthma treatment (&quot;rescue&quot;
             β2-agonists alone included) at a stable dose, for at least 8 weeks prior to baseline
             visit.

          4. Current smoker, ex-smoker (since the past 12 months) or lifelong non-smoker (total
             lifetime smoking history &lt; 10 packyears defined as [(number of cigarettes smoked per
             day) x(number of years of smoking)] / 20).

        Healthy subject inclusion criteria

          1. Male or female patients aged ≥ 18 and ≤ 65 years, who have signed the Informed
             Consent form prior to initiation of any study-related procedure.

          2. No clinical history of asthma or COPD (no respiratory symptoms compatible to asthma
             or COPD in the past 2 years).

          3. Current smoker, ex-smoker (since the past 12 months) or lifelong non-smoker (total
             lifetime smoking history &lt; 10 packyears).

          4. Normal spirometry: baseline FEV1 ≥ 80% of the predicted normal value, FEV1/FVC &gt; LLN
             (lower limit of normal).

          5. Normal airways responsiveness: PC20 ≥ 16 mg/mL, PD20 ≥ 1.4 mg.

        Asthmatic patient exclusion criteria

          1. Cigarette smoking &gt; 10 packyears defined as [(number of cigarettes smoked per day) x
             (number of years of smoking)] / 20.

          2. diagnosis of COPD confirmed by a chest physician.

          3. Asthma exacerbation in the 8 weeks prior to baseline visit (defined as a significant
             deterioration of asthma and signalled by any or more of the following: need for a
             systemic corticosteroid course (≥ 3 days); hospitalisation for asthma; emergency room
             attendance for asthma).

          4. Clinical or functional uncontrolled respiratory, haematological, immunologic, renal,
             neurologic, hepatic, endocrinal or other disease, or any condition that might, in the
             judgment of the investigator, compromise the results or interpretation of the study.

          5. Pregnant or lactating women (a urine pregnancy test will be performed).

          6. Participation in an interventional clinical trial with intake of the last dose of any
             investigational drug &lt;12 weeks preceding baseline visit (last dose &lt; 5 half-lives
             prior to baseline visit for biologics).

          7. Inability to comply with study procedures.

          8. Alcohol or drug abuse.

        Healthy subject exclusion criteria

          1. Cigarette smoking history &gt; 10 packyears defined as [(number of cigarettes smoked per
             day) x (number of years of smoking)] / 20.

          2. Diagnosed upper and/or lower respiratory disease(s).

          3. Clinical or functional uncontrolled haematological, immunologic, renal, neurologic,
             hepatic, endocrinal or other disease, or any condition that might, in the judgment of
             the investigator, compromise the results or interpretation of the study.

          4. Pregnant or lactating women (a urine pregnancy test will be performed).

          5. Participation in an interventional clinical trial with intake of the last dose of any
             investigational drug &lt;12 weeks preceding baseline visit (last dose &lt; 5 half-lives
             prior to baseline visit for biologics).

          6. Inability to comply with study procedures.

          7. Alcohol or drug abuse.
