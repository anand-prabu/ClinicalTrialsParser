Patients\n      initially enter an up to 4 weeks screening phase to confirm the randomization to whom met\n      DSM-IV criteria of bipolar I or II disorder, currently depressed with Hamilton Depression\n      Rating Scale-17 items (HAM-D) total score \u226517. The protocol was approved by the each sites'\n      appropriate institutional review boards and ethics committees. After screening, patients\n      were randomly allocated to one of three groups: (1) lithium monotherapy; (2) lithium plus\n      quetiapine; (3) lithium plus a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) named as Shuganjieyu\n      capsule (SGJY, St. John's wort and acanthopanax senticosus combination). After phase I,\n      patients who met stable remission, defined as HAM-D total score \u22647 and Young Mania Rating\n      Scale (YMRS) total score \u226410 in two consecutive visit at least 4 weeks, were qualified into\n      phase II and III. Patients remained on the allocated treatment for up to 48 weeks or until\n      treatment failure. The difference between phase II and phase III was that treatment dose\n      could be decreased (within the study ranges) if side-effects became troublesome in phase\n      III, but not for phase II. All patients will be provided with free care (3 visits) by the\n      investigators, for a period of up to 3 months after the end of the study, in order to help\n      them make the transition into routine clinical care."
