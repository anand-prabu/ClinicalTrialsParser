Peripheral stem cell transplantation combined with biological\n      therapy may be an effective treatment for breast cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of interleukin-2 with filgrastim to\n      stimulate cell production in treating patients with stage IIIB, stage IV, metastatic, or\n      recurrent breast cancer who will undergo peripheral stem cell transplantation."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Estimate the maximum tolerated dose of continuous infusion interleukin-2\n      (IL-2) that can be combined with a standard dose of filgrastim (G-CSF) to stimulate\n      peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) for harvest in patients with advanced breast cancer. II.\n      Assess PBSC engraftment following high dose cyclophosphamide, thiotepa, and carboplatin (the\n      STAMP V regimen) supported by G-CSF or IL-2/G-CSF hematopoietic support in patients who\n      underwent the same pretransplant PBSC stimulation. III. Characterize the toxic effects of\n      combined IL-2 and G-CSF. IV. Compare immune function changes following IL-2/G-CSF and G-CSF\n      alone by assessing expression of CD56/CD56-bright, CD3, and CD25; natural killer cell and\n      lymphokine activated killer cell activity; T-cell responses (TT, HER2/neu); and serum levels\n      of interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor, and G-CSF. V. Compare the effects on the expression\n      of circulating hematopoietic progenitor cells (CD34+, CFU-GM, and BFU-GM) of a range of IL-2\n      doses when combined with G-CSF to those achieved with G-CSF alone. VI. Compare the time to\n      neutrophil and platelet recovery, requirements for red blood cell and platelet transfusion,\n      and time to hospital discharge in patients receiving IL-2/G-CSF-primed vs. G-CSF-primed PBSC\n      following STAMP V chemotherapy. VII. Compare the feasibility, toxicity, and hematologic and\n      immunologic effects of post-PBSC infusion of IL-2/G-CSF vs. G-CSF alone. VIII. Assess the\n      response rate, duration of response, and disease free interval of patients with advanced\n      breast cancer treated with STAMP V with PBSC rescue. IX. Assess the presence of cytokeratin\n      as a marker of minimum residual disease when measured in blood and marrow by polymerase\n      chain reaction during and following treatment.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups for peripheral blood stem cell\n      stimulation (priming) and for therapy after stem cell transplantation. All patients receive\n      priming therapy with filgrastim (G-CSF) alone or with interleukin-2 (IL-2), then have stem\n      cells harvested. Patients with adequate harvest receive high dose cyclophosphamide,\n      thiotepa, and carboplatin (STAMP V) followed by stem cell rescue with subsequent G-CSF with\n      or without IL-2, as follows: Arm I receives G-CSF alone for priming and following stem cell\n      transplant. Arm II receives G-CSF priming alone and G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant. Arm III\n      receives various doses of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and G-CSF following transplant. Arm IV receives\n      various levels of G-CSF/IL-2 priming and fixed doses of G-CSF/IL-2 following transplant.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients each are treated on each treatment arm and at escalating doses of\n      IL-2. The maximum tolerated dose is defined as the dose at which less than 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for disease progression and\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 36 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24\n      months; a maximum of 12 patients will receive G-CSF priming alone (6 without and 6 with\n      post-PBSC IL-2)."
