After excluding\n      other causes, participants with persistent elevated serum aminotransferase levels were\n      presumed to have NAFLD. Those with NAFLD liver fat score greater than (-0.64) and positive\n      urea breath test (UBT) were enrolled. They were randomly assigned to lifestyle modification\n      alone or lifestyle modification plus HP eradication groups. Quadruple therapy (omeprazole,\n      amoxicillin, bismuth subcitrate, and clarithromycin) for HP eradication was performed in two\n      weeks. HP eradication was documented by UBT. Fasting serum glucose, alanine\n      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, triglyceride,\n      cholesterol, high and low-density lipoprotein, HOMA-IR, and anthropometric measurements\n      (body mass index and waist circumference) were checked at baseline, eight weeks, and twelve\n      weeks from the beginning of study."
