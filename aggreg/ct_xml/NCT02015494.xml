  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One dose of escalating strengths of an investigational influenza vaccine VAX2012Q
      (Quadrivalent Recombinant Hemagglutinin Seasonal Influenza Vaccine) will be evaluated for
      tolerability and immunogenicity in healthy adults 18-40 years of age.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, open-label, dose escalating study in which up to 320 healthy
      subjects age 18-40 years will be administered VAX2012Q at one of up to 7 dose levels.
      VAX2012Q vaccine will be formulated at the clinical site (&quot;field mix&quot;) from the four
      components (VAX128C, VAX181, VAX173 and VAX172) in diluent to produce ten doses in a
      multi-dose vial for use within 12 hours of preparation.  The dose will be prepared from
      appropriate dilutions from the monovalent drug product vials.  Data for safety and
      immunogenicity will be collected after each dose with safety being assessed after each dose
      level and immune response, after dose levels 4 and 6. Reactogenicity and safety labs through
      Day 1 will be reviewed by the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) prior to enrolling in the
      next dose level.
