This study evaluates the effect of melatonin in\n      improving quality of life and reducing chemotherapy-induced toxicity in advanced cancer\n      patients. This is a multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial\n      conducted in  patients with histologically proven advanced non small cell lung, breast, head\n      and neck or sarcoma cancer. Mixed-block randomization, stratified by center and treatment\n      scheme is used to divide eligible patients into three groups: melatonin 20 mg, 10 mg or\n      matched placebo. The patients are required to take the studied drugs at night (after 21.00\n      pm) on the first day of chemotherapy and continue daily for six months. Standard treatment\n      is chemotherapy according to each center's standard protocol. Study endpoints are QOL\n      (FACT), adverse event frequency (CTCAE), oxidative stress status, melatonin level, and\n      survival."
