      Background:

      - Proteins, fats, and other molecules are the body   s building blocks. Many of these
      molecules must have sugars, or chains of sugars, attached to work properly. People with
      congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) cannot attach these sugars or sugar chains
      properly. A child or adult with a CDG can have symptoms in different parts of the body,
      including brain, nerves, muscles, liver, and immune system. Researchers want to learn more
      about these diseases to understand better what is causing the problems.

      Objective:

      - To learn more about CDGs.

      Eligibility:

      - People age 1   80 with CDG or suspected to have a CDG.

      Design:

        -  CDG participants will stay in the hospital 3   5 days. They will have:

        -  Medical history and physical exam. They will answer questions about their CDG.

        -  Blood taken several times. Their skin will be numbed, then a needle will take blood
           from an arm vein.

        -  Samples taken of their skin, urine, and maybe stool and spinal fluid.

        -  Photos taken of their whole body. They can wear underwear and cover their eyes.

        -  Brain MRI. They will lie on a table that slides in and out of a metal cylinder. The
           scanner makes loud knocking noises so they can wear earplugs.

        -  Abdomen ultrasound. Sound waves take images of the body from the outside.

        -  Hand/wrist X-rays for young patients. They may have a full-body X-ray.

        -  DEXA bone density scan. Participants will lie on a table under a scanner.

        -  Echocardiogram and electrocardiogram for heart activity. Pads are stuck on the skin and
           the electrical activity of the heart is recorded.

        -  Tests of hearing, thinking, motor skills, and speech.

        -  Children participants may have tests done under sedation if it will benefit them
           directly.

        -  CDG participants may have other procedures during their visit. They may have follow-up
           visits every year.

    <textblock>
      Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDGs) are a group of diseases characterized by an

      abnormal glycosylation of proteins, but that can also result from an abnormal synthesis of

      glycosaminoglycans, glycophospholipids or glycosylphosphatidylinositol or the abnormal

      synthesis or utilization of dolichols. CDGs were first described in 1980, but the initial
      description of mutations in a gene underlying CDGs did not occur until 1997. Since then,
      there has been a rapid discovery phase of new CDGs, with more than 80 different types,
      reflecting defined mutations in 80 different genes in glycobiologic pathways affecting about
      1000 patients worldwide. The clinical manifestations of CDGs are quite variable both within
      and among different types, and physicians from every specialty will likely encounter
      patients affected by glycosylation defects. The diagnosis of CDGs should be suspected in
      cases with neurological signs and symptoms of unknown etiology, or in any patient with
      multisystemic disease even in the absence of neurological features. Other potential clinical
      presentations include tissuespecific disorders such as anemia or ichthyosis, when common
      disorders have been ruled out. Diagnostic screening for many of the disorders is performed
      by analyzing the glycosylation on serum transferrin, initially by isoelectric focusing, now
      by mass spectrometry, in specialized clinical diagnostic laboratories both in the United
      States and abroad. The pattern of transferrin glycoforms allows the differentiation between
      defects of N-glycosylation assembly in the ER (type I) and defects of N-glycan trimming and
      elongation, occurring mainly in the Golgi apparatus (type II). Most recently, whole-exome
      sequencing has led to the elucidation of the underlying mutation in patients with unknown
      CDGs. Treatment is available for only three CDG subtypes. In this protocol, we propose to
      clinically evaluate up to a 100 patients of all ethnicities with known or suspected CDGs,
      obtain cells, plasma, and urine for future studies, perform mutation analysis for known
      CDG-causing genes, and search for other genes responsible for CDGs. Routine admissions of
      3-5 days will occur annually or as required by changes in clinical symptomatology.

        -  INCLUSION/EXCLUSION CRITERIA:

        Patients of any gender and ethnicity age 1-80 years with a suspected CDG based on
        biochemical tests or a confirmed CDG based on enzymatic or molecular tests will be
        eligible to enroll in this protocol. Patients will also be excluded if they cannot travel
        to the NIH due to their medical condition. Infants under age one year or under 10 kg of
        body weight are excluded because care is more readily provided to older infants at the
        Clinical Center.
