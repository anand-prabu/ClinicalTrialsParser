    <textblock>
      Study will test the use of narratives on patient satisfaction and translation of an
      evidence-based approach to the use of X-rays for leg injuries in the Emergency Department
      (ED). The investigators will identify patients with foot, ankle, or knee injuries for whom
      X-rays are determined to not be needed. On discharge, patients will receive the current
      fact-based sheet or that plus a narrative explaining the work-up and treatment of these
      injuries. Outcomes will be assessed by a survey measuring patient satisfaction and
      understanding.

    <description>To measure patient satisfaction, we will use a validated survey instrument.  The survey asks patients 5 questions, which they answer by providing responses on a 5-point scale ranging from &quot;Poor&quot; to &quot;Excellent.&quot;  The questions include:
My satisfaction with the amount of time spent with me by the person who evaluated and treated me was....
The explanation I received of how my illness should be treated was...
The way the health care provider treated me was...
My overall satisfaction with my visit was...
Your care provider determined that you did not need an X-ray for your injury. What is your level of satisfaction with that decision?</description>
