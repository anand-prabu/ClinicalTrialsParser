            "textblock": "Chronic renal disease is a \"silent epidemic\" affecting up to 10% of the population in the\n      EU, USA, and Asian with some of the sufferers progressing into end-stage renal failure.\n\n      Renal disease patients are characterized by progressively worsening muscle weakness and\n      muscle atrophy due to both a metabolic and a disuse component collectively described as\n      uremic myopathy. While various interventions in stable HD patients have helped these\n      patients improve their functionality, they still have not proven enough to bring their\n      muscle quality and quantity up to the levels of a healthy sedentary person. Moreover,\n      patients present with sleep problems, neurological and quality of life issues, anxiety\n      and/or symptoms of depression but most notably they complain of chronic fatigue and \"lack of\n      energy\".\n\n      Other factors that contribute to the excessive fatigue are a lack of restorative sleep,\n      excess pre-dialysis weight, poor nutritional status, restless legs syndrome and the overall\n      mental status of the patients. Evidently, of all of these factors can contribute to a\n      self-exacerbating process, a vicious circle, of fatigue due to inactivity and further\n      inactivity due to fatigue. This sensation of an enduring fatigue interferes with physical\n      and social activities and feeds perceptions of increased restrictions and barriers, and\n      leads to a significant reduction of physical activity and functional capacity, which in turn\n      contributes to the increased cardiovascular risk and a high mortality rate among these\n      patients.\n\n      Rationale: The investigators hypothesize  that by improving the quality of sleep will\n      increase patients' rest levels resulting in more energy during day and therefore more\n      physical activity, total body and mind recovery and therefore better capacity for exercise,\n      and more secretion of growth hormone and therefore increased anabolism. Our mission is to\n      help the HD patient to better cope with their sensation of fatigue."
