            "textblock": "Purpose: To assess the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the\n      utility of a home -based Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii) program in rehabilitation of\n      individuals with a unilateral transtibial or transfemoral amputation. This study will\n      provide seed data and information (e.g. sample size calculation) to leverage funds for a\n      future RCT.\n\n      Hypothesis: Our guiding primary hypothesis is that the Wii will result in improved\n      functional walking capacity of older adults with a mature (\u22651 year post) unilateral\n      transtibial or transfemoral amputation. Secondary hypotheses are that the Wii will lead to\n      improvement in lower extremity strength and balance, inter-limb gait symmetry, balance\n      confidence, participation in daily and social activities, locomotor capabilities, and\n      increase in physical activities.\n\n      Justification: It is estimated that approximately 1 million individuals were living with a\n      lower extremity amputation in the United States in the year 2005. This number is projected\n      to more than double by the year 2050. This imposes a serious public health issue and\n      increases the demand for more rehabilitation resources to become available to this\n      population.\n\n      Following a unilateral lower limb amputation the position of the centre of mass over the\n      base of support is altered, resulting in weight distribution asymmetry over the amputated\n      and contralateral legs. Miller et al. have reported that about 52.4% of persons with a lower\n      extremity amputation have fallen at least once in the past year due to poor balance.\n      Therefore, a well-planned rehabilitation program is crucial for improving and retaining the\n      balance and walking patterns of lower limb amputees. An optimal rehabilitation program has\n      to be challenging, repetitive, task-specific, intensive, and motivating. Given the pressure\n      to discharge patients earlier in order to reduce rehabilitation costs, standard\n      rehabilitation programs often fail to provide all these important elements. Virtual reality\n      (VR) rehabilitation has been introduced as a solution to this problem. VR is a\n      computer-human interface that creates an interactive, immersive virtual environment where\n      the user engages in real-time. VR technologies have the potential to provide an optimal\n      rehabilitation program in terms of repetition, task-specificity, motivation, and challenge.\n\n      Recently there has been a growing interest in integrating VR into rehabilitation. Due to the\n      cost and lack of commercial availability of most of these VR systems, the notion of using\n      off-the-shelf commercial VR technologies, such as gaming systems has been introduced. The\n      Nintendo Wii Fit Plus (Wii) is a low-cost VR gaming system which is widely available to the\n      general population. The Wii balance board has force sensors that measure the user's center\n      of balance and weight distribution. Users stand on the balance board and interact with the\n      games through weight shifting. Due to the weight-shifting, balance and aerobic training\n      nature of the Wii games, the Wii may serve as a suitable therapeutic agent for\n      rehabilitation in individuals with lower extremity amputation.\n\n      Although the number of studies using the Wii as a therapeutic agent is growing, there is\n      still a dearth of research in the field of amputation rehabilitation. Promising results are\n      reported regarding safety, feasibility, and efficacy of the Wii in rehabilitation of\n      individuals who had stroke, acquired brain injury (ABI), cerebral palsy, developmental\n      disabilities, and cystic fibrosis.\n\n      Previously we conducted 6 case studies in order to develop a Wii oriented intervention\n      protocol for individuals with lower extremity amputation. We believe that our intervention\n      will provide an excellent augmentative program to standard amputee rehabilitation; however\n      the only way to definitively determine the efficacy is to conduct a robust RCT. These study\n      designs are, however, expensive and require feasibility data in order to attract appropriate\n      funding. We propose to conduct a pilot RCT in order to assess the feasibility of our\n      intervention with the intention of submitting to the Canadian Institutes of Health Research\n      for a larger definitive RCT.\n\n      Objectives: The objectives of this study are to: 1) pilot the methodologies and\n      randomization procedures, 2) obtain preliminary effect size data to inform power analysis\n      and sample size calculation for a future RCT, 3) estimate the recruitment, refusal,\n      compliance, and attrition rates, and 4) determine safety and adverse event information\n      related to the intervention.\n\n      Research Method: This pilot study is a parallel, single-blind RCT. Twenty individuals with a\n      unilateral transtibial or transfemoral will be randomly assigned to either the Wii, or the\n      Lumosity arm (10 in each arm) using computer-generated block randomization. The\n      randomization will be done by a statistician who will not be involved in any part the study.\n\n      Subjects (n=10) in the experimental arm will be trained using the Wii for 40-minute\n      sessions, 3 times a week for a period of 4 weeks. Subjects will stand on the Wii balance\n      board and interact with the Wii games through weight shifting. The intervention protocol\n      includes: 1) Yoga (static single and double leg exercises), 2) Balance games (lateral and\n      poster/anterior weight shifting exercises in standing), 3) Aerobics (running on spot and\n      step class), and 4) Strength training (dynamic single and double leg exercises). Each\n      component will be practiced for 10 minutes in each session. For onsite training sessions, a\n      trained research assistant will administer the intervention and will provide external cueing\n      and correction of the pose if the participants use unsafe technique.\n\n      Subjects (n=10) in the control arm will play cognitive computer games using Lumosity Brain\n      Training program for the same frequency and duration as the experimental arm. For onsite\n      training sessions a separate research assistant will administer the intervention and will\n      provide supervision. Lumosity is an online program which has games and exercises to improve\n      cognitive function (www.lumosity.com).\n\n      The interventions will be administered in combination of onsite group training and\n      home-based individualized training."

The next 5 items ask individuals to estimate their participation in other activities such as travelling, or gardening during the past six months. Response options range from 0 (never) to 3 (at least once a week). A summary score is derived by adding up the response of all items.
