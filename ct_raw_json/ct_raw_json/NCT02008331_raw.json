Epidemiological evidence has\n      strongly linked one of these compounds, p-Cresol, to cardiovascular risk and mortality in\n      CKD. In the present paper the investigators investigated the effect of a probiotic/prebiotic\n      mixture on plasma p-cresol concentrations and GI symptoms and in CKD patients not on\n      dialysis yet."
