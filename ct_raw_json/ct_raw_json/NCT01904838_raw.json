The initial phase of the study involves developing and\n      refining an item bank. During the initial 'item bank development' phase, the investigators\n      will run focus groups and cognitive interviews with individuals who participate in CAM and\n      conventional medicine interventions.  The next step of instrument development is called\n      Calibration, and involves administering the revised item bank to an internet sample and to\n      persons who receive services in a CAM clinic and a conventional primary care setting. The\n      items will be calibrated using item response theory and classical test theory. This will\n      result in a computerized adaptive testing version of the instrument, as well as a static\n      short form of the instrument. This current protocol in ClinicalTrials.gov pertains only to\n      the Calibration Phase of the study. The final phase of the project will involve conducting\n      initial validation studies of the set of instruments. The set of instruments will be called\n      the Healing Encounters and Attitudes Lists (HEAL). The investigators will evaluate the\n      convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the HEAL instruments in a sample of 200\n      persons with chronic low back pain who are receiving physical therapy, chiropractic care, or\n      mindfulness-based stress reduction. For convergent validity, the HEAL is expected to display\n      moderate to large correlations with measures of similar constructs. The HEAL is expected to\n      correlate modestly with self-report measures of general psychosocial functioning, in support\n      of discriminant validity. Finally, HEAL scores should account for a significant proportion\n      of the variance in treatment outcome, supporting predictive validity."

            "textblock": "This project will develop and test a set of patient self-report measurement tools to assess\n      the perceived contextual factors, such as patient attitudes and expectations, patient\n      provider relationship factors, and environmental factors that contribute to healing. Our\n      project is synergistic with the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Roadmap initiative,\n      Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS), and will use the rigorous\n      instrument development and validation methodology of PROMIS. The overall objective of this\n      study is to develop efficient self-report instruments to measure CAM-relevant contextual\n      factors important in healing, hereafter referred to as the Healing Encounters and Attitudes\n      Lists (HEAL), and conduct initial validation in persons seeking CAM and conventional\n      treatment for pain. Specific Aim 1: Develop an item bank. We will employ several iterative\n      steps used successfully in PROMIS to identify items that assess contextual factors of\n      healing relevant to CAM. Initial steps in developing an item bank include: a) compilation\n      and evaluation of existing instruments and relevant questions, b) consultation with experts,\n      and c) focus groups with individuals who participate in CAM and conventional medicine\n      interventions, and d) item editing. During the initial year of this study, we expect to\n      identify conceptual areas of potential importance to CAM interventions and patients, and\n      identify and edit items to create an item bank assessing these conceptual areas. Specific\n      Aim 2: Calibrate items. We will use item response theory (IRT) and classical test theory\n      (CTT) to calibrate the items from Aim 1 on three samples: 1) an internet-based sample (n=\n      1400), 2) 125 outpatients participating in CAM interventions at our Center for Integrative\n      Medicine (CIM), and 3) 125 outpatients at a General Internal Medicine clinic. During year\n      2-3 we administer the items in the item bank to the 1650 persons, conduct IRT and CTT\n      analyses and refine the item bank to only those items that best assess the constructs.\n      Specific aim 2 will result in a Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT) version of the HEAL,\n      which maximizes information while minimizing patient time burden. A static short form of the\n      HEAL will be derived from the HEAL CAT in Aim 2. Specific Aim 3: Conduct initial validation\n      studies. We will evaluate convergent, discriminant, and predictive validity of the Healing\n      Encounters and Attitudes List (HEAL) in a sample of chronic low back pain (CLBP) patients\n      receiving CAM and conventional medicine treatments. The validity studies will use two\n      samples of adults with CLBP: 100 persons receiving CAM treatments: chiropractic manipulation\n      (CM) or mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR) at the CIM, and 100 persons receiving\n      conventional care (physical therapy) at Centers for Rehab Services referred by the General\n      Internal Medicine Clinic (GIMC) of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). We\n      will administer the CAT version of the HEAL questionnaire developed in aims 1 and 2 as well\n      as conventional measures of treatment expectancy, confidence in treatment provider,\n      psychosocial functioning, and treatment outcome measures for CLBP of pain and disability. \u2022\n      Hypothesis 3a: Scores on the HEAL measure will display moderate to large correlations (r's >\n      .50) with similar self-report measures, supporting convergent validity. \u2022 Hypothesis 3b:\n      Scores on the HEAL measure will correlate modestly (r's = .20-.35) with self-report measures\n      of general psychosocial functioning, supporting discriminant validity. \u2022 Hypothesis 3c: HEAL\n      scores will account for a significant proportion of variance in treatment outcome in both\n      samples. In addition, we predict that HEAL scores will demonstrate incremental validity,\n      i.e., they will account for significant incremental variance in outcome beyond that\n      accounted for by existing measures of treatment expectancy and related constructs."
