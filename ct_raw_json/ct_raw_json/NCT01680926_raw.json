However, in many cases, even a high insulin dosage (> 100 U per day) does not\n      achieve satisfying metabolic control. A new therapy option is necessary that makes it\n      possible to lower the daily insulin requirement and to improve metabolic control. The aim of\n      this study was to investigate whether a protein-rich meal replacement is suitable to lower\n      the daily insulin requirement and to reduce HbA1c and body weight."
