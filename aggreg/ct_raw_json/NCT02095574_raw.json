Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of non-hodgkin's lymphoma as\n             defined by a B-cell neo-plasm in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification\n             scheme except as noted in exclusion criteria.\n\n          3. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0-2.\n\n          4. Subject has adequate bone marrow (independent of growth factor support per local\n             laboratory reference range).\n\n          5. Subject has adequate coagulation, renal and hepatic function.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Subject has been diagnosed with Post-Transplant Lymphoproliferative Disease (PTLD),\n             Burkitt's lymphoma, Burkitt-like lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma/leukemia, chronic\n             lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), mantle cell leukemia (MCL), or small lymphocytic lymphoma\n             (SLL).\n\n          2. Subject has undergone an allogeneic stem cell transplant.\n\n          3. Subject is receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy for human immunodeficiency\n             virus (HIV) (due to potential drug-drug interactions, as well as the potential for\n             increased risk of opportunistic infections).\n\n          4. Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic,\n             metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease within 6 months that in\n             the opinion of the Investigator would adversely affect his/her participation in this\n             study.\n\n          5. Subject has active peptic ulcer disease or other hemorrhagic esophagitis/gastritis."
