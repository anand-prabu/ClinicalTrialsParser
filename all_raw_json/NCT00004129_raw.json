Courses repeat\n      every 4-6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3 patients receive escalating doses of C P32 until the maximum tolerated dose\n      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined the dose at which 2 of 3 patients experience\n      dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 15, and 24 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12 patients will be accrued for this study."
