Combining combination\n      chemotherapy with hormone therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy\n      with or without tamoxifen in treating women with stage I or stage II breast cancer that can\n      be surgically removed."

Assess the disease-free and overall survival produced by adjuvant tamoxifen\n      given after postoperative chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide/methotrexate/fluorouracil (CMF)\n      vs. adjuvant CMF alone in women with primary breast cancer.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized study. Patients are stratified by age and by participating\n      institution. All patients undergo surgical resection with local radiation therapy, as\n      appropriate. Within 4 weeks of surgery, patients receive cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, and\n      fluorouracil (CMF) every 3 weeks for 6 courses. Radiotherapy is given within 4 weeks of\n      completion of CMF. Before beginning the last course of CMF, patients are randomized to\n      receive either oral tamoxifen daily for 5 years or no further therapy. Patients are followed\n      every 6 months for 5 years, then yearly. Hormone therapy is prohibited except as specified\n      above and except for short-term hormone replacement therapy for severe unresponsive\n      menopausal symptoms.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 2,000 patients will be required. Data on patients entered\n      in Scotland as part of this study will be pooled with data from the EORTC-10901 study."
