Hospitalization for any reason within 60 days prior to the screening visit\n\n          5. Participation in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug\n             or therapy within 30 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer) of the\n             investigational drug prior to the screening visit\n\n          6.
