  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aims were to determine if exhaled breath condensate (EBC) could detect differences in
      ion regulation between cystic fibrosis (CF) and healthy and measure the effect of the
      albuterol on EBC ions in these populations. We hypothesized EBC chloride and sodium would be
      lower in CF patients at baseline and that albuterol would decrease EBC sodium and increase
      EBC chloride.

    <description>We collected exhaled breath condensate (EBC) samples, with subjects breathing on a Jaeger EcoScreen for 20 minutes.   EBC samples were collected in cystic fibrosis and healthy subjects before and 30-, 60-, and 90-minutes following albuterol administration.</description>

    <description>Using the rebreathe technique the diffusion capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide and nitric oxide were measured, and this allowed for the determination of alveolar-capillary membrane conductance and pulmonary capillary blood volume.  These measurements were made at baseline and 30-, 60- and 90-minutes post albuterol administration in cystic fibrosis and healthy subjects.</description>
