Determine the efficacy of autologous tumor cell-derived heat shock protein\n      peptide vaccine in terms of the rate of complete and partial response and time to\n      progression in patients with recurrent soft tissue sarcoma. II. Determine the safety and\n      tolerability of this treatment regimen in this patient population. III. Determine the\n      anti-tumor response to this treatment regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: At approximately 5 weeks after surgery, patients receive autologous tumor\n      cell-derived heat shock protein peptide vaccine intradermally weekly for 4 weeks. Patients\n      receive subsequent vaccinations once every 2 weeks for at least 12 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with improving or stable disease or\n      without recurrence continue on therapy for up to 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 35 patients will be accrued for this study."
