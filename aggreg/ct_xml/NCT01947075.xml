  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Following the decline of malaria in Sub-Saharan Africa, clinicians face febrile patients in
      whom an alternative diagnosis has to be made. This situation has led to an overuse of
      antibiotics by clinicians.  It is crucial to increase knowledge on etiologies and risk
      factors of outpatient febrile illness in order to improve their management.

      This present proposal aims to investigate the etiologies of fever among adult patients
      attending an outpatient department in urban Tanzania. It also aims to assess the clinical
      significance of nasopharyngeal (NP) respiratory viruses and bacteria documentation in this
      setting. Third, it aims to compare the spectrum of infections in this population with that
      of children included in the same setting in a previous study. The last objective is to
      assess diabetes mellitus (DM) as a risk factor for infection and exposure to indoor air
      pollution (IAP) as a risk factor for acute respiratory infections (ARI) in adults in
      Tanzania.

      The investigators hypothesize that acute respiratory infections are the main cause of adult
      febrile illness in a urban low-income setting and that use of quantitative molecular assays
      on naso-oropharyngeal samples can improve the diagnosis of pneumonia. The investigators also
      think that the spectrum of infections is different between children and adults, mainly due
      to a high HIV prevalence in adults. The investigators also hypothesize that experiencing IAP
      and/ or DM is a risk factor for infections in adults.

        Every consecutive adult with temperature ≥38°C attending the outpatient department of
        Mwananyamala Hospital will be screened for inclusion. Additional inclusion criteria are
        fever of ≤1 week duration and first consultation for the present problem. Exclusion
        criteria are refusal of HIV screening,  main complaint is injury or trauma, antibiotic
        treatment during the previous week (apart from cotrimoxazole prophylaxis), delivery within
        the previous 6 weeks and hospitalization during the last month.  Medical history will be
        taken (including exposure to IAP) and clinical examination will be done in a standardized
        way.
