Due to\n      the use of ultrasonic energy, it produced more post-operative inflammation than other\n      methods. Many routes of steroid had been used to control post-operative inflammation. The\n      investigators here compare the efficacy of single depot steroid subtenon injection (20-mg\n      triamcinolone) with four-time-a-day steroid eye drop (0.1% dexamethasone) in controlling\n      inflammation after uneventful phacoemulsification."

            "textblock": "Cataract is one of the most common causes of blindness in the world. Surgical removal of\n      lens is the only treatment for cataract, which now shifts from extracapsular cataract\n      extraction to phacoemulsification. Although phacoemulsification provides faster operating\n      time and gives better optical result and rapid recovery to the patient, it causes more\n      inflammation post-operatively compare with extracapsular cataract extraction.\n      Corticosteroids eye drops are mainly use to control intraocular inflammation after the\n      surgery.\n\n      Other routes of corticosteroids have been introduced to increase the intraocular level and\n      to increase the patient's compliance. Subtenon triamcinolone injection is easy and safe.\n      Antiinflammatory effect of single subtenon triamcinolone injection lasts about 4-6 weeks.\n      This method has been used in combination with corticosteroid eye drop to control the\n      inflammation after cataract surgery in uveitic patients. It shows potency in controlling of\n      intraocular inflammation with lower rate of increasing the intraocular pressure. The\n      investigators here quantitatively compare the efficacy of subtenon 20-mg triamcinolone\n      injection with 0.1% dexamethasone eye drop in controlling intraocular inflammation after\n      uneventful phacoemulsification."
