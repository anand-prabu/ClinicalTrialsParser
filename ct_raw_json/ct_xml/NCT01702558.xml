  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter study will assess the maximum tolerated dose of capecitabine in combination
      with Kadcyla (trastuzumab emtansine) in patients with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer
      or locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer using a Phase I design, followed by a
      randomized, open-label Phase II study to explore the efficacy and safety of the combination
      of Kadcyla and capecitabine compared with Kadcyla in metastatic breast cancer patients. The
      anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or
      withdrawal of consent.
