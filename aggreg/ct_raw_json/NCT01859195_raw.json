The investigators will ask women to help design the best strategy for\n      applying a vaginal product using a specific kind of applicator. The investigators want to\n      identify designs that women think would be easy to prepare and insert. Women's thoughts and\n      opinions will help researchers develop new products called microbicides that may protect\n      against HIV and other sexually transmitted diseases, that are easy to use, and that will be\n      acceptable to women who use them. If researchers can make products that are easy to use and\n      that women like to use, the products will be used more often, and more infections will be\n      prevented.\n\n      Women who enroll in the project will either participate in a focus group with approximately\n      3-7 other women or a one-on-one cognitive interview. All participants will complete a brief\n      questionnaire. Some women may enroll in both stages.\n\n      Each focus group will take approximately 1.5-2.5 hours. Group leaders will talk to women\n      about their experiences using vaginal products and will provide participants with study\n      products to look at and touch. All participants will be asked to come up with ideas of how\n      to make the products easy to use and acceptable to women who use them. Group leaders will\n      encourage discussion about the different designs. After this, group leaders will talk about\n      a specific type of microbicide and ask women about their opinions. In particular,\n      researchers and participants will talk about the language that would be best understood by\n      women who would use these products or be in studies to evaluate them.\n\n      Each cognitive interview will take approximately 1.5-2.5 hours.                Each\n      participant will be asked about different product designs and application instructions, and\n      will be asked her thoughts, opinions, and potential concerns about each. She will also\n      evaluate sample language that will be used to help women understand the products and how to\n      use them."
