Patients will receive an infusion (given by vein) of\n      autologous tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs).  TILs are a type of white blood cells that\n      recognizes tumor cells and enter them which causes the tumor cells to break down.\n\n      Prior to the cell infusion, patients will receive a two drugs cyclophosphamide and\n      fludarabine to prepare the body to receive the TILs. After cell infusion, patients will\n      receive low-dose interleukin-2 therapy which is an approved drug to treat melanoma.  This\n      study will see how useful this regimen is in treating metastatic melanoma."
