  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this descriptive study is to provide information on the feasibility of using
      the cranial cup, a new positioning device, in a small sample of prematurely born infants
      with elongated head shapes as a result of laying on their abdomens, during the convalescent
      phase of their hospitalizations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cranial cup is a non-invasive, non-restrictive, adjustable orthotic device that grows
      with the infant and maintains proper body alignment while promoting normal head shape
      development. While the cranial cup is not yet FDA approved, it is considered a
      non-significant medical device and it has successfully corrected asymmetric positional head
      shape deformities in hundreds of healthy newborns less than 4 months of age cared for by the
      Children's Hospital Boston outpatient plagiocephaly clinic.  Additionally preliminary
      analysis of a prospective randomized controlled trial currently underway suggests that the
      cranial cup may be useful in prevention of positional head shape deformity in a cohort of
      hospitalized infants of varying gestational ages. However, the cranial cup has never been
      used for correction of the most common form of positional head shape deformity in
      hospitalized premature infants; namely dolichocephaly.  Thus, the purpose of this
      descriptive study is to provide information on the feasibility of using the cranial cup in a
      small sample of prematurely born infants with dolichocephaly during the convalescent phase
      of their hospitalizations.  Information obtained from this descriptive study will be used to
      determine if a larger investigation using the cranial cup is warranted in this specific
      patient population.

    <description>Nurses will complete daily logs indicating the number of desaturation events and emesis events during cranial cup device use.  The cup's designated use is for at least 12 hours per day.  Study duration is at least 14 days and can continue until the infant is discharged. Comparisons will be made for the number of desaturation events and emesis during data analysis.</description>

    <description>To describe infant head shape, the study will use cranial measurements and laser head scans in a sample of prematurely born NICU or SCN patients with dolichocephaly. Measurements and scans will be taken directly following study enrollment and discharge to document head shape pre and post intervention. The discharge measure will be obtained at approximately 2 weeks-4 months of age at hospital discharge.</description>
