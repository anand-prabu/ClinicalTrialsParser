            "description": "Carotid revascularization can significantly reduce the risk of stroke in patients with severe carotid stenosis; however, it has been associated with cognitive decline in 25% of the older adults who undergo the procedure. Neuroimaging techniques that characterize white matter integrity and regional hypoperfusion have the potential to provide sensitive brain structure indicators that may be associated with memory decline following revascularization procedures. In this proposal, we hope to determine the risk factors and cognitive effect of microembolization following carotid revascularization procedures."

            "textblock": "Microembolization is commonly associated with carotid artery stenting (CAS), but our\n      understanding of subclinical microembolization is superficial. Through collaborative effects\n      of multidisciplinary team-experts, novel approaches, and longitudinal evaluations, we hope\n      to better understand the clinical significance and long-term cognitive effects of\n      microemboli. This proposal may change our current clinical practice by providing a better\n      outcome measure for carotid interventions and improving outcomes of CAS procedures through\n      risk factor stratification. Our central hypothesis is that development of subclinical\n      microemboli is associated with decline in cognitive function following CAS and that the risk\n      of development of microemboli themselves is associated with patient- and procedure-related\n      factors.  We hope that this prospective study will help to clarify these important issues in\n      the era of rapidly evolving percutaneous interventions."
