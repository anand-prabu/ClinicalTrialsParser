Boanmycin with special pharmacological basis, as well as the high\n      purity, may not obvious increase in adverse reactions, and probably improve the effect of\n      chemotherapy. At the same time, because of its low lung toxicity, especially in the combined\n      use of corticosteroids, and in the background of the poor survival of advanced squamous cell\n      lung cancer patients, the chemotherapy regimen of boanmycin plus docetaxel needs to be\n      investigated.\n\n      This predictive, randomized, double-blind, multi-center trial is going to evaluate the\n      efficacy and safety of two regimens of boanmycin plus docetaxel versus docetaxel alone as a\n      second line treatment for chemotherapy for stage IIIb-IV or postoperative recurrent squamous\n      cell lung cancer patients.\n\n      According to the test center, gender, disease staging (stage IIIB, IV/recurrence) and\n      pathologic types, patients with squamous cell lung cancer were stratified and then randomly\n      assigned to one of two groups. In the first group, 75 mg of docetaxel per square meter of\n      body-surface area, administered on day 1, followed by 5~6 mg boanmycin of per square meter\n      and 5mg dexamethasone on days 3,5,10 and 12, the cycle was repeated every 21days. The second\n      group received the reference treatment: docetaxel at a dose of 75 mg per square meter was\n      administered on on day 1 of a three-week cycle. The efficacy was evaluated using RESIST\n      standard after every 2 cycles of the treatment, the regimen will continue until the disease\n      progression or the appearance of not tolerable toxicity."
