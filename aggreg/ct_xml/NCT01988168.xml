  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the CSCAR pilot study is to improve the design of a full-scale trial by
      determining the patient recruitment rate and participation rate. The objective of the
      full-scale trial is to determine the optimal method of skin closure after Caesarean delivery
      in women with chorioamnionitis, which is an acute inflammation of the membranes and chorion
      of the placenta, seen typically after rupture of membranes with ascending polymicrobial
      bacterial infection. Women in labour with chorioamnionitis will be randomized at the time of
      Caesarean delivery to skin closure with either staples or sutures. The women will be
      followed at 6 weeks and 6 months post-partum in order to establish the occurrence of
      surgical site infection and wound disruption, as well as evaluation of the scar and other
      secondary questions.

      The investigators hypothesis is that closure of skin with sutures will have a rate of wound
      infection that is no higher than the rate of wound infection when closing skin with staples.
      The investigators also hypothesize that closure with sutures will have a decreased rate of
      wound disruption, increased patient satisfaction and decreased length of hospital stay
      compared to skin closure with staples.
