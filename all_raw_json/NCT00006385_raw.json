It is not yet known if\n      vaccine therapy if more effective with or without biological therapy for melanoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase II trial to compare the effectiveness of vaccine therapy with or\n      without biological therapy in treating patients who have metastatic melanoma."

Each peptide is\n           separately emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 and administered subcutaneously (SC) (for a\n           total of 2 injections per peptide) on days 1 and 15.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I and sargramostim (GM-CSF)\n           subcutaneously (SC) daily on days 1-14.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I and interferon alfa-2b SC three times\n           a week.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive MEP vaccine as in arm I, GM-CSF as in arm II, and interferon\n           alfa-2b as in arm III.\n\n      Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a maximum of 13 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, and then\n      annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 92 patients (23 per arm) will be accrued for this study within\n      13-16 months."
