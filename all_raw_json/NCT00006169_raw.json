The second treatment gives children with CF and\n      their families similar nutritional information plus behavioral parenting methods for\n      motivating  children to eat the recommended foods.  Children with CF and their families are\n      seen weekly for 7 treatment sessions across 9 weeks for the active phase of treatment.\n      Families are then followed for 2 years after treatment in order to better understand how\n      long the treatments are effective and to determine the health benefits of better nutrition\n      status and weight gain."
