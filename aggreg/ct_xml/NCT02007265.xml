  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether simple, evidence-based clinical screening
      for the three most common and important post-stroke comorbidities (depression, obstructive
      sleep apnea and cognitive disorders) can add to clinical and demographic data to predict the
      occurrence of a composite negative outcome (any of: recurrent stroke, myocardial infarction,
      death, or admission to a long-term care (LTC) / complex continuing care (CCC) facility)
      within one year of screening, in large-volume stroke prevention clinics.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The DOC screen will be routinely applied to all patients presenting to three high volume
      Regional Stroke Prevention Clinics (combined first visits &gt;2,800 patients per year). Data
      will be abstracted from the patient chart using methodologies developed and validated in the
      Registry of the Ontario Stroke Network. We have research ethics board approval to collect
      this data and to link with administrative data-sets through the Institute for Clinical and
      Evaluative Sciences (ICES). We will use regression models to determine whether DOC screen
      scores add to baseline clinical and demographic data to predict the main negative outcomes.
      We hope to identify which patients presenting to TIA/stroke prevention clinics are at
      highest risk of adverse long-term events so focused interventions can be developed to
      improve survival, outcomes and function of stroke prevention clinic patients.
