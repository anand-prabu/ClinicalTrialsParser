This randomized controlled trial is to study the elderly\n      participants who suffer major depressive disorder according to DSM-IV. The subjects will be\n      divided into two groups. The experimental group will receive 12 sessions of CBT 2 times per\n      week for 6 weeks in addition to usual treatment. The control group will receive treatment as\n      usual and general conversation (non-CBT) with monks. Pretreatment factors (such as\n      attachment style, interpersonal factors) of both therapist monks and patient participants\n      will be studied."
