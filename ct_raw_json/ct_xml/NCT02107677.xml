    <textblock>
      This study assesses the specificity of DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA versus standard reference
      tests (e.g. PCR or viral culture) for dengue diagnosis in the US.

      DENV Detect™ NS1 ELISA serves as an aid in the clinical laboratory diagnosis of early stages
      of Dengue infection in patients with clinical symptoms consistent with Dengue infection.
      This test is intended to be used on sera obtained within the first 7 days of symptoms. DENV
      Detect™ NS1 ELISA and rapid test results (positive or negative) must be confirmed by testing
      with a reference standard test.

      This study will use archived, leftover human serum samples that have been sequentially
      collected from areas non-endemic for Dengue infection. Each specimen must have been
      collected within the first 7 days of symptoms, and must be accompanied by clinical data
      demonstrating that the individual had symptoms consistent with Dengue infection. The samples
      will have no personally identifiable information.

      ELISAs and reference tests will be performed by different operators who are laboratory staff
      members. These staff members, blinded to each other's results, will evaluate the samples
      from each method independently.

        Human males and females of varying ages and geographical locations where dengue fever is
        non-endemic. We will use retrospective (archived) human serum samples, not collected
        specifically for this study and not individually identifiable to the Investigators. These
        samples will fall under the category of &quot;leftover&quot; specimens as described by FDA guidance.
        These archived samples will have been collected from patients within 7 days after onset of
        symptoms consistent with Dengue infection.
