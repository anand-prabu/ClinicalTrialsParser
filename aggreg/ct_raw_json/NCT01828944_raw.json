Among the nutrients that may be of interest for bone and muscle tissues,\n      unsaturated fatty acids and vitamins are the most described.\n\n      Consequently, based on the promising available preliminary data, the present project aims to\n      investigate the possible preventive effect of olive oil polyphenols and eventually the\n      synergistic effects of fatty acids and vitamin D on bone, muscle and adipose tissue, in\n      order to prevent any locomotor dysfunction.\n\n      Volunteers will be supplemented during 9 months. The primary and secondary outcome measures\n      will be performed at baseline, 3 and 9 months."
