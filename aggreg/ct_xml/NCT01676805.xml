      Background:

      - Lab studies help researchers better understand cancer biology. This information may lead
      to new methods for diagnosing or treating cancer. To develop these studies, researchers want
      to collect samples from people with cancer or precancer conditions of the lymph system.
      These conditions include multiple myeloma, different types of lymphoma, and adult
      leukemia/lymphoma. The samples collected will include blood, urine, bone marrow, and tumor
      and skin tissue.

      Objectives:

      - To collect tissue samples to study different types of lymph cancer.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have a lymphoid cancer or precancer condition.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history.

        -  Different samples will be collected for study. Blood samples will be collected at the
           initial testing. More blood samples will be collected at different treatment points.
           Other liquid samples include urine, bone marrow, and any abnormal fluid. Tumor tissue
           and skin tissue biopsies will also be collected for study.

        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this study.

      Background:

      An estimated 79,190 people living in the United States will be diagnosed with lymphoma in
      2012, including 9,060 cases of HL, 70,130 cases of non-Hodgkin   s lymphoma (NHL) and
      multiple cases of adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Laboratory investigations conducted in the
      Metabolism Branch, including analysis of cellular, molecular, genetic and genomic biology
      are attempting to develop new prognostic and diagnostic models, therapeutic agents and novel
      treatment approaches for lymphoid malignancies and premalignant conditions.

      Objectives:

      This biology protocol is designed to allow sample acquisition for use in the study of
      lymphoid malignancies and malignancy precursors, including but not limited to B and T cell
      malignancies, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin   s lymphoma (HL),
      multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma
      (ATL). A variety of laboratory investigations will be conducted on blood, tumor, bone
      marrow, urine, abnormal fluid and normal tissue, including analysis of cellular, molecular,
      genetic and genomic biology in the support of NIH translational trials to develop new
      therapeutic agents and novel treatment approaches as well as new prognostic and diagnostic
      models.

      Eligibility:

      Adult patients with confirmed pathological diagnosis of lymphoid malignancy or lymphoid
      precursor, including B-cell and T-cell lymphomas: including but not limited to diffuse large
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin   s lymphoma (HL), multiple myeloma (MM), lymphomatoid
      granulomatosis (LYG) and adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL).

      Design:

      The purpose of this study is to examine, in an exploratory fashion, a variety of biologic
      assays relevant to the investigation of lymphoid malignancies.

      It is anticipated that up to 60 consented subjects, 50 at the NCI site, 10 at the UWI site,
      will be studied each year. Thus, an accrual ceiling of 600 consented subjects is planned
      over 10 years.

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:

          -  Patients with known lymphoid malignancy or precursor disease to a lymphoid
             malignancy, including multiple myeloma, B-cell and T-cell lymphomas: including but
             not limited to diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), Hodgkin   s lymphoma (HL),
