Kallicrein profile is unkonwn in COPD. The investigators will assess\n      Kallikrein 1 to 15 and CCN 1 to 6 in sputum of patients. Three groups of patients will be\n      included: Healthy smoker subjects, stable COPD patients and COPD patients with acute\n      exacerbation. Kallicrein levels in sputum will be compared in these groups."
