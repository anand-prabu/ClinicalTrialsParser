Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. Evaluate\n      toxicity. III. Correlate serum prolactin levels during therapy with response. IV. Evaluate\n      within-patient changes in computed tomography (CT) and bone scan measurements taken at\n      baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment.\n\n      V. Evaluate within-patient changes in prolactin receptor (PRLr) expression from baseline to\n      after 1 cycle of treatment in those patients who consent to optional repeat biopsy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive cabergoline orally (PO) twice weekly for weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6\n      months thereafter."
