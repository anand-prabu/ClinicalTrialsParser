Both of these\n      treatment groups will be given corrective doses of rapid-acting insulin analogs (aspart,\n      lispro or glulisine) before meals if their blood sugars are > 140 mg/dl.\n\n      The patients will be monitored for their blood sugars while the hospital.\n\n      If patients are agreeable to participate in the discharge part of the study, the\n      investigators will randomized them to a treatment group based on their admission HbA1c. The\n      investigators will follow these patients for 3 months with phone calls and clinic visits,\n      and will monitor their blood sugars. This is to compare the efficacy of linagliptin and our\n      discharge treatment algorithm in controlling blood sugars as out patients."
