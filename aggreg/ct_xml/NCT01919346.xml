    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of Eculizumab in the prevention of
      Delayed Graft Function following deceased donor kidney transplantation.  Based on
      experimental data and supportive observations in humans associating complement gene
      upregulation with ischemic reperfusion (IR) injury, it is hypothesized that C5 cleavage is a
      key step in the pathogenesis of ischemic reperfusion injury following transplantation.  It
      is further hypothesized that Eculizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody that blocks C5
      cleavage in humans will be an effective prophylactic agent to prevent IR injury in high risk
      recipients.  This trial is a prospective, randomized study to test the efficacy of
      eculizumab vs. placebo given once at the time of transplantation and once again 24 hours
      later in preventing delayed graft function in first adult recipients of deceased donor
      kidneys.
