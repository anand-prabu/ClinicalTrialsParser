Patients will continue on treatment until at least one of the following occurs (main criteria): Progressive Disease (PD) {PD as defined by mRECIST criteria or clinical progression [e.g. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS) of \u22653], treatment may be continued past radiological progression, provided the patient derives clinical benefit as judged by the treating physician.}, Death, Unacceptable toxicity, Subject withdraws consent, Treating physician determines discontinuation of treatment is in the subject's best interest, Substantial non-compliance with the protocol"

The study will be conducted in 2 stages.\n      Approximately 95 patients (15 at Stage 1/ 80 at Stage 2) will be accrued to this study to\n      receive treatment. Stage 2 of the trial will only be conducted if at least 5 out of 15\n      patients at Stage 1 show at least partial response according to an objective criteria to\n      evaluate tumor size based on contrast enhancement [modified response evaluation criteria in\n      solid tumors (mRECIST)] assessed by external independent radiologists.\n\n      Refametenib is an oral (i.e. taken by mouth) protein kinase inhibitor. A kinase inhibitor\n      targets certain key proteins that are essential for the survival of the cancer cell. By\n      specifically targeting these proteins, refametinib in combination with sorafenib may stop\n      cancer growth. The growth of the tumor may be decreased by preventing these specific\n      proteins from functioning.\n\n      The primary endpoint (the most meaningful result to be tracked) of this study is based on\n      the rate of response, i.e. the disease getting smaller. The aim is to show that the therapy\n      with refametinib in combination with sorafenib improves the response rate in this patient\n      population compared to historical results observed with the sorafenib only."
