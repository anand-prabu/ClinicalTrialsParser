However, it frequently leads to sore mouth, tummy pain and increased risk of\n      developing infections.\n\n      The investigators try to save or \"rescue\" normal cells from the side effects of methotrexate\n      by giving a drug called folinic acid. Folinic acid is started 24 hours after methotrexate\n      and given regularly until methotrexate levels are really low and not dangerous to normal\n      cells anymore. Despite this rescue, side effects are still a problem and many patients are\n      not well enough to receive subsequent chemotherapy on time. Almost half of the planned\n      chemotherapy cycles are not given on time due to methotrexate side effects.\n\n      In this study the investigators will examine if adding a drug called glucarpidase to folinic\n      acid is helpful. Glucarpidase is an enzyme that inactivates methotrexate in the blood\n      stream. Lower methotrexate concentration in the blood stream leads to fewer side effects.\n      The investigators would like to see if glucarpidase helps patients to have their\n      chemotherapy on time, by reducing the side effects of methotrexate."

Two courses will be\n      given with folinic acid rescue (standard high-dose methotrexate), and the other two will be\n      given with glucarpidase rescue as well as folinic acid. This will enable us to compare\n      whether there is any difference in side effects with and without glucarpidase and also how\n      quickly patients recover from them.\n\n      Half of the patients will receive standard high-dose methotrexate on weeks 1 & 2 and\n      high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 4 & 5 (arm A) and half of the patients\n      will first have high-dose methotrexate with glucarpidase on weeks 1 & 2 and then standard\n      high-dose methotrexate on weeks 4 & 5 (arm B).\n\n      All patients receiving methotrexate have daily blood tests to monitor the levels of\n      methotrexate in their body, and monitor their kidney function. However, patients on this\n      study will have extra blood tests for chemotherapy drug levels and glucarpidase antibody\n      levels.
