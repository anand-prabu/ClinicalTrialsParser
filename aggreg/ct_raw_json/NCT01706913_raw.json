The hypothesis of this study is that obtaining inpatient dermatology consultations,\n      within 24 hours of a patient being admitted to the hospital for cellulitis, will reduce the\n      length of stay, readmission rate, cost, and antibiotic usage of the patient\u201fs admission as\n      well as properly evaluate and diagnose patients with pseudocellulitis. The primary objective\n      will be to measure the difference in the length of stay for patients who are randomized to a\n      dermatology consultation within 24 hours of hospital admission (active arm) versus being\n      managed by an internal medicine hospitalist alone, as is the standard of care (control arm).\n      The length of stay for each arm will be assessed once the study has been completed. The\n      secondary endpoint will be to measure readmission rates for cellulitis after patients are\n      discharged from the hospital. An additional endpoint will be to determine if antibiotic\n      usage differs between patients randomized to a dermatology consultation and those not.\n      Exploratory analyses will assess the percentage of patients with a concomitant known\n      predisposing factor for recurrent cellulitis such as lymphedema, leg ulceration, tinea\n      pedis, or onychomycosis, as well as the association of fever >100.5 F and a history of a\n      prior episode of cellulitis."
