GM-CSF stimulates the body to produce\n      white blood cells.\n\n      Before treatment starts, patients will have a complete exam, including blood and urine\n      tests.  A chest x-ray and a CT scan or MRI scan of the abdomen and pelvis will be done to\n      measure tumors.  Bone marrow and lymph node samples will be taken.\n\n      Women who are able to have children must have a negative blood pregnancy test.\n\n      Patients in this study will receive both rituximab and GM-CSF. The combined treatment will\n      last 8 weeks.\n\n      Rituximab will be given through a needle in a vein over 3-6 hours once a week.  GM-CSF will\n      be given through a needle under the skin 3 times a week.  The first of these 3 doses will be\n      usually given 1 hour before the rituximab dose.  In selected cases, GM-CSF will start 1 week\n      before or 1 day after the rituximab.\n\n      Patients may also receive the drugs acetaminophen (Tylenol) and diphenhydramine\n      hydrochloride (Benadryl) 30-60 minutes before each dose of rituximab.  This will be done to\n      ease side effects.  Patients may need to stay in the clinic for up to 2 hours after\n      rituximab is given.\n\n      If the combined Rituximab and GM-CSF treatment causes severe side effects, the treatment may\n      be stopped.\n\n      During the study, blood tests will be done before each rituximab treatment and after the\n      first and fourth rituximab treatments.  About 2 to 6 teaspoons of blood will be drawn for\n      each test.  A physical exam and a urine test will be done before the fourth rituximab\n      treatment.\n\n      After all treatment is done, patients will have a complete exam, including blood tests once\n      a week for 4 weeks and then at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.  A CT scan or MRI scan of\n      the abdomen and pelvis will also be done at 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18, and 24 months.  Bone marrow\n      samples will be taken at 2, 3, and 12 months.  Some patients may also have bone marrow\n      samples taken once a year after that.  A large needle will be used to take the bone marrow\n      samples.\n\n      This is an investigational study. GM-CSF and rituximab are approved for commercial use by\n      FDA.  As many as 40 patients will take part in the study.  All will be treated as\n      outpatients.  The study will take place only at the University of Texas (UT) MD Anderson\n      Cancer Center (MDACC)."
