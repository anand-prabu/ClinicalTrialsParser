  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Annually, 4,200 new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed in Denmark. The stage of the disease
      is an important prognostic factor as an advanced stage reduces the opportunity for surgical
      intervention and other curative treatment. In denmark, as in many other countries, a fast
      track evaluation for lung cancer has been introduced in 2008.

      When the general practitioners refer patients through the fast track, the majority of
      patients make their first visit to the Department of Pulmonary Medicine. After this visit,
      further investigation is initiated, which is often a CT scan of the chest and the upper
      abdomen. We dont know Whether this is the most appropriate organisation.

      The aim of this project is to evaluate the way lung cancer patients are examined through the
      fast track and the impact of chest CT before an evaluation by a chest physician.

      Investigators want to randomise all patients referred for the existing fast track to either
      direct CT scan of chest and upper abdomen or to evaluation by the chest physician, in order
      to test:

      A) Fast track performance measured by number of CT scans and chest physician specialist time
      per diagnosis, and whether there is a difference between the intervention and the control
      group.
