Patients also receive docetaxel IV over\n      1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed within 3-4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 12-33 patients will be accrued for this study."
