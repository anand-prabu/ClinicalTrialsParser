        inborn infants at 26-32 weeks gestation with RDS, whom received NCPAP as the initial

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All enrolled infants were able to breathe at 5 min of age, had evidence of
             respiratory distress, unable to receive surfactant therapy, and were administrated
             with early NCPAP as the initial treatment

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were endotracheal intubation for resuscitation or insufficient
             respiratory drive, died in the first 24 hours after birth, known genetic disorders,
             potentially life-threatening conditions unrelated to prematurity, and premature
             rupture of membranes (PROM) for &gt;3 weeks.
