Only standard diagnostic tests and treatments will be used in this study.\n\n      Patients of any age with seizures who are referred to CES may participate in this study.  At\n      the end of the study, patients may be discharged to the care of their referring physician,\n      offered participation in another NINDS research protocol, or followed for teaching purposes.\n\n      Participants will undergo standard diagnostic procedures used to determine the type of their\n      seizures, what part of the brain they are coming from, what is causing them, and whether\n      standard drug treatments can help them.  These may include some or all of the following:\n\n        -  Physical and neurological examination\n\n        -  Neuropsychological tests     tests of learning and memory\n\n        -  Electroencephalography (EEG)     brain wave recording\n\n        -  Evoked potentials     tests of nerve reactions to lights and sounds\n\n        -  Polysomnography     simultaneous recordings of brain waves, breathing and eye movements\n\n        -  Video-EEG monitoring     simultaneous recording of seizures using a video camera and\n           brain waves\n\n        -  Video-EEG monitoring with extra electrodes to record muscle activity, breathing and eye\n           movements for analyzing sleep patterns\n\n        -  Imaging studies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission\n           tomography (PET) scans to examine the structure and function of the brain\n\n        -  Frequent blood tests to measure blood levels of anti-seizure drugs"

Tests will\n      be performed in patients when clinically indicated.  The protocol will be used to screen\n      patients for inclusion in other protocols, follow the natural history of seizure disorders,\n      and train fellows in the evaluation and treatment of epilepsy.
