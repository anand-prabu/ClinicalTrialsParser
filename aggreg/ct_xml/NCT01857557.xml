  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial assesses the impact of a supervised aerobic exercise program by a kinesiologist
      in patients with migraine. Patients can be assigned to one of two groups 1)The exercise
      group or 2)non-exercise group. This is a important area to study because there is currently
      limited information regarding exercise and its impact on migraine frequency and severity. In
      many cases, migraine patients are disabled by their headaches and sometimes will not have a
      significant response to medications. As a result, it is important to study other
      non-pharmacological interventions. In this study, the investigators hope to show the
      benefits of exercise by a reduction in number of headache days per month as well as by
      improvement in quality of life, disability,depression,anxiety,and aerobic fitness.This study
      will not interfere with the usual treatment patients receive at our headache clinic and
      patients can remain on medications deemed necessary.
