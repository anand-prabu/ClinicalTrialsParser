  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fanconi anemia (FA) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by progressive bone
      marrow failure (BMF), congenital abnormalities and a predisposition to malignancy.  Current
      therapies for children with Fanconi anemia (FA) and bone marrow failure, i.e. androgens or
      bone marrow transplantation, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality.

      This is a pilot study aiming to assess feasibility, toxicity and pharmacokinetics of oral
      Quercetin therapy in patients with FA. This is a first step towards a clinical study of the
      efficacy of Quercetin therapy in delaying progression of BMF in FA.

      Additional correlative studies will include assessment of impact of Quercetin on reduction
      of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), maintenance or improvement of hematopoietic stem cell
      (HSC) reserve, improvement of hematopoiesis (i.e. peripheral counts) and insulin
      sensitivity/glucose tolerance.

      This study is an open-label single arm study.

    <description>Quercetin will be given orally on a twice a day schedule starting with weight adjusted dose for a maximum total daily dose of 1500 mg/day, for 4 months (16 weeks). If any of the patients in the first cohort is 70 kg or more, the starting dose will be automatically assigned at the maximum dose of 750 mg/day. Pharmacokinetics (PK) data will be used to optimize the dosing schedule (if required)for subsequent patients.</description>
