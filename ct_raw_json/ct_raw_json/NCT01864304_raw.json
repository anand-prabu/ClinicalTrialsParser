In addition, clinical observations and preliminary data\n      suggest increased overall body fat in these individuals, as well as a relative increase in\n      fat deposition in the lower extremities.  However, glucose and lipid metabolism in WS remain\n      incompletely characterized.  The purpose of the current study is to carefully describe\n      glucose metabolism and lipid parameters in people with WS."

Obesity or abnormal fat distribution due to a known secondary cause (except WS) such\n             as Cushing syndrome, HIV-infection, etc.\n\n          5.
