Sessions will include preparation of a healthy meal (hands-on) and discussions of mindful eating, balanced meals, portion sizes, and preparing food at home, under a dietitian's supervision. Sessions will also include a one-hour physical activity information/practice session with a kinesiologist. Participants will track daily step counts with a pedometer and aim to eventually reach more than 10,000 steps/day. They will also receive instruction and demonstration from a kinesiologist of some simple resistance exercises they may perform at home. Between sessions, participants will receive advice and support through a study-specific website and telephone calls."

            "textblock": "Women with a history of 'diabetes in pregnancy' or Gestational Diabetes (GDM) have a high\n      risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. This can often be prevented, however, with\n      improvements in eating habits and higher physical activity levels. However, many women find\n      it difficult to alter their lifestyle habits, especially if they have young children. In\n      adults with type 2 diabetes, the investigators have been studying the effects of combining\n      nutrition education with meal preparation training and pedometer-based self-monitoring to\n      improve eating habits and increase activity levels. The investigators have shown that such a\n      strategy can reduce hemoglobin A1C by 0.3% and correlates with small reductions in weight\n      (Dasgupta et al, International Journal of Behavioural Nutrition and Physical Activity,\n      2012). In developing the present interventional study, we presented this strategy to women\n      with a GDM history and asked them how they would modify it to suit their needs. They\n      expressed strong interest in such an approach but emphasized a need to involve their spouses\n      and provide childcare support. They did not express interest in use of meal replacements.\n      Therefore, in MoMM-intervention phase, the investigators will examine the effects of a once\n      per month (4 session) program combined with Internet/telephone-based support. The four\n      sessions with include meal preparation training, strategies to limit mindless eating and\n      improve meal content and portion control. All sessions will offer child care. Two sessions\n      will involve spouses. The investigators will assess effects on weight, BMI, DXA measures of\n      fat, and measures of insulin resistance and blood pressure. This single-arm intervention\n      study may lead ultimately to a randomized controlled trial."

The investigators have designed the intervention to include\n      in-person sessions- but at a feasible frequency for busy mothers- as well as telephone calls\n      and an on-line discussion forum, to provide an ongoing source of support, information, and\n      accountability. Further, participants' partners will be invited to some of the in-person\n      sessions and childcare will be provided on-site. Importantly, there are no meal replacements\n      included, despite the study title, because focus group discussions indicated that this was\n      not of interest to the target population.\n\n      The investigators will hold in-person sessions at a frequency of once per month over a\n      4-month period. In addition to the in-person, on-site sessions, we will arrange for\n      participants to have in a grocery store 'tour' led by a student from the McGill School of\n      Dietetics and Human Nutrition BSc program. This will allow a review of label reading and\n      interpretation as well as tips on produce selection. Details of the intervention are\n      provided under the trial arm section below."
