    <textblock>
      Background:

      - Some people who have chronic hepatitis C do not respond to the usual treatment with
      peginterferon and ribavirin. New chronic hepatitis treatments are being developed that may
      work better for different people. The treatments will look at how specific genes interact
      with the drugs. Researchers want to see how well these new drugs work in people whose
      chronic hepatitis C has not responded or only partly responded to the usual treatment drugs.

      Objectives:

      - To compare new treatments for people with chronic hepatitis C.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have chronic hepatitis C that has not responded
      to standard treatments.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Liver scans and a biopsy will be taken before the start of
           treatment.

        -  Participants will be separated into two groups. One group will have the new treatment
           drugs (assunaprevir and daclatasvir). The second group will have these two drugs as
           well as peginterferon and ribavirin. All participants will have an initial 4-day
           hospital stay with regular blood tests to see how the start of the treatment works.

        -  The first group will take the new study drug tablets daily for 24 weeks. Those who do
           not respond to this treatment will also start to take peginterferon and ribavirin, and
           the treatment will continue for 24 weeks after starting the additional drugs.

        -  The second group will take all four drugs according to the standard dosing schedule for
           24 weeks.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests. Liver scans, biopsies, and other
           tests will be performed as directed by the study doctors.

        -  Participants will have 24 weeks of regular followup visits.

      Up to 70 patients with chronic hepatitis C, genotype 1, who were partial or null responders
      to optimal therapy with the combination of peginterferon and ribavirin will be enrolled into
      this pilot study on the use of asunaprevir and daclatasvir together or in combination with
      peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin to improve response to antiviral therapy. Two separate
      studies will be conducted based upon HCV genotype 1 subtype. For patients with HCV genotype
      1b: After medical evaluation and liver biopsy, 30 HCV genotype 1b patients will receive
      combination therapy with asunaprevir and daclatasvir alone for 24 weeks and undergo paired
      liver biopsies, pre-treatment and either at 2 or 4 weeks after starting therapy. Patients in
      whom HCV RNA is greater than or equal to LLOQ at 8 weeks will either discontinue therapy at
      that point (early stopping rule for futility) or may have rescue therapy instituted at the
      discretion of the investigator with a QUAD regimen (asunaprevir and daclatasvir plus
      peginterferon and ribavirin) provided they meet pre-specified inclusion criteria. For
      patients with HCV genotype 1a: After medical evaluation and liver biopsy 40 (15 with
      cirrhosis and 15 with Ishak fibrosis 0-2; the remaining 10 slots will be allocated for
      individuals who do not meet the histological entry requirement i.e. Ishak 3-4) HCV genotype
      1a patients will be started on combination therapy with asunaprevir, daclatasvir,
      peginterferon alfa-2a and ribavirin for 24 weeks. Patients will be randomized to undergo a
      second liver biopsy at study week 4 after starting therapy either before or 6 hours after
      the next scheduled peginterferon dose to assess intrahepatic interferon stimulated gene
      expression. Intrahepatic drug concentrations of asunaprevir and daclatasvir will be measured
      as part of an ancillary study. Patients in whom HCV RNA is  &gt;=LLOQ at 8 weeks will
      discontinue therapy (early stopping rule for futility). Routine serum chemistries, complete
      blood counts and HCV RNA levels will be monitored more frequently for the initial 4 days and
      then at standard intervals during the period of antiviral therapy. The major endpoints will
      be changes in interferon stimulated gene and protein expression in the liver and changes in
      HCV RNA levels in liver and serum between baseline and 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints will be
      rates of sustained virologic response 12 and 24 weeks off therapy.

      Routine serum chemistries, complete blood counts and HCV RNA levels will be monitored more
      frequently for the initial 9 days and then at standard intervals during the period of
      antiviral therapy. The major endpoints will be changes in interferon stimulated gene and
      protein expression in the liver and changes in HCV RNA levels in liver and serum between
      baseline and 4 weeks. Secondary endpoints will be rates of sustained virologic response 12
      and 24 weeks off therapy.
