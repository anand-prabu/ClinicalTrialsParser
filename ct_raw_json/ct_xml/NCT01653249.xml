  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 300 women aged 18-50 years.  The study will show that a new
      therapeutic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine designed to regress a precancerous condition
      called high-grade squamous intraepithelial neoplasia (HSIL)is safe.  HPV is known to cause
      cervical, vaginal, oral, and anal cancers.  This novel vaccine will consist of a
      synthetically made fragment of HPV protein called E6 and yeast extract called Candin速.
      Previous studies have revealed that immune response to E6 is important in fighting HPV.  We
      also know that injecting Candin has anti-HPV effect since it has been used to treat common
      warts which are caused by different types of HPV.  The current standard treatment for HSIL
      is loop electrical excision procedure (LEEP). The immune system is the part of the body that
      fights infection and cancer.  This research study will also examine the immune response to
      the vaccine and its effectiveness in regressing HSIL.  Volunteers would be eligible to
      enroll in the study if they have had a recent Papanicolaou (Pap) smear result indicating
      HSIL or &quot;Cannot rule out HSIL&quot;, and if they meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria. Subjects
      will be eligible to receive vaccinations if biopsy confirms HSIL. A series of four
      vaccinations will be given roughly 3 weeks apart, and LEEP will be performed at the end of
      the study approximately 12 weeks after the last vaccination.
