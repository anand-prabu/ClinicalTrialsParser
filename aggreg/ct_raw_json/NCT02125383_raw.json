The first sleep study in each pair will acclimate subjects to\n      the sleep laboratory and minimize \"first night\" effects, thus no tDCS will be applied. The\n      second sleep study in each pair will include active or sham tDCS, presented in a\n      pseudorandom order such that approximately half of the subjects receive active tDCS first\n      while the other half receives sham first. The two pairs of sleep studies will be separated\n      by one to three weeks."
