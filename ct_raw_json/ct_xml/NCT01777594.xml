  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the fifth most common type of cancer worldwide and the
      third most common cause of death from cancer.  Sorafenib is the only approved therapy for
      treatment of advanced HCC, and there is a need to identify more drugs that are beneficial
      for these patients without unacceptable side effects.  Prodrug chemotherapy is an approach
      in which an inactive non-toxic agent is administered to the patient and gets activated
      within the body at specific locations, resulting in a higher concentration of the cytotoxic
      form at a tumor location while avoiding general side effects. G-202 is an example of prodrug
      chemotherapy.  It is activated by Prostate Specific Memory Antigen (PSMA), which is
      expressed by some cancer cells and in the blood vessels of most solid tumors, but not by
      normal cells or blood vessels in normal tissue. It is believed that activation of the
      prodrug G-202 will allow the drug to kill cancer cells.  This study will evaluate the
      activity and safety of G-202 in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma who have progressed
      after taking sorafenib.  The study will evaluate clinical activity and safety of G-202
      administered by intravenous infusion on three consecutive days of a 28-day cycle.
