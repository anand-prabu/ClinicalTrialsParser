Little is know, however,\n      about the effect of CPAP in elderly people with OSA.  Objective: To assess the effect of\n      CPAP treatment in elderly patients with severe OSA on clinical, quality-of-life and\n      neurocognitive spheres. Methods and Measurements: Open-label, randomized, multicenter\n      clinical trial of parallel groups with blinded end-point design conducted in 12 Spanish\n      teaching hospitals on a consecutive clinical cohort of elderly (\u2265 70 years) patients with\n      confirmed severe OSA (IAH\u2265 30) receiving CPAP or no therapy while maintaining their usual\n      control for three months. CPAP titration was performed by an auto CPAP device. A good\n      adherence was set as at least 4 hours/day of CPAP use. Primary endpoint was the measurement\n      of quality of life by the Quebec Sleep questionnaire, which includes diurnal and nocturnal\n      symptoms, hypersomnolence, and social and emotional dimensions. Secondary endpoints include\n      different sleep-related symptoms, presence of anxiety or depression, office blood pressure\n      figures and some neurocognitive tests. Patients were invited to a clinical visit on three\n      occasions to quantify the adherence to CPAP. Intention-to-treat analysis was performed."
