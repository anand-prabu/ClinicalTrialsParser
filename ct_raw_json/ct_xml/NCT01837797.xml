          -  The patient has had neuroleptic malignant syndrome.

          -  The patient has any relevant medical history or currrent presence of systemic
             disease.

          -  The patient has a neurodegenerative disorder.

          -  The patient has, at the Screening Visit an abnormal ECG that is, in the
             investigator's opinion, clinically significant.

          -  The patient has a history of cancer, other than basal cell or Stage 1 squamous cell
