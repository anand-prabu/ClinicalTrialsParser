  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment
      of behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone
      found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells.  It is also
      shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism. We hope to
      examine the tolerability of pregnenolone in adults with autism.

      This study will assess the tolerability and effectiveness of pregnenolone in the treatment
      of behavioral deficits in adults with autism. Pregnenolone is a naturally occurring hormone
      found in the body which has been shown to help with the function of nerve cells.  It is also
      shown to modulate the activity of certain brain receptors implicated in autism.

      Pregnenolone has been used safely in research studies involving individuals with
      schizophrenia.  In the proposed trial, we hope to examine the tolerability of pregnenolone
      in adults with autism. We hope to see improvement in behavioral outcomes as measured by
      standardized behavioral measures. Further, we will measure concentrations of pregnenolone
      and related neuroactive compounds in the blood.  The use of pregnenolone has been studied in
      a number of mental disorders but not autism. Thus, we hope the study will identify new
      avenues of research for the treatment of autism.

    <description>With Baseline serving as approximately day 1, twice daily intake of orally administered pregnenolone will occur on a schedule consisting of an up-titration followed by a down-titration as described below.
Days 1-14: 100 mg
Week 1 and 2: 200 mg
Week 3 and 4: 350 mg
Week 5 and 6: 400 mg
Week 7 -12: 500 mg
If the participant is unable to tolerate a specific dose then he/she will be maintained at the highest tolerated dose until down titration occurs.</description>
