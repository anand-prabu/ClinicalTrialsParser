The dose and the type\n      of atypical antipsychotic (ie risperidone or olanzapine) each patient will receive during\n      the double-blind period will be the same that the patient had been on at the time of entry\n      into the double-blind phase. All patients, irrespective of which treatment arm they are in,\n      will receive active psychoeducation and counselling regarding sleep hygiene, healthy daily\n      routines and rhythms, alcohol and substance abuse, anxiety management, conflict resolution\n      and problem solving as clinically indicated in routine clinical practice.
