    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of comparing colchicine to
      placebo for the prevention of new onset atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing general
      thoracic surgery and establish the foundation for a large, multi-centre, clinical trial.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  All patients â‰¥55 years of age undergoing intra-thoracic surgery for a resection of
             tumor in lung.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  In AF prior to surgery*,

          -  Undergoing minor thoracic interventions/ procedures (i.e., chest tube insertion,
             needle pleural/lung biopsies, or minor chest-wall surgeries), or

          -  With contraindications to colchicine (i.e., allergy, or myelodysplastic disorders or
             estimated glomerular filtration rate [e-GFR] &lt;30 mL/min/1.73m)

               -  Clarification: Patients with history of AF who are in sinus rhythm during
                  enrollment will be eligible for recruitment. Patients who have no history of AF
                  and are found to be in AF at the time of enrollment will not be eligible.
