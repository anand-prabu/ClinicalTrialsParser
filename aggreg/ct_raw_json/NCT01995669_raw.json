            "textblock": "Study Groups:\n\n      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a study\n      group based on when you join this study.  Three (3) groups of up to 6 participants will be\n      enrolled in the Phase 1 portion of the study.  Up to 60 participants will be enrolled in\n      Phase 2.\n\n      If you are enrolled in the Phase 1 portion, the dose of lenalidomide you receive will depend\n      on when you joined this study.  The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose\n      level of lenalidomide.  Each new group will receive a higher dose of  lenalidomide than the\n      group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.  This will continue until the\n      highest tolerable dose of lenalidomide is found.\n\n      If you are enrolled in the Phase 2 portion, you will receive lenalidomide at the highest\n      dose that was tolerated in the Phase I portion.\n\n      All participants will receive the same dose level of obinutuzumab.\n\n      Study Drug Administration:\n\n      Each cycle is 28 days.  You will be given a drug diary to record your doses.\n\n      On Days 2-22 of Cycles 1-6, you will take lenalidomide by mouth at about the same time each\n      morning. You should take it with a glass of water on either a full or an empty stomach.   Do\n      not break, chew, or open the capsules.\n\n      If you miss a dose of lenalidomide, take it as soon as you remember on the same day.  If you\n      miss taking your dose for the entire day, take your regular dose the next scheduled day. Do\n      not take double your regular dose to make up for a missed dose.\n\n      If you take more than the prescribed dose of lenalidomide, you should seek emergency medical\n      care if needed and contact the study staff right away.\n\n      You will receive obinutuzumab by vein on Days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 of Cycle 1 and Day 1 of\n      Cycles 2-6.  The first infusion will last about 2 hours. If this is well-tolerated, the next\n      infusions will take about 1 hour.\n\n      If you have stable disease you will continue receiving obinutuzumab and lenalidomide for up\n      to 12 cycles.\n\n      There is no \"rest period\".  Participants will move to the extended dosing schedule after\n      Cycle 6, where dosing of obinutuzumab will be given every other cycle.\n\n      Extended Dosing:\n\n      If you are responding, you may begin taking obinutuzumab on Day 1 on every even cycle\n      (Cycles 8, 10, 12 and so on).   You may continue taking lenalidomide until Cycle 12.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Some of the tests and procedures may be done up to 7 days before the timing listed below.\n\n      On Day 1 of each cycle and Days 8 and 22 of Cycle 1:\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd tablespoons)\n           pregnancy test.\n\n        -  On Day 1 only, you will have a complete physical exam.\n\n      On Day 15 of Cycle 1, if you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd\n      tablespoons) pregnancy test.\n\n      On Day 14 of Cycles 2-12:\n\n      -Blood (about 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      On Cycles 3, 6, 9, 12 and then every 4 months after that:\n\n      You will have a CT or PET/CT to check the status of the disease. If your doctor thinks it is\n      needed, you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the\n      disease.\n\n      Length of Treatment:\n\n      You may continue taking the study drugs for up to 30 months.  You will no longer be able to\n      take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you\n      are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment\n      and follow-up visits.\n\n      End-of-Treatment Visit:\n\n      Within 28 days after your last dose of study drug:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  You will have a CT and/or PET/CT to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have a chest x-ray to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed you will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to\n           check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 \u00bd tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1\u00bd tablespoons)\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      Depending on the disease status, you many have other tests to help further check the status\n      of the disease.  The exact tests needed would be up to your doctor.  Your doctor will\n      discuss these with you.\n\n      Long-term Follow-up:\n\n      If you stopped taking the study drug because the disease got worse, your study doctor will\n      follow up with you to check you how you are doing every 3 months for 1 year, every 6 months\n      for the next year, and then every year after that. At each clinic visit:\n\n        -  You will have a CT scan and/or PET/CT to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n      This is an investigational study.   Lenalidomide is FDA approved for the treatment of\n      multiple myeloma (MM) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS).  Obinutuzumab is FDA approved and\n      commercially available for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).  Its use in\n      this study is investigational.  The combination of lenalidomide and obinutuzumab is\n      investigational.\n\n      Up to 72 participants will be enrolled on this study.  All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
