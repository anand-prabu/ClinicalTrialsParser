Recently, three randomized controlled trials\n      (RCT) concerning PVP have been published with conflicting results. Two RCTs with a sham\n      control intervention failed to show an advantage of vertebroplasty over placebo for\n      participants with acute, subacute, and chronic fractures or severe pain. In the third RCT,\n      PVP compared to optimal conservative treatment showed significant immediate postoperative\n      pain relief in the vertebroplasty group, but not at 3 and 12 months. To examine these\n      issues, this study is initiated to compare PVP with conservative therapy in patients with\n      osteoporotic VCFs. Moreover, this study addresses concerns about the possibility that PVP\n      increases the incidence of new compression fractures in adjacent vertebrae."

Patients may present\n      with pain and frequently require hospital admission for analgesia, bed rest, and physical\n      support (bracing). While their back pain may last for 6-12 weeks, complications such as\n      pneumonia, decubitus ulcers, venous thromboembolism, and even death may occur. Percutaneous\n      vertebroplasty (PVP) is now a therapeutic option for individuals for whom medical management\n      has not been successful or for those who are at risk for developing complications due to\n      long-term immobilization. Recently, three randomized controlled trials (RCT) concerning PVP\n      have been published with conflicting results. So this study is  to compare PVP with\n      conservative therapy in patients with osteoporotic VCFs. Moreover, this study addresses\n      concerns about the possibility that PVP increases the incidence of new compression fractures\n      in adjacent vertebrae.\n\n      This study is a multicenter randomized controlled trial (RCT),  Participants in this study\n      will be allocated randomly to PVP or conservative treatment.All Participants will be asked\n      to fill out standard questionnaires to provide clinical information at baseline (the day of\n      randomization), and at 1 day, 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after the\n      treatment. Cross-over will not be offered before 12 months after randomization. All standard\n      questionnaires (except the 1-day questionnaire) consist of the VAS score, Quality of Life\n      Questionnaire of the European Foundation for Osteoporosis (QUALEFFO), EQ-5D, and\n      Roland-Morris Disability (RMD) Questionnaire.  Furthermore,additional questions about pain\n      treatment, hospital stay, outpatient visits,medical aids, and medical costs will be\n      completed with the help of a nurse practitioner."
