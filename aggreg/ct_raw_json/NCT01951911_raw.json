All patients will be recruited from hospital\n      wards (Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen). In the case of patient withdrawal or dropout,\n      new patients will be recruited so that the total number of patients completing the study\n      will be 20. Data from patients not completing the study will solely be used to provide\n      information about adverse effects.\n\n      The basic treatment with subcutaneous morphine infusion will be supplemented with a separate\n      subcutaneous infusion of ketamine 1 mg/kg/ 24 hours or NaCl 9 mg/ml (placebo).\n\n      After 48 hours (phase 1) there will be a \"wash-out\" period of minimum 10 hours to minimize\n      carryover effects before the treatment is replaced by the alternative treatment for a\n      further 48 hours (phase 2) in a standard crossover design. The treatment duration is based\n      on ketamine's short plasma half-life which is less than 2 hours after initial equilibration.\n\n      Pain intensity (using NRS) will be recorded at rest and on movement x 4 daily. Rescue\n      medication in the form of morphine subcutaneous bolus may be given to the patient as\n      required. There will be a\" lockout\" time of 1 hour which means that the rescue dose of\n      morphine can be repeated every 60 minutes if necessary, providing the patient is awake and\n      has a respiratory rate of 8 or more per minute.Randomization will be performed by Haukeland\n      University Hospital Pharmacy. The study drug/ placebo will also be prepared by the hospital\n      pharmacy according to a standard instruction."
