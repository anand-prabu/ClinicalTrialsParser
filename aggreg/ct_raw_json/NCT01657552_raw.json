In this\n      study there will be a screening visit, three treatment periods, and a follow-up visit. In\n      Period 1, subjects will receive a single dose of ELT on Day 1, and pharmacokinetic (PK)\n      sampling will occur for 72 hours. In Period 2, subjects will receive BCP/TLP for 10 days\n      with PK sampling for 8 hours. In Period 3, subjects will receive a single dose of ELT with\n      BCP/TLP on Day 1 only with PK sampling for 72 hours. Subjects will return for a follow-up\n      visit within 10 to 14 days of the last dose of study drugs. The total duration of the study\n      from Screening to Follow-up will be approximately 9 weeks."

Signed informed consent\n             must be on file prior to screening procedures.\n\n          -  Body weight >= 50 kilogram (kg) (110 pounds [lbs]) for men and >=45 kg (99 lbs) for\n             women and body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 to 32.0 kg/ (meters squared) m^2 inclusive.\n\n          -  Male subjects, who are not surgically sterile, must agree on abstinence or to use a\n             double barrier method, such as, a condom plus spermicidal agent\n             (foam/gel/film/cream/suppository). This criterion must be followed from the time of\n             the first dose of study medication until 14 days after the last dose of medication.\n\n          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is neither pregnant nor lactating,\n             and falls into one of the following categories: non-childbearing potential including\n             pre-menopausal females with documented (medical report verification) hysterectomy or\n             bilateral oophorectomy, or postmenopausal females defined as being amenorrheic for\n             greater than 1 year and having serum estradiol and follicle stimulating hormone\n             levels consistent with menopause, child-bearing potential with negative beta human\n             chorionic gonadotropin (\u03b2hCG) test and agrees to comply with recognized non-hormonal\n             contraceptive methods from screening or at least two weeks prior to first dose\n             (whichever is earlier) until the follow-up visit. Recognized non-hormonal\n             contraceptive methods include: complete abstinence from intercourse, two forms of\n             barrier contraception (e.g. condom with spermicide, or diaphragm with spermicide), or\n             intrauterine device (IUD).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  History of Gilbert's syndrome.\n\n          -  History of deep vein thrombosis or other thromboembolic event.\n\n          -  History of thrombocytopenia or bleeding due to abnormal platelet number or function.\n\n          -  Clotting factor abnormalities associated with hypercoagulability, including Factor V\n             Leiden, Protein C or Protein S deficiency or antithrombin III deficiency.\n\n          -  Elevated blood pressure (BP) at screening, Day -1 and at pre-dose (systolic >140 mm\n             Hg [millimeters of mercury], diastolic >90 mmHg). If the subject's BP is elevated on\n             the first measurement, complete two additional BP measurements at least 2 minutes\n             apart and average the three assessments to evaluate this criterion.  If averaged BP\n             exceeds the safety criteria, the subject should be excluded.\n\n          -  History of atrial fibrillation, mitral valve prolapse, significant heart murmur or\n             vascular bruit.\n\n          -  Prolonged QTcF interval at screening, Day 1 and at pre-dose (for females and males\n             >450 milliseconds [ms]). If the QTcF interval is prolonged on the initial ECG, then\n             complete two additional ECGs at least 5 minutes apart and take the average QTcF\n             measurements of all three ECGs to evaluate this criterion.  If averaged QTcF exceeds\n             the safety criteria, the subject should be excluded.\n\n          -  Female subjects currently receiving hormone replacement therapy (HRT).\n\n          -  Positive for HIV, hepatitis B virus infection or HCV infection at screening.\n\n          -  Positive urine drug screen including serum alcohol at screening or pre-dose (Day -1).\n\n          -  History of alcohol/drug abuse or dependence within 12 months of the study.
