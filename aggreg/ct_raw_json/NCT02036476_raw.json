It is commercially available\n      as COMETRIQ\u2122 in the United States.\n\n      During the Pre Treatment Period, participants are consented and qualified (screened) for the\n      study. Treatment will be administered on an outpatient basis.\n\n      Each treatment cycle lasts 28 days, during which time the participant will be taking the\n      study drug, cabozantinib, once daily. The participant will be given a study drug-dosing\n      diary for each treatment cycle. The diary will also include special instructions for taking\n      the study drug.\n\n      - Participants will be followed for 8 weeks after removal from study or until death,\n      whichever occurs first. Participants removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will\n      be followed until resolution or stabilization of the adverse event."
