    <textblock>
      This purpose of this trial is to determine whether a 12-month eHealth behavioral
      intervention that includes interactive self-monitoring and feedback, tailored skills
      training materials, telephone counseling calls, and primary care physician (PCP) counseling
      will produce greater weight change at 12 months than a standard primary care control.
