Monoclonal antibodies, such as anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody\n      MOR00208, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of cancer to\n      grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry cancer-killing\n      substances to them. Biological therapies, such as lenalidomide, may stimulate the immune\n      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving anti-CD19 monoclonal\n      antibody MOR00208 and lenalidomide may kill more cancer cells."

To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 6 months for patients with\n      treatment-naive CLL/SLL/PLL treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus lenalidomide.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR) at 12 months for patients with untreated\n      CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed/refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus\n      lenalidomide.\n\n      II. To determine the complete response (CR) rate, nodular partial response (nPR) rate,\n      partial response (PR) rate, and stable disease (SD) rate for patients with untreated\n      CLL/SLL/PLL or relapsed or refractory disease treated with the combination of MOR00208 plus\n      lenalidomide.\n\n      III.

To determine whether NK cells and T cells are activated in response to MOR00208 alone\n      or in combination with lenalidomide.\n\n      VIII. To estimate the rate of minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients achieving CR, and\n      whether this correlates with PFS.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive anti-CD19 monoclonal antibody MOR00208 intravenously (IV) over 2 hours on\n      day 1 (days 1, 2, 8, 15, and 22 of course 1) and lenalidomide orally (PO) daily on days 1-28\n      (days 9-28 of course 1).
