From the date of initial subject recruitment\n      to the issuance of a final study report and closeout activities, the expected total study\n      duration is 6 to 10 months.\n\n      Each participant will be screened for eligibility and randomized to receive either oral\n      bexarotene or placebo control (\"Test Article\").The study has the potential to demonstrate\n      the pharmacodynamic properties of a novel treatment approach to Alzheimer's disease. The\n      primary biomarker measurements obtained from this study are believed to be highly dynamic\n      and able to provide a rapid read-out of the biologic activity of the candidate therapeutic\n      under study. In addition, exploratory analysis will involve a proteomics-based screen to\n      identify proteins within both blood and CSF that are induced by the Test Article, thereby\n      potentially identifying new biomarkers that can be used in future clinical trials to\n      demonstrate bexarotene action and target engagement."
