All patients will\n      receive IAI 2 mg at baseline and Week 4.  If the pre-defined extension criteria are met at\n      the 4-week visit, and at any follow up visit, the patient will receive a mandated treatment,\n      and the next visit will be extended by two weeks.  If the extension criteria are not met on\n      a follow-up visit, the treatment interval will be continued to be reduced by 1 week. If\n      criteria are still not met despite treatment at the reduced interval, treatment will be\n      administered as usual and follow up interval will continue to be reduced by 1 week until the\n      criteria are met or a 4-week interval is reached.  Treatment of IAI is rendered at every\n      visit."
