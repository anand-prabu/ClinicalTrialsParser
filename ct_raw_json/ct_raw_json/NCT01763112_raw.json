Background and rationale for\n      the proposal:Capacity and the ability to exercise, in patients with PAH is limited. There is\n      a few investigations evaluating the effects of the training with whole body vibration (wbv)\n      in adults. It was shown that wbv-training could improve muscle power,  QoL,  body balance\n      and  had positive effects on the neuromuscular system. Primary scientific question\n      addressed:Changes in muscle power, changes in 6-Minute Walk Distance (6MWD) and changes in\n      QoL are to be evaluated."
