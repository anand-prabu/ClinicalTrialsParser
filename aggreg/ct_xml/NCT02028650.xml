  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The relapse leukemia patients after transplantation were divided into two groups randomly.
      Group D1: patients received first-donor stem cells infusion(DSI) treatment with or without
      chemotherapy; group D2: patients received second-donor DSI treatment with or without
      chemotherapy. The second donors were preferably donors who were genetically related and had
      more HLA-match locus. The re-induction chemotherapy regimen was primarily MAT(mitoxantrone,
      cytarabine, Teniposide ) for acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and VMCLD(vincristine, Teniposide,
      cyclophosphamide, L-Asparaginase, Dexamethasone) for acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), and
      no graft versus host disease(GVHD) prevention was conducted pre- and post- therapy.

      Evaluation indications include bone marrow morphology,hematopoietic recovery (neutrophil and
      platelet), 100-day transplantation-related mortality (TRM), donor chimerism, acute GVHD,
      chronic GVHD, disease free survival (DFS), and overall survival (OS). The cut-time of the
      follow-up was Oct, 2013. DFS was defined as the time between the date of transplantation to
      the death or relapse. OS was defined as the time from diagnosis to death or to the last date
      of follow-up until Oct. 2013.
