  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current follow-up study was planned to reveal the rates of Major Adverse Cardiovascular
      and Cerebrovascular Events (MACCE) during 4-year follow-up in patients participated in
      OPTIMA study.  In addition, the long-term effects of statins on LDL-cholesterol and
      different biomarkers in patients after drug-eluting stents implantation will be assessed. In
      addition, such project implementation will allow to clarify the treatment options used by
      Russian patients with CAD (Coronary Artery Disease) after drug-eluting stent implantation.
      The information received in this study will help to optimize management of Russian patients
      with CAD after PCI in order to improve prognosis and quality of life of these patients.

      This project is 3-years follow-up of OPTIMA study. This is an observational
      retro-prospective study based on the data collected during one visit: 4-year after PCI
      performed at the Russian Cardiological Research Center (РКНПК). From the date of the study
      start and until the end of the study investigators will enroll those patients participated
      in OPTIMA study. Only patients, who consent to participate in the study and sign the
      informed consent form after being informed by a physician on the objectives and methods of
      the study, will be enrolled into this project.

      This study is an observational one, and there is no intervention into routine clinical
      practice either in terms of therapy, or special examinations. The main point of this project
      is the data collection using the out-patient medical records or disease history of a
      patient, as well as collection of data received during patient routine examination. Data
      collection will be performed only once during single routine patient visit to treating
      physician or hospitalized patient examination. Study participation will be finished after
      this visit. Data collection will be performed at the visit 4 years after PCI and will
      include medical history, current medications, physical examination, ECG (electrocardiogram)
      and laboratory assessments.

      The study will be conducted in Russian Federation. It is planned that 80-90% of patients
      participated in OPTIMA study will be enrolled into current project. One clinical site -
      Russian Cardiological Research Center (РКНПК) - is supposed to participate in this study.

      The total period of the study is anticipated to be about 18 months.
