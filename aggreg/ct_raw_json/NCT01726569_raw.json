In the country of China,\n      patients who are low educational level and less known acknowledgement and information have\n      less known glaucoma. In the help of the government and some international non-governmental\n      organizations(NGOs), a lot of people in the country know the cataract, and the operability\n      of cataract is increase. Because vision loss usually development after operation for\n      glaucoma. If patients did not understand this, they may be not only do not accept operation,\n      but also affect operability of cataract. We hope the educational intervention for glaucoma\n      can increase the degree of satisfaction in glaucoma patients."
