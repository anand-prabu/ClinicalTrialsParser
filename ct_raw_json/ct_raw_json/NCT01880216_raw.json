The condition may progress to severe health\n      complications, such as pulmonary embolism (PE), if not diagnosed and treated in a timely and\n      effective manner.\n\n      The goal of the therapy for lower-extremity DVT is to prevent the extension of thrombus and\n      pulmonary embolism in the short term and to prevent recurrent events in the long-term.\n      Although anticoagulant therapy decreases the risk of recurrent thrombosis, the treatment\n      also increases the risk for major hemorrhage.\n\n      This trial aims to optimize the current medical knowledge on the effectiveness and safety of\n      two low molecular weight heparins, bemiparin and enoxaparin in the treatment of deep vein\n      thrombosis."
