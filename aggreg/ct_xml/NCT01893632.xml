  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Benzodiazepine dependence is a growing public health problem for which very few
      evidenced-based treatment approaches are available. Approximately 683,000 individuals met
      past year criteria for sedative-hypnotic use disorders in the US during 2010, a prevalence
      greater than heroin or methamphetamine dependence. The most commonly prescribed
      sedative-hypnotic agents are the benzodiazepines. Chronic use induces pharmacodynamic
      tolerance in the GABA neurotransmitter system and individuals with physiological dependence
      find benzodiazepines difficult to discontinue because of withdrawal or rebound symptoms,
      which include autonomic arousal, depression, anxiety, and insomnia. Available evidence-based
      treatment approaches have been primarily directed at therapeutic users of benzodiazepines
      who do not meet criteria for a substance use disorder, with a general consensus that the
      gradual taper of benzodiazepines over a period of several months is the optimal approach.
      However, patients with benzodiazepine dependence are typically referred for inpatient
      detoxification treatment, which rapidly tapers patients off benzodiazepines. Protracted
      withdrawal symptoms frequently persist after discharge, predisposing patients to relapse.
      More effective pharmacotherapeutic strategies are needed for the treatment of benzodiazepine
      dependence in the outpatient setting.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gabapentin has proven to be a safe and well-tolerated medication with a low abuse liability,
      thereby making it ideal for use in the outpatient setting.

      The proposed Exploratory Development research project is a double-blind randomized
      controlled clinical trial comparing the efficacy of gabapentin to placebo for the outpatient
      treatment of benzodiazepine dependence. The goal of this project is to study the effects of
      gabapentin on the participants' benzodiazepine use in a facilitated taper-to-abstinence
      model, where participants will be actively using benzodiazepines at study entry, gabapentin
      treatment will be introduced, and participants will be counseled to gradually discontinue
      benzodiazepine use over the study period while gabapentin treatment is maintained. A
      modified version of Medical Management will be used to facilitate compliance with study
      medication and other study procedures, and includes clinical instruction for gradually
      reducing benzodiazepine use 25% per week. Benzodiazepines are not prescribed in the proposed
      study; participants continue to obtain benzodiazepines from their own prescribed or
      nonprescribed sources.

    <description>All study medication will be over-capsulated with riboflavin to assess compliance using quantitative fluoroscopy. All participants will take three capsules three times per day throughout the study period. During week 1, GBP will be titrated over a five-day period to the dose target (GBP 1200 mg three times daily) or the maximum tolerated dose. Medication dosing will continue at GBP 1200 mg three times daily or placebo through the end of the study period (week 12). Dose reductions will be made for tolerability if necessary.</description>
