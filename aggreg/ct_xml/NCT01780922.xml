  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of a single dose of cranberry beverage
      in healthy adults on the kinetic uptake of polyphenol compounds and polyphenol metabolites,
      and antioxidative and anti-inflammatory activity.

      Participants will be randomized based on age, sex and BMI, and will consume a low-polyphenol
      diet 2 days prior to the intervention. On the day of the study, baseline blood and urine
      samples will be collected after an overnight fast. Participants will consume the assigned
      beverage within 15 minutes and blood collected at 2, 4, 8, and 24 h (10 mL/blood draw; total
      blood volume per period = 50 mL). Urine will be collected for polyphenol analysis during the
      following periods: 0-3, 3-6, 6-9, 9-12, 12-24 hours. After a one-week washout period,
      participants will receive their second and then the third beverage in a cross-over design;
      blood and urine sampling will be repeated at each of the 3 intervention periods.
