  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have confirmed that patients with cirrhosis possess an imbalance in
      procoagulant versus anticoagulant activity due to increased factor VIII and decreased
      protein C. Moreover, in the last two decades there has been an increased recognition that
      not only bleeding but also thrombosis complicates the clinical course of cirrhosis. The
      prevalence and pathogenesis of portal vein thrombosis (PVT) in patients with cirrhosis
      without hepatocellular carcinoma are not clearly defined. The Aim of this study is to assess
      the prevalence of portal vein thrombosis in patients with cirrhosis without hepatocellular
      carcinoma, and to prospectively assess the risk factors, outcome, and prognosis in these
      patients. The investigators plan to enroll two hundred patients with liver cirrhosis. The
      patients are going to follow up for one year and evaluate at baseline and every 6 months by
      liver function tests, coagulation test, upper abdomen ultrasound. All relevant clinical
      events will be evaluated at every follow up.
