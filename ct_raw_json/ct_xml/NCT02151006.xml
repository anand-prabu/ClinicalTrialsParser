    <textblock>
      140 women with expected poor ovarian response undergoing IVF/ICSI will be randomly divided
      into 2 groups using computer generated random numbers . Group 1 ( study group) will receive
      DHEA 25 mg  ( DHEA 25mg,  Natrol , USA) twice daily for 6 weeks before starting IVF/ICSI
      cycle. Group 2 ( control group) will not receive DHEA. Patients included in the study will
      be subjected to full history taking and clinical examination. On the second day of
      menstruation serum FSH, LH, Prolactin and Oestradiol will be assessed and the antral
      follicular count (AFC) will be assessed using a vaginal ultrasound scan. AFC will be defined
      as the number of follicles measuring 3-10mm.

      All patients will have standard pituitary down-regulation followed by (Human menopausal
      gonadotrophin (HMG) stimulation until the day of (Human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG)
      administration. On the day of HCG administration, ovarian ultrasound scan will be performed
      using a transvaginal probe. Oocytes will be aspirated 34-36 hours after HCG administration.
      Oocytes will be fertilized and embryos will be transferred. Both groups will be compared
      regarding the proportion of pregnancy.

      The study will be conducted in Cairo university hospitals and Dar Al-Teb Infertility and
      Assisted conception center, Giza Egypt. All patients attending the centre will be evaluated
      for their expected ovarian response.Patients fulfilling the Bologna criteria definition of
      poor ovarian response will be invited to participate in the study and to sign informed
      consent forms. The invitation will include a clear full explanation of the study.

      140 women will be randomly divided into 2 groups using computer generated random numbers.
      Group 1 ( study group) will include 70 women who will receive DHEA 25 mg t.d.s  ( DHEA®,
      Natrol , USA) twice daily for 6 weeks before starting IVF/ICSI cycle. Group 2 will include
      70 women who will not receive DHEA and will serve as the control group. All women fulfilling
      the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the study. A written informed
      consent will be taken and only women signing the consent will be included in the study.

      Patients included in the study will be subjected to full history taking and clinical
      examination including general, abdominal and gynecological examination. This will be
      followed by a vaginal ultrasound scan to assess uterus, ovaries and any pelvic masses.

      On the second day of menstruation serum FSH, LH, Prolactin and Oestradiol will be assessed
      and the antral follicular count (AFC) will be assessed using a vaginal ultrasound scan.  AFC
      will be defined as the number of follicles measuring 3-10mm.

      The stimulation protocol will start on day 2 using  450-300 IU highly purified HMG  (
      Menogon® Ferring GmbH, Germany) and GnRH agonist, Triptorelin acetate (S.C Decapeptyl® 0.1
      mg Ferring GmbH, Germany).  The starting dose of Triptorelin will be 0.1mg daily on day2-4
      after which the dose will be reduced to 0.05mg daily. Gonadotropins will be administered for
      4 to 5 days, after which the dose will be adjusted according to the ovarian response. The
      ovarian response will be monitored by transvaginal ultrasound and serum E2 levels. When
      three or more follicles reached a maximum diameter of 16 mm, highly purified HCG 5000 or
      10,000 IU (Choriomon ®IBSA) will be administered. The procedure will be cancelled if less
      than 3 follicles 16 mm in size are present 12 days after starting gonadotropins despite
      doses reaching 450 IU. The cycle will be also cancelled if there is risk of ovarian
      hyperstimulation like massive ovarian enlargement or serum estradiol exceeds 3000pg/L
      Transvaginal oocyte retrieval will be performed 34-36 h after the administration of HCG.
      Oocytes will be fertilized either via IVF or ICSI based on the couple's history.
      Fertilization will be assessed 16-18 h after IVF or ICSI . Embryos will be transferred on
      Day 3 or 5. Vaginal tablets containing progesterone (Prontogest® IBSA)  400 mg/day will be
      given when fertilization is confirmed. A pregnancy test will be done 2 weeks after embryo
      transfer. For patients with a positive pregnancy test, progesterone is to be continued for
      an additional 4 weeks. Clinical pregnancy will be defined as Visualization of an
      intrauterine gestational sac 5 weeks after embryo transfer.
