Pepper Older Americans\n      Independence Center (OAIC) is to build a comprehensive understanding of the causes and\n      consequences of declining physical function and disability development among older adults.\n      To date investigators have largely focused on sarcopenia, the age-related decline in\n      skeletal muscle mass and strength, as the primary contributor to physical decline. However,\n      recent findings indicate that changes in the central and/or peripheral nervous systems may\n      play a larger role than previously thought in the development of functional limitations.\n      These fields hold extensive promise for identifying novel contributors to age-related\n      functional decline.  Therefore, the overarching aim of this project is to develop the\n      ability of RC1 to assess novel neural contributors to mobility and overall physical\n      function. Importantly, the development of these techniques will provide the RC1 with the\n      tools to evaluate the potential involvement of the central and peripheral nervous systems in\n      age-related functional decline and disablement. The primary aim of this project is to\n      develop techniques for quantifying peripheral motor unit number and size as well as spinal\n      cord integrity."

These tests are\n           listed below and will not be conducted in a particular order, and will take\n           approximately 1.5 hours to complete.\n\n             -  Walking tests,\n\n             -  Tests of physical ability that include:\n\n                  1. Standing up from chairs of different height\n\n                  2. Lying on the floor and rising to a standing position\n\n                  3. Kneeling on the floor and rising to standing position\n\n                  4. Climbing a flight of stairs\n\n                  5. Lift a weighted laundry basket and placing it on a shelf\n\n             -  Muscle strength tests will be performed on the legs and arms.\n\n             -  Questionnaires that address physical function.\n\n             -  Muscle and nerve testing will be done.\n\n             -  During the above testing, sensors will be worn on the forehead that use invisible\n                light to indirectly measure blood flow and blood oxygen content of the brain.  In\n                addition, sensors may be worn the fingers that measure how the skin conducts\n                electricity.  A chest strap that measures heart beats will also be worn.  These\n                measures are safe and provide information about the nervous system responds to\n                physical and/or mental challenges.\n\n        -  Tests will be done that measure memory, attention, vocabulary, problem solving, and\n           planning skills.\n\n        -  A bone density and body composition measured (scanned) by the machine called DEXA. DEXA\n           scans, like x-rays, are painless, and involve exposure to very small amounts of\n           radiation.\n\n        -  Images of the brain will be taken using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).  Magnetic\n           resonance imaging (MRI) is a procedure that allows doctors to look inside the body by\n           using a scanner that sends out a strong magnetic field and radio waves.\n\n      All of these test are done for this study and will not be used to diagnose or treat any\n      medical problems.\n\n      The expected length of participation is approximately six hours total, over the course of 4\n      separate visits."
