Patients will\n      receive chemotherapy with cisplatin + docetaxel or customized therapy for 3 cycles (60 days\n      with gefitinib) before surgery.\n\n      Every 4 months for 3 years and then every 6 months for 2 years following surgery, subjects\n      will be assessed by the investigator for adverse events related to study drug, documentation\n      of post study therapies received, DFS, and survival.\n\n      - Periodic evaluations of the trial data will be conducted by an independent data monitoring\n      committee to ensure subject safety and the validity and scientific merit of the study.\n\n      Assuming that the study is not stopped at the planned futility analyses or for safety\n      reasons, the final analysis will take place after the targeted number of events\n      (pathological complete response) is reached, which is estimated to take place 24 months post\n      study initiation.\n\n      - The pathological complete response (pCR)in the two groups will be computed in the ITT\n      populations and compared by means of the chi-square test without continuity correction. For\n      exploratory purposes, a multivariate logistic regression model will be fitted to the data,\n      with the pCR as the response variable and treatment (standard/ experimental) and\n      histo/molecular subgroup as covariate. The heterogeneity of the relative efficacy of the\n      tailored approach in the various subgroups (=subgroup analysis) will be evaluated by\n      including in the model the appropriate set of treatment-by-subgroup interaction terms, using\n      the standard likelihood ratio test. Time-to-event analyses (DFS and OS) will use standard\n      Kaplan-Meier estimators (with the Log-rank test) and semi-parametric PH  regression models.\n      Safety will be summarized based on adverse events, vital signs and laboratory assessments. A\n      group sequential design is used to compare the Overall Survival in the two study arms."
