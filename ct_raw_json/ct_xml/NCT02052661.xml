      The purpose of this study is to assess the long-term persistence of immunity to hepatitis B
      in adolescents aged 12-13 years who were vaccinated with four doses of Infanrix™-Hexa in
      infancy and to assess the anamnestic response, immunogenicity, safety and reactogenicity of
      a single challenge dose of the hepatitis B vaccine Engerix™-B Kinder.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects' parent(s)/LAR(s) who, in the opinion of the investigator, can and will
             comply with the requirements of the protocol (e.g. completion of the diary cards,
             return for follow-up visit).

          -  A male or female between the ages of 12 to 13 (from and including the 12th birthday,
             up to but excluding the 14th birthday) at the time of enrolment.

          -  Subjects with documented evidence of previous vaccination with four consecutive doses
             of Infanrix hexa as part of routine vaccination in Germany: three doses of primary
             vaccination received by 9 months of age and one booster dose received between 11 and
             18 months of age.

          -  Written informed consent obtained from the parents/LAR(s) of the subject.

               -  In addition to the informed consent that will be signed by the parents/LAR(s),
                  written informed assent of the subject will be sought.

          -  Healthy subjects as established by medical history and clinical examination before
             entering into the study.

          -  Female subjects of non-childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study.

               -  Non-childbearing potential is defined as pre-menarche, current tubal ligation,
                  hysterectomy, ovariectomy or post-menopause.

          -  Female subjects of childbearing potential may be enrolled in the study, if the
             subject:

               -  has practiced adequate contraception for 30 days prior to vaccination, and

               -  has a negative pregnancy test on the day of vaccination, and

               -  has agreed to continue adequate contraception during the entire treatment period
                  and for 2 months after completion of the vaccination series.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Child in care.

          -  Use of any investigational or non-registered product (drug or vaccine) other than the
             study vaccine within 30 days preceding the dose of study vaccine, or planned use

          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs at any time during the study
             period (e.g. infliximab).

          -  Chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days in total) of immunosuppressants
             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the vaccination. Inhaled
             and topical steroids are allowed.

          -  Administration of any chronic drug therapy to be continued during the study period.

          -  Planned administration/administration of a vaccine not foreseen by the study protocol
             during the period starting from 30 days before and ending 30 days after the HBV
             challenge dose, with the exception of tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid and
             acellular pertussis (dTpa) vaccine, which can be given as part of routine vaccination
             practice.

          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study
             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a
             non-investigational vaccine/product (pharmaceutical product or device).

          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component
             of the vaccine.

          -  Major congenital defects or serious chronic illness including thrombocytopenia and

                  or ≥ 38.0°C on rectal route. The preferred route for recording temperature in
                  this study will be axillary.

               -  Subjects with a minor illness (such as mild diarrhoea, mild upper respiratory
                  infection) without fever may, be enrolled at the discretion of the investigator.
