This study is important for establishing a baseline to analyze results obtained\n      in MS patients (another dedicated study is performed in parallel in MS patients). The study\n      will be conducted over one year in a cohort of healthy subjects. The MSRV RNA level,\n      MSRV-Env protein levels, reverse transcriptase activity, inflammatory markers assessed by\n      cytokines levels will be analysed to define control levels in the normal population and\n      their variation during one year. The data obtained in this study in healthy controls will be\n      compared to those obtained in a parallel similar study, GN-E-002, conducted in different\n      types of MS patients."
