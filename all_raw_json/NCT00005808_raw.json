Determine the optimal dosage with the least toxicity of lutetium texaphyrin as well as\n      the length of time following its systemic injection that provides the maximum differential\n      in drug uptake between the target dysplastic squamous cells and normal squamous epithelium\n      when given to patients with cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).\n\n      II. Determine, by histomorphometry, the photodynamic light dose that demonstrates the\n      greatest treatment selectivity between normal cervical epithelium and CIN with the least\n      amount of cervical pain and necrosis.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of lutetium texaphyrin (part 1) followed by a\n      dose-escalation study of light fluence (part 2).\n\n      Part 1: Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV over 5-20 minutes. Patients undergo in vivo\n      tissue assessment by spectrometer at 0, 1, 3, 5, 12, and 24 hours and loop electrical\n      excision procedure (LEEP) at 24 hours after lutetium texaphyrin infusion.\n\n      Part 2: Patients receive lutetium texaphyrin IV over 5-20 minutes. A laser delivers 730 nm\n      of light to the cervix for 4, 8, or 16 minutes. Patients undergo LEEP at 4, 8, or 12 hours\n      after exposure of the cervix to the light source.\n\n      Cohorts of 9 patients receive escalating doses of lutetium texaphyrin (part 1) and then\n      light fluence (part 2) until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of each is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 9 patients experience dose-limiting\n      toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 48 hours, weekly for 1 month, and then at 4 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 54 patients will be accrued for this study."
