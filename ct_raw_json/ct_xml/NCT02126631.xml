  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to compare the new Carnation Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System, a
      patch monitoring system, with the Holter monitoring system.   Holters represent the current
      standard for continuous recording of the ECG over extended periods.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is to simplify the system of recording ECGs. Carnation
      Ambulatory Monitoring (CAM) System is a small patch system that can be worn during most
      activities include showering.  Each patient will be his or her own control, and will wear
      the CAM and Holter systems simultaneously for 24 hours. Both systems will then be sent out
      for analysis.

    <description>ECG signal quality = scoring the ability of each system to record electrical activity from the atrium (P-waves). The Physician Event Committee will independently score the P-waves from all recordings, using the following scale: Excellent, Good, Fair, Poor, Non-existent.  Diagnostic yield will also be assessed.</description>

    <description>Secondary outcome measures will include Human Factors performance of the 2 systems, which will be scored and compared in the following areas and duration of patch adherence: skin irritation, comfort, contact and stability.</description>
