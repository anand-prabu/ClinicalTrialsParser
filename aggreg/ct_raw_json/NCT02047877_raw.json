The hormones IL-10 and IL-12p70 are cytokines, special\n      hormones cells use to communicate with each other during inflammation or infection.\n      Cytokines can be measured in mucous and blood.  The balance of one cytokine compared to\n      another help doctors to understand how people respond differently to infection.\n      Unfortunately, the amount of IL-10 and IL-12p70 is not known in children, especially\n      children with a lung infection.  In addition, we do not know if the balance of these\n      cytokines differ in various regions of the lung.  We believe the balance of IL-10 and\n      IL-12p70 is similar whether measured in the upper or lower airways."
