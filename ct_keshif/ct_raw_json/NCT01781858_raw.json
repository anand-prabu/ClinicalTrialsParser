            "textblock": "The course of both pulmonary embolism (PE) and one of its more relevant late complications,\n      i.e. chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) is still substantially unknown.\n\n      Recent evidence has shown that the incidence of CTEPH is higher than previously believed,\n      but this has not been confirmed by other studies. A clear link between PE and CTEPH has been\n      questioned by some experts. A great number of patients affected by PE persistently have\n      residual chronic thromboembolic material the meaning of which is a matter of debate.  The\n      evidence sustaining a link between chronic residual PE and subsequent PE recurrences or\n      CTEPH is insufficient.\n\n      Thus, a nationwide, multicentre, prospective cohort study was designed with the following\n      aims:\n\n        1. to ascertain the actual incidence of symptomatic CTEPH after a first episode of acute\n           PE;\n\n        2. to ascertain the actual incidence of venous thromboembolic (VTE) recurrences after a\n           first episode of acute PE;\n\n        3. to evaluate  whether a relation exists between chronic residual PE and CTEPH\n\n        4. to evaluate  whether a relation exists between chronic residual PE and VTE recurrences;\n\n        5. to evaluate  whether a relation exists between persistent right ventricular dysfunction\n           and CTEPH;\n\n        6. to evaluate  whether a relation exists between persistent right ventricular dysfunction\n           and PE recurrences.\n\n      For each enrolling centre, consecutive outpatients or inpatients with an objectively\n      diagnosed first acute PE episode are considered eligible."
