  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High prevalence of obesity in children has increased associated complications such as type 2
      diabetes, hypertension and fatty  liver disease. Dietitians develop a meal plan that
      restricts caloric intake by estimating the resting and total daily energy
      expenditures.Estimation of energy needs is most commonly done using predictive equations.
      Reliable and valid energy requirements can be obtained using a traditional metabolic system,
      however this is an expensive option. Handheld indirect calorimeters may be a good
      alternative to measure energy needs. Several studies have been conducted to determine the
      validity and accuracy of handheld calorimeters in adults and health children, however, to
      the best of our knowledge, there are no such studies in the overweight and obese pediatric
      population.

      The purpose of this study is to validate a handheld indirect calorimeter against a
      traditional metabolic system in overweight and obese children.

      If handheld calorimeters can accurately measure resting energy expenditure in overweight and
      obese adolescents, dietitians will have an opportunity to tailor pediatric weight management
      interventions based on parameters that are unique to each individual.
