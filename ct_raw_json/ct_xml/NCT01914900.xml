  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study of preoperative chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and
      5-fluorouracil (TPF) in locally advanced resectable oral cavity squamous cell cancer. The
      aim is to improve the rate of pathological complete response to induction chemotherapy in a
      molecular enriched population, consisting of patients with tumour harbouring a functional
      p53 protein and/or showing low expression of beta-tubulin II.
