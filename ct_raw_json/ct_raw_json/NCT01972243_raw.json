It is important to\n      identify patients, in whom the recurrence risk is lower than the expected bleeding risk, and\n      who will not benefit from long term anticoagulation. By use of a scoring model (Vienna\n      Prediction Model), patients can be stratified according to their recurrence risk based on\n      their sex, location of VTE and D-Dimer. Before implementation in routine care, an\n      independent validation is required. Patients with unprovoked VTE will stop anticoagulation\n      after 3-7 months and the recurrence risk will be estimated by use of the Vienna Prediction\n      Model. Low risk patients with a score of <180 will be included and will be left untreated.\n      Patients with a high score will not be included and their management will follow current\n      guidelines. Follow-up will be two years and the endpoint will be recurrent symptomatic VTE."
