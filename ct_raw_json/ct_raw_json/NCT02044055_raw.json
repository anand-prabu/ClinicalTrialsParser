Nucleosides\n      analogues, lamivudine, telbivudine, or nucleotides analogues, tenofovir DF decrease HBV\n      mother-to-child transmission risk, and are recommended in Guidelines (EASL 2012) for\n      pregnant women with HBV DNA above 1,000 000 I.U/mL. HDV is a defective virus using HBs Ag\n      for its own replication. HDV-HBV co-infection is a re-emerging infectious disease in western\n      countries, due to immigration of people coming from endemic areas. Nucleosides analogues\n      have only a minor impact on quantitative HBs Ag level (Boyd A et al. AIDS Research and Human\n      Retroviruses 2013). Data about vertical HDV transmission are old (Rizzetto, et al. J Med\n      Virol 1982), before a large use of nucleosides/nucleotides analogues in HBV infected\n      pregnant women, justifying a new study."
