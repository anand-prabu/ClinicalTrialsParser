The primary outcome will be survival with microbiological\n      eradication of Ureaplasma defined as survival to discharge or transfer with 3 negative\n      cultures obtained post-therapy. Secondary outcomes will include physiologic BPD at 36 weeks\n      post-menstrual age (PMA), overall mortality, incidence of co-morbidities of prematurity such\n      as intraventricular hemorrhage, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis,\n      bacterial and fungal nosocomial infection, pulmonary air leak, patent ductus arteriosus,\n      retinopathy of prematurity, number of days of positive pressure ventilation, number of days\n      of oxygen supplementation, use of postnatal steroids, and use of non-study antibiotics. At 6\n      and 18 months adjusted age, a pulmonary outcome questionnaire will be administered by phone\n      or in person interview. At 18-22 months adjusted age, neurodevelopmental outcomes will be\n      assessed by 1) Bayley Scale of Infant and Toddler Development, 3rd edition (BSID-III); 2)\n      Amiel-Tison neurologic examination; 3) Gross Motor Function Classification System; and 4)\n      medical record review for hearing impairment with or without amplification and vision\n      impairment (vision <20/200)."
