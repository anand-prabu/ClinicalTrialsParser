  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be looking at the clinical efficacy of using a intranasal evaporative
      cooling device in providing relief of the symptoms of migraine and cluster headache. It will
      involve using a nasal catheter to spray a liquid coolant into the nasal cavity where it
      evaporates and removes heat from the tissue, thereby cooling the tissue and the blood
      vessels which supply blood to the brain. This cooling effect will cause the blood vessels to
      constrict and it is thought that this may provide symptomatic relief in both these forms of
      headache. 10 migraine patients and 5 cluster headache patients will be enrolled in the study
      and will receive 10 treatments each, for a maximum of 20 minutes at a time. They will be
      monitored during the treatment and for two hours afterwards to assess headache severity and
      side effects. There will be a further follow up 2 months after the last treatment to assess
      for longer term side effects from the treatment.

    <description>When a participant presents with headache, baseline assessments will be performed for pain, nausea and other recognised symptoms of migraine/cluster headache. The Rhinochill device will be used to provide transnasal cooling for a period of 20 minutes then reassessment of pain and other symptoms will be undertaken.</description>

    <description>The RhinoChill device will be used to locally cool the posterior nasopharynx, surrounding tissues and vasculature using a variable cooling flow rate based on patient comfort and tolerance, for a maximum of 20 minutes. Local anaesthetic spray will be administered to patients if the nasal catheters or cooling is poorly tolerated.</description>
