The population selected for this study, adult nongeriatric patients and\n      pediatric patients (excluding the very young) represents a patient population that may\n      benefit from vapocoolant spray. This is a patient population that according to the treating\n      health care provider already requires venipuncture for \"blood draw\" but not intravenous\n      cannulation. Because venipuncture is a painful procedure, vapocoolant may confer benefit for\n      the relief of pain."
