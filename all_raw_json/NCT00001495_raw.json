            "textblock": "Irinotecan (CPT-11) is a promising camptothecin analogue with activity in solid tumors.  In\n      Phase I studies using short intravenous infusion schedules, the predominant drug toxicities\n      have been gastrointestinal, such as diarrhea, and myelosuppression.  In animal studies,\n      prolonged infusion schedules followed by short drug-free intervals have resulted in\n      preservation of antitumor activity and decreased drug toxicity.  Therefore, we propose to\n      examine a 96 hour infusion schedule of irinotecan alternating with 72 hour drug-free\n      intervals in patients with solid tumors in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose of\n      this regimen.  The duration of these treatments will be escalated in our Phase I study until\n      patients are receiving therapy for 2 out of every 3 weeks.  Standard Phase I drug toxicity\n      and tumor response information will be monitored and the pharmacokinetics of irinotecan and\n      its active metabolite, SN-38 will also be examined.  We will also attempt to monitor the\n      intracellular molecular effects of SN-38 therapy in blood, bone marrow, and, whenever\n      possible, tumor tissue."
