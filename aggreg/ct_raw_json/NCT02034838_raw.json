However, ritonavir, when\n      used at low doses (up to 100mg) does not have HIV activity, but will enhance (boost) the\n      blood concentrations of other drugs like atazanavir.\n\n      Recently, a study showed that taking 50mg of ritonavir administered in an oral solution led\n      to similar blood concentrations of atazanavir than when given with 100mg of ritonavir.\n      Potential benefits associated with a lower dose of ritonavir may include a reduction of side\n      effects such as upset stomach and an improvement in cholesterol level.  This study will look\n      at the amount of atazanavir into your blood when given with ritonavir in a tablet\n      formulation at 50mg or 100mg with standard atazanavir dose (300mg)."
