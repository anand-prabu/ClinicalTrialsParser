    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to test whether Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS)
      may alleviate the symptoms of Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS). The investigators will
      test various methods of TMS in a small pilot study to investigate what methods may have
      clinical potential. This is a small pilot study to determine feasibility and signal to
      potentially inform future trials.
