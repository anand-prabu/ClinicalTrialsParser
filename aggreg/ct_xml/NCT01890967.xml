  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to define the amount and duration of cholesterol lowering and to
      assess the safety and tolerability of different dose regimens of LY3015014 in participants
      with high cholesterol. The study will also investigate how the body processes the drug and
      how the drug affects the body. Participants will remain on a stable diet and will continue
      taking cholesterol-lowering medications (statins with or without ezetimibe). After signing
      the informed consent document, the participant will complete a screening/run-in period that
      will last at most 8 weeks. Then, the treatment period will last approximately 16 weeks.
      After the treatment period, the participants will complete a  follow-up period lasting
      approximately 8 weeks for a total study duration ranging from approximately 25 to 32 weeks.
