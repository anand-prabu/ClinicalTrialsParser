      -  To estimate the incidence rates of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD)
           in adult, EBV seropositive, kidney alone transplant recipients treated with belatacept
           at the time of transplantation

        -  To estimate the incidence rates of PTLD in adult, EBV seropositive, kidney alone
           transplant recipients treated with calcineurin inhibitors (CNI)-based regimens at the
           time of transplantation

        -  To compare the PTLD incidence rates in adult, EBV seropositive, kidney alone transplant
           recipients treated with belatacept to the rates in  adult, EBV seropositive, kidney
           alone transplant recipients treated with CNI-based regimens at the time of
           transplantation
