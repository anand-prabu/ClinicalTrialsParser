      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a home visit by an Occupational Therapist
      is effective in reducing the rehospitalization rates in elderly patients after hospital
      discharge.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: The hospitalization of the elderly is a frequent event that is associated with
      complications including loss of functionality, which makes it difficult for the person to
      reinstate to their original context after discharge, increasing the likelihood of
      rehospitalization.

      Objective : To describe and compare the impact of home-based intervention by  Occupational
      Therapists (OT) in the likelihood of rehospitalization at 6 months versus usual care in
      persons older than 60 years after discharge.

      Design : Randomized controlled trial in medical units of the Hospital Clínico de la
      Universidad de Chile (HCUCh) and Hospital de la Fuerza Aérea de Chile (HFACH)

      Patients: Two hundred and six patients aged 60 years or older admitted for acute or
      decompensated chronic disease to either HCUCH or HFACH, with a life expectancy greater than
      6 months, not institutionalized prior to hospitalization or discharge destination , and
      provided that they have a person of reference after hospital discharge .

      Methods: The control group consists of the usual care regarding post discharge patients, in
      comparison to the experimental group, which , besides the usual discharge plan, considers a
      home visit from OT on 2 occasions for 6 months, who will apply the following plan of action:
      Compliance assessment of pharmacological and non-pharmacological indications, applying a
      checklist of home safety evaluation and structuring of an occupational routine, education of
      stimulation strategies, education in recognition of warning signs and proper use of health
      services. Patients will be recruited between 24 and 48 hours prior to hospital discharge
      where they will be invited to participate. Informed consent will be retrieved, and
      demographic information of patients and pre- hospitalization functional backgrounds will be
      collected during this period, and at discharge by means of Barthel Index (independence /
      dependence in basic activities of daily living (ADL)), Lawton &amp; Brody Scale (ADL
      instrumental), Questionnaire Pfeffer Functional Activities ( FAQ), Confusion Assessment
      Method (CAM) (delirium at discharge), Pfeiffer Questionnaire (Short Portable Mental Status
      Questionnaire: SPMSQ ) (cognition), and Geriatrics Cumulative Illness Rating Scale disease (
      CIRS -G) (comorbidity).  Both groups will receive telephone follow-up at 4, 12 and 24 weeks
      after hospital discharge with intent to evaluate functionality and rehospitalization.
      Allocators,  medical team giving hospital discharge, pone interviewers, and data analysts
      will be blind of the intervention allocation.

      Expected Results: the home-based intervention after discharge with OT reduce the rate of
      rehospitalization in at least 40 % at 6 months in people over 60 years compared with usual
      care .
