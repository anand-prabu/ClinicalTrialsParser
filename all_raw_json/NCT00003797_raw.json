Monoclonal antibodies such as trastuzumab can locate tumor\n      cells and either kill them or deliver tumor-killing substances to them without harming\n      normal cells. Combining monoclonal antibody therapy with chemotherapy may kill more tumor\n      cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gemcitabine and trastuzumab in\n      treating patients who have metastatic cancer of the pancreas that overexpresses HER2/neu."

Patients\n      receive trastuzumab IV over 90 minutes once during week 1 and trastuzumab IV over 30-90\n      minutes once weekly during weeks 2-8.\n\n      Patients with stable or responding disease receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once\n      weekly during weeks 1-3 and trastuzumab IV over 30 minutes once weekly during weeks 1-4.\n      Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 41 patients will be accrued for this study over 18-24\n      months."
