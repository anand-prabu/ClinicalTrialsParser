Patients with aggressive and indolent lymphoma are further stratified as to being\n      refractory (no complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to initial therapy) vs\n      recurrent (CR or PR to initial therapy); i.e, the following subcategories are used:\n\n        -  Stratum I:Refractory aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL)\n\n        -  Stratum II:Recurrent aggressive NHL\n\n        -  Stratum III: Refractory indolent NHL\n\n        -  Stratum IV: Recurrent indolent NHL\n\n        -  Stratum V: Mantle cell NHL All patients receive irinotecan intravenously every 21 days.\n           Patients achieving CR or PR receive 6 courses. Patients may receive bone marrow\n           transplantation after at least 2 courses.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 18 patients per stratum; if at least three\n      patients respond, an additional 25 patients will be accrued for a total of 43 evaluable\n      patients per stratum. The total number accrued will be 90-215 over a period of approximately\n      3 years."
