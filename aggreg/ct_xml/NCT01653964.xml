  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this work is to determine if half-dose Molecular Breast Imaging
      (MBI) performed with 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi with or without Wide Beam Reconstruction applied
      can achieve image quality and diagnostic accuracy non-inferior to that of standard MBI
      performed with 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent implementation of dose reduction strategies for Molecular Breast Imaging now allow
      performance of MBI at an administered dose of 8 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi, which is reduced from
      the previously used doses of 20-30 mCi. In order to safely introduce MBI as a screening
      modality, we aim to perform MBI using 4 mCi Tc-99m sestamibi. An image processing algorithm
      called Wide Beam Reconstruction (WBR) has been tailored for MBI technology with the goal of
      allowing either the current administered dose or current acquisition time to be reduced by
      half.

    <measure>Compare the diagnostic accuracy (sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, LR(T+), LR(T-), diagnostic OR, AUC/concordance) of 8 mCi molecular breast imaging (MBI), 4 mCi MBI, and 4 mCi MBI with Wide Beam Reconstruction (WBR).</measure>

    <description>A timely clinical interpretation will be performed of the 8 mCi MBI. A new finding on MBI will be worked up according to the established standard of care.
Following collection of all study MBIs, three study radiologists will provide a blinded interpretation of the following three acquisition settings for each patient: 8 mCi MBI, 4 mCi MBI, and 4 mCi MBI with WBR processing applied. The acquisitions will be anonymized and presented in randomized order at three separate reading sessions with 4-6 weeks between each session.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Subgroup 1, Patients with breast lesions:

        -At least one breast lesion detected by mammogram, ultrasound or breast MRI that measures
        &lt; 20 mm in greatest dimension, presents as a mass, is considered suspicious or highly
        suggestive of malignancy according to the Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System Atlas
        criteria (BIRADS 4 or 5), and is scheduled for core-needle biopsy or surgical biopsy.

        OR

        -At least one breast lesion that measures between &gt; 10 mm but &lt; 20 mm in greatest
        dimension, presents as a mass, is biopsy-proven as malignant, and is scheduled for
        surgical resection.

        AND

          -  Age &gt; 40 years

          -  Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized

        Subgroup 2, Patients without known breast lesions:

          -  Negative screening mammogram performed at Mayo Clinic Rochester within 15 months
             prior to performance of study MBI

          -  No signs or symptoms of breast disease

          -  Age &gt; 40 years

          -  Negative pregnancy test, postmenopausal, or surgically sterilized

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Vacuum-assisted or excisional biopsy has been performed prior to the study MBI.
             Reason: these types of biopsies are more likely to remove all of the tumor

          -  MBI is performed after biopsy and neo-adjuvant chemotherapy is planned prior to
             surgery. Reason: true tumor size will not be able to be ascertained from the final
             pathology findings

          -  Breast implants.  Reason: cases with breast implants will be easily identifiable on
             blinded interpretation to take place at the study end

          -  Suspected that breasts will not fit in the MBI field of view. Reason: cases that
             require tiled views or additional views will be easily identifiable on blinded
             interpretation to take place at the study end

          -  Only one breast remaining. Reason: unilateral cases will be easily identifiable on
             blinded interpretation to take place at the study end; injection timing is designed
             for bilateral views

          -  Pregnancy test (if necessary) is not negative, or the patient is unable to complete
             the pregnancy test

          -  Physically unable to sit upright and still remain still during two consecutive MBI
             studies over the course of a 2-hour period.
