In order to determine whether,\n      or to what extent, genetic profiling of venous stasis ulcers can stratify patients according\n      to their potential for disease progression or healing, and guide preventive strategies and\n      levels of therapeutic interventions, the study will involve retrospective genetic profiling\n      of patients with a healed or persistent venous stasis ulcer as a means of determining the\n      efficacy of current therapies, and to establish a future prospective evaluation of treatment\n      algorithms based on genetic phenotype and variation.  Results obtained from the 2\n      aforementioned groups of participants will be compared with those of a control group of\n      participants who have no history of venous ulcer nor peripheral vascular disease.\n\n      ."
