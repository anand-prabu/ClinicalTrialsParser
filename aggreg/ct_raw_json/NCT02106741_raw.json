            "textblock": "Acupressure is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) technique based on a philosophy similar\n      to that of acupuncture. It involves the application of physical pressure on different\n      acupuncture points (acupoints). One advantage of acupressure is the ability to\n      self-administer the treatment. Acupressure is also a viable alternative to acupuncture in\n      situations where patients: (1) cannot come to the clinic to receive an acupuncture\n      treatment; (2) when a more frequent intervention is needed; or (3) where needle phobia or\n      safety concerns are an issue.\n\n      The objective of this study is to evaluate the validity and feasibility of teaching\n      acupressure interventions using an acupressure educator for the management of symptoms\n      related to low back pain.\n\n      Specific aims:\n\n        1. To examine the effect of 6-weeks of relaxation acupressure (RA) compared to a regime of\n           stimulating acupressure (SA) or wait-list control (WL) on fatigue and sleep quality as\n           assessed by Brief Fatigue Inventory and wrist-worn accelerometry (sleep efficiency).\n\n        2. To explore the effect of 6-weeks of RA compared to a regime of SA or WL on for chronic\n           low back pain in terms of reduced pain and improved function."
