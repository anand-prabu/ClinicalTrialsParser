  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to increase survival of patients with locally advanced
      triple-negative breast cancer using two consequent induction preoperative chemotherapy
      regimens.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Compared to other breast cancer subtypes, patients with triple-negative breast cancer have a
      lower recurrence-free and overall survival, regardless of disease stage at diagnosis. That's
      why new approaches to treatment of this aggressive breast cancer subtype are extremely
      anticipated.

      One of the ways to improve the results of treatment of locally advanced triple-negative
      breast cancer is intensification of induction preoperative chemotherapy regimens. Elevation
      of the rate of pathological complete responses after completion of intensification induction
      preoperative chemotherapy enables to decrease the stage and increase survival of this
      aggressive breast cancer subtype. We hope to achieve more clinical and pathological
      treatment responses than with standard chemotherapy regimens and therefore to improve
      treatment outcomes of this extremely adverse group of patients.

             adenocarcinoma of the breast
