The efficacy of cognitive behavior therapy associated to nicotine replacement in\n      tobacco cessation has not yet been demonstrated.\n\n      Objective: Evaluate if cognitive behavior therapy during six weeks associated to nicotine\n      replacement for twelve weeks is able to contribute to tobacco cessation at the end of 52\n      weeks.\n\n      Methods: Multicentre, open-label, and pragmatic randomized controlled trial will include 334\n      patients. Analysis will follow intention-to-treat principle.\n\n      Patients older than 18 years old and who had smoked at least 5 cigarettes in the past year\n      before randomization will be included.\n\n      All of them will receive nicotine replacement therapy with patches and gum. They will be\n      randomized 1:1 ratio to attend or not cognitive behavior therapy once a week for the first\n      six weeks of the treatment. Every two weeks all of the patients will be evaluated by a\n      physician in order to access any adverse effects from the nicotine replacement.\n\n      All patients will have carbon monoxide levels accessed at baseline and after 6 weeks.\n      Telephonic interview will be done at 16, 28, and 52 weeks to access the rates of tobacco\n      cessation, relapses episodes and abstinence maintenance."
