  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The
      mechanisms that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. Some studies have
      shown that there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during
      expiration (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea. The
      investigators will assess the viscoelastic properties of the pharyngeal airway and its role
      in PEN.

      In obstructive sleep apnea, the upper airway recurrently closes during sleep. The mechanisms
      that lead to airway closure are not completely understood. Some studies have shown that
      there is progressive narrowing of the pharyngeal airway across breaths during expiration
      (Progressive Expiratory Narrowing, PEN) preceding an obstructive apnea.

      The investigators will test how the viscoelastic properties of the airway influence PEN. To
      this end, the investigators will visualize the pharynx of sleep apnea patients using a thin
      endoscope and will induce central apneas during sleep. Pharyngeal cross-sectional area will
      be recorded during incremental changes in pharyngeal pressure during  central apneas.

    <description>The investigators will determine elasticity of the upper airway during induced central apneas by dividing the change in airway pressure by the change in airway cross-sectional area.
The time frame for the outcome of this study is equal to the duration of the induced central sleep apnea (usually less than 40 seconds).</description>
