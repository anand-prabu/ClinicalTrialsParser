Furthermore, it would be of great importance if lean women who suffer from\n      PCOD would be revealed to shere cardiovascular risks with their more overweight peers.\n\n      Patients - women who will be diagnosed with PCOD following their initial referal to our\n      fertility clinic. Controls - normal ovulatory women who approached our fertility clinic due\n      to either unexplained or male factor infertility.\n\n      Workup - history for menstrual pattern; Clinical evaluation for features of\n      hyperandrogenism; ultrasonographic documentation of ovarian morphology; follicular phase\n      hormonal profile for validation of the diagnosis and for ruling out other pathologies which\n      may cause anovulation.\n\n      Liver profiling - The following blood tests will be used for the biochemical profiling:\n      fasting glucose and insulin, CRP, HDL-cholesterol, triglycerides, AST, ALT, GGT, LDH,\n      alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, direct bilirubin, ferritin, HBA1C and micro albumin\n      ratio.\n\n      FibroScan\u00ae will be used to measure liver stiffness."
