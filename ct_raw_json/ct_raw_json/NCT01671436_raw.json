            "textblock": "Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a serious, costly and highly prevalent condition.\n      However, currently available treatment options have limited efficacy. The aim of this pilot\n      study is to determine whether patients suffering from MDD who have not responded to at least\n      one antidepressant trial may actively engage in a novel group therapy, Central Meditation\n      and Imagery Therapy (CMIT). Preliminary results with individual patients suggest that CMIT\n      techniques may have benefit for major depression. The purpose of this trial is to assess the\n      feasibility of a group form of CMIT for the treatment of major depression. The trial will\n      also seek to identify neurophysiological and cardiovascular predictors of treatment\n      response.\n\n      In this study, 10 subjects with major depressive disorder will receive antidepressant\n      treatment augmentation with group meditation and mental imagery therapy for a total of 12\n      weeks, as well as daily meditation practice. Group sessions will also involve gentle yogic\n      stretches. The subjects will be limited to those who remain depressed despite at least one\n      trial of antidepressant medication. Changes in brain activity and heart rate variability\n      will be measured at three time points utilizing electroencephalography (EEG) and pulse\n      monitors. Depression symptoms will be measured at several time points using questionnaires\n      and objective measures. Participation will require a total of 15 visits for weekly therapy\n      and the measurements. Two-month follow-up questionnaires will be mailed to the subjects\n      after study end to assess durability of any improvements in depressive symptoms."
