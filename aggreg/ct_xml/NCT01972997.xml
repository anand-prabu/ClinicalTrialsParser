  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study investigating the effect of various SENSIMED Triggerfish sensor lens sizes
      on the recorded IOP related patterns in 10 healthy volunteers. Each volunteers receives 4
      24-hours sessions of pattern recording on one selected eye (study eye). Each of the sensor
      lens sizes is placed on the eye in the different sessions. Subjects visit the study site for
      installation and removal of the device and accompanying exams, but remain ambulatory during
      the recording.
