      This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility of a low glycemic load diet in patients
      with stage I-III colon cancer. A low glycemic load diet includes foods that have low scores
      on the glycemic index. The glycemic index is a scale that measures how much a certain
      carbohydrate causes a person's blood sugar to rise. A low glycemic load diet may help
      decrease the chance of cancer coming back and improve the survival in patients with colon
      cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the feasibility of following a low or medium glycemic load diet in patients
      with stage I-III (local-regional) colon cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine patient-reported acceptability of diet. II. To determine nutritionist
      resources utilized. III. To evaluate the effect of lowering dietary glycemic load on body
      mass index (BMI), lipid metabolism and pro-oncogenic intermediaries of cellular metabolism.

      OUTLINE: Patients are sequentially enrolled in 1 of 4 possible cohorts as needed based on
      the feasibility of the prior cohort.

      COHORT 1: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every 2 weeks with phone contact on the alternating
      weeks) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 2: Patients follow a low glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      (contact with nutritionist in person every week) for 12 weeks.

      COHORT 3: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with standard dietary intervention for
      12 weeks.

      COHORT 4: Patients follow a medium glycemic load diet with intensified dietary intervention
      for 12 weeks.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Individual patient compliance, defined by following assigned target glycemic load index &gt;= 75% of the time between weeks 4 and 12</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to week 12</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This compliance rate will be determined through conducting a 24 hour telephone recall, every 2 weeks at random and calculating the glycemic load. For each dose cohort, the number and percentage of patients who are compliant will be summarized, with 90% confidence interval that accounts for the two-stage design.</description>

    <description>Results of the acceptability survey will be tabulated and described (the questions use a 7 point likert scale), separately for each cohort.</description>

    <measure>Hours of nutritionist time per week</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>Separately for each cohort, serum levels will be summarized descriptively and graphically across the follow-up period. Paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed rank tests will be used to compare baseline vs. post-intervention levels of all biomarkers.

    <description>Patients will be contacted weekly, in person, by a nutritionist . Participants will take part in a cooking demonstration at the time of their initial visit. The demonstration will be hands-on and participants will be able to sample foods and recipes. In addition to grocery shopping information, participants will be accompanied by a nutritionist to their local grocery store to practice new shopping habits for their target dietary glycemic load. Each participant will also receive weekly random phone calls to assess his or her progress.</description>
