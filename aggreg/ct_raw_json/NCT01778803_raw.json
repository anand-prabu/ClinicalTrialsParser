This clinical study is comprised of 2 parts: Phase I (Dose\n      Escalation) and Phase Ib (Expansion).  The purpose of this study is to assess assess the\n      safety (including the recommended phase 2 dose), the pharmacokinetics, and the anti-cancer\n      activity of defactinib (VS-6063) when administered in combination with paclitaxel.\n      Pharmacodynamic effects will also be examined in tumor biopsies."
