  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to document the effectiveness of Cyberknife
      stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) in the treatment of intermediate and high-risk
      localized prostate cancer defined by biochemical Disease-Free Survival (bDFS), using Phoenix
      and American Society of Therapeutic Radiation and Oncology (ASTRO) definitions, at 5 years.

      During the prostate-specific antigen era, an ever-increasing percentage of men with prostate
      cancer have presented with clinically localized, potentially curable disease.  Although
      conventional treatment options are potentially curative in selected patients, these
      treatments also have drawbacks, including the risk of negative long-term quality of life
      consequences and serious complications.

      The CyberKnife® system is a type of radiation machine that uses a special system to
      precisely focus large doses of x-rays on the tumor.  The device is designed to concentrate
      large doses of radiation onto the tumor so that injury from radiation to the nearby normal
      tissue will be minimal.

      Patients will be treated with either CyberKnife® Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)
      monotherapy or with prostate/seminal vesicles (SV)/pelvic Intensity Modulated Radiation
      Therapy (IMRT), followed by CyberKnife® SBRT boost.  Treatment will last 4-7 days.
      Patients will complete the QOL questionnaires before treatment.  Questionnaires will also be
      completed during follow-up visits at 1 month, 3 months and every 6 months for five years.
