The study will test the intervention's effectiveness in improving the\n      adolescents' behavior, thinking, mood, and use of substances such as drugs and alcohol.  The\n      study also will look at the effects of the patient on the family.\n\n      The intervention involves training in recognizing symptoms of schizophrenia and in stress\n      management, problem-solving, and social skills. Parents and siblings are included to gain\n      knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.\n\n      The Self-Management Therapy intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in\n      12 sessions over 7-1/2 months. The effects of the intervention on the patient and his/her\n      family are assessed prior to treatment, after 6 sessions, after 12 sessions, and in a\n      follow-up visit 6 months after completion of sessions.\n\n      A child may be eligible for this study if he/she:\n\n      Is 15 to 19 years old and has been diagnosed with schizophrenia."

            "textblock": "To test the effectiveness of a family-centered, community-based, self-management\n      intervention (Self-Management Therapy) for adolescents with schizophrenia. The primary aim\n      is to test its effectiveness in improving the adolescents' level of functioning in role\n      performance, thinking/cognitive processing, behavior towards others, mood, and use of\n      substances.  The second aim is to assess the impact of the intervention on family\n      functioning.  The third aim is to describe the relationships among the process variables of\n      the intervention.\n\n      Nakagawa-Kogan's self-management nursing model, Kanfer's self-regulation theory, and\n      Liberman's theory of stress and vulnerability provide the theoretical basis for the\n      self-management intervention developed specifically for a population with deficits in\n      cognitive processing. The intervention involves training in symptom awareness, stress\n      management skills, problem-solving, and social skills.  Parents and siblings are included to\n      gain knowledge and skills to support the adolescents.\n\n      The adolescent's level of functioning is assessed using the Child and Adolescent Functional\n      Assessment Scale, the Birchwood Early Signs & Symptoms Scale for schizophrenia, and the\n      DISA.  Family Functioning is assessed by computing a Composite Family Functioning Index\n      using weighted scores from the FACES II, Family Apgar, Family Empowerment, and Family Social\n      Support scales. One parent is designated by the family to be the family respondent on the\n      scales. The adolescents are referred to the study by mental health professionals. The\n      intervention is administered in small multiple-family groups in 12 sessions over 7-1/2\n      months.  Data are collected at 4 points in time: at baseline, after 6 intensive sessions,\n      after 6 monthly reinforcement sessions, and 6 months post-intervention. ANCOVA is used to\n      test the study hypotheses.  Multivariate relationships are examined among the process\n      variables of the intervention."
