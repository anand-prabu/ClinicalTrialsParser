Because of the nature of the injury which includes the\n      sympathetic failure, they can not easily get the desired pulse to improve physical fitness.\n\n      Wheelchair rugby in Canada was developed specifically for people with tetraplegia who could\n      not participate in wheelchair basketball. The game combines short, quick races with\n      different aerobic capabilities. Previous studies have shown that participants in wheelchair\n      rugby Improve anaerobic power, oxygen consumption, physical fitness and daily functioning.\n      Wheelchair rugby improves self-confidence and as a result it affects other areas of life.\n      Another study examined sense of self-efficacy, saw improvement in this index for rugby\n      players in a wheelchair at high levels.\n\n      In the present study the investigators aim to examine whether regular participation in\n      wheelchair Rugby for a season has more impact than other routine exercise (table tennis,\n      gym, swimming)."
