  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) is associated with inadequate drainage of the aqueous
      humor via the trabecular meshwork through the Schlemm's canal towards the systemic
      circulation. This may lead to an increase in IOP and may damage the optic nerve. The purpose
      of glaucoma management is to lower IOP in order to prevent progression of the optic
      neuropathy and subsequent visual loss. Firstline treatment usually includes IOP-lowering
      drug therapy. However, if IOP remains uncontrolled and/or the optic nerve damage progresses
      despite controlled IOP, surgery may be indicated. Deep sclerectomy (DS) is a non-penetrating
      surgical procedure for the treatment of open angle glaucoma that allows the enhancement of
      the aqueous outflow by removing part of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal and trabecular
      meshwork. DS was shown to achieve a good control on IOP over the long term.

      The purpose of this study is to assess the 24-hour IOP fluctuation profile recorded with
      Triggerfish in patients with POAG before and after DS.
