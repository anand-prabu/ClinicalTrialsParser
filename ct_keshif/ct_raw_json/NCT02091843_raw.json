            "textblock": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects approximately 30 % of American veterans\n      returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Although the current therapy is effective, a percentage\n      of patients will fail to improve and will develop chronic treatment-resistant PTSD. Patients\n      suffering from PTSD experience intense suffering, lack of productivity and a higher risk of\n      suicide. Unfortunately, combat PTSD has a tendency to be resistant to current treatments.\n\n      The central goal of this project is to develop a new therapeutic strategy involving the\n      placement of intracranial electrodes to treat the symptoms of PTSD. The project is based on\n      recent evidence showing abnormal activity in a specific brain region of PTSD patients,\n      thought to be responsible for the core symptoms of PTSD."
