  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hope to learn whether access to online support and education can help
      people with Bipolar Disorder (BD) better manage their symptoms of depression.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will examine if there is a benefit of an online intervention for persons with
      bipolar diagnoses, and what components appear to be useful. Specifically, the study will
      examine (1) whether exposure to the MoodSwings 2.0 intervention results in decreased
      depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale for Depression (MADRS)
      and (2) whether there is an association between graduated levels of involvement (Level I, 2,
      or 3) and resulting improvement? We expect that those participants assigned to the control
      condition (Level 1, peer discussion board only), will have fewer positive outcomes than
      those in Level 2 (discussion board and psychoeducation) or 3 (discussion board,
      psychoeducation, and interactive psychosocial tools) conditions.

    <measure>Montgomery Asberg Rating Scale (MADRS) for Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The MADRS is a 10-item scale, completed by the clinician to assess symptoms of depression. It is particularly sensitive to changes in depression over time. Joint reliability for the total score across several studies ranged from 0.76 to 0.95, and it is viewed as a reliable and valid measure of depression symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Relapse</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>Yes</safety_issue>
    <description>Relapse or time to intervention will be assessed using Time to Intervention for Mood Episode (TIME), with intervention defined as initiation, discontinuation, or dose adjustment of a treatment, initiation of psychotherapy or ECT, visit to an emergency provider or hospitalization in response to new mood symptoms.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functioning (SF-12)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The SF-12 is a short, multipurpose measure of perceived impairment due to health problems. It is widely used as a short version of the SF-36, and has good validity. The SF-12 yields two risk-adjusted summary scores, impairment perceived as due to physical illness and impairment perceived as due to emotional problems (Ware et al., 1996)</description>

    <measure>Cornell Service Index (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline, 4 months, 8 months, 12 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Use of general medical and psychiatric health services will be collected via the Cornell Service Index (CSI; Sirey et al., 2005). The CSI is a brief assessment of health service use. It has good inter-rater and test-retest reliability and assesses four types of services: outpatient psychiatric or psychological services (e.g., psychotropic medication visits or psychotherapy), outpatient medical services (e.g., visits to medical providers), professional support services (e.g., home health nurse visits, meal delivery), and intensive services (e.g., emergency department visits or hospitalization).</description>

    <description>All groups will have access to asynchronous, moderated discussion boards. Assignment to discussion board will be stratified by randomization group (Level 1, 2 or 3). Level 1 access to the discussion board will serve as our &quot;peer support&quot; control condition, although we do expect some modest benefit from this intervention alone (Mead et al., 2010).
The discussion boards will be moderated by trained clinicians (masters level or higher). Discussion boards will be asynchronous, with all posts screened by the moderator(s) before appearing to the group.</description>

    <description>Online psychoeducation is only available to those randomized to Levels 2 and 3. The core modules of MoodSwings 2.0 will use videos and improved organization of content based on feedback from previous pilot work. Module topic areas include:
What is bipolar disorder? - content about symptoms and diagnosis
Stress and triggers of illness
Medication and the biological basis of bipolar
Depression - symptoms, early detection and helpful strategies
Mania and hypomania - symptoms, early detection and helpful strategies</description>

    <description>Online psychosocial tools are only available to those randomized to Level 3. They include structured mood monitoring, medication monitoring, and life charting visual tools.  There are also interactive worksheets that encourage awareness of negative thoughts and strategies to challenge them, help participants weight the costs and benefits of different behaviors, problem solving and goal setting, and reinforcing self-affirmation. Participants have the opportunity to build a record of personal triggers of illness and illness profile - including early warning signs, and symptoms typically experienced during an episode of illness, as well as a personal &quot;relapse prevention plan.&quot;</description>
