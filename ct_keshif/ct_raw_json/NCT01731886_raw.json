Due to the potential teratogenic\n             properties of lenalidomide, the use of this drug in patients that are pregnant is\n             absolutely contraindicated. Further, all women of childbearing potentialFCBP and\n             sexually active males must agree to avoid conception while participating in this\n             study.
