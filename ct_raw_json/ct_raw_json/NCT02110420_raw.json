Part 1 is a randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and\n      pharmacokinetics of CC-90001 following a single oral dose in healthy subjects. During the\n      course of Part 1, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a\n      treatment phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 5 planned cohorts, each of\n      which will consist of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6\n      subjects will receive a dose of CC 90001 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on\n      the randomization schedule. Administration of study drug at the next higher dose level will\n      not begin until the safety and tolerability of the preceding dose have been evaluated and\n      deemed acceptable by the investigator and sponsor's medical monitor. Part 2 is a randomized,\n      double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and\n      pharmacokinetics of CC-90001 following multiple oral doses in healthy subjects. Only doses\n      that are safe and well tolerated in Part 1 will be administered in Part 2. During the course\n      of Part 2, each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase, a treatment\n      phase and a follow up visit. There will be a total of 5 planned cohorts, each of which will\n      consist of a different dose level, with 8 subjects per cohort. In each cohort, 6 subjects\n      will receive a dose of CC 90001 and 2 subjects will receive placebo depending on the\n      randomization schedule. It is planned for study drug to be administered once daily for up to\n      14 days. Proposed dose levels in Part 2 may be modified and/or eliminated based on data\n      obtained from Part 1; however, the maximum dose administered in Part 2 will not exceed the\n      maximum tolerated dose in Part 1."
