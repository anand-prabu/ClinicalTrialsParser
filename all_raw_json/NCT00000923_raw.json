The purpose of this study\n      is to see if IL-2 can increase the number of CD4 cells (cells of the immune system which\n      fight infection) in HIV-infected patients who have completed ACTG 328.\n\n      HAART is often successful in decreasing viral load (level of HIV in the blood), but these\n      drugs have not been able to restore the immune systems of HIV-infected patients. IL-2 is a\n      substance naturally produced by the body's immune cells. In ACTG 328, IL-2 is tested to see\n      if it can increase the number of CD4 cells and \"boost\" a patient's immune system. This study\n      is a follow-up to ACTG 328 so that patients who are benefiting from IL-2 can continue to\n      take it and patients in the control group who do not receive IL-2 can start taking it."

            "textblock": "HIV disease is characterized by a progressive decline in CD4 cells and an increase in viral\n      burden. Although antiretroviral therapy has been successful in controlling viral levels, its\n      effects on CD4 cell counts have been modest. Intermittently administered IL-2 in the\n      presence of HAART has been shown to increase CD4 cell counts, decrease lymphocyte activation\n      markers, and increase certain lymphocyte functional activity in patients with early-stage\n      HIV infection. ACTG 328 evaluated the effects of intravenous and/or subcutaneously\n      administered IL-2 in conjunction with HAART in a group of more advanced HIV-infected\n      patients over an 18- to 22-month period. As patients were enrolled in this study over an\n      18-month period, a follow-up protocol is required to provide continued IL-2 therapy for\n      patients responding to IL-2 and patients in the control group who wish to receive this drug.\n\n      This study enrolls patients who participated in ACTG 328. Patients in Arm I of ACTG 328 (the\n      control group receiving HAART only) who have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less\n      register for Step II. Patients in Step II receive subcutaneous [SC] IL-2 in combination with\n      HAART. IL-2 is administered for 5 days every 8 weeks for the first 3 cycles. For subsequent\n      cycles, the interval between cycles may be extended in 8-week increments for a maximum of 24\n      weeks, provided the patient's bimonthly CD4 count exceeds 500 cells/mm3. Patients in Arm I\n      who have a viral load greater than 5,000 copies/ml register for Step I which requires a\n      change in antiretroviral therapy. Patients who then achieve viral levels of 5,000 copies/ml\n      or less may begin to receive IL-2 no earlier than 4 weeks and no later than 12 weeks after\n      the change in HAART regimen. Patients whose viral load remains above 5,000 copies/ml for 12\n      weeks after the change in drug regimen are discontinued from the study. Patients in Arms II\n      or III of ACTG 328 (IL-2-containing arms) who have had a 25 percent or greater increase in\n      CD4 cell count above their Week 11 value and have a viral load of 5,000 copies/ml or less\n      continue on SC IL-2 and HAART. Patients who meet the CD4 criteria but whose viral load is\n      above 5,000 copies/ml change their HAART regimen. After a minimum of 4 weeks and a maximum\n      of 12 weeks, these patients may receive IL-2 provided they have a viral load of 5,000\n      copies/ml or less. For this study, HAART is defined as one protease inhibitor and two\n      nucleoside analogues. [AS PER AMENDMENT 9/16/99: All patients must receive a protease\n      inhibitor or, with permission of the chair, a nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor\n      (NNRTI) plus either two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) or another\n      protease inhibitor or NNRTI.] The protease inhibitor provided on this study is indinavir\n      (IDV). The nucleoside analogue combinations provided on this study are as follows:\n      zidovudine (ZDV) plus didanosine (ddI), ZDV plus lamivudine (3TC), stavudine (d4T) plus 3TC,\n      or d4T plus ddI. Other antiretroviral drugs may be used but are not provided by this study.\n      Patients are monitored for CD4 counts at bimonthly intervals after the first IL-2 dose. CD4\n      counts and plasma storage for HIV RNA are done within 96 hours prior to each cycle of IL-2.\n      Safety laboratory evaluations are obtained prior to and at the conclusion of each IL-2\n      course. TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone), DTH skin testing, and real-time plasma HIV RNA\n      are obtained at 6-month intervals."
