Data from the ULTRA\n      Registry will be used to evaluate the long-term safety and efficacy of laparoscopic RF\n      ablation.\n\n      The ULTRA Registry will recruit women age 21 or older who plan to undergo or have undergone\n      laparoscopic RF ablation within the United States. Participants will be recruited through\n      study materials distributed at clinical offices across the country where gynecologists are\n      performing laparoscopic RF ablation. Study participants will consent to participate in a 3\n      year prospective study conducted by UCSF but the laparoscopic RF ablation surgery will be\n      performed by the study participants' own gynecologist. We will evaluate changes in\n      fibroid-related symptoms from pre-treatment values to 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months after\n      RFA. We will determine long-term efficacy of RFA by evaluating the rate of re-treatment for\n      symptomatic fibroids after the RFA procedure. Participants will be asked for permission to\n      review their medical records to assess surgical and pregnancy outcomes. The gynecologists\n      performing the laparoscopic RF ablation surgery will be asked to consent to complete a brief\n      study questionnaire with information on demographics, work history, professional training,\n      and practice setting.\n\n      UC San Francisco will have oversight of all scientific and administrative aspects of the\n      study. All study data will be stored securely in a HIPAA compliant, secure database\n      monitored by the UC San Francisco Coordinating Center."
