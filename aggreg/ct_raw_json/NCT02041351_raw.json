Menopausal status. Hormone receptor status. Overexpression of HER2 neu. Location of\n      metastatic sites. Performance status (PS) 0-3. comorbidities.\n\n      Case management in the variables (patient subgroups )\n\n      The patients with HER 2 neu overexpression of anti -HER2 therapy will further chemotherapy\n      with docetaxel.\n\n      The patients presenting with brain metastases may receive radiation therapy to the brain and\n      then at the end of radiotherapy, start docetaxel.\n\n      Patients whose tumors express estrogen receptors and progesterone positive receive treatment\n      with docetaxel:\n\n      Where there is visceral crisis and it is shown that they have already progressed to more\n      than 2 lines of previously administered hormone treatment.\n\n      In no event cytotoxic chemotherapy with concurrent docetaxel was administered to an\n      anti-estrogen drug.\n\n      And they can continue only when hormone therapy has achieved complete response measurable\n      lesions with docetaxel and opt for a non-cytotoxic anti-estrogen therapy and when it came to\n      presenting unacceptable toxicity with docetaxel.\n\n      Evaluations:\n\n      clinical assessment that will include physical examination and review of laboratory studies\n      were carried out every 2 weeks before authorizing the housing management of a next cycle.\n\n      The objective assessment of tumor response was carried out by imaging studies (CT) by RECIST\n      criteria after administration of the 4 criteria of cycles, a cycle is administered every 2\n      weeks with docetaxel at a dose of 45mg/m2.\n\n      Response Criteria\n\n        1. Response tumor shrinkage by royalty over 30%.\n\n        2. Greater than 1 cm in the size of tumor lesions decrease.\n\n        3. Disease-free survival\n\n        4.
