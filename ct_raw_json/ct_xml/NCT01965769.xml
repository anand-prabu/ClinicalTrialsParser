  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omitting evaluation of gastric residual contents prior to feeding very premature infants
      will increase the feeding intake at 2 weeks, and total caloric intake and growth by 3 weeks,
      as well as decrease the time required for parenteral nutrition.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Infants were randomized into 2 groups.  Group 1 had no gastric residuals evaluated prior to
      feeding. Group 2 had gastric residuals evaluated prior to feeding.  Nutritional outcomes
      were compared between groups.
