Immediate and longer term outcomes will be explored.\n\n      Eight weeks after surgery, participants will return to the clinic for a follow up\n      appointment. While they are in the waiting area they will be asked to complete a short\n      questionnaire to assess time taken to return to pre surgical levels of functioning, pain\n      experienced in the first four weeks after surgery,  severity of venous symptoms and\n      satisfaction with treatment."
