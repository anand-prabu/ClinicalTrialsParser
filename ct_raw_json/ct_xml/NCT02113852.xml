  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an epidemiological,multicenter study of genomic and expression profiles of patients
      with newly diagnosed NSCLC.Two hundred and fifty NSCLC patients who fulfill the criteria are
      to be recruited by investigational sites.Approximately 100 of them will be from
      retrospectively collected samples with detailed clinical and 2-year follow-up information
      after surgeries.The demographics,cancer/adjacent normal tissue and matched blood sample will
      be collected after the patient had provided informed consent.All tissue samples will be
      analyzed for somatic mutations by exome deep sequencing,mRNA expression profiling by RNA
      sequencing and chromosome copy number variation by SNP array at the designated laboratories.

        The study aims to collect approximately 250 smoking induced lung cancer(NSCLC)
        samples.Approximately 200 cases of treatment naive samples will be required. Samples will
        be collected mainly from the investigational sites in Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing that
        have expertise in lung cancer diagnosis.
