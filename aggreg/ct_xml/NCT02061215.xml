  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using novel CYTOF technology to measure a wide array of innate and adaptive cell proportions
      and cytokine levels, we plan a pilot study in old (&gt;/=60 years) and young (20-40 years)
      renal transplant recipients who are CMV seropositive (regardless of donor serology). Viral
      load measurements will be performed at baseline prior to transplant (within 1 week),and then
      at 3, 7 and 10 months after transplant. It is expected that the patient will receive
      anti-CMV prophylaxis until 6 months post-transplant, so the latter two time points will
      reflect responses after &quot;release&quot; from antiviral suppression. Each patient will serve as
      their own control, with comparisons made between measurements at baseline and then at each
      timepoint.

      Blood from 10 patients in each age group will be studied, to collect virologic and immune
      response data:

        -  CYTOF (broad array of measurements)

        -  Tetramer assays (requires recipient HLA type of A1, A2, B7)

        -  CMV viral load PCR

        -  Response to pneumococcal antigens and inactivated influenza virus

      In addition, clinical data will be collected at the time points indicated,particularly renal
      function and the presence/absence of acute rejection.
