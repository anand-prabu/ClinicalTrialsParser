      The purpose of this study is to determine whether baricitinib therapy alone is noninferior
      to methotrexate (MTX) therapy alone in the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid
      arthritis (RA) in those who have had limited or no treatment with MTX and are naive to other
      conventional or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs).
