Exceptions are inhaled steroids for asthma treatment (i.e. patients on\n             inhaled steroids are allowed), or epidural steroid injections.\n\n          -  Are taking immunosuppressive agents (Cancer chemotherapy, treatment with Disease\n             Modifying Anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or any similar immunomodulating drugs) or are\n             treated with Growth Factors or Insulin at any time within 6 months prior to surgery.\n\n          -  Are being treated with radiotherapy.\n\n          -  Are having medical conditions, known to impact bone metabolism, such as Paget's\n             disease, osteoporosis.\n\n          -  Are smokers and/or nicotine/tobacco users.\n\n          -  Are pregnant, lactating or women wishing to become pregnant.\n\n          -  Are a prisoner.\n\n          -  Are currently participating in an investigational drug or another device study that\n             has not completed the primary endpoint or that clinically interferes with the study\n             endpoints.\n\n          -  Prior spine surgery at the index level except posterior decompressive surgery where\n             the posterior elements are preserved e.g. facet saving techniques such as discectomy,\n             laminotomy, and intradiscal procedures.\n\n          -  Use of any other bone graft or bone graft substitute in addition to or in place of\n             Accell Evo3\u00ae with the exception of local autograft and/or cancellous bone chips.\n\n          -  Use of routine prophylactic NSAIDS for 3 months post-operatively, but low dose\n             concomitant pain medications e.g. aspirin should be continued and recorded on the\n             Concomitant Pain Medications case report form (CRF)."
