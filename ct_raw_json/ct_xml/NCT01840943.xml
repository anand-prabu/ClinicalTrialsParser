  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness between CAELYX and topotecan
      hydrochloride (HCl) in Chinese participants with recurrent epithelial ovarian carcinoma
      following failure of first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy, who have received no more than
      one prior platinum-based regimen therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (all people know the identity of the intervention), randomized (the
      study medication is assigned by chance), comparative bridging study (a supplemental study
      which performs to provide data of effectiveness, safety, and dosage to compare two study
      medications in a new region). The study consists of 3 phases: screening phase (30 days
      before administration of study medication), treatment phase, and follow up phase (every 8
      weeks for tumor assessment until disease progression or death, or until the study
      completion, whichever is earlier and every 3 months after disease progression for overall
      survival and for anti-tumor therapy for a minimum of 1 year). In the treatment phase,
      approximately 120 eligible participants will be categorized prospectively for
      platinum-sensitivity (sensitive versus refractory) and bulky disease (presence versus
      absence). Later on participants will be randomly assigned either to experimental arm
      (CAELYX: administer on Day 1 of each cycle) or control arm (topotecan HCl: administer on Day
      1 to Day 5 of each cycle). Treatment will continue until disease progression occurs and may
      continue for at least 2 cycles after confirmed complete response (disappearance of all
      target lesions). On average, it is expected that participants will continue treatment for
      approximately 3 to 6 cycles in experimental arm (CAELYX) or 4 to 8 cycles in Control arm
      (topotecan HCl). Safety evaluations will include assessment of adverse events, clinical
      laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram (or multiple gated acquisition scans),
      vital signs, and physical examination which will be monitored throughout the study. The
      total duration of the study will be approximately 23 months.
