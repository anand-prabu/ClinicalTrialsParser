  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multicenter study will evaluate the safety of assisted subcutaneous
      administration of Herceptin (trastuzumab) in patients with HER2-positive early breast
      cancer. Patients who have completed the first 6 cycles of intravenous Herceptin as part of
      the (neo)adjuvant treatment will be eligible to receive a further 12 cycles of Herceptin in
      this study. For the first 3 cycles, Herceptin will be administered intravenously (6 mg/kg)
      at the hospital. The next 3 cycles, Herceptin (600 mg every 3 weeks) will be administered
      subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained HCP at the hospital, and for the last 6
      cycles Herceptin will be administered subcutaneously via a hand-held syringe by a trained
      HCP at the patient's home.
