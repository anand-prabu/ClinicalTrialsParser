  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will document the efficacy of a behavioral intervention for Processing
      Speed (PS) in Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI), Speed of Processing Training (SPT), which has
      been successful used in the aging population in several studies. This study will (1) apply a
      treatment protocol for PS impairments, well-validated in aging, to persons with TBI with
      impaired PS, and document its efficacy on standard neuropsychological (NP) tests (2) assess
      the effectiveness of the intervention utilizing global measures of daily life, including an
      objective measure (TIADL) (3) examine the long term impact of SPT. This study is unique in
      that it will be the first to evaluate the efficacy of a highly-manualized structured
      behavioral treatment for processing speed deficits in persons with TBI utilizing the optimal
      methodology for carrying out such studies, a randomized clinical trial. Given the prevalence
      of PS deficits in the TBI population and the significant impact such deficits have on
      everyday functioning, public safety, and overall quality of life, the identification of an
      effective intervention for PS deficits in TBI could have a profound impact on the population
      and society as a whole.

    <description>SPT involves trainer-guided practice of computer-based exercises, including Target Detection (indicating presence or absence of targets, identifying targets, etc.) and Discrimination and Localization (performing same/ different discriminations of targets presented very quickly and followed by a masking pattern) 10, 19, 84. Display speed, ranging from 17 to 500 ms, is the primary manipulation during training, which increases task demands and thus demands on PS itself. These training tasks are tailored to each individual's ability by the trainer.</description>
