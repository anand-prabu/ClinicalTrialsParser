The multitrait-multimethod matrix (MTMM) is a procedure first developed by Campbell and Fiske to asses construct validity by creating a fully crossed method-by-measure matrix of associations among multiple constructs and multiple measurement methods. The resulting matrix of correlation coefficients gives a pattern of associations that informs the validity evidence of the measure and construct. We will use the following measures  in the multitrait multimethod matrix: Neighborhood Physical Activity Questionnaire, the American Timeuse Survey, and PALMS based physical activity in location estimates.",
