The cuts are applied by\n      means of the VICTUS femtosecond laser system using a cylindrical cut pattern with diameter\n      and height dependent on anterior chamber depth, pupil diameter and ocular lens size for\n      Group A and the manual surgery technique for Group B.\n\n      The allocation of the surgery technique will be randomized between the study patient. Each\n      surgery technique represents a study group. In Group A the anterior capsulotomy and lens\n      fragmentation will be performed by means of femtosecond laser surgery. Group B acts as a\n      control group where the capsulotomy as well as the lens fragmentation is performed manually.\n\n      The hypothesis of the study is that by means of intraocular, laser-induced cuts, circularity\n      of the capsulotomy can be improved in a safe and effective way.\n\n      A detailed pre-operative examination will ensure that every interested and willing patient\n      fulfils the inclusion criteria of this study. Post-operative examinations, which should\n      document the success of the treatment, are to be carried out after 1-day, 1-week, 1-month."
