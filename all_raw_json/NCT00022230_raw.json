Biological therapies use different ways to stimulate the immune\n      system and stop tumor cells from growing. Combining chemotherapy with biological therapy may\n      kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is studying the side effects of giving chemotherapy together\n      with biological therapy and to see how well they work in treating patients with stage II or\n      stage III breast cancer."

Patients then receive paclitaxel or another taxane IV on day 1\n      and G-CSF on days 3-10 of 3 consecutive 14-day courses. Patients then receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV on day 1 and G-CSF on days 3-10 of 3 consecutive 14-day courses.\n      Patients who enroll after previously receiving 2 of these 3 chemotherapy drugs may receive\n      the third. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      After recovery from chemotherapy, patients undergo peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)\n      collection. The PBMC are treated ex vivo with monoclonal antibody OKT3 to form activated T\n      cells (ATC). The ATC are expanded for up to 14 days in interleukin-2 (IL-2).\n\n      At 3-4 weeks after PBMC collection, patients receive ATC IV over 15-30 minutes weekly for 8\n      weeks. Patients also receive IL-2 subcutaneously (SC) daily and sargramostim (GM-CSF) SC\n      twice weekly beginning 3 days before the first ATC infusion and continuing until 7 days\n      after completion of ATC therapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 4-5\n      years."
