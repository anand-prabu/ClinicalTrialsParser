Even though the cause of PLP remains unclear and the large number of treatments has\n      been suggested, there is no single treatment regimen proving long lasting pain relief for\n      PLP. However Gabapentin is widely used and have been well suggested recently for the\n      treatment of neuropathic pain.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the accuracy and efficacy achieved in using of\n      extended release Gabapentin to offer effective pain relief, improvement of sleep function,\n      and decrease problematic side effects related to the peaks and valleys of the drug's short\n      cycle in patients with PLP. Gabapentin has been clearly demonstrated to be effective in\n      neuropathic pain and epilepsy, but as a treatment option for post amputation pain, it has\n      not been tested.\n\n      Approximately, 20 patients will be enrolled in the study, after a titration of two weeks a\n      changing in pain intensity and quality of life will be obtained at subsequent visits.  We\n      are expected that the accuracy will be of benefit in reducing the incidence of chronic\n      post-amputation pain and improving clinical outcomes postoperatively."
