Combining chemotherapy with peripheral stem cell or bone marrow\n      transplantation may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      autologous bone marrow transplantation or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating\n      patients who have non-Hodgkin's lymphoma or Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients undergo autologous bone marrow or\n      peripheral blood stem cell transplantation on day 0.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3, 6, and 12 months, annually until disease relapse, and then every\n      6 months until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 40 patients will be accrued for this study within 3 years."
