If left untreated, inflammation of the eye may result in further ocular\n      complications including scarring, vision loss, or blindness. Although the exact dosing\n      regimen is physician-dependent, patients are typically prescribed a topical corticosteroid\n      for a period of 2-4 weeks following surgery, being tapered over the course of delivery as\n      the inflammation subsides. Topical anti-inflammatory agents are usually administered\n      multiple times per day, particularly in the early period following ophthalmic surgery.\n      Continuing  efforts  in  drug  development  aim  to  identify  alternatives  to  ophthalmic\n      corticosteroid use, due to their well-known local and systemic negative side effects."
