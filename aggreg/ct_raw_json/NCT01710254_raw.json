            "textblock": "Scientific Background/Rationale:\n\n      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a large and growing healthcare problem worldwide. Over 7 million\n      people in the U.S. and Europe currently suffer from atrial fibrillation, and this number is\n      expected to double before 2050. The lifetime risk of AF is high: ~24% at age 40, and this\n      risk remains fairly constant at older ages, with 22% lifetime risk at age 80 [1]. AF\n      significantly increases the risk of stroke and mortality, and can greatly limit quality of\n      life. Little research has been done on AF and ischemic cardiomyopathy, though it is a\n      relatively common co-morbidity. CT found increased prevalence (41% vs 27%) of coronary\n      artery disease (CAD) in patients with AF compared to patients with similar pre-test risk but\n      no AF [2]. AF patients with a positive SPECT scan for CAD have a worse prognosis for cardiac\n      events than patients with positive SPECT but without AF [3]. It was recently reported that\n      in a study of 253 AF patients, that AF patients with positive SPECT studies had a very high\n      number of false positives - only 15% of patients had significant CAD by angiography\n      (compared to 67% in the control group) [4, 5]. Just over half of the patients were in sinus\n      rhythm at SPECT, but since similar numbers of positives were seen in each half, the authors\n      did not feel that imaging during AF was the cause of the poor specificity.\n\n      Use of MRI for assessment of CAD is a growing area that entails no radiation exposure to the\n      patient. Advances in MRI have made it possible to accurately detect CAD, either as well or\n      better than SPECT in unselected populations [6, 7]. However, adoption of MRI myocardial\n      perfusion scans has been limited in part due to the challenges associated with the use of\n      adenosine. Adenosine requires starting a second IV, and to use either a special expensive\n      MRI-compatible infusion pump to deliver the drug, or long lengths of tubing to run to a pump\n      outside the scanner room. Neither solution is ideal, and regadenoson would not require any\n      such pumps or the starting of a second IV.  Here the investigators propose to determine the\n      sensitivity/specificity for dynamic contrast-enhanced myocardial perfusion MRI with the\n      vasodilator regadenoson in a subpopulation of patients - those with atrial fibrillation.\n\n      The investigators have a great deal of experience with stress and rest myocardial perfusion\n      MRI. In a preliminary study imaging three patients with AF that then went to X-ray\n      angiography (cath), two of the three subjects had significant stenoses by cath, and one did\n      not. This agreed with the regadenoson stress perfusion MRI findings. These MRI acquisitions\n      were performed on a Siemens Verio MRI scanner. The Verio operates at twice the magnetic\n      field strength (3 Tesla, or 3T) of most MRI scanners, which operate at 1.5T. The higher\n      magnetic field offers images with significantly less noise (almost twice the signal-to-noise\n      ratio).\n\n      Objective: To demonstrate sensitivity/specificity comparable to that reported in\n      meta-analyses of non-AF patients and adenosine (90%/80% [6, 7]), in an atrial fibrillation\n      population while using the time-efficient vasodilator regadenoson that requires only a\n      single IV.\n\n      Study Design: This will be a prospective, open-label, comparative trial using MRI.\n      Non-invasive MRI measurements of resting flow and flow at regadenoson stress will be\n      obtained in each subject during a one hour MRI exam using our advanced MRI acquisition\n      techniques.\n\n      32 subjects will be recruited for this study.\n\n      Study Procedure: Each subject will undergo a single MRI scanning session. Caffeine will be\n      stopped 12 hours prior to the procedure. One IV will be started and subjects positioned in\n      the scanner. Resting perfusion with Multihance Gd-BOPTA contrast agent will be performed\n      first. The perfusion acquisition acquires 3-6 short axis slices each heartbeat and lasts for\n      one minute. Then a standard regadenoson injection of 400ug/5cc will be given and MR imaging\n      performed with a Gd-BOPTA contrast agent bolus 60-100 seconds later [9] [10]."
