  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that the substitution of multi-day oral aprepitant with (intravenous) IV
      fosaprepitant, in combination with a  5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5HT3RA) + dexamethasone
      will provide comparable protection from 5 day cisplatin chemotherapy induced nausea and
      vomiting, compared to the results of our prior study of aprepitant. This study will be the
      first clinical trial evaluating fosaprepitant in patients receiving multi-day cisplatin.
      This will be a single arm, phase II study. The investigators propose to utilize intravenous
      (IV) fosaprepitant on days 3 and 5 of the 5-day cisplatin chemotherapy regimen. It is
      anticipated that fosaprepitant can suppress delayed chemo-induced nausea and vomiting for
      2-5 days after therapy. This study will test the value of fosaprepitant in this patient
      population.

      OUTLINE:  This is a multi-center study.

      Treatment Regimen:

      Patients must have no nausea and/or vomiting for 24 hours and must not have used other
      anti-emetics for 72 hours prior to starting protocol treatment.  Treatment must not start
      until this criteria is satisfied.

      Any germ cell chemotherapy regimen utilizing cisplatin (20mg/m2 x 5 days). This will usually
      be combined with bleomycin (BEP), etoposide (EP), ifosfamide (VIP), vinblastine (VeIP),
      paclitaxel (TIP) or epirubicin. All of these regimens get the identical cisplatin, which is
      the only highly emetic drug in any of the chemo regimens.

      Acute emesis prophylaxis (administered per institutional standards prior to chemotherapy):

        -  Any 5HT3 receptor antagonist may be used days 1 through 5 or days 1, 3 and 5 if
           palonosetron is used per institutional standards.

        -  Dexamethasone 20mg PO (orally) daily, days 1 and 2

        -  Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 3

      Delayed emesis prophylaxis:

        -  Fosaprepitant 150mg IV on day 5

        -  Dexamethasone 4mg PO BID (twice a day) on days 6, 7 and 8

      PRN (as needed) antiemetics allowed at the discretion of the treating investigator

        -  No additional doses of 5HT3 receptor antagonist, dexamethasone, or fosaprepitant will
           be given during the acute or delayed treatment periods

      ECOG Performance Status of 0-2

      Life Expectancy:  Not specified

      Hematopoietic:

        -  White blood cell count (WBC) &gt; 3.0 K/mm3

        -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 K/mm3

        -  Hemoglobin (Hgb) &gt; 10 g/dL

        -  Platelets &gt; 100 K/mm3

      Hepatic:

        -  Bilirubin &lt; 1.5 x ULN (upper limit of normal)

        -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST, SGOT) ≤ 3 x ULN

        -  Alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT) ≤ 3 x ULN

      Renal:

        -  Creatinine ≤ 2 mg/dl
