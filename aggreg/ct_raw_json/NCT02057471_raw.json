This drug is often poorly tolerated due to the side effect profile. Blood\n      transfusions can also be administered but expose the patient to other risks including\n      infection and transfusion associated reactions. In order to overcome these issues,\n      intravenous iron preparations have been developed and have improved in safety.\n\n      This is open label clinical trial, which looks to investigate the efficacy of intravenous\n      iron is in the treatment of preoperative anemia in colorectal patients. The outcomes\n      reviewed will include the amount and frequency of blood transfusions received, changes in\n      patient blood profiles operative complications and hospital length of stay. The role of\n      hepcidin as a biomarker of treatment response will also be assessed.\n\n      All data will be confidentially recorded on a Case Report Form, as will drug reactions and\n      side effects."
