The stem cells are returned to the patient to replace the blood-forming\n      cells that were destroyed by the chemotherapy and radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well cyclophosphamide plus filgrastim followed\n      by stem cell transplant works in treating patients with chronic phase or accelerated phase\n      chronic myelogenous leukemia."

Peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are collected between\n      days 14-21.\n\n      Patients then receive preparative therapy for transplant consisting of cyclophosphamide IV\n      over 2 hours on days -7 and -6 and total body irradiation twice a day on days -4 through -1.\n      Patients receive the PBSC transplantation on day 0. Patients also receive G-CSF IV starting\n      on day 0 and continuing until blood counts recover. Patients then receive interferon alfa SQ\n      daily in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks; then at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 18 months; and then annually for\n      5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
