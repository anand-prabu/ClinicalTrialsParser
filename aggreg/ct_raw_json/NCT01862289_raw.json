The purpose of the study is to assess the prevalence of chronic\n      hyperventilation syndrome in a specific population of difficult-to-treat asthmatics\n      patients, those who receive daily high doses of inhaled steroids (\u2265 1000 \u00b5g of fluticasone\n      with an additional treatment by a long-acting beta 2-agonist (LABA) and who remain\n      uncontrolled (Asthma control test (ACT) < 18). We plan to realize a systematic assessment of\n      the diagnosis of chronic hyperventilation syndrome with the Nijmegen questionnaire, blood\n      gases at rest, hyperventilation testing and Cardiopulmonary Exercise Testing(CPET). We also\n      will collect demographic information as well as information about asthma history, asthma\n      control and treatment."

The diagnosis\n      is confirmed by two positive tests (Nijmegen, Hyperventilation challenge and blood gases)\n      and the final decision of a medical committee. The first step is to determine the prevalence\n      oh this syndrome in this specific population. The second step is to assess the sensitivity,\n      the specificity, the false positive rate and the false negative rate of the different\n      parameters measured during the tests."
