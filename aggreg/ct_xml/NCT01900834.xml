      This study is conducted in the United States of America (USA). The aim of this study is to
      assess longitudinal variation of immune biomarkers in subjects with type 1 diabetes (T1D),
      type 2 diabetes (T2D) and healthy, non-diabetic subjects over a one year period.

      Monthly venous blood samples within the first half year and thereafter bi-monthly the rest
      of the year. A subgroup of the subjects will also be invited for a visit within a week after
      the former visit to assess the variation of the biomarkers within a week. The blood samples
      will be assayed for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) specificity, phenotype and
      function as well as for islet autoantibodies (presence and precise titers), for autoantibody
      isotypes and diabetes risk parameters. Finally C-peptide levels and residual beta cell
      function will be measured three times during the study after a mix meal tolerance test
      (MMTT) in subjects with T1D.
