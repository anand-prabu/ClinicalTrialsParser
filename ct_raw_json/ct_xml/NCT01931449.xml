    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the validity and safety of a modified operative
      procedure of digestive tract reconstruction following pancreatoduodenectomy which enables
      the pancreatic juice and bile to bypass at the pancreatointestinal anastomosis and merge at
      gastrointestinal anastomosis. It is anticipated that this procedure can decrease the risk of
      post-surgical pancreatic leakage and preserve the patients' digestive function as well.

    <textblock>
      Pancreatoduodenectomy (PD) is one of the most complicated surgeries in abdominal clinical
      practice. It is widely used in the treatment of pancreatic head carcinoma, periampullary
      carcinoma, chronic pancreatitis with intractable pain, pancreatic head mass which unable to
      rule out pancreatic cancer. PD was improved in many ways in the last 80 years and the
      post-surgical mortality has decreased under 5%. Since the resected region of PD is wide
      including gall bladder, billiary tract, duodenum, pancreas, stomach, jejunum and regional
      lymph nodes. It has a high prevalence of complications, of which pancreatic leakage is the
      most common and serious one with a prevalence rate of 5-25% and mortality rate 20-50%ã€‚ The
      objective of the present study is to evaluate a new surgical procedure used for the
      digestive tract reconstruction following PD. The new procedure enables the pancreatic juice
      and bile to bypass at the pancreatointestinal anastomosis and merge at gastrointestinal
      anastomosis which can decrease the risk of post-surgical pancreatic leakage and keep the
      digestive function of patients. A multicenter, randomized, controlled study is designed to
      observe the prevalence of pancreatic leakage, other post-surgical complications, hospital
      stay, medical costs, life quality and other indexes to evaluate the efficacy and safety of
      this procedure. It is anticipated that through the study, this new procedure can be
      systematically verified if it is an ideal procedure of digestive reconstruction following PD
      which can be promoted into wider use.
