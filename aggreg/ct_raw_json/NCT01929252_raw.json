Different local anaesthetics can be used for the wound infiltration\n      techniques.Ifiltration of the surgical wound with bupivacaine following outpatient provides\n      pain relief in the postoperative period , allows the early discharge from the outpatient\n      surgical units.There has been increased interest in administration of analgesic prior to\n      surgical injury. Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective alpha-2 adrenergic agonist with\n      sedative , anxiolytic, analgesic, sympatholytic and antihypertensive effects.Dexmedetomidine\n      has been used intravenously before initiation of anaesthesia and it has shown to provide\n      some analgesic effect after surgery but there were some adverse hemodynamic effects.\n      Surgical wound administration of dexmedetomidine may be useful to avoid the adverse\n      haemodynamic effects  of intravenous administration while still providing the postoperative\n      analgesia."
