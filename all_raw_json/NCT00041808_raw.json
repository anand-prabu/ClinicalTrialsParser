MTCs are tiny, microscopic particles of iron and carbon.  When DOX\n      is added to MTCs, DOX attaches to the carbon part of the MTCs.  MTC-DOX is directed to and\n      deposited in the area of a tumor, where it is thought that it then \"leaks\" through the blood\n      vessel walls.  Once in the surrounding tissues, it is thought that Doxorubicin becomes \"free\n      from\" the magnetic beads and will then be able to act against the tumor cells.  The iron\n      component of the particle has magnetic properties, making it possible to direct MTC-DOX to\n      specific tumor sites in the liver by placing a magnet on the body surface.  It is hoped that\n      MTC-DOX used with the magnet may target the chemotherapy drug directly to liver tumors and\n      provide a treatment to patients with cancers that have spread to the liver."
