  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is open to patients with cirrhosis due to chronic HCV, and to patients who have
      already received a liver transplant for chronic HCV. All subjects will be treated with
      Daclatasvir and Sofosbuvir for 12 weeks. Under certain conditions, the treatment duration
      may be extended for cirrhotic subjects. The study will test how well this combination of
      investigational drugs works to treat chronic HCV.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects must be able to understand and agree to comply with the prescribed dosing
             regimens and procedures, report for regularly scheduled study visits, and reliably
             communicate with study personnel about adverse events and concomitant medications

          -  Subjects chronically infected with HCV Genotype 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 with HCV RNA
             viral load of ≥10,000 IU/mL at screening

          -  Subjects may be treatment-naïve or treatment-experienced

          -  Cirrhotic subjects must have cirrhosis confirmed by biopsy, Fibroscan or fibrotest
             and Aspartate aminotransferase platelet ratio index (APRI) criteria as outlined in
             the protocol

          -  Post-transplant subjects must be at least 3 months post-transplant with no evidence
             of moderate or severe rejection

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of multi-organ transplant, with the exception of dual transplantation of the
             liver/kidney, is prohibited

          -  Current or known history of cancer (with the following exceptions:  In situ carcinoma
             of the cervix, adequately treated basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, or
             hepatocellular carcinoma within Milan criteria for transplantation) within 5 years
             prior to screening

          -  Evidence of an ongoing medical condition contributing to chronic liver disease other
             than HCV (such as, but not limited to: hemochromatosis, autoimmune hepatitis,
             metabolic liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, or toxin exposures)

          -  History of HIV infection or chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) as documented by HBV
             serologies (e.g., HBsAg-seropositive). Subjects with resolved HBV infection may
             participate (e.g., HBcAb-seropositive with concurrent HBsAg-seronegative)

          -  Active hospitalization for decompensated liver disease
