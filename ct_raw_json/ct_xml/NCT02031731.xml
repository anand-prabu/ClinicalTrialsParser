    <textblock>
      This phase I study will examine the pharmacokinetics and safety of Onartuzumab (MetMAb) in
      chinese patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Patients will be divided
      into 3 cohorts, which will each be given a different dose of MetMAb. The cohorts will be
      treated sequentially, starting with the lowest dose. MetMAb will be administered
      intravenously every 3 weeks. Patients may be treated for up to 16 cycles (21 days each) or 1
      year, whichever occurs first, in the absence of disease progression.

             have been receiving corticosteroids.

          -  Previously diagnosed and treated central nervous system (CNS) metastases or spinal
             cord compression that has not been clinically stable for at least 2 months.

          -  Treatment with anti-tumor therapy within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment,
             with the following exception: Patients with metastatic prostate cancer on maintenance

             disease or condition that contraindicates the use of an investigational drug or that
             may affect the interpretation of the results or render the patient at high risk from
             treatment complications.

          -  Receipt of any investigational agent, or participation in any other clinical study,
             within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment.

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks before the start of study treatment, without complete
             recovery.

          -  Significant traumatic injury within 3 weeks before the start of study treatment (All
             wounds must be fully healed prior to Day 1).
