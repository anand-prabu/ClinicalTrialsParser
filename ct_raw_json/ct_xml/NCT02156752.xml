  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is a randomized controlled trial to compare the efficacy of two interventions-
      one based on Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) and one based on Self-Regulation (SR)-
      and a control group (called weight loss only (WLO)) on 24-month weight loss outcomes. All
      participants will first participate in an initial 4-month standard behavioral weight loss
      program. Participants will be randomized into 1 of 3 groups and receive a 3-part workshop;
      the ACT workshop will teach ACT skills including acceptance and mindfulness techniques
      designed to promote behavior change and health behavior persistence consistent with one's
      core values. The SR program will focus on self-regulation, regular weighing, and modeling
      behavior on successful maintainers. The WLO group will receive a control workshop focused on
      cooking demonstrations and general nutrition topics.The primary outcome is weight loss at 24
      months. The secondary outcome is change in psychological flexibility, a critical component
      of ACT interventions and a potential innovative mediating mechanism. Primary Hypothesis: At
      24 months, the ACT group will show significantly greater weight loss as compared to the SR
      and WLO groups.
