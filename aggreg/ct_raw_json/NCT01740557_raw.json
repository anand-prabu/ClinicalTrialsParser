Fludarabine infused at 25 mg/m2 IV daily over approximately 15-30 minutes on Days -5 to -1.  On day 0, all patients receive up to 1.5x10^11 T cells (including both CXCR2 and NGFR transduced TIL). TIL infused as an inpatient by IV over approximately 15-60 minutes. Twelve (12) to sixteen (16) hours after completing T cell infusion, all patients receive high dose interleukin-2 (IL-2) on an inpatient basis at standard dose of 720,000 IU/kg as an intravenous bolus over an approximate 15 minute period every 8-16 hours for up to 15 doses on Days 1 to 5, as tolerated."

            "textblock": "The goal of this clinical research study is to learn the side effects of T-cells injected\n      with CXCR2 and NGFR when given in combination with chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide and\n      fludarabine) and aldesleukin to patients with metastatic melanoma in an attempt to allow\n      them to better localize the tumor.  The safety of this combination will also be studied.\n\n      T cells are types of white blood cells that help your body fight infections. T-cells are\n      designed to recognize and kill melanoma cells. Researcher want to grow your T-cells in a\n      laboratory, inject them with CXCR2 and NGFR to be able to recognize tumor cells, and then\n      give them back to you. This may help to control melanoma.\n\n      Cyclophosphamide is designed to block cancer cells from dividing, which may slow or stop\n      their growth and spread throughout the body.  This may cause the cancer cells to die.\n\n      Fludarabine is designed to interfere with the DNA (genetic material) of cancer cells, which\n      may cause the cancer cells to die.\n\n      Aldesleukin is designed to block the activity of cells that decrease the immune system's\n      ability to fight cancer."

            "textblock": "Study Drug Administration:\n\n      If you were found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will begin to receive the\n      study drugs and other drugs that are given to help lower the risk of side effects.\n\n      The days leading up to Day 1 of the study are considered negative days. For example, the day\n      before Day 0 is Day -1.\n\n      On Days -7 and -6, you will receive cyclophosphamide each day by vein over about 2 hours.\n\n      On Day -7, you will receive mesna by vein non-stop over about 24 hours. This is help to\n      protect the bladder from side effects of cyclophosphamide.\n\n      On Days -5 to -1, you will receive fludarabine each day by vein over about 15-30 minutes.\n\n      On Day 0, you will receive CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells through a catheter over about 15-60\n      minutes. A catheter is a thin flexible tube that inserted into the body. The catheter may be\n      placed into a vein in your arm or in a large vein in your neck.  If the cells need to be\n      given through a large vein either in your upper chest or in your neck, the area will be\n      numbed with medicine before the catheter is put in.  Other catheters may be needed in one or\n      both of your arms to give you fluids, medicines, or extra nutrition.  You will sign a\n      separate consent for the catheter, which will describe the procedure and the risks in more\n      detail.\n\n      On Days 1-5, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15 minutes every 8-16 hours\n      for up to 15 doses.\n\n      On Days 22-26, you will receive aldesleukin by catheter over about 15 minutes every 8-16\n      hours for up to 15 doses. You will only receive aldesleukin if your platelet counts are high\n      enough.\n\n      You will be given levofloxacin once a day by mouth or vein until your white blood cell count\n      rises.  You will receive filgrastim through a needle under the skin once a day until your\n      white blood cell count rises. You will begin to receive fluconazole on Day 0 by mouth until\n      your white blood cell count rises.  You will also take trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole\n      (SMX) by mouth 2 times a day, beginning on Day -7 and continuing for at least 3 months after\n      chemotherapy.  If you have herpes, you will receive acyclovir by mouth or valacyclovir by\n      vein if you are unable to take by mouth until your white blood cell count rises.\n\n      The drug furosemide will be given by vein while you receive cyclophosphamide to try to\n      increase the amount of urine your body makes.\n\n      The T-cell infusion may cause an allergic reaction such as fever, chills, and/or shivering.\n      You will take Tylenol (acetaminophen) by mouth before the T-cell infusion to decrease the\n      risk of these side effects.\n\n      You will receive the drug ondansetron by vein over 30 minutes to decrease the risk of\n      nausea and vomiting during chemotherapy.\n\n      It is possible that you will receive a 2nd round of chemotherapy, aldesleukin, and T-cells.\n      You will repeat the study visit schedule as well. Your doctor will discuss this with you.\n\n      Study Visits:\n\n      Every 1-2 days during Days -7 to 26, blood (about 3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine\n      tests.\n\n      While you receive CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells, your vital signs will be measured before T-cell\n      infusion, every 15 minutes during the infusion, and then 1 time an hour for 4 hours after\n      the infusion.\n\n      On Days 0, 6, and 27, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to check the activity of the\n      T-cells and their ability to attack the tumor.  If you return for follow up this blood will\n      also be drawn 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after you receive the  CXCR2\n      and NGFR T-cells.\n\n      On Days 6 and 27, you will have biopsies to check the status of the disease. The type of\n      biopsy will depend on the size and location of the tumor.\n\n      At about 6 and 12 weeks:\n\n        -  You will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  You will have a CT or PET/CT scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to check the status\n           of the disease.\n\n        -  You will have an MRI scan, CT scan, and/or a PET scan of the brain to check the status\n           of the disease.\n\n      You will return every 3-4 weeks for the first 2 months after treatment.  Then every 1-3\n      months for the next 10 months.  The study doctor will decide the types of tests that you\n      will have.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      You may receive up to 2 rounds of the study drugs (up to 12 weeks).  You will no longer be\n      able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if intolerable side effects occur,\n      or if you are unable to follow study directions.\n\n      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-treatment\n      and follow-up visits.\n\n      If all of the tests are normal and show no change, blood (about 2-4 tablespoons) will be\n      collected from you at every visit and stored in case you develop symptoms later. This blood\n      may be tested to check the number of t-cells in your blood and how they are functioning.  If\n      you give your consent below, in the optional procedures section, any blood left over from\n      these tests will be stored and used for use in future research.\n\n      Long Term Follow-Up:\n\n      One (1) time a year for 5 years after you receive the T-cells, you will have a physical\n      exam.\n\n      One (1) time a year for up to 15 years, you will be mailed a questionnaire about your health\n      and quality of life. This questionnaire should take about 15 minutes to complete. You will\n      be given a self-addressed, stamped envelope in order to return the questionnaire.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  CXCR2 and NGFR T-cells is not FDA approved or\n      commercially available.  It is currently being used for research purposes only.\n\n      Cyclophosphamide is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of several\n      types of cancer (such as leukemia, lymphoma, and breast cancer).\n\n      Fludarabine is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of B-cell chronic\n      lymphocytic leukemia.\n\n      Aldesleukin is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of  Metastatic\n      melanoma or renal cell carcinoma.\n\n      Up to 36 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
