      All available retrospective and prospective data from pediatric MS participants who have
      received at least 1 dose of BG00002 before turning 18 years old and before 31 March 2015
      will be used in this study.  Prospective data are defined as data to be collected in the
      future, i.e., from new participants not included in the first data transfer or additional
      data from existing participants that were not included in the first data transfer. Existing
      biospecimen samples will be evaluated but not collected as part of this study.

          -  Adequate data received by Biogen Idec by 30 September 2015 will be used for this
             meta-analysis including data collected after a patient may have turned 18 years old.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Data received by Biogen Idec after 30 September 2015 will not be included in the
