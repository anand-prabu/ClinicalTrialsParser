  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current study aims to test the efficacy of treatment for a device that utilises a
      thermal pulsation system, which applies heat from the inner surface of the eyelids
      (Lipiflow) in patients suffering from meibomian gland dysfunction.

      Patients will be asked to undergo a one-time treatment with Lipiflow and the investigators
      will monitor them for changes in tear film and lipid composition, as well as changes in the
      anatomy of meibomian glands for over a study period of 12 weeks. Additionally, dry eye
      symptoms will be documented in form of questionnaires.

      The investigators hypothesize that the treatment will be effective in improving clinical
      signs and will relieve dry eye symptoms for the patient. If this method of managing
      Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is found to be efficacious and safe, it will be made
      available to patients in Singapore.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Eyelids must present with blocked meibomian gland openings (plugs), at least 1
             visible MG plug in the 4 eyelids, or discernable change in consistency of meibum
             (increased in viscosity or opacity) when MG expressed in upper or lower eyelids.

          2. At least one out of 8 questions on dry eye symptoms is answered with often or all the
             time.

          3. Eyes should not show any other ocular surface pathology which required more treatment
             than eye lubricant and conventional eyelid hygiene.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known history of thyroid disorders (diagnosed by physician).

          2. No ocular surgery within the previous 6 months and LASIK within the previous 1 year.

          3. Any intake of central nervous system and hormonal drugs within last 30 days and
             inability to withhold such drugs for at least 6 weeks.

          4. Active ocular infection or pterygium.

          5. Anticipated necessity to wear contact lens in the duration of the study.

          6. Living in the same household as another participant of the study.

          7. Any other specified reason as determined by clinical investigator, for example, the
             need to use any treatment or eyedrops not permitted by the study.
