  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria is a common disease in Africa and a major health problem. Pregnant women are also at
      risk of malaria. Malaria in pregnancy is life threatening to both the mother and the baby
      she is carrying. It can result in the destruction of the mother's blood and in babies with a
      lower birth weight than normal, making them less healthy in their first years of life. These
      risks are even higher in women having their first pregnancy.

      When a woman is pregnant she should go to the Antenatal clinic (ANC) for care. Usually the
      ANC health staff gives the woman intermittent preventable treatment (IPTp-SP) against
      malaria. This drug helps protect the woman against getting malaria. Each pregnant woman
      should receive at least 2 doses of this drug during their pregnancy; thus, they should go
      the ANC at least 2 times during their pregnancy. However, many women still do not go often
      to the ANC for health care during their pregnancy.

      This study would like to see whether community health workers (CHW) can work with pregnant
      women to encourage them to attend ANC more often. Also, the CHW will test a pregnant woman
      every month for malaria with a rapid test. If a woman has malaria, the CHW will treat her in
      her home instead of the woman having to go a health clinic for treatment. The woman will be
      treated with a different drug than the drug that is given at the ANC visits. Our hypothesis
      is that this will improve the care and management of malaria during pregnancy and this will
      improve the health of women and their newborns. To see whether this strategy improved the
      health of women and their newborns, we will take a small piece of the placenta at delivery
      to test for malaria and we will weigh the baby. We will test this strategy in multiple
      communities. We will compare this to pregnant women in communities where this strategy was
      not followed, thus where pregnant women received standard care.

      Participants will be pregnant women. There are no direct benefits for participating in the
      study, except the outcome of our research question that is possible health benefits in the
      intervention group. The drugs involved are tested safe in pregnant women from second
      trimester on.
