This is a\n      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled prospective study on patients from the Katzmann\n      Breast Center undergoing outpatient breast surgery (including excisional biopsy, lumpectomy,\n      sentinel lymph node biopsy, axillary node dissection, or ductal excision).\n\n      IV acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been in Europe and other countries.  In the U.S. the FDA\n      approved IV acetaminophen (Ofirmev) in November of 2010.  Since then, it has been used in\n      many different ways, but most commonly in the first 24 hours post operative recovery period.\n\n      There will be two arms included in this study.  Patients in Arm One will receive a one gram\n      dose of IV acetaminophen in the pre-operative area.  Patients in Arm Two will receive a dose\n      of the placebo (IV normal saline).  The medication will be disguised in the same bag as the\n      normal saline, so no one (including the patient) in the pre-operative area will know which\n      arm the patient is in.  This prospective, randomized, double blind study will compare\n      post-operative nausea, vomiting, and pain rates in patients from both arms.\n\n      The primary endpoint of this study will be to compare post-operative pain in patients\n      receiving a pre-operative dose of IV acetaminophen to patients receiving the normal saline\n      placebo.  Secondary endpoints will include post-operative nausea and vomiting, recovery\n      times, and overall satisfaction of pain management throughout their experience (assessed on\n      post operative day one).  If this study shows that IV acetaminophen given in the\n      pre-operative setting decreases post-operative nausea, vomiting, and/or pain and/or shortens\n      recovery time, and improves patient satisfaction in regards to their pain management, it\n      could also become a routine medication given to all patients in the pre-operative setting."
