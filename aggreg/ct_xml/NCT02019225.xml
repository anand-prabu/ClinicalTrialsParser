  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the TiME Trial is to determine whether dialysis facility implementation of a
      minimum hemodialysis session duration of 4.25 hours (versus usual care) for patients with
      end-stage renal disease initiating treatment with thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis has
      benefits on mortality, hospitalizations and health-related quality of life.

      The trial also aims to demonstrate the capacity to conduct a large, pragmatic clinical trial
      in partnership with two large dialysis provider organizations.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The TiME Trial is a cluster-randomized, parallel-group pragmatic clinical trial for patients
      initiating treatment with maintenance hemodialysis. Facilities will be randomized in a 1:1
      distribution to the Intervention arm or the Usual Care arm.  Facilities randomized to the
      Intervention arm will adopt the practice of recommending dialysis session durations of at
      least 4.25 hours for all patients initiating hemodialysis treatment regardless of body size
      or dialysis solute clearance measurements.  Facilities randomized to Usual Care will
      maintain their existing approaches to prescribing dialysis session duration.  Participants
      will be followed for up to 3 years.  The primary endpoint is mortality; major secondary
      endpoints are hospitalization rate and quality of life.  Pragmatic features of the TiME
      Trial include 1) high generalizability due to non-restrictive eligibility criteria and broad
      representation of participating facilities, 2) implementation of the intervention by
      clinical care providers rather than by research personnel, and 3) reliance on data obtained
      through routine clinical care rather than through research activities.
