Is the study drug equivalent to the approved drug, Doxil/Caelyx, and does it act the same\n      way in the body as the approved drug?\n\n      ATI-0918 is believed to be a generic of Doxil/Caelyx and this is what the study is trying to\n      prove.  All people who participate in this study will receive the research study medication\n      (ATI-0918) and Doxil/Caelyx in addition to best supportive care (treatment for symptoms).\n\n      The study drug being tested in this study works the same as the FDA (government) approved\n      drug doxorubicin HCl.  ATI-0918 is a generic (the same) formulation of doxorubicin HCl being\n      delivered (given to the patient)."
