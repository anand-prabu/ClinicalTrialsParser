  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing orthotopic liver transplant will experience some degree of clinical
      and/or biochemical hepatic dysfunction.   This early injury is known as primary graft
      dysfunction and varies from minor abnormalities to primary nonfunction.  Prostaglandin-class
      drugs, including prostacyclin and its analogs, could represent an important advance toward
      the goal of reducing transplant related morbidity, mortality and associated costs by
      providing these benefits.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In vitro and in vivo research has consistently demonstrated an array of potential beneficial
      effects of prostanoids under both immune and non-immune circumstances relevant to liver
      allografts. (1-3)  Recent reviews summarize the pharmacologic rationale and nonclinical and
      clinical experience supporting for the use of prostanoids, including prostacyclin and its
      analogs, in reducing early morbidity and mortality associated with liver transplantation.
      Prostaglandin-class drugs, including prostacyclin and its analogs, could represent an
      important advance toward the goal of reducing transplant related morbidity, mortality and
      associated costs by providing these benefits. Additionally, the reduction in serum
      creatinine and reduced need for post-operative dialysis observed in some studies has
      implications in protecting the kidneys from the nephrotoxic affects of the immunosuppressant
      agents, especially during the early post-operative period.

      As a chemically stable analog of prostacyclin (PGI2), peri-operative intravenous
      administration of Remodulin is hypothesized to ameliorate or prevent reperfusion damage and
      thereby decrease hospitalization time and improve the clinical outcome of liver
      transplantation, compared to placebo control.  Remodulin, as a prostanoid, is expected to
      facilitate restoration of the blood supply to the revascularized graft, and to provide the
      well-characterized protective effects of this class of compounds in liver transplant
      patients.
