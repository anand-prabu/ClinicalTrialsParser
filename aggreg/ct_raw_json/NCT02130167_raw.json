Recently the 0.01% atropine was also reported\n      effective and with less visual side effects such as mydriasis. The aim of this study is to\n      compare the efficacy in controlling myopia progression and visual side effects of 2 low\n      concentration of atropine(0.05% vs 0.01%) in children aged 6-12 years with myopia of at\n      least -0.5 diopters (D) and astigmatism of -1.50 D or less."
