            "textblock": "Obesity is a worldwide problem and leads to multiple metabolic and endocrinological\n      problems, including type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). In T2DM, body is unable to response to\n      circulating insulin levels, which ultimately destroys pancreatic \u03b2-cells, leading to chronic\n      hyperglycaemia with ensuing consequences\n\n      Intestine is able to produce endocrinologically active substances, which affect to body's\n      intermediary metabolism. One of these substances in glucose-dependent insulinotrophic\n      polypeptide (GIP, part of the incretin family), which potentiates the release of insulin\n      postprandially. However, recent evidence suggests, that GIP may have more harmful than\n      beneficial role in the pathogenesis: it has been shown that GIP participates in the\n      development of insulin resistance, the key defect in the process of metabolic dysfunction.\n      GIP may also regulate postprandial redistribution of splanchnic blood flow which might act\n      in the body's nutrition handling [8].\n\n      Bariatric surgeries are a growing field as a treatment choice for morbid obesity (BMI > 35\n      kg/m2). Most established of these procedures is a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), where\n      duodenum and proximal jejunum is bypassed. Clinical and research evidence shows that shortly\n      (before any significant weight loss) after RYGB, T2DM resolves with improving glucose\n      tolerance. Foregut hypothesis behind bariatric surgeries postulate, that bypassed portions\n      of intestine contain a substance, that acts as an anti-incretin\u00ac, ie. to counteract\n      metabolically favourable incretins. In view of the recent studies, it may be that GIP is\n      really the anti-incretin behind this hypothesis.\n\n      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a modern imaging technique, which can be used to study\n       perfusion and metabolism of  different organs non-invasively. When radiowater measurement\n      is combined with [15O]CO, both tissues specific perfusion and blood volume can  be measured,\n      respectively. When coupled with magnetic imaging (ie. PET-MRI), the volumes-of-interests can\n      be accurately drawn to the desired organs.\n\n      The current study is conducted to investigate the vasoactive roles of the GIP. We aim to\n      show that GIP is the major contributor to the blood flow and tissue blood volume observed in\n      postprandial state. Moreover, we hypothesize that the elimination of GIP-effect has a\n      central role in the improved intermediary metabolism observed after bariatric surgery\n      procedures, and that part this change is mediated by changes in splanchnic circulation.\n      Furthermore, we investigate the effect of GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1, another member of\n      incretin family) on splanchnic circulation.\n\n      In the present study intestinal, hepatic and pancreatic blood flow and volume are measured\n      using [15O]H2O- and [15O]CO radiotracers and PET-MRI imaging in healthy normal weight\n      volunteers (n = 20, BMI \u2264 27 kg/m2) and in morbidly obese T2DM patients (n = 30, BMI \u2264 35\n      kg/m2) before and after the bariatric surgery operation. The PET imaging will be performed\n      at fasting state but also separately either during 1) mixed meal solution (MMS), 2) GIP-, or\n      3) GLP-1-infusion. Also abdominal subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue, intestinal and\n      hepatic tissue samples will be collected."

In RYGB procedure large part of the ventricle, duodenum, and proximal jejunum (ad 1.5 meters from pylorus) is bypassed. \"New\" stomach pouch is anastomosed into the \"new\" proximal jejunum, and remaining larger portion of the stomach, duodenum, and jejunum are reattached to the distal part of the jejunum for the secretion of pancreatic, gastrointestinal, and biliary juice. In SG a notable amount of ventricle is removed to create a stomach pouch which effectively restricts the amount of food feasible to ingest.
