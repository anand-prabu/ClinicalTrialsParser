Participant study number will be given at the screening\n      visit, prior to inclusion in the study.\n\n      The chosen intervention and study regimen are based on the dynamics of viral infection and\n      the pharmacokinetics of the study drugs. In order to inhibit reverse transcription\n      nucleoside and nucleotide analogues need to be phosphorylated intracellularly. On the other\n      hand, available data indicate that it takes approximately 10 hours between exposure and HIV\n      viral integration, offering a window of opportunity for Raltegravir to block integration and\n      thus prevent infection, given that this drug does not need to be metabolized to exert its\n      effect. The intervention will be maintained for 4 weeks following exposure, in accordance\n      with Brazilian and CDC guidelines for PEP."

Study participants will be instructed to\n      start study drugs if they expect or experience an exposure of any mucous membrane (oral,\n      urethral, anal) to semen. Subjects who expect or experience these exposures will be\n      instructed to take 1 pill of Raltegravir 400mg and one pill of truvada, followed by a second\n      dose of Raltegravir 12 hours later. From the second day onward, participants will be\n      instructed to take Raltegravir 400 mg BID + Truvada once daily. The first dose should be\n      taken no more than 6 hours before or 6 hours after the expected or actual exposure and\n      continued for 28 days.\n\n      Enrolled subjects will also be instructed to report to the study site within 4 days of\n      beginning study drugs to respond to a CASI questionnaire and to have blood taken. They will\n      be instructed to return at the end of the 4-week chemoprophylaxis course for reevaluation\n      and to be given another 4-day supply of medication. Under no circumstances will any\n      participant be given a greater than 4 week supply of medication; all will be evaluated for\n      toxicity and adherence following each course of chemoprophylaxis.\n\n      The study participants will be monitored closely for safety after each course of\n      chemoprophylaxis and at the end of the trial. In addition, subjects will be instructed to\n      immediately contact the site if they experience certain symptoms consistent with severe\n      toxicity. At each evaluation a careful clinical history, physical examination, and\n      laboratory assessment, including HIV serology, will be completed. Adherence will be\n      estimated based on self-report and the use of pill counts.  During each visit, subjects will\n      be reminded of the need to not increase high-risk sexual behavior. HIV serology and response\n      to a CASI questionnaire will be conducted monthly."
