Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells\n      from dividing so they stop growing or die. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to\n      damage tumor cells. Combining chemotherapy and radiation therapy with the p53 gene may kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of gene therapy plus surgery followed by\n      cisplatin and radiation therapy in treating patients who have newly diagnosed resectable\n      stage III or stage IV cancer of the mouth or throat."

Patients also receive a third intraoperative Ad5CMV-p53 gene injection into the\n      neck dissection bed, where it is allowed to sit in place for 10 minutes.\n\n      Within 48-72 hours after surgery, patients receive a postoperative Ad5CMV-p53 gene injection\n      into each of two drainage catheters next to the mucosal suture line and neck dissection bed,\n      where it is allowed to sit in place for 2 hours.\n\n      Within 56 days after surgery, patients receive cisplatin IV over 30-90 minutes on days 1,\n      22, and 43 and radiotherapy on days 1-5, 8-12, 15-19, 22-26, 29-33, and 36-40. Patients may\n      receive 3 additional days of radiotherapy to high-risk areas on days 43-45.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-6 months for 2 years and then annually for 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 60 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
