Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing or\n      die. Drugs such as amifostine may protect normal cells from the side effects of chemotherapy\n      and radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of amifostine in treating side effects of\n      treatment in patients receiving radiation therapy and cisplatin for advanced head and neck\n      cancer."

Determine the efficacy of amifostine in alleviating treatment related\n      mucositis associated with targeted supradose cisplatin and concurrent radiotherapy (RADPLAT\n      protocol) in patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. II.\n      Determine the efficacy of amifostine in alleviating other treatment related morbidities\n      associated with this protocol in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study of amifostine. Patients receive external\n      beam radiotherapy 5 days a week for approximately 6.5-7.5 weeks. Concurrent with\n      radiotherapy, patients receive amifostine IV over 10 minutes, 30 minutes prior to cisplatin,\n      then cisplatin intra-arterially over 3-5 minutes. Chemotherapy and amifostine course is\n      repeated every week for 4 weeks. Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30 patients will be accrued into this study over 12-18\n      months."
