The investigator\n      will apply low frequency rTMS for 20 minutes 5 times a week for 3 weeks targeting the area\n      of brain which was involved in repetitive behaviors. The investigator will obtain clinical\n      measures of repetitive behaviors as well as social functioning pre and post treatment. As a\n      control and a cross-over condition , we will stimulate other area of brain which has nothing\n      to do with repetitive behaviors but may improve social functioning in autism spectrum\n      disorders. In addition to r TMS we will perform a pre and post treatment perfusion\n      functional MRI and obtain TMS measure of excitability of brain."
