Giving chemotherapy with a peripheral stem cell\n      transplant may allow more chemotherapy to be given so that more tumor cells are killed.\n\n      The design of this trial is a phase I/II trial of sequential accelerated chemotherapy cycles\n      with taxol/ifosfamide and carboplatin/etoposide administered with G-CSF and PBSC support.\n\n      PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of an intensive sequence of\n      chemotherapy drugs in patients with metastatic germ cell cancer. All of these chemotherapy\n      drugs are known to be active in this disease."

Autologous peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested on days\n           11-13. Filgrastim (G-CSF) is administered subcutaneously (SC) twice daily beginning 6\n           hours after completion of paclitaxel and ifosfamide infusions and continuing until the\n           last day of leukapheresis. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 2 courses in the\n           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Before beginning the first\n           course of chemotherapy, autologous bone marrow (ABM) is harvested, if possible, in case\n           insufficient peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) are harvested. Patients who were unable\n           to undergo harvest of ABM before the first course of chemotherapy undergo harvest of\n           ABM before beginning the second course of chemotherapy.\n\n        -  Part B : Beginning 2 weeks after completion of regimen A, patients receive etoposide IV\n           over 2 hours and carboplatin IV over 1 hour on days 1-3. PBSC are reinfused on day 5.\n           G-CSF is administered SC twice daily beginning 6 hours after completion of etoposide\n           and carboplatin infusions and continuing until blood counts recover. G-CSF is held on\n           the morning of PBSC transplantation and restarted beginning 6 hours after completion of\n           PBSC transplantation. Treatment continues every 2 weeks for 3 courses in the absence of\n           disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with insufficient PBSC for the\n           second course receive PBSC combined with ABM. Patients with insufficient PBSC for the\n           third course receive ABM.\n\n      During the second part, cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of carboplatin\n      until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose\n      preceding that at which 3 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      After completion of parts A and B, some patients may undergo resection of residual masses."
