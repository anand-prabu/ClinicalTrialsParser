    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effect of baricitinib on the levels of digoxin
      in the blood stream and how long it takes the body to remove digoxin.  This study will also
      look at how safe and well-tolerated baricitinib is when given at the same time as digoxin in
      healthy participants.  This study will last approximately 3-4 weeks.
