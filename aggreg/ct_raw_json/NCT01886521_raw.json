The underlying\n      assumption was, that the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) obtained from lumbar drains has a higher\n      concentration of blood than CSF from lumbar drains. The investigators decided to test this\n      assumption. In this study, the investigators will randomize patients to either placement of\n      a ventricular or a lumbar drain and analyze the CSF drainage on a daily basis."
