  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In animal and human studies, histochemical and physiological evidences showed that the
      muscle transferred from slow, fatigue-resistant muscle to fast, fatigable muscle after
      spinal cord injury. The alternation of muscular property was accompanied by the alternation
      of spinal circuitry property, and was related to the immobilization adaptation. Previous
      study showed that remobilization by continuous passive motion (CPM) for one month would
      restore the function of spinal circuitry in individual with chronic SCI. It is possible that
      long term application of CPM can reverse the adaptation of contractile properties of the
      paralyzed muscle after SCI. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a four
      month CPM training on muscular properties in individuals with chronic SCI.
