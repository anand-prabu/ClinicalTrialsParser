Microstructural changes characteristic of LTD processes, wear, and clinical\n      behaviour following standard parameters will be evaluated. Notably Raman spectroscopy and 3D\n      laser surface analysis will be used, directly on the restorations, which will be removed at\n      regular intervals.The working hypothesis is that LTD process is very slow at the scale at\n      the lifespan of dental prostheses."
