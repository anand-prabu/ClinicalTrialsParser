  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will determine the efficacy of a teaching program incorporating hybrid simulation
      in training practicing anesthesiologists on ultrasound (US)-guided continuous peripheral
      nerve block (CPNB).

      This study will also examine the extent of practice change following participation in a
      regional anesthesia teaching program incorporating hybrid simulation. In addition, this
      study will assess remaining obstacles to incorporating the use of US-guided perineural
      catheters through identifying potential future interventions and &quot;tool-kits&quot; for setting up
      perineural catheter programs.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study subjects will complete a pre-course survey to assess prior experience then participate
      in a standardized one-day workshop comprised of two sessions; 1) a didactic lecture and
      model scanning session and 2) a simulation session.  Quantitative and qualitative
      assessments will be performed using video analysis by two blinded reviewers after equipment
      orientation (baseline), following first session, and following second session.  Performance
      times, number of attempts, and composite scores for procedural performance and ergonomics
      will be analyzed within and between groups.  Every 3 months for one year, subjects will be
      surveyed to assess implementation of PNB in practice and identify remaining barriers.

    <description>The primary outcome is the change in composite score from baseline assessment based on the video analysis tool used by blinded reviewers. The baseline assessment at time 0 will take place after initial orientation to the simulation lab. This procedure will take approximately 15 min to perform and record. After the morning session of training (4 hours), the interval assessment at time 1 will take place in the same manner. The final assessment will take place following the entire course (8 hours total) according to the same procedures at time 2. Video recordings will be reviewed at a later date after completion of the training day.</description>

    <description>Starting 3 months after the workshop and every 3 months thereafter for one year, subjects will be sent an online practice assessment survey similar to the pre-course survey by the research assistant and will be asked to report their case logs.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Anesthesiologists in practice ten years or more; active board certification (American
             Board of Anesthesiologists); active license to practice medicine in California; and
             willingness to spend one full day (8 hours) participating in the standardized
             workshop and undergo interval survey and interview follow-up for one year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Formal training (e.g., post-graduate fellowship) in regional anesthesia; current
             practice includes the routine performance of US-guided PNB (≥10 blocks per month); or
             visual, hearing, or other communication impairment that would interfere with video
             recording or require substantial deviation from the standardized teaching curriculum.
