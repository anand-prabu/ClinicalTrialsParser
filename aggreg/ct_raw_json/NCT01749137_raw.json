Hormonal contraception\n             must have started at least 3 months prior to screening.  A female whose male partner\n             has had a vasectomy must agree to use one additional form of medically acceptable\n             contraception.  Patients must agree to practice the above birth control methods for\n             30 days after completion of study treatment as a safety precaution.\n\n         10.
