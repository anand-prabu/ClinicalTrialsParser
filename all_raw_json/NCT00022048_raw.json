Others find cancer cells\n      and help kill them or deliver cancer-killing substances to them.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase I/II trial is to see if bevacizumab works in treating patients who have\n      myelodysplastic syndrome."

Patients are stratified according to International\n      Prognostic Scoring System risk status (low (low or intermediate-1) vs high (intermediate-2\n      or high)).\n\n      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30-90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 2 weeks for 4-6\n      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 16-25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2 years."
