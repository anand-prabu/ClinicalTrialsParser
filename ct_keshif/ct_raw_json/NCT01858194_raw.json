RSDN  may be an effective tool for preventing ventricular arrhythmias, and\n      associated ICD therapies, by  reducing central sympathetic tone, catecholamine levels, and\n      the renin-angiotensin- aldosterone system and promoting ventricular remodeling. Although\n      RSDN has been shown to reduce the recurrence of VT in a case report of 2 patients suffering\n      from electrical storm, to date no large prospective randomized study has evaluated the\n      impact of RSDN in the prevention of recurrent VT in patients following catheter ablation of\n      VT with ischemic or non-ischemic ventricular dysfunction. This study will specifically\n      evaluate the safety and efficacy of adjunctive RSDN in the prevention of ICD therapy in\n      patients with ischemic or non-ischemic  ventricular dysfunction who are to receive a\n      catheter-based VT ablation."
