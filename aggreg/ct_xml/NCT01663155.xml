      The investigators would like to see if lung cancer screening with chest x-rays,computer
      aided detection (CAD)and a lose dose CT scan  can detect lung cancer in early stages when it
      is more responsive to treatment. The investigators would also like to see if early detection
      will reduce the incidence of symptomatic advanced lung cancer compared to no screening in
      former and current smokers with or without a family history of lung cancer who are 40-75
      years old.

    <textblock>
      The fight against lung cancer is waged on three major fronts: prevention, detection and
      treatment.  Our goal is to determine if chest x-rays,computer aided detection (CAD)and a CT
      scan  can detect disease earlier when treatment is more effective. If we improve the
      detection of disease, we will see if screening reduces the incidence of symptomatic advanced
      lung cancer relative to no screening in people at high risk to develop lung cancer.
