Prior use of\n             bisphosphonates is permitted.\n\n          -  No other prior malignancy is allowed except for the following: adequately treated\n             basal cell or squamous cell skin cancer, in situ cervical cancer, adequately treated\n             Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is currently in complete remission, or\n             any other cancer from which the patient has been disease-free for 2 years.\n\n          -  May not have history of poorly-controlled hypertension, diabetes mellitus, or any\n             other serious medical illness or psychiatric illness that could potentially interfere\n             with the completion of treatment according to this protocol or could be considered to\n             be an exclusion criterion deemed by the PI.\n\n          -  Pregnant or nursing women may not participate. Women of childbearing potential must\n             have a negative pregnancy test documented within 10 to 14 days of enrollment.\n             Women/men of reproductive potential may not participate unless they have either\n             agreed to practice true abstinence, when this is in line with the preferred and usual\n             lifestyle of the participant.

OR begin TWO reliable methods of birth control: 1 highly effective\n             method and 1 additional effective method AT THE SAME TIME, at least 28 days before\n             starting study treatment through 30 days after the last dose of study treatment.\n\n          -  Serologic evaluation will be used to assess exposure to syphilis, West Nile Virus,\n             Chagas, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Immunoglobulin G (IgG), hepatitis B, and C, HIV I and\n             II,  and human t cell lymphoma virus (HTLV) I/II.  Participants may not be hepatitis\n             B or C (+) unless positive due to previous vaccination or positive but has received\n             therapy and is negative for hepatitis B or C by rapid test polymerase chain reaction\n             (RT-PCR). An HIV-I/II(+) and HTLV-1/II (+) participant will be rejected on medical\n             grounds.
