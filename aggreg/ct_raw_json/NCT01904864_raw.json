To compare the adverse effects of treatment for IDA between ferrous sulfate and\n           NovaFerrum\u00ae\n\n        2. To compare normalization of iron stores as demonstrated by laboratory measures of IDA\n           (ferritin, TIBC, reticulocyte hemoglobin content) between subjects treated with ferrous\n           sulfate or NovaFerrum\u00ae\n\n        3. To compare the adherence to study medication between subjects on ferrous sulfate and\n           NovaFerrum\u00ae\n\n        4.
