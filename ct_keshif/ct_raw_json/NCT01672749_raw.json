This\n      study will compare two techniques of growth modulation: Standard dual growing rods versus\n      the new Luqu\u00e9 Trolley screws\n\n      Hypothesis: Patients treated with the DePuy Synthes TROLLEY system will undergo fewer\n      re-operations after 3 years of follow-up (FU) than patients included in the comparison group"
