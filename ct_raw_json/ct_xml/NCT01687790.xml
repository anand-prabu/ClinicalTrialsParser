  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary hypothesis of this project is that using molecular breast imaging (MBI) in
      evaluating women with equivocal mammographic or sonographic findings will demonstrate high
      specificity in distinguishing benign from malignant breast disease and, as a result,
      decrease the number of biopsies.

    <description>We will compare the outcome of the biopsies with the determinations made with the MBI examinations. The rate of unnecessary biopsies will be determined by the specificity and prevalence of cancer in the dataset. Thus, we formulate our primary statistical hypothesis in terms of a reduction in the false positive frequency (namely an improvement in specificity) of the pre-biopsy diagnostic work-up that includes MBI.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  18 years of age or older

          -  Women who have indeterminate mammographic or sonographic findings who are recommended
             and for biopsy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Known contraindication to mammographic imaging

          -  women who are pregnant

          -  women who are lactating

          -  women who have significant existing breast trauma

          -  women who have breast implants

          -  Women under 18 years of age.

          -  women who had previous benign breast surgery within 1 year

          -  Males and children

          -  Women who are unable to understand or execute written informed consent

          -  Women who refuse to have a biopsy

          -  Women with any known renal disease - if an MRI is deemed necessary, a serum creatine
             will be checked prior to injection of contrast. Using the National Kidney Foundation
             recommendations, a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) greater than 60 may safely
             receive intravenous gadolinium-based MRI contrast. Those individuals with a GFR &gt;30
             and &lt;60 can receive the contrast but at a reduced dose (typically half). Those with a
             GFR &lt;30 will not receive MRI contrast and will not undergo the exam. Breast MRI must
             be done with contrast if evaluating for cancer. Several factors can affect the GFR
             such as age, body size, creatinine, renal status and will be calculated from the
             blood drawn. GFR is the final determinant and a creatinine greater than 1.6 usually
             has a GFR that precludes a Breast MRI with contrast. The final determinant will be
             the GFR.
