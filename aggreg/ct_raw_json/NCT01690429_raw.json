A pulse wave\n      amplitude decrease (PWAD) is considered to be a marker for autonomic activation. Detecting\n      the PWAD is a surrogate marker for waking reactions (arousal) which eventually will\n      contribute to assess sleep disruption and resulting performance deterioration. Arousal and\n      performance deterioration and its possible improvement under continuous positive airway\n      pressure (CPAP) therapy will be determined in this study."

The\n      Somnocheck micro records oxygen saturation as well as pulse frequency and breathing, and\n      calculates an autonomic arousal index (AAI). Somnocheck measurements will take place in two\n      nights (baseline and with CPAP) and parallel to a standard polysomnography (PSG). The PSG\n      provides data to analyze the arousal frequency according to ASDA rules, which will then be\n      compared to the AAI.\n\n      Performance is determined twice (prior and after CPAP therapy) by the use of a steering\n      simulator programme (DASS). Differences in arousal will be correlated with differences in\n      performance (deviation from the road, reaction time). The subjects are also asked to fill\n      out the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS) twice, prior and after therapy. Aim is to compare\n      Somnocheck and PSG measurements and daytime sleepiness with DASS and ESS."
