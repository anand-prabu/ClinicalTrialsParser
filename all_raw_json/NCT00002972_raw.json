Patients are treated for a minimum of 2 cycles unless serious toxicity or\n      complication occur.\n\n      Disease is assessed every 6 weeks until documented progression; treatment side effects are\n      assessed separately for each cycle of therapy. Treatment is given up to a maximum of 6\n      cycles of therapy or until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient refusal\n      occurs.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 16 or 25 patients will be accrued."
