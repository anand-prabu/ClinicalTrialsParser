      This is an observational study in which data will be collected from a group of patients with
      retinal diseases such as Dry Macular Degeneration, RetinitisPigmentosa, and Stargardt's
      Disease, who have opted to receive Microcurrent Stimulation Therapy as an alternative
      treatment for their retinal condition.
