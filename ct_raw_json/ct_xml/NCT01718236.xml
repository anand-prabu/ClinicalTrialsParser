  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to introduce into clinical practice for Caesarean section conducted under
      general anesthesia with the rapid induction myorelaxation with rocuronium and the reversal
      of neuromuscular blockade by using sugammadex. The aim is to demonstrate at least the same
      efficiency and confirm the safety of the procedure for both mother and newborn compared with
      older procedure.

      Project &quot;Modern myorelaxation procedure and reversal of neuromuscular blockade during
      general anesthesia for caesarean section&quot; aims to introduce  in other indications for rapid
      induction of general anesthesia common and safe, alternative method of combining
      short-acting intravenous anesthetics propofol and fast-onset non-depolarizing muscle
      relaxant rocuronium into the clinical practice and demonstrate the efficacy and safety in
      this indication. At the same time to demonstrate the benefits of using modern reversal of
      neuromuscular blockade by sugammadex in termination the caesarean section under general
      anesthesia. Both procedures will be monitored by clinical observation, monitoring
      instrumentation and laboratory examination of mother and fetus (newborn) in various stages
      of peripartal period. The main benefit of this procedure will be in particular risk groups
      of mothers which are indicated by Caesarean Section while neuraxial blockade is
      contraindicated.

    <description>Quality: Rapid induction to general anesthesia with administration propofol and rocuronium for termination the pregnancy by Caesarean section are at least as good as the combination of propofol and succinylcholine iodide.Recording and evaluated will be the time from the beginning as the first drug in the rapid induction to general anesthesia will be administered until the discovery of the first wave of  etCO2 after successful intubation (seconds), evaluation of intubation conditions (resistance to laryngoscopy, position of the vocal cords, response to the intubation attempt (limbs movement  or cough) scored 1-3 according to level terms, conditions, entry scores for direct visualization of the vocal cords by Cormack-Lehane (I-IV)</description>

    <description>Economics: After reversal of neuromuscular blockade using sugammadex are procedure time and turnovers shorter than the use of neostigmine in the recommended dosage for patients undergoing termination of pregnancy by Caesarean section. Recording and evaluated will be the total procedure time until the recovery from neuromuscular blockade to the level of TOF ratio of 0.9, the administration of the recovery dose will in group ROCSUG in the case for posttetanic count mode in the level of PTC1, 2 at a dose of sugammadex 4mg/kg , the TOF count 1.2 sugammadex at a dose of 2 mg / kg, in the case of failure to achieve these values the anesthesiologist wil wait with the administration of the recovery dose for their achievement. In group SUCNEO for achieving TOF count 1.2 and higher, the dose of atropine  to 0.01 mg / kg and neostigmine 0.03 mg / kg will be administered.</description>
