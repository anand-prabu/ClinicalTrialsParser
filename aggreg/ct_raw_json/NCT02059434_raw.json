One dose level will be\n      administered per week with 2 to 3 weeks between each dose level for the safety and\n      pharmacokinetic data review.\n\n      Part two: A 5-way , crossover, single dose study (of LAS190792 [two doses], indacaterol,\n      tiotropium and placebo) in 40 male and non-childbearing potential women subjects with\n      moderate to severe COPD. Each treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at\n      least 7 to 14 days. The aim is to ensure at least 30 subjects complete Part 2 of the study.\n      The primary comparison for bronchodilation will be between LAS190792 doses and placebo.\n      Other treatment comparisons (indacaterol or tiotropium vs placebo and LAS190792 vs\n      indacaterol or tiotropium) will be considered additional."
