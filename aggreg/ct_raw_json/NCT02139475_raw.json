Through this, ultimately in\n      patients with a history of colorectal cancer who have high risk of colorectal cancer, it\n      could be possible to detect cancerous lesions early and increase the survival rate.\n\n      This study is based on observational study Subjects are the patients with colorectal cancer\n      surgery who visits the out patients clinic for follow-up colonoscopy The patient's medical\n      records on the basis of information collected at the point of the colonoscopy performed\n      Quality of bowel cleansing is calculated with the Boston bowel preparation scale Patient\n      compliance and satisfaction are measured."
