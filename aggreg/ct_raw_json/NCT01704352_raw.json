The aim is to compare cognitive\n      behavioral therapy added to 'treatment as usual' with just 'treatment as usual'. The\n      investigators hypothesize that cognitive behavioral therapy will improve quality of sleep,\n      stabilize minor mood variations and prevent new mood episodes in euthymic patients with\n      bipolar disorder and insomnia."
