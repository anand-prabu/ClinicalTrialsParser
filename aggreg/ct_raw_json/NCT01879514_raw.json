In terms of differences in prognosis, severe IgA nephropathy,one of the most\n      main primary renal disease,could cause the uremia. It will be significant that early\n      indicators of prognosis and early intervention can be normalized and the scientific criteria\n      for judging the efficacy of great clinical can be established. The subject based on the past\n      study,literature research and various treatment will take the method of multi-center,\n      double-blind, randomized, control to investigate the standard treatment of severe IgA\n      nephropathy. Otherwise the uniformity and objectivity of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM)\n      will be improved by the standardization of TCM research based on the epidemiological\n      investigation and statistical analysis. The subject will determine the efficacy of more\n      sensitive biomarkers and establish more scientific criteria for judging the effect with the\n      application of urine proteomics and metabolomics technologies in order to operate in the\n      formation of the standardization program of the treatment of severe IgA nephropathy with the\n      Integrative medicine of TCM."
