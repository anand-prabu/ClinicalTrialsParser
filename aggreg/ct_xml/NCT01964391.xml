    <textblock>
      This phase IIIb, open-label, multinational, multicenter study will evaluate the patient's
      satisfaction and safety with subcutaneously administered Herceptin (trastuzumab) in patients
      with HER2-positive early breast cancer. Patients will receive Herceptin 600 mg administered
      subcutaneously every 3 weeks in the adjuvant or neo-adjuvant plus adjuvant setting for 18
      cycles (1 year), unless disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs. The Herceptin
      regimen could include mono- and/or combination therapy.
