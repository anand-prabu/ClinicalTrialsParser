In this context, noninvasive\n      ventilation (NIV) has been used to minimize such impairment, increasing functional capacity\n      Aim: To evaluate the impact of NIV on exercise performance in HF individuals. Methods: A\n      randomized crossover clinical trial with allocation concealment consisted of two\n      experimental phases: NIV and control, 7 days apart of each other. During NIV phase, 30\n      minutes of bi-level ventilation was performed. Any type of ventilator support was offered\n      during control phase. Functional capacity was assessed by cardiopulmonary exercise test on a\n      treadmill."
