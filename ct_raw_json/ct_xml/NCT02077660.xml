    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the beneficial effects of a long term (12 weeks)
      green tea drinking on plasma, erythrocytes and saliva oxidative stress biomarkers and
      antioxidant capacity, as well as on cardiometabolic risk factors: anthropometric,
      inflammation and metabolic parameters in a healthy aging men and women.

      A prospective, crossover trial in which every individual served its own control. All
      subjects undergo a four weeks washout period, during which they briefed to avoid tea
      drinking and antioxidant supplements until the end of the study. At the end of the washout
      period, blood and saliva samples is collected after 12 hours of night fast. Subsequently,
      all subjects receive the maltodextrin containing placebo &quot;tea bags&quot;. The subjects instructed
      to brew the placebo sachets for five minute in 240 mL boiling water without stirring and to
      drink 4 cups per day for 12 weeks period (placebo period). After the placebo period, fasting
      samples collected once more and the subjects receive the green tea bags. Preparation and
      drinking instructions are the same as the placebo drink. At the end of the 12 weeks, green
      tea drinking, fasting blood and saliva samples drawn for the third time. During the study,
      every 4 weeks the subjects get additional placebo or green tea bags.  Assessment of
      nutritional consumption of macronutrients and antioxidants using a food diary, physical
      activity lifestyle as well as weight, body fat and circumference measurements is made at the
      beginning, middle and end of the study.
