    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to conduct a randomized controlled trial comparing an
      intervention group and a control/wait list group to evaluate the feasibility of the

    <description>We are using the  Nursing Child Assessment Satellite Training Teaching Scales to assess quality of caregiver-child interactions. Caregivers select an activity that their child cannot perform, such as drawing, and spend up to 5 minutes teaching this activity to the child. The interaction is video-recorded and coded for the caregiver's sensitivity to cues, response to distress, and fostering of social, emotional, and cognitive growth, as well as for the child's clarity of cues and responsiveness to the caregiver.</description>

    <description>Caregiver helplessness is measured by the Caregiving Helplessness Questionnaire, comprising 45 items specific to interactions with the child. We evaluate 2 subscales for this study: Mother-Child Frightened and Mother Helplessness (&quot;mother&quot; is changed to &quot;caregiver&quot;)</description>

    <description>The intervention consists of delivering the Promoting First Relationship (PFR) program. PFR comprises 10 sessions and lasts approximately 12 weeks. Each session lasts approximately 30 minutes, and begins with brief (~10 min) discussions and education on the target topic for that week . The remaining 20 minutes will alternate between video recording a structured interaction between the caregiver and child or viewing the previous session's recording and engaging in reflective discussion about successful caregiving strategies and child's response to caregiver behavior. Trained PFR specialists who are community members use the 5 &quot;consultation strategies,&quot; labeled Joining, Positive Feedback, Instructive Feedback, Reflective Questions and Comments, and Instruction with Handouts.</description>
