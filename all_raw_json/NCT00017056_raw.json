Determine the clinical activity of BMS-247550 in terms of response rate in\n      patients with recurrent metastatic gastric cancer previously treated with a fluoropyrimidine\n      or platinum regimen. II. Determine the safety of this drug in this patient population. III.\n      Determine the duration of response, time to progression, and survival of patients treated\n      with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive BMS-247550 IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n      Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression\n      or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a complete response (CR) receive up to 4\n      additional courses after CR. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 21-58 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months."
