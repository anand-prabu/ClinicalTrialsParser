            "textblock": "Liver fibrosis has been considered as irreversible change. However, recent study showed that\n      early stage liver fibrosis could be reversible and a lot of new drugs are now developing or\n      developed including anti-viral treatment. Liver biopsy is considered as golden standard for\n      the evaluation of liver fibrosis. But biopsy specimen through biopsy only consists of\n      1/50000 of the whole liver and heterogeneity of liver fibrosis, accurate diagnosis of liver\n      fibrosis is still challenging. Furthermore, its invasive nature, repeated biopsy is\n      practically almost impossible. Hence, non-invasive diagnosis of liver fibrosis is important.\n      In this study we hypothesized that multi-parametric MR imaging including MR elastography,\n      conventional DWI, and IVIM can predict changes of liver stiffness after anti-viral therapy\n      in patients with chronic liver disease. We will enroll 60 biopsy-proven patients and perform\n      multi-parametric MR imaging at the enrollment and one year later to evaluate changes in\n      quantitative values in MR."
