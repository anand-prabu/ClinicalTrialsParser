            "textblock": "Alzheimer's disease is a devastating neurodegenerative disorder, for which there is\n      currently no effective treatment to slow or halt progression. Beta amyloid peptide\n      accumulates in the brains of those with Alzheimer's, and is thought to play a major role in\n      triggering the dementia. The investigators recently characterized a molecular pathway by\n      which \u00df-amyloid damages neurons, and showed that the protein termed Fyn kinase is crucial.\n      Our data suggest that blocking Fyn will have a significant therapeutic benefit for\n      Alzheimer's. Astra Zeneca has developed a blocker of Fyn and related kinases (AZD0530) for\n      the treatment of cancer. Chronic AZD0530 administration is well tolerated in humans, and the\n      investigators propose to test its potential as a novel Alzheimer's disease modifying\n      therapy. This study will assess the safety and tolerability of AZD0530 in patients with\n      Alzheimer's disease."
