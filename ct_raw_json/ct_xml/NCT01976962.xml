  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To improve radiation therapy of prostate cancer, the investigators must be able to
      accurately identify the tumour.  By using advanced functional imaging techniques available
      on state-of-the-art MRI scanners to clearly show the specific location of the tumour inside
      the prostate, the investigators can use advanced radiation therapy techniques to
      specifically target the tumor and control it with as few radiotherapy clinic visits as
      possible. This is different than current techniques which treat the whole prostate gland to
      the same dose, delivered over 7-8 weeks of daily radiotherapy visits. By increasing the
      radiation dose to the active tumor while still maintaining adequate radiation dose to the
      rest of the prostate, the investigators hope to better control prostate cancer and reduce
      complications to nearby normal tissues.

      This project combines advances in functional imaging of prostate cancer and
      hypofractionation through stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT), with an aim to improve
      tumour control and reduce or maintain normal tissue complications.  The strategy will make
      use of the combined effectiveness of several functional imaging approaches to identify the
      dominant lesion(s) within the prostate. An SBRT treatment plan will be designed which
      utilizes 5 fractions to treat the entire prostate gland with an additional boost to the
      dominant lesion.  The lower dose to the entire prostate should reduce normal tissue
      complications but still be effective in treating prostate cancer while the increased dose to
      the dominant lesion should improve tumour control. The use of only 5 fractions will reduce
      the number of patient visits, thus reducing overall treatment costs.
