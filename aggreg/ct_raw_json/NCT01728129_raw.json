            "textblock": "In Operations Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom (OIF/OEF), over 60% of combat casualties\n      have been the result of explosive blasts, and many of these critical injuries involve trauma\n      to the head. As a result, traumatic brain injury (TBI) has been deemed a \"signature wound\"\n      of OIF and OEF. The symptoms of head injuries, particularly of concussion/mild TBI (mTBI),\n      can be sever but subtle, suggesting that early and accurate diagnosis is paramount to a\n      wounded warrior's appropriate medical care. Most first providers in the war theater are\n      medics who could benefit from an improved diagnostic test to better identify service members\n      with concussion/mTBI. The MACE cognitive test is heavily weighted towards memory, is not\n      100% specific, and does not preclude a diagnosis of concussion being rendered despite a\n      score in the normal range. Thus, an objective test of neurocognitive function, such as the\n      DANA Rapid, that can be rapidly administered in theater by a combat medic would be highly\n      beneficial to accurate clinical diagnosis and timely treatment. The results of the present\n      study will provide information on the predictive value of the newly developed DANA handheld\n      computer in assisting in the diagnosis of concussion in service members who have been blast\n      exposed. If the DANA Rapid exam proves to be equally or more accurate than the MACE in\n      detecting cognitive deficits, these tests and the handheld computer will also contribute to\n      improved health care for service members by minimizing the time between injury and\n      diagnosis."
