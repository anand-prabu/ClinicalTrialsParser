Females on hormone\n             replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to\n             use one of the contraception methods listed in the protocol if they wish to continue\n             their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow\n             confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study enrollment. For most forms of\n             HRT, at least 2-4 weeks will elapse between the cessation of therapy and the blood\n             draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage of HRT. Following confirmation of\n             their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of HRT during the study without use\n             of a contraceptive method.\n\n          -  Male subjects with female partners of child-bearing potential must agree to use one\n             of the contraception methods listed in the protocol.
