Topotecan also inhibits the replication of HIV-1 and the\n      function of Tat (which upregulates the replication of JC virus).\n\n      Patients are randomized to be treated immediately with topotecan or to have treatment\n      delayed for 8 weeks. The dosing schedule for patients receiving immediate or delayed\n      treatment is topotecan as a continuous 21-day intravenous infusion every 28 days. All\n      patients must have received optimal, stable antiretroviral therapy for 3 weeks prior to\n      entry and preferably will continue that therapy during the study."
