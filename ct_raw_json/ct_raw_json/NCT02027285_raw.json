It could be hypothesized that an inadequate nutritional status may amplify\n      the effects of a low-grade chronic inflammation associated with age influencing the\n      functionality of the immune systems, the resistance to infections, the cognitive function\n      and contributing to an increased morbidity and mortality. Indeed experimental evidence\n      indicate that improving the nutritional status attenuates the decline in immune and\n      cognitive functions, in physical performance associated with age by helping to improve the\n      level of Quality of Life.\n\n      Therefore, the present study focus on nutrients and micronutrient which have a role in\n      fighting oxidative stress, in the regulation of inflammatory responses and the immune\n      system."
