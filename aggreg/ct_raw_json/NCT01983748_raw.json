Tumor\n             material has to be stored appropriately in RNAlater solution for RNA preparation.\n\n          -  The patient has to be free of detectable tumor at the time point of study enrollment\n             (adjuvant setting), as assessed by clinical inspection, abdominal sonography, chest\n             X-ray and evaluation of the tumor-marker S-100..\n\n          -  Patients must have a WHO performance status of 0, 1 or 2 and must be in stable\n             medical condition.\n\n          -  Patients must be between 18 and 75 years old and must be able and willing to give\n             informed consent.\n\n          -  Women of child-bearing age must have a negative pregnancy test, and must oblige to\n             use effective contraception until at least 4 weeks after the last vaccination.\n\n          -  Patients must be willing to get hospitalized for at least 4 hours following\n             vaccination(s), and to cooperate for the whole period of the trial.\n\n          -  Patients must have fully recovered from surgery.\n\n          -  Signed informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Any other major serious illness [e.g. active systemic infections, immunodeficiency\n             disease, clinically significant heart disease, respiratory disease, bleeding\n             disorders, cancer etc.] or a contraindication to leukapheresis.\n\n          -  Evidence for HIV-1, HIV -2, HTLV-1, HBV, or HCV infection.\n\n          -  Active autoimmune disease (such as but not limited to Lupus erythematosus, autoimmune\n             thyroiditis or uveitis, multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease). Vitiligo and\n             pathological laboratory results (autoantibodies) without clinical symptoms are,\n             however, not an exclusion criterion.\n\n          -  Previous splenectomy or radiation therapy to the spleen.\n\n          -  Patients with organ allografts.\n\n          -  Concomitant treatment with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, any investigational drug and\n             paramedical substances.

If pregnancy occurs during the\n             course of the trial to female patients in arm A or B, the patient has to be excluded.\n\n          -  Detection of metastases.
