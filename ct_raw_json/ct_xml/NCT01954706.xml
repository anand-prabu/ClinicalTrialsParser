  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormone receptor-positive tumors are the most common breast cancers in postmenopausal women,
      and drug therapies, which block the production or effects of estrogen, are the mainstay of
      treatment in these patients.  Due to their effectiveness in postmenopausal women, aromatase
      inhibitors (AIs) are the standard of care for long-term estrogen suppression in these
      patients.  Estrogen deficiency, however, results in multiple side effects.  Some of the most
      common side effects in women taking AIs are joint and muscle aches, which promote physical
      deconditioning.  Because of the long term use of AIs in postmenopausal breast cancer
      patients and the improvements in cancer-related outcomes that are observed with their use,
      identifying methods to reduce these side effects to maintain adherence to treatment is
      important.  Exercise interventions in breast cancer patients also improve quality of life
      and reduce fatigue.  Understanding the role of exercise in AI side effect prevention will
      allow us to translate these findings into therapy guidelines.
