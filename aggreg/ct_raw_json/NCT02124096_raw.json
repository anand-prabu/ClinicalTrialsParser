Researchers want to know\n      more about how the flu is transmitted from animals to people. If they know more about it,\n      they can find better ways to prevent the flu and treat people who get sick from it.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To discover if flu viruses can be found in people exposed to pigs at Ohio agricultural\n      fairs.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Volunteers 8 years of age and older who exhibit pigs at Ohio agricultural fairs.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Before or on the first day of the fair, participants will fill out a short demographic\n           and medical history form. They will also complete a two-page symptom questionnaire.\n           This is a form that asks them about any flu symptoms they might have.\n\n        -  Participants will have a nasal swab performed. The inside of the participant   s nose\n           will be rubbed with a swab to collect nasal fluid.\n\n        -  Researchers will see participants 2 days later and 4 days later. During these visits,\n           participants will again fill out a symptom questionnaire and have a nasal swab."

            "textblock": "The bidirectional transmission of influenza A viruses between animals and humans are clearly\n      an important part of the complex dynamics of influenza evolution, however a thorough\n      understanding of this process remains a mystery.  The role of swine in overall human\n      influenza evolution is unclear, but a long history of the study of swine origin influenza\n      has revealed that influenza evolves in swine populations both in North America and Europe.\n\n      In 2009, a pandemic occurred with the emergence of the H1N1 pandemic (pdm) virus which was\n      found to have originated from both a North American and European swine lineage, again\n      reinforcing how viruses evolving in swine can lead to important human pathogens.\n      Interestingly this virus was transmitted back into swine and birds in North America.  In\n      2011, an H3N2 swine origin influenza virus known as the H3N2v and containing the H1N1pdm\n      matrix genomic segment was reported causing human infections in multiple parts of the US.\n      In 2012, these cases increased, especially during the summer months.  Since 2011, 321\n      confirmed cases have been reported from 13 states including 107 cases in Ohio.  Almost all\n      of these cases have been linked to swine exposure on farms or at agricultural fairs.\n\n      Study of these zoonotic transmission events at agricultural fairs are necessary in order to\n      better understand how and why these events occur, how human pathogens emerge, and how to\n      potentially prevent events from occurring. These events could lead to new pandemics and\n      epidemics so their prevention is crucial.  The goal of this study is to examine rates of\n      bidirectional zoonotic transmission at Ohio agricultural fairs.  Through collection of\n      viruses and host samples, we hope to begin to answer questions regarding how viruses cross\n      species barriers, adapt to new hosts, and how these events could impact overall influenza\n      virus evolution."
