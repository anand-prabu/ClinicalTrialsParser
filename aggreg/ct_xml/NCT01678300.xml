  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this protocol is:

        1. To quantify the prevalence of adherence to topical mesalamine in patients with UC

        2. To describe the determinants of medication adherence in patients with UC prescribed
           topical mesalamine
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patient adherence with topical mesalamine is low. Behavioral and psycho-social barriers to
      topical mesalamine adherence exist in patients with UC. These factors can be identified
      using qualitative testing in order to develop and design appropriate behavioral
      interventions to reduce non-adherence.

      The investigators will undertake an observational study of medication persistence in 100
      patients in the BIDMC clinic, &quot;Persistence Cohort&quot;. Persistence will be measured using
      12-month pharmacy refill data. The investigators will also employ a qualitative research
      design with discrete choice modeling in two phases:  Phase I - Initial Interviews with 10
      patients and Phase II - Focus Groups (2) with 5 patients each.
