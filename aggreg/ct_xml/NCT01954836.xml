      Hypothesis: Fasting before (48h) and one day after chemotherapy may protect normal cells
      from the adverse effects of chemotherapy. Design: Within a randomized controlled pilot trial
      30 female patients with gynecological cancer (ovarian and breast cancer)and 4-6 scheduled
      chemotherapies will be randomized to fast 60-72 hours during the first half of
      chemotherapies or during the second half of chemotherapies and to proceed normocaloric food
      intake during the other cycles.Sequence of fasting and normocaloric food intake will be
      randomized. Assessments of adverse effects, quality of life and laboratory values take place
      24 and 7 days after each chemotherapy. Statistical analyses compare summarized differences
      of fasted and non-fasted chemotherapy cycles.

    <textblock>
      Evidence from experimental animals provides strong support for the concept that caloric
      restriction (CR) increases resistance to multiple forms of stress. CR decreases plasma
      levels of growth factors, e.g. insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), thereby diverting
      energy from growth to maintenance. Accordingly, the currently available information suggests
      that short-term fasting protects normal cells against the perils of (high dose)
      chemotherapy. In contrast, cancer cells are not (or less) protected as a result of their
      self-sufficiency in growth signals. This phenomenon is termed Differential Stress Resistance
      (DSR). DSR may reduce the severity of adverse effects caused by chemotherapy, without
      interfering with its anti-tumoral effects. A first case series of 10 cancer patients,
      suggested that short-term fasting may also protect against the side effects of chemotherapy
      in humans. This study aims to further evaluate the impact of short-term fasting on tolerance
      to chemotherapy in humans.Within a randomized controlled pilot trial 30 female patients with
      gynecological cancer disease (ovarian and breast cancer)in all stages and 4-6 scheduled
      chemotherapies will be randomized to fast 60-72 hours during half of chemotherapies and to
      have normocaloric food intake during the other chemotherapies. Fasting is defined as caloric
      restriction to below 400kcal energy intake/day with free intake of water and tea. Sequences
      of fasting and normocaloric food intake will be randomized. Assessments of adverse effects,
      quality of life, fatigue and laboratory values will take place 24 and 7 days after each
      chemotherapy. Statistical analyses will compare the summarized differences of fasted and
      non-fasted chemotherapy cycles, that means a total of max. 60-90 chemotherapies with
      accompanying fasting will be compared to 60-90 non-fasted chemotherapies.
