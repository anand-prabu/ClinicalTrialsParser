Nevertheless,\n      there is still a widespread conviction that the overall high energy density and\n      concentration of long-chain saturated fatty acids (SFA) present in dairy have detrimental\n      health effects, contributing to the progression of cardiovascular disease, obesity and\n      diabetes.\n\n      Supplementation of the bovine diet with a source of MUFA, such as rapeseed oil, has become\n      an achievable strategy in order to reduce the amount of SFA present in dairy products.\n\n      The aim of this project is to observe the effects of three types of dairy products (UHT\n      milk, cheese and butter) produced from milk derived from cows fed with rapeseed oil, on CVD\n      risk biomarkers and plasma total cholesterol levels in adults with a >10% risk of developing\n      CVD. The aim is to determine whether an isoenergetic exchange of dairy products will affect\n      vascular function and CVD biomarkers."
