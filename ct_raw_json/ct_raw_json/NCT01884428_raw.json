However, if one out of 3 patients will\n      develop a DLT, the same dose-level will be administered to three additional patients for one\n      cycle. If no one of those additional patients will experience a DLT, dose escalation will\n      continue. If more than one over 3 or 6 patients will develop a DLT after the first cycle in\n      any cohort, MTD will be reached. Six further patients will be treated at the lower dose in\n      order to obtain more information about the optimal dose for phase II trials and to\n      characterize pharmacokinetic profiles of this combination. If DLT will be found at level 1\n      (20 mg), 3 patients will be treated at dose -1 (10 mg). If no more than 1 patient experience\n      toxicity, other 3 patients will be treated to assess more information about pharmacokinetic\n      profiles and safety."
