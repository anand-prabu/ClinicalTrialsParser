This will\n      allow us to identify some patients most at risk of morphine-induced adverse drug reactions,\n      and thus to adapt morphine titration and monitoring of these patients. Leading to a better\n      understanding and a better prediction of adverse effects in patients, it is possible that\n      part of the \"opiophobia\" which persists in emergency services disappear. Finally, it is\n      toward a better security but also a better efficiency in the management of pain patients in\n      emergencies that leads this study.\n\n      The secondary objectives are:\n\n      To determine the frequency and severity of adverse events related to morphine. To establish\n      an inventory of morphine use in emergency departments in the different centres studied."
