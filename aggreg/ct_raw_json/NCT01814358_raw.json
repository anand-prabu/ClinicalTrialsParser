            "textblock": "Risk for heart and blood vessel diseases is increased when blood sugar rises. Blood vessel\n      dysfunction is common to such diseases. Elevated blood sugar after eating promotes blood\n      vessel dysfunction. Dietary factors other than carbohydrates influence rises and falls in\n      blood sugar. Dietary protein is associated with improved blood sugar control. Whey protein\n      effectively blunts the rise in blood sugar after consuming a carbohydrate rich drink/meal in\n      normal weight and obese adults. This study will investigate the efficacy of drinking a whey\n      protein beverage prior to eating for improved daily blood sugar control in normal weight and\n      obese adults in the \"real world.\" Also, the study will test this dietary approach to reduce\n      blood vessel dysfunction associated with eating a meal that causes blood sugar to rise. 24\n      normal weight and 24 obese men and premenopausal women (18-50y) will participate. Subjects\n      will wear a sensor to monitor daily blood sugar changes in response to their typically\n      consumed diets for 2 days. Subjects will report to the UCLA CTRC the morning after the\n      monitoring period for measurement of blood vessel function after eating a breakfast cereal\n      meal. Blood samples will be obtained before and after the meal to measure relevant health\n      markers. Subjects will repeat the 2-day diet and breakfast cereal meal challenge after a\n      week or more, and will consume either a chocolate flavored 1) whey protein or 2) gelatin\n      protein (control) shake prior to each meal. Neither subjects nor researchers will know which\n      protein (\"double blind\"). Subjects will receive the alternate protein intervention after\n      another week or more (\"crossover\"). We think drinking the protein shake prior to meals will\n      reduce daily blood sugar rises and falls after eating and blunt the blood vessel dysfunction\n      that results from eating the breakfast cereal."
