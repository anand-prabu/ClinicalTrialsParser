    <textblock>
      The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the effectiveness of complete wound healing in a
      prospective, open-label, case-matched cohort-controlled trial in which pressure ulcers will
      be treated using AutoloGel and standard care and case-matched against a concurrent cohort of
      patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a common problem in all patient care settings, especially
      long-term acute care facilities and nursing homes. AutoloGel is a platelet-rich plasma gel
      used in the treatment of non-healing chronic wounds. The results of AutoloGel to date when
      used to treat PUs have been promising. The aim of this trial is to demonstrate the
      effectiveness of complete wound healing in a prospective, open-label, case-matched cohort
      trial in which pressure ulcers will be treated using AutoloGel and standard of care to
      determine time to heal at 16 weeks. Comparison will be made with a case matched concurrent
      cohort of patients receiving undefined Usual and Customary Care.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Medicare/Medicaid eligible

          2. ≥18 years of age

          3. Ulcer of pressure/shear etiology (Stage II, III, and IV, see Appendix 9 for stage
             definitions)

          4. The largest non-healing wound, if multiple wounds are present, or the single wound to
             be treated (Index Ulcer) that is located on the heel, ischium, sacrum, and trochanter

          5. For subjects with potentially multiple eligible PUs, the largest ulcer will be
             selected.

             There must be at least 4 cm between the Index Ulcer and other ulcers; if all ulcers
             are closer than 4 cm, the subject should not be enrolled (screen failure)

          6. Debrided ulcer size between 3 cm2 and 200 cm2

          7. Demonstrated adequate offloading regimen

          8. Duration ≥ 1 month at first visit

          9. Subject must be willing to comply with the Protocol, which will be assessed by
             enrolling clinician.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects known to be sensitive to AutoloGel components (calcium chloride, thrombin,
             ascorbic acid) and/or materials of bovine origin

          2. Stage I pressure ulcers

          3. Ulcers that are unstageable or of deep tissue morphology that have yet to become an
             open wound

          4. Presence of another wound that is concurrently treated and might interfere with
             treatment of index wound by AutoloGel

          5. Ulcer not of PU pathophysiology (e.g., pure diabetic, vasculitic, radiation,
             rheumatoid, collagen vascular disease, venous, or arterial etiology)

          6. Any malignancy other than non-melanoma skin cancer

          7. Subjects who are cognitively impaired and do not have a healthcare proxy

          8. Serum albumin of less than 2.5 g/dL

          9. Plasma Platelet count of less than 100 x 109/L

         10. Hemoglobin of less than 10.5 g/dL

         11. Subject has inadequate venous access for repeated blood draw required for AutoloGel
             Administration.

        10. Life expectancy of &lt; 6 months.
