The aim of this study to determine the effects of\n      routine drainage compared to no drainage in thyroidectomy  patients.\n\n      Study Design : Total of 400 patients who undergoing total thyroidectomy or lobectomy for\n      thyroidal disorders will be randomly allocated to be drained or not. Postoperative\n      ultrasonographic (USG) neck examination will be performed for all patients on postoperative\n      24th hour by the same ultrasonologist each time. Postoperative pain, complications and\n      hospital stay will be recorded.  The statistical analysis will be performed and p<0,05 will\n      be accepted as an important statistical value (SPSS 16.0 for Windows)."

We don't use drain routinely in standard thyroidectomy in our clinic for seven years. Bleeding and reoperation rates are similar between the literature and our clinic.  The amount of fluid collection in thyroid bed will be assessed by Ultrasonography in postoperative 24th hours.
