Therefore, management outside hospital, especially the regular\n      administration of drugs, is vital to prevent the recurrence of cardiovascular events.\n      However, most patients often fail to stay on a long-term administration regimen, especially\n      the administration of statins. According to the statistics, the average duration adhered\n      with statin in patients with ACS is less than 3 months, use of statin at hospital discharge\n      was only 80% and 65% in 6 month, with a very low LDL-C control rate (about 11% at 6 months),\n      which poses a threat to the recurrence rate of cardiovascular events in patients with ACS.\n\n      It was found in previous studies that there were many factors influencing patients'\n      compliance, in which patients' refusing to take medicine accounted for a higher proportion.\n      It suggests that patient had not recognized the importance of long-term administration.\n      Therefore, it is extremely important for physicians to strengthen patient education and\n      regular follow-up visits during disease management. Moreover, the effectiveness of patient\n      education during chronic disease management has already been proved in some studies abroad,\n      and the interventional effect of multiple patient education process outweighs that of single\n      approach education.\n\n      Thus, we intend to conduct a randomized and controlled study to explore the effect of\n      multi-channel intensive patient education on LDL-C target achieving rate and statin\n      adherence in patients with ACS in China."
