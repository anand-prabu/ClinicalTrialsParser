  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This self-controlled, prospective, pilot study is designed to gather information regarding
      the diurnal variation (changes that occur each day) in the levels of plasma phenylalanine
      (Phe) and tyrosine in patients with phenylketonuria (PKU) and in the non-PKU population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare genetic metabolic disease caused by a mutation that codes
      for an enzyme that converts the essential amino acid phenylalanine (Phe) into tyrosine. An
      absence or deficiency of this enzyme activity results in a Phe elevation, where higher Phe
      levels result in neurological damage. Diurnal variations of Phe levels have been observed in
      PKU patients in a 24-hour period.

      As Kuvan has shown to stabilize Phe levels in PKU patients over time, our hypothesis is that
      this can be demonstrated within a 24-hour period of observation and indicate therefore that
      Kuvan may correlate with a lower plasma Phe variability. This study on PKU patients' diurnal
      variation will also provide  important information as to the current method of blood Phe
      monitoring in a clinical setting to learn more about the optimal way to measure Phe
      concentration.

      The study will last about 4 weeks (6 study visits) for the PKU participants and about 1 week
      (2 study visits) for the control group.

      Participants will be required to follow a recommended diet, complete a dietary log, and
      undergo several blood draws, including a 24-Hour Blood Assessment in which blood will be
      obtained 8 times throughout the day.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        PKU PARTICIPANTS (ARM 1):

          -  Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of PKU with hyperphenylalaninemia documented by a
             fasting Phenylalanine level of at least 360 umol/L (6 mg/dL)

          -  Patient is at least 4 years old (there is no upper age limit for this study)

          -  Willing and able to provide written authorization or, if under the age of 18 years,
             provide written assent (if required) and written patient authorization by a parent or
             legal guardian

          -  Willing to undergo study related procedures including commencing Kuvan treatment for
             patient not currently on treatment; temporary discontinuation of Kuvan for patient on
             treatment; and completing the 24-Hour Blood Assessment

          -  Authorized to provide personal health information

          -  Subjects should not be pregnant and willing to use appropriate birth control during
             the study

        CONTROL GROUP (ARM 2):

          -  Healthy, non-PKU individuals. They will be age-sex matched to the PKU group. They may
             be a relative (ex: sibling) of a PKU participant, but they don't have to be a blood
             relation.

          -  Individual is at least 4 years old (there is no upper age limit)

          -  Willing and able to provide written consent or, if under the age of 18 years, provide
             written assent and written participant authorization by a parent or legal guardian

          -  Authorized to provide personal health information

        Exclusion Criteria (BOTH ARMS):

          -  Subjects who do not meet all the inclusion criteria

          -  Age &lt; 4 years

          -  Concomitant medical problems or medications which at the discretion of the principal
             investigator would put participant at health risk or prevent them from completing
             study.

          -  If female, unwillingness to use birth control during the period of the study drug
             administration (this doesn't apply to Arm 2)
