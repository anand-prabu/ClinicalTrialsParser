The data collected from patient-reported outcomes\n      allows the physician and staff to screen for specific health conditions, monitor patients\n      individually, evaluate outcomes for specific groups, assess quality of care, determine\n      impact of intervention and predict outcomes.  Most of the follow-up results from this study\n      will be obtained directly from the patient during follow-up visits, but other information\n      may be obtained from medical records.\n\n      Evaluation of the surgical database Application will identify both patient and procedural\n      variables that can predict adverse outcomes."
