  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Plasma exchange is a frequently used therapy in many antibody-mediated disorders, such as
      humoral rejection after kidney transplantation. Treatment frequency is adjusted to daily
      measured fibrinogen blood levels to prevent bleeding complications. However, data about the
      correlation of fibrinogen blood levels and function of the coagulation system during plasma
      exchange therapy is scarce. In the present study we examine blood fibrinogen levels and
      coagulation factors as well as thrombin clotting time in patients under plasma exchange
      therapy.
