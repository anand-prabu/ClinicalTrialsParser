      Summary Rationale: Cardiac resynchronisation therapy (CRT) with biventricular pacemakers and
      implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) has proven to be a valuable therapy in selected
      patients with systolic heart failure, ameliorating both morbidity and mortality. However,
      with current selection criteria and implant technique, about 20 to 30 % of patients remain
      non-responders. Non-responders might be due to failing selection criteria or methodology in
      casu echocardiography. Moreover, the definition of response to CRT is unequivocal and there
      is a need for a simple and reproducible measure of response with low inter- and
      intra-observer variability.

      Primary objectives: This study evaluates the  correlation between intrathoracic blood volume
      (ITBV) measured by contrast enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
      as well as the feasibility to use intrathoracic blood volume as a predictor for response to
      CRT.

      Study design: a prospective nonrandomized pilot study Study population: patients with heart
      failure New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, a left ventricular ejection
      fraction equal to or less than 35% and a QRS-duration equal to or more than 0.12 seconds who
      are referred to our centre for implantation of a CRT-P or CRT-D device.

      Intervention:  No specific intervention will be performed. Main study parameters:
      correlation between intrathoracic bloodvolume measured by CEUS and MRI, correlation between
      LVEF measured by CEUS and by standard 2D ultrasound (biplane methods of discs), change in
      intrathoracic blood volume as a response to CRT.

      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group
      relatedness:  at baseline a clinical examination, laboratory analysis, cardiopulmonary
      exercise testing, echocardiography and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging will be performed.
      All of these examinations will be repeated at 3-months follow-up except for the cardiac
      magnetic resonance imaging. All examinations, except for the MRI, are part of the standard
      workup in our hospital for patients undergoing implantation of a CRT device. Data needed for
      the purpose of this study, will be acquired by offline image analysis with dedicated
      software.
