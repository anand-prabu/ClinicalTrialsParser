  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well biological therapy with or without vaccine
      therapy works in treating patients with metastatic hormone-resistant prostate cancer.
      Biological therapies may stimulate the immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells
      from growing. Vaccines may help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor
      cells. It is not yet known whether biological therapy is more effective with or without
      vaccine therapy in treating prostate cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 (glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7) administration
      increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific T-cell immune response to the sipuleucel-T
      fusion protein vaccine construct prostatic acid phosphatase-sargramostim (PAP-GM-CSF)
      (PA2024).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced antigen-specific
      T-cell immune response to PAP.

      II. To assess the character of the T-cell immune response to PAP and PA2024.

      III. To determine whether CYT107 administration increases the vaccine-induced
      antigen-specific antibody immune responses to PAP and PA2024.

      IV. To quantify the effects of CYT107 on T-cell repertoire diversity.

      V. To assess the effects of CYT107 on the immune competence of patients with advanced
      prostate cancer.

      VI. To assess the clinical efficacy and tolerability of sipuleucel-T plus CYT107 compared
      with sipuleucel-T alone.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment cohorts.

      COHORT I: Patients receive no treatment after completion of standard sipuleucel-T therapy.

      COHORT II: Patients receive glycosylated recombinant human interleukin-7 subcutaneously (SC)
      on days 0, 7, and 14 beginning 3-7 days after completion of standard sipuleucel-T therapy.
      Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 52 weeks.

             infection, congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or

             requirements

          -  History of pulmonary disease such as emphysema or chronic obstructive pulmonary
