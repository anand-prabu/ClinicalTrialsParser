One study group will receive one dual depth Ultherapy treatment to a region on the\n      cheeks, and one study group will receive two dual depth Ultherapy treatments to a region on\n      the cheeks 14 days apart. Average pain scores will be obtained using a Numeric Rating Scale\n      following each region of treatment and for each depth of treatment. In Phase II, based on\n      observations of last follow-up visit in Phase I (at 90 days after treatment), subjects will\n      be given the option to receive treatment of the affected area(s) for the protocol specified\n      region, treated at the treatment depth showing the most efficacy in Phase I.  Efficacy will\n      be determined by improvement in Erythematotelangiectatic Rosacea in the treatment area\n      versus control (an untreated area) as determined by primary investigator assessment at the\n      last follow-up visit in Phase I."
