            "textblock": "Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP) is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder of the\n      heme biosynthesis pathway. AIP is caused by a genetic defect in porphobilinogen deaminase\n      (PBGD) a key enzyme for heme synthesis.\n\n      AIP is characterized by acute episodes and asymptomatic periods. Neuropathic symptoms are\n      predominantly in these attacks, which may be related to the toxic effect produced by the\n      precursors delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG), accumulated because\n      the enzyme deficiency. It occurs with very low prevalence (1 in 50,000), but figures for\n      prevalence based on clinical manifestations (i.e., acute attacks) greatly underestimate the\n      number of patients with latent AIP.\n\n      Abdominal pain is the most common symptom, sometimes with constipation. Paraesthesias and\n      paralysis also occur, and death may result from respiratory paralysis. Many other phenomena,\n      including seizures, psychotic episodes, and hypertension, develop during acute attacks\n      (Kadish 1999, Anderson 2007). Acute attacks rarely occur before puberty. They may be\n      precipitated by porphyrogenic drugs such as barbiturates, progestogens and sulfonamides,\n      some of which are known to induce the first rate-controlling step in heme synthesis, ALA\n      synthesis. Other known precipitants are alcohol, infection, starvation, and hormonal\n      changes; attacks are more common in women.\n\n      This is a pre-treatment observational study designed to collect clinical and laboratory data\n      to later compare baseline and post-treatment variables in a future clinical trial\n      (AAVPBGD-AIP-001) for the AIP treatment using a recombinant adeno-associated virus vector\n      with a liver-specific promoter for the PBGD expression (rAAV5-AAT-cohPBGD).\n\n      The PRIMARY OBJECTIVE is to observe the changes of PBG and ALA urinary levels in AIP\n      patients.\n\n      The SECONDARY OBJECTIVES are:\n\n        -  To observe and document the frequency of acute attacks, the nature and frequency of\n           symptoms, medication and hospitalization requirements, neurological involvement,\n           psychological involvement and health-related quality of life of AIP patients.\n\n        -  To record the use of concomitant medication in AIP patients.\n\n      At least eight patients fulfilling the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be included. No\n      sample size assessments have been taken into account due to the study nature, so this number\n      of patients is considered sufficient to meet the study objectives."
