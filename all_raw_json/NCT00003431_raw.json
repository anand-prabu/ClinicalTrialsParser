This course of therapy may be repeated for a total of 3 courses. Leukapheresis is\n      performed on day 15 of the last course of Flt3 ligand. Patients undergo restaging and\n      metastasis resection. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, every 6\n      months for the second year, and yearly thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: This study will accrue 12 patients in 1 year."
