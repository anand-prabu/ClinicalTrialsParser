  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, spinal anesthesia is most commonly used for cesarean.But spinal anesthesia can
      not block the visceral vagus nerve, and the patient is prone to nausea, vomiting, chest
      tightness or other discomfort when the uterus is stretched .For the puerperae who have poor
      uterine contractions and are bleeding larger, obstetricians often use oxytocin to strengthen
      the contraction of the uterine,which also would increase the puerperae'
      discomfort.Anesthesiologists often intravenous sedative hypnotics (eg.propofol or midazolam)
      to alleviate the fear of the puerperae after the baby is delivered.One of the side effects
      of propofol or midazolam is that they would lead to the respiratory depression.For the poor
      respiratory reserve of the puerperae, functional residual capacity(FRC) of this group could
      be reduced by up to 20%, and the oxygen consumption was also increased.The SPO2 could
      decline quickly intraoperatively.Dexmedetomidine(DEX) is a novel , highly selective α2
      adrenergic receptor agonists , and its selectivity for α2 receptor is 1600 times higher than
      α1.It also could provide dose-dependent sedation , analgesia , anti-anxiety and inhibition
      of sympathetic nerves and other effects.Because of its minimal impact on the respiratory ,
      it could safely and effectively used to sedate patients undergoing cesarean.But the change
      of endocrine system and hemodynamic of the puerperae may affect the pharmacokinetics and
      pharmacodynamics of some anesthetic drugs.Currently studies have demonstrated the increased
      sensitivity of some anesthetic drug in puerperae, such as lidocaine and isoflurane.The study
      is aim to explore the right DEX dose to produce suitable sedation in puerperae.

      30 patients undergo cesarean were scheduled. All patients accepted combined spinal and
      epidural anesthesia first.And then an dose of DEX would be performed as soon as the
      umbilical cord was clapped.Determination of median effective (ED50) doses was performed by
      the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method. Initial doses was 1μg/kg,with dose adjustment
      intervals of 0.1μg/kg in first three turning points and 0.05μg/kg in the last three turning
      points.Sedative efficacy was defined as an OAA/S of ≤2, or an OAA/S of 3 but with an BIS
      value of ≤46, 26 min after the beginning of drug administration.

    <description>The aim of our study is to define the median effective sedative doses (ED50s) of DEX  with respect to the loss of consciousness in cesarean surgery,using the Dixon and Mood up-and-down method。The loss of consciousness is defined as an OAA/S of ≤2, or an OAA/S of 3 but with an BIS value of ≤46, 26 min after the beginning of drug administration.</description>
