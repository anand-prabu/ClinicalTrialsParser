This study is to learn if waiting 20,\n      40, or 60 seconds to clamp the umbilical cord after baby delivers will improve his/her\n      outcome and overall health. Benefit to the baby may come by increasing the amount of blood\n      in the baby's body, reducing the need for possible transfusion later, and possible\n      prevention of other complications caused by too little blood in the baby.  Possible\n      reduction of cerebral palsy may be realized by a longer interval for cord clamping."
