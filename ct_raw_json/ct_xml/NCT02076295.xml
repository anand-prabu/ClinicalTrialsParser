  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mild cognitive impairment and dementia are frequent non-motor complications of moderate to
      advanced Parkinson's disease. Brain positron emission tomography (PET) study findings
      confirm post-mortem evidence that cholinergic loss is related to cognitive impairment in
      Parkinson's disease. However, current cholinergic augmentation therapy is not always
      effective and it should only target those Parkinson's disease patients who have evidence of
      cholinergic system impairment. The objective of this study is to study the association of a
      particular subtype of cholinergic receptors, so-called nicotinic acetylcholine receptors,
      with cognition in Parkinson's disease using a novel PET marker of cholinergic system
      integrity.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease patients will undergo nicotinic acetylcholine receptor PET imaging with
      the radioligand [18F]flubatine and MRI on one day and extensive neuropsychological testing
      on another day. The degree of nicotinic receptor expression obtained with PET imaging will
      be correlated with the neuropsychology test results.

      Positive [18F]flubatine PET findings in this study would establish nicotinic receptors as an
      important contributor to cognitive dysfunction in Parkinson's disease and could kindle
      pharmaceutical interest in pursuing these agents for Parkinson's disease applications.

      We expect that lower nicotinic receptor expression is associated with impaired cognitive
      functioning in Parkinson's disease. In a personalized medicine approach the PET radioligand
      [18F]flubatine could serve as an important marker to identify those patients who are
      expected to benefit most from nicotinic receptor drug treatment.
