Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells. Combining\n      chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of cisplatin plus interferon alfa followed\n      by surgery and interferon alfa plus radiation therapy in treating patients with malignant\n      pleural mesothelioma."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of neoadjuvant interferon alfa 2b\n      (IFN-A2b) administered with cisplatin in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma. II.\n      Determine the MTD of IFN-A2b administered with radiation therapy and cisplatin after surgery\n      in these patients. III. Determine the response rate and toxicity of induction therapy with\n      IFN-A2b and cisplatin in these patients. IV. Determine the toxicity of concurrent radiation\n      therapy, cisplatin, and IFN-A2b after surgery in these patients. V. Determine the local\n      control rate, freedom from progression, median survival, and long term survival of these\n      patients after combined modality therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive induction therapy consisting of\n      cisplatin IV weekly and interferon alfa 2b (IFN-A2b) subcutaneously three times a week for 6\n      weeks. Patients who experience at least 25% tumor shrinkage receive another 4 weeks of\n      therapy. Patients then undergo debulking surgery to remove all gross tumor, if possible. If\n      this resection is performed, then patients begin radiation therapy 2-6 weeks after surgery.\n      Patients with unresectable tumors begin radiation therapy 2-4 weeks after the last course of\n      induction chemotherapy. Patients undergo radiation therapy 5 days a week for 6 weeks.\n      Concurrently, patients receive cisplatin IV weekly and IFN-A2b subcutaneously three times a\n      week. Cohorts of 4 patients each receive escalated doses of IFN-A2b during induction\n      chemotherapy. Once the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of IFN-A2b is established, one dose\n      level below this dose is used for the beginning doses of IFN-A2b during adjuvant\n      chemotherapy. If no unacceptable toxic effects occur, then the dose of IFN-A2b is escalated\n      to the induction MTD. Patients are followed at 3-6 weeks after completing radiochemotherapy,\n      then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 25 patients will be accrued for this study within 2-3 years."
