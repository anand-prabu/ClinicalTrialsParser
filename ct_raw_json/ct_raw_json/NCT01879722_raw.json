These participants will be randomized to receive TAK-063 (8\n      subjects) and placebo(2 subjects) QD for 7 days.\n\n      In total, approximately 60 participants will be enrolled in the study. This trial will be\n      conducted in single site in the United States. The overall time to participate in this study\n      is up to 42 days. Participants will make 2 visits to the clinic, including 8-10 days\n      confinement to the clinic, and will be contacted by telephone 7 days after last dose of\n      study drug for a follow-up assessment.\n\n      Dose escalation and the actual choice of the subsequent dose level will only occur following\n      a review of the blinded data from the previous cohorts."
