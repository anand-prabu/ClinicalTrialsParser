The data\n      and experienced gained from this study will be utilised in planning future home studies.\n\n      This is an open-label, three centre, randomised, crossover design, involving two,  8 day\n      (first day in the clinical research facility and seven days at home) study periods during\n      which glucose levels will be controlled either by an automated closed-loop system or by\n      subjects usual insulin pump therapy in random order. A total of up to 24 adults (aiming for\n      18 completed subjects) aged 18 years and older with T1D on insulin pump therapy will be\n      recruited through diabetes clinics and other established methods in participating centres.\n\n      Subjects will receive appropriate training in the safe use of closed-loop insulin delivery\n      system. During the 24 hour in-patient stay subjects will be encouraged to mimic their usual\n      day and will be allowed to walk inside hospital premises. Subjects will be advised to\n      discontinue automated closed-loop insulin delivery and follow their usual insulin pump\n      therapy for periods of strenuous exercise during the 7 day home study phase.\n\n      The primary outcome is time spent in target range between 3.9 and 10.0 mmol/L as recorded by\n      CGM (adjusted for potential over-estimation) during home stay. Secondary outcomes are the\n      time spent with glucose levels above and below target, as recorded by CGM, and other\n      CGM-based metrics, and for the stay at the clinical research facility, time spent in the\n      target range, above and below the target range as measured by plasma glucose."
