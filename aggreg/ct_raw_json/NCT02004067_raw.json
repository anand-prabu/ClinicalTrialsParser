It is accompanied by increased osmolarity of the\n      tear film and inflammation of the ocular surface. DED prevalence is estimated around 15 -35%\n      of the population over 50 years old. There is a wide variety of topic medications for the\n      treatment of DED, though few aim the re-establishment of tear osmolarity equilibrium and\n      reduction of damages to the ocular surface. The treatment of DED can include a medical\n      treatment, such as tear substitution, tear preservation, production stimulation,\n      anti-inflammatory; it can also include surgical treatment, as tarsorrhaphy and salivary\n      gland transplant. Considering tear substitutes and anti-inflammatory topical treatments, the\n      purpose of our study is to determine efficacy of an immunomodulating topical medication\n      containing 0.05% cyclosporine A (CsA), compared to a topical lubricant (vitamin A, Refresh\n      Endura\u00ae), on the treatment of dry eye disease (DED) due to primary or secondary Sj\u00f6gren's\n      syndrome (aqueous deficient DED) and evaporative DED."
