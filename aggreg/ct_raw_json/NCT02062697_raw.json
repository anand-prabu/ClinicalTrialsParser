Treatment and survival of the patients depend primarily on\n      the stage of the disease.

In these cases the five-year survival rate is 80% to\n      90% and the disease can often be cured by the combination of surgery and chemotherapy.\n      Unfortunately, almost 75% of women affected have advanced stage disease with metastatic\n      spread throughout the abdominal cavity or to retroperitoneal lymph nodes at the time of\n      diagnosis; five-year survival rates drop to 10%-30% for advanced disease, despite maximum\n      surgical effort and combination chemotherapy.\n\n      State-of-the-art diagnostic tests for EOC include transvaginal ultrasonography and serum\n      cancer antigen (CA-125) measurements; the specificity of these diagnostic tools however is\n      low, and both tests are not effective enough at detecting EOC early enough to improve\n      clinical outcomes.
