      To improve progression free survival in high risk patients with resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma who have node positive disease, margin positive disease, and/or elevation in
      CA 19-9 treated with CC-486 (oral azacitidine) as compared to observation after completion
      of adjuvant therapy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is for patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma who have concluded
      adjuvant therapy or were deemed unable to receive adjuvant therapy with an elevated CA 19-9
      or node positive or margin positive disease.  CA 19-9 elevation is defined as two levels &gt;
      the institutional upper limit of normal (ULN) taken at least 2 weeks apart.  These levels
      should be measured after adjuvant therapy has concluded or upon the decision that adjuvant
      therapy will not be offered.  Patients will be randomized to one of two arms.  Randomization
      must occur within 3 months of finishing adjuvant therapy or from the decision that adjuvant
      therapy will not be offered.  Group A, the treatment arm, will be started on CC-486 (oral
      azacitidine).  Group B, the control arm, will receive no additional therapy.  CA 19-9 will
      be followed monthly and CT scans every 2 months in both arms. When patients have visible
      disease recurrence on imaging, CC-486 will be stopped and both groups will start first-line
      chemotherapy (possibly abraxane or gemcitabine).

      GOALS:

      To improve progression free survival in high risk patients with resected pancreatic
      adenocarcinoma who have node positive disease, margin positive disease, and/or elevation in
      CA 19-9 treated with CC-486 (oral azacitidine)as compared to observation after completion of
      adjuvant therapy.

      To improve response rates to first-line chemotherapy (partial and complete response) after
      recurrence in patients treated with CC-486 after completing adjuvant therapy.

      To improve overall survival in patients with resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma treated with
      CC-486.

      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue and biopsies at time of recurrence for
      epigenetic and genetic alterations to determine the pharmacodynamic effects of CC-486.

      To evaluate resected pancreatic cancer tissue to identify predictive signatures of possible
      recurrence and the benefit of hypomethylating therapy.
