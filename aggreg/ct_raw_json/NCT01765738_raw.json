This will include sterile technique, placement via a vein of the upper arm using\n      ultrasound guidance, and positioning of the catheter tip under fluoroscopic guidance.  A\n      database of all catheters placed will be kept. Records will be reviewed at 1 week, 30 days,\n      and 60 days by the Interventional Radiology Fellow.Review will include length of time\n      catheter was in place, whether treatment was completed, whether catheter was removed\n      prematurely, the clinical reason for removal, results of other imaging tests, and results of\n      cultures on any catheters removed for suspicion of infection.
