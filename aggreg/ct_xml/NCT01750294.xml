  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is estimated that in the United States there are approximately 8 million individuals with
      moderate to severe chronic kidney disease (CKD), not on dialysis. Volume expansion plays an
      important role in the pathogenesis of hypertension in patients with CKD.  For this pilot
      study, the investigators hypothesize that administration of chlorthalidone among patients
      with moderate to severe CKD will improve BP.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age greater than 18 years.

          -  eGFR ≤ 45 ml/min/1.73m2 but ≥20 mL/min/1.73m2.

          -  Poorly controlled blood pressure by 24-hour ambulatory BP monitoring.

          -  Treated hypertension: use of at least one antihypertensive drug. One of the drugs
             should be either an ACE inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker.  If these are
             contraindicated then use of a beta-blocker is required.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Use of thiazide or thiazide-like drugs in the previous 3 months.

          -  Use of furosemide in a dose &gt;200 mg/d.

          -  Ambulatory BP of either ≥160 systolic or ≥100 mmHg by 24-hour ambulatory BP
             monitoring.

          -  Expected to receive renal replacement therapy within the next 3 months.

          -  Vascular event such as myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, or
             stroke within 3 months prior to randomization.

          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding women or women who are planning to become pregnant or those
             not using a reliable form of contraception (oral contraceptives. condoms and
             diaphragms will be considered reliable).

          -  Known hypersensitivity to thiazide or sulfa drugs.

          -  Organ transplant recipient or therapy with immunosuppressive agents. Nasal or inhaled
             corticosteroids will be permitted.
