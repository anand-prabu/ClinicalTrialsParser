    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot-study is to evaluate a cognitive behavioral program, the
      Friends-program, as indicated prevention for anxious youth with or without symptoms of
      depression. The youth are recruited by school nurses who will also lead the intervention
      groups applying the Friends-manual developed by Paula Barrett. The study will furthermore
      also evaluate the Friends program as an universal prevention program used in ordinary school
      classes with school nurses and class-room teachers as Friends-leaders.
