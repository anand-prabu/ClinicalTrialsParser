      This is a multi-center, randomized, blinded, placebo controlled study to evaluate the safety
      of GSK1278863 and its acute and short-term (e.g. 14d) effects on calf muscle endurance and
      walking ability in subjects with PAD and symptomatic claudication.  Functional assessments
      will be performed following a single high dose (300mg), a single low dose (15mg), and
      following 14 days of low dose treatment (15mg q.d.).  The objectives of this study are to:
      1) Evaluate the safety and tolerability of GSK1278863 administered as a single dose and as
      sub-chronic low dosing (i.e. 14 days) in subjects with peripheral artery disease; 2) To
      demonstrate the potential pharmacodynamic effect of GSK1278863 on functional measures of
      calf muscle endurance and fatigability and timed walking distance following a single high or
      low dose and after 14 days of multiple low dose administration in subjects with
      claudication-limited peripheral artery disease.  In this hypothesis-generating study,
      multiple assessments of ambulatory and skeletal muscle function will be made during
      standardized tests of claudication-limited exercise performance, and 3). Characterize the
      relationship, if any, between the doses and plasma concentrations of GSK1278863 and the
      pharmacodynamic effects.

             study drug (Day 1) through the Follow-up Visit (Day 65), unless, in the opinion of
             the Investigator, medication will not interfere with the study procedures or
             compromise subject safety and GSK Medical Monitor concurs.

             of drug or other allergy that, in the opinion of the investigator or GSK Medical
