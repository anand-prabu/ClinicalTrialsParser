  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have demonstrated long term relief from dentine hypersensitivity with twice
      daily brushing of a toothpaste containing stannous fluoride in comparison to marketed
      (negative) controls.  The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a stannous
      fluoride dentifrice in the treatment of dentinal hypersensitivity compared to a marketed
      (negative) control, over a period of 56 days (8 weeks) with twice daily brushing.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants with self-reported history of dentinal hypersensitivity lasting more
             than 6 months but not more than 10 years.

          -  Participants with minimum of 20 natural teeth.

          -  At screening, a minimum of two accessible teeth (incisors, canines, premolars) that
             meet all of the following criteria.

               1. Teeth showing signs of facial/cervical gingival recession and/or signs of
                  erosion or abrasion.

               2. Teeth with Gingival Index score ≤1 and a clinical mobility of ≤1.

               3. Teeth that are determined to be sensitive by the subject following a 1 second
                  air blast to the cervical margin.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of chronic debilitating disease which, in the opinion of the investigator,
             could affect study outcomes.

          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, causes dry mouth.

          -  Tooth with evidence of current or recent caries, or reported treatment of decay in 12
             months of screening.

          -  Participant using of a desensitising dentifrice within 6 weeks of screening
