            "textblock": "Myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) is a nuclear scan using a radioisotope to see blood flow\n      to the muscles of the heart when the heart is at rest and when it is under stress. The\n      stress test in MPI can be done using medications, such as adenosine, that dilate coronary\n      arteries and increase blood flow. Similarly, elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) levels in the\n      blood, or hypercapnia, also dilates arteries and increases blood flow. Thornhill Research\n      Inc. has developed the RespirAct \u2122 Gen3 sequential gas delivery system used to control CO2\n      levels in the blood. The RespirAct \u2122 Gen3 can deliver precise amounts of CO2 through a mask\n      for inhalation to increase CO2 levels in the blood and thereby increasing blood flow like\n      during stress.\n\n      The objective of this study is to compare the differences in blood flow through the arteries\n      of the heart during stress with  hypercapnia and adenosine MPI. The imaging will be done\n      using positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioisotope, or tracer, called Rubidium\n      (Rb-82). The Rb-82 is given through a pump, or elution system.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that hypercapnia will induce a stress-to-rest increase in\n      myocardial blood flow by a factor of 2 or more in myocardial regions supplied by\n      non-stenotic arteries in normal volunteers and participants with coronary artery disease."
