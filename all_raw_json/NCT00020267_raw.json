Determine whether an immunologic response, as measured by an in vitro sensitization\n      assay, can be obtained after administration of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      III.  Determine a frequency of administration for this regimen based on immunologic response\n      in these patients.\n\n      IV.  Determine other immunologic parameters in these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      V.  Determine the clinical response rate in these patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      PROTOCOL OUTLINE: This is a randomized study.  Patients are stratified according to disease\n      (metastatic cutaneous melanoma vs other tumor types).  Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms.\n\n      Arm I:  Patients receive MAGE-12 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant\n      subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 4 doses.\n\n      Arm II:  Patients receive MAGE-12 peptide vaccine emulsified in Montanide ISA-51 adjuvant SC\n      once every 3 weeks for 4 doses.\n\n      Patients with progressive disease may receive interleukin-2 IV over 15 minutes every 8\n      hours, beginning on the day after each immunization and continuing for up to 4 days.\n      Patients achieving stable disease or a mixed, partial, or complete response continue on\n      vaccine therapy alone for up to 24 total doses.\n\n      Patients are followed at 3 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL:\n\n      A total of 26-56 patients (13-28 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this study within 1\n      year."
