  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine dependence involves problematic neuroadaptations, such as heightened reactivity to
      cocaine cues, that may be responsive to pharmacological modulation of glutamatergic
      circuits. Despite promising preclinical findings with n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAr)
      modulators, studies with human subjects have been unsuccessful to date. The purpose of this
      investigation is to examine the effects of the NMDAr antagonist ketamine, recently found to
      have potent therapeutic effects in humans, on cue-induced craving in cocaine dependent and
      on impaired motivation for quitting cocaine participants, 24-hours post-infusion.
