            "textblock": "Despite the success of Omalizumab that neutralizes free IgE in blood and interstitial\n      fluids, treatment of many allergic disorders remains an unmet medical need. Omalizumab was\n      approved for patients having serum IgE levels in the range of 30-700 IU/ml.  Omalizumab may\n      not be effective for patients with much higher serum IgE levels, such as those with atopic\n      dermatitis. Therefore, an alternative approach that targets IgE-committed B cells directly\n      and inhibits the synthesis of IgE without binding to free IgE will be attractive. Anti-C\u03b5mX\n      mAb, developed by Dr. TW Chang in Academia Sinica, binds human mIgE+ cells, including\n      IgE-committed lymphoblasts and memory B cells.  Such anti-C\u03b5mX mAbs should be able to\n      activate B cell receptor (BCR) signaling, which leads to anergy or apoptosis of mIgE+ B\n      lymphoblasts, and induces ADCC through their Fc portion. Depletion of mIgE+ B cells by\n      anti-C\u03b5mX treatment would inhibit the formation of IgE-producing plasma cells, resulting in\n      a long-term attenuation of IgE synthesis that would eventually lead to a desensitized state\n      in allergic patients."
