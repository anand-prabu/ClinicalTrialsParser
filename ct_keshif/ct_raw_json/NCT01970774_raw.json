Research participants will attend two MTM sessions and undergo PGx testing to\n      inform the MTM plan. Participants will also complete 2 surveys pre and post-MTM/PGx testing.\n      Data analysis will assess the impact of MTM/PGx testing on recommendations for drug dosing,\n      clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and feasibility of service delivery. Safety issues\n      are minimal with the primary risks being associated with loss of confidentiality, typical\n      discomfort associated with acquiring blood samples, and genetic discrimination."
