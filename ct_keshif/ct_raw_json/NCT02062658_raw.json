            "textblock": "Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a common psychiatric illness that affects up to 2-3%\n      of the population. People with OCD experience anxiety-provoking, intrusive thoughts, known\n      as obsessions, and feel compelled to perform repetitive behaviors, or compulsions. The only\n      medications approved for OCD are serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs), but even with SRI\n      treatment, most patients continue to experience significant OCD symptoms, impaired\n      functioning, and diminished quality of life. Recent studies have found that a single IV\n      infusion of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, can lead to rapid\n      improvement in OCD symptoms (within hours) which can persist for a week or longer in some\n      patients. An important next step in this line of research is to find ways of extending this\n      effect. This proof-of-concept study will investigate whether a condensed course of EX/RP can\n      extend the effects of ketamine on the symptoms of Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in\n      adults aged 18-55."
