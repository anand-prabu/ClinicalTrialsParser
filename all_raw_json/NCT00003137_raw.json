Evaluate the response rate, survival, and toxicity of previously untreated\n      patients with locally advanced or metastatic gastric cancer who are treated with irinotecan\n      (CPT-11).\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a nonrandomized study. Patients receive irinotecan (CPT-11) by IV over 90\n      minutes every 3 weeks. Dosage modifications are made based on toxicity. Retreatment may be\n      delayed another 3 weeks (for a total of 6 weeks) to allow for recovery from toxic effects.\n      Patient is taken off study if they do not recover from toxic effects, unless cause is\n      documented to be unrelated to CPT-11. Patients with stable disease or partial response\n      continue on treatment until disease progression or intolerable toxicity. Patients with\n      complete response continue on treatment for another 2 courses and then are observed.\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 3 years or until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 21 and a maximum of 66 patients will be accrued into this\n      study."
