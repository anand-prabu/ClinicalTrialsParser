            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing\n      so they stop growing or die. Monoclonal antibodies can locate tumor cells and deliver\n      tumor-killing substances to them without harming normal cells. Combining chemotherapy with\n      monoclonal antibody therapy may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining docetaxel and monoclonal\n      antibody therapy in treating women who have metastatic or recurrent breast cancer."

Treatment repeats every\n      8 weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 45 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
