Patients continue to be treated with their current dose of Dehydrex. Upward\n      dose adjustments may be made as clinically indicated. Patients undergo eye exams every 3 to\n      4 months or more often. Downward dose titration will be attempted in patients who are\n      stable, free of symptoms, and willing to attempt downward adjustments. In patients who are\n      able to discontinue the medication, duration of healing will be determined. In those\n      patients who experience a recurrence after discontinuing the medication, Dehydrex will be\n      restarted at a dose higher than the minimum effective dose. After at least 8 weeks of\n      treatment and resolution of symptoms, the dose may again be reduced. Further attempts to\n      discontinue the medication will not be made."
