This beneficial effect is mediated by the reduction of chronic inflammatory\n      response of swallowing musculature to radiation, consequently a reduction in muscle\n      fibrosis.\n\n      Primary study objective: To evaluate the effectiveness  of ALTENS in relieving\n      radiation-induced dysphagia. Eating Assessment Tool (EAT-10) scores will be used for this\n      primary study endpoint."

            "textblock": "Difficulty in swallowing is a concerning symptom after radiation treatment for some types of\n      head and neck cancers. Swallowing becomes difficult when radiation damage induces\n      inflammation (with swelling and pain) in the inner covering tissues of the throat and\n      muscles that involve in the swallowing process. Currently, supportive measures are used to\n      manage this symptom while waiting for the tissue damages to heal. In some patients, the\n      inflamed muscles develop scar tissues causing long-term swallowing difficulty and narrowing\n      of the swallowing passage. Needle acupuncture may help to reduce tissue inflammation and may\n      lessen the severity of swallowing difficulty. However, needle puncture is often not desired\n      by patients.  Acupuncture-like transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (ALTENS) is like\n      acupuncture treatment, but the acupuncture points are stimulated with mild electrical\n      stimulation without needles, simplifying treatment delivery. This study is to examine if a\n      pre-selected set of acupuncture points treated using ALTENS can reduce swallowing\n      difficulty. There will be a total of 12 treatments given over 6 to 8 weeks. Changes in\n      severity of swallowing difficult after treatment will be assessed using 2 subjective\n      assessment tools."

The global question is scored and interpreted separately. The scores of all the items in each domain are summed and a mean score is calculated. The final score for each subscale is calculated by multiplying the calculated mean score by 20 with a final range from 0 to 100. The final score of the global question is also calculated in the same way. The higher the final score represents better functioning and quality of life.",
