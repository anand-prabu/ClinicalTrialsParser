In correlation to the pressure level oxygen dissolves in the plasma resulting in\n      an increase of total oxygen in the body. The elevated tissue levels of oxygen may persist\n      for hours, instigating healing processes in wounds caused by disturbances in of perfusion in\n      small vessels, a condition often found in patient with diabetes.\n\n      We plan a prospective, double-blind randomized clinical study in 80 patients with chronic\n      diabetic ulcer. All will have optimum treatment of diabetes. The HBO group will be given HBO\n      at 2.4 bar, 90 min., 30 sessions, controls will have sham HBO. Routine wound care will be\n      identical in both groups. Before, during and after treatment (3, 6 and 12 months), a number\n      of monitoring and imaging procedures will be done, cells in the bloodstream indicating\n      improved healing will be determined.\n\n      Hypothesis: HBO will instigate the healing process in the majority of patients with chronic\n      diabetic leg ulcer, provided the patency of the large vessels is given."
