  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and anti-tumour effect of CO-1686, given
      as oral tablets at a dose of 625mg twice a day, to participants whose tumours did not
      respond or stopped responding to treatment with their first EGFR TKI medication and who have
      a T790M positive tumour. The trial is open-ended, which means patients will continue to take
      CO-1686 until the study doctor determines it is no longer beneficial for them.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, single arm, open-label, multicenter study evaluating the safety and
      efficacy of CO-1686 administered orally twice daily to patients with previously treated
      mutant EGFR NSCLC whose tumor harbors the T790M resistance mutation (central laboratory
      assessment). Eligible patients are T790M positive patients who have received only one prior
      single agent EGFR-directed TKI therapy for advanced/metastatic NSCLC, and have had no
      intervening chemotherapy between TKI and planned treatment with CO-1686. One line of
      chemotherapy prior to any TKI treatment is permissible. TIGER-2 will consist of a screening
      phase to establish study eligibility and document baseline measurements, an open-label
      treatment phase, in which the patient will receive CO-1686 at 625mg BID to ascertain safety
      and efficacy until protocol-defined disease progression, and a Follow-up Phase, to monitor
      survival status and subsequent NSCLC cancer therapy. Each 28 day period of treatment will
      represent one cycle, with dosing initiated on Cycle 1 Day 1 (C1 D1).
