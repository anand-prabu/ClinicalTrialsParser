Participant will receive a separate consent form that will describe this treatment\n      and its risks in more detail.\n\n      Study Visits During Radiation Therapy:\n\n      Every week during radiation therapy:\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 1 teaspoon) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Chemotherapy Administration:\n\n      Participant will start Cycle 1 of chemotherapy during their first week of radiation.  Each\n      cycle will be 21-days long (or longer if it takes longer for participant's blood cell counts\n      to recover).  Participant will receive up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy.\n\n      On Days 1-3 of each cycle:\n\n        -  Participant will receive dexamethasone by vein over about 15 minutes.\n\n        -  Participant will receive etoposide by vein over 2 hours.\n\n        -  Participant will receive ifosfamide by vein over 3 hours.\n\n        -  Mesna is given to protect the bladder from side effects.  Participant will receive\n           mesna by vein as a non-stop infusion over 24 hours on Days 1-3 of each cycle.\n\n        -  On Day 1 only, participant will receive carboplatin by vein over 30 minutes.\n\n      Study Visits During Chemotherapy:\n\n      Before Day 1 of Cycle 1 and on Day 15 of Cycle 1:\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Participant will have an x-ray of the chest.\n\n        -  Participant will have an EKG and either an ECHO or a MUGA scan.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  If participant is able to become pregnant, they will have a blood (about 2 teaspoons)\n           pregnancy test.\n\n      On Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 2 and Day 15 of Cycle 3, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn\n      for routine tests.\n\n      On Day 1 of Cycle 3:\n\n        -  Participant will have an EKG.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      Length of Study:\n\n      Participant may receive radiation and up to 3 cycles of chemotherapy.  Participant will no\n      longer be able to receive chemotherapy if the disease gets worse or intolerable side effects\n      occur.\n\n      Patient's participation on the study will be over after the end-of-study and follow-up\n      visits.\n\n      Follow-Up Visits:\n\n      Participant will also have routine follow-up visits every 3 months for the 1st year, every 4\n      month during the 2nd year, and every 6 months during the 3rd-5th years.  After that,\n      participant will have follow up visits 1 time every year.  At these visits, the following\n      tests and procedures will be performed:\n\n        -  Participant will have CT, MRI, and PET/CT scans to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n        -  Any skin lesions that participant may have that are related to the tumor will be\n           measured and photographed.\n\n      If participant's doctor thinks it is needed, their MRI and PET/CT scans will be performed\n      more or less often.\n\n      If participant leaves the study early:\n\n        -  Participant will have CT, MRI, and PET/CT scans to check the status of the disease.\n\n        -  Any skin lesions that participant may have that are related to the tumor will be\n           measured and photographed.\n\n        -  Participant will have a physical exam.\n\n        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.\n\n      This is an investigational study.  Radiation and chemotherapy are FDA approved and\n      commercially available for participants with Stage 1 and/or 2 NK cell lymphoma.  The\n      combination of these therapies given at the same time is investigational.\n\n      Up to 40 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson."
