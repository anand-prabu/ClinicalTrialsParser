He/she will undergo marshmallow esophagography in\n      detecting esophageal dysmotility at 6 weeks after study intervention and will be followed\n      for 12weeks.\n\n      During the study, both the patients and the observer for the primary and secondary efficacy\n      evaluation will be masked.\n\n      Non-inferiority of the test device (Hyalobarrier) compared to the reference device\n      (Guardix-SG) will be confirmed using the primary efficacy outcome,the percentage of normal\n      esophageal transit."
