Revascularization Surgery is the treatment of choice, but\n      about half of patients with severe PAD IIb is not eligible for surgery or endovascular\n      treatment. The usefulness of use of vasodilators or hemorheological is controversial, and\n      medical treatment of these patients is therefore heterogeneous understanding the various\n      pharmacologic options (for the correction of risk factors, prevention of cardiovascular\n      events, improvement of claudication), and rehabilitative programs. Iloprost, a synthetic\n      analogue of prostacyclin, is effective in the treatment of patients with chronic critical\n      ischemia, and its pharmacological profile (effective vasodilator, anti-platelet, and\n      leukocyte activation) is particularly suitable to modulate multiple components pathogenesis\n      of peripheral arterial disease. Specifically, in the treatment of patients with PAD IIb\n      severe, the current state is available only a retrospective study that compared the use of\n      iloprost with that of vasodilators. Aim of the study FADOI-2bPILOT is to evaluate\n      prospectively and for an observation period of 13 months, if you can get a benefit on the\n      pain-free walking distance and on clinical outcome  from \"anticipated\" and additional use of\n      iloprost, in patients with severe IIb stage PAD treated according to current \"best medical\n      practice\"."
