The use of miRNAs as minimally-invasive biomarkers has opened\n      new opportunities for the diagnosis of cancer. A number of studies have addressed the\n      potential association of disregulated miRNA profiling and benign asbestos-related disease\n      and mesothelioma. Thus, the investigators will evaluate serum miRNA profiling before and\n      after treatment with Artichoke WPC."
