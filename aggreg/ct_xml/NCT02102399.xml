  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to verify the effects of two speech-pathology interventions:
      vocal warm-up and respiratory training in teachers who work in a public school of the city
      of Salvador-Bahia, with or without complaints of vocal disorders. It is a preventive study
      and the hypothesis is that both approaches can produce positive voice changes, but the Vocal
      Warm-up will produce the most significant changes.

    <textblock>
      Randomized Clinical Trial where participants were allocated into groups: Vocal Warm-up (to
      perform exercises of resistance and flexibility for fifteen minutes before teaching for six
      weeks) and Respiratory MuscleTraining (to perform exercises to strengthen the respiratory
      muscles through the use of incentive respiratory equipment. Five repetitions of exhales with
      an interval of thirty seconds between each one were performed. It was requested rest for two
      minutes, repeating the procedure four times with the total of five series. These exercises
      were performed for fifteen minutes before teaching for six weeks).

      Outcomes to be analysed: Self-reported voice handicap, by applying the Voice Handicap
      Index-VHI-10; vocal severity rating, by Vocal Severity Scale; acoustic parameters through
      the computerized acoustic voice analysis program: VoxMetria (CTS inform√°tica) and
      sociodemographic characteristics and teaching activity characteristics, symptoms, habits and
      factors associated with voice disorders.
