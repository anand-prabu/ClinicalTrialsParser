This study has a pretest-posttest\n      design in order to determine if improvement in vision is in response to replacement of\n      deficiency (dopamine). The ERG testing and OCT will be critical determinants to confirm\n      vision improvement as a result of improved retinal function, but are not primary outcome\n      data. Main outcome measures will be collected at pre-treatment, 1 month, 3 months, and 4\n      months. Change in visual acuity as measured in logMAR by Snellen or SVEP after 3 months of\n      treatment is the primary outcome. Patients include OCA1a patients, OCA1b, OCA2, and\n      unclassified OCA. OCA1a patients clinically are known to have the worst vision, and\n      physiologically have the lowest (or absent) levels of tyrosinase function (Dopamine\n      Production). All patients will be treated with Levodopa/carbidopa 4mg/kg/day in three\n      divided doses."
