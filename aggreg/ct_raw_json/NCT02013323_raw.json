The clinical outcomes\n      evaluated were plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), clinical attachment level (CAL), PD\n      and % of sites with bleeding on probing (%BOP) at baseline (B\\L), 10 days, 1, 3 and 6 months\n      interval and percentage of sites positive for A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis and T.\n      forsythia were recorded at B/L, 3 and 6 months using polymerase chain reaction."
