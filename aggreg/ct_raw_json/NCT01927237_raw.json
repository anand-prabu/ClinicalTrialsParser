This\n      prospective clinical study will enroll consenting adult patients scheduled for elective\n      cardiac surgery and who require postoperative mechanical ventilation, pulmonary artery\n      (Swan-Ganz) catheter monitoring, and arterial catheterization as part of routine standard\n      care during the immediate postoperative period. The study will perform measurements using\n      available ventilator monitors, ventilator in-line pneumotachograph and capnograph,\n      measurements from the indwelling pulmonary artery catheter, transesophageal\n      echocardiography, and other measurements available as part of routine care. The entire\n      experimental protocol will be performed in one day over 2-4 hours, and the protocol will not\n      interfere with routine postoperative care, nor prolong the need for mechanical ventilation,\n      pulmonary artery catheterization, arterial catheterization, or intensive care unit length of\n      stay.\n\n      Ventilation with low tidal volumes has been shown definitively to improve mortality from\n      acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)1 and may provide benefit even in patients without\n      ARDS.2 During low tidal volume ventilation, practice varies on whether to allow some degree\n      of alveolar hypoventilation with incidental hypercapnic acidosis (termed \"permissive\n      hypercapnia\"),3 or to increase respiratory rate to maintain alveolar ventilation and target\n      eucapnia, often requiring respiratory rates > 30/min.4 The physiological consequences of\n      these divergent strategies remain to be fully elucidated. We propose the following study to\n      distinguish the effects of a eucapnic high respiratory rate (EHR) strategy from a\n      hypercapnic low respiratory rate (HLR) strategy on pulmonary hemodynamics during low tidal\n      volume ventilation.\n\n      Specific Aim:  To test the hypothesis that, while administering inspired CO2, eucapnia\n      achieved by high respiratory rate (EHR) significantly decreases pulmonary artery pressures\n      compared to hypercapnia with a lower respiratory rate (HLR).\n\n      Specific Aim:  To test the hypothesis that EHR decreases myocardial strain compared to HLR."
