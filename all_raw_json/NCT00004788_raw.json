Determine whether premenstrual porphyria attacks are associated with increased luteal\n      phase energy requirements.\n\n      III.  Determine whether energy requirements are higher than intakes in men with unexplained\n      frequent porphyria attacks.\n\n      IV.  Assess the nutritional status of women with acute intermittent porphyria using a\n      comprehensive series of laboratory methods, including zinc and pyridoxine status.\n\n      V.  Determine whether the frequency of disease exacerbations decreases when dietary and\n      nutritional abnormalities are corrected in these patients.\n\n      VI.  Evaluate the safety and efficacy of a parenteral nutrition regimen for patients with\n      acute porphyria attacks."

Energy\n      expenditure, resting metabolic rates, and basal metabolic rates are determined with indirect\n      calorimetry, including measurements taken during the follicular and luteal phases of the\n      cycle.  Other testing includes hormone assays, serology for nutritional studies, and a\n      urinary metabolite profile. Zinc, lead, and other metals are measured by atomic absorption\n      spectroscopy.\n\n      The diagnosis of acute intermittent porphyria is confirmed by erythrocyte porphobilinogen\n      deaminase; urinary aminolevulinic acid, porphobilinogen, and porphyrins; and total fecal\n      porphyrins.\n\n      Patients hospitalized for acute attacks of porphyria during the study will receive standard\n      treatment, including intravenous hematin and parenteral support."
