      This project aims at characterizing HIV-1 viral biofilms structural and functional
      properties and at deciphering its role as a new viral reservoir and as a new mode of viral
      spread. The prospective national study will be conducted on cells isolated from blood
      samples from 20 patients infected with HIV.

      The investigators' preliminary data indicate that besides &quot; free &quot; infectious viral
      particles, HIV-1 infected cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4+) lymphocytes also produce
      extracellular viral assemblies wrapped in an extracellular matrix cocoon and tightly bound
      to the surface of the cell. Importantly, these structures are infectious, transferred to
      target cells upon intercellular contacts and they are key role in HIV-1 spread between T
      lymphocytes. HIV-1 viral biofilm could be important not only for direct transmission of the
      virions but also for &quot; trans-infection &quot;, a process our objectives are:

        -  to better characterize the molecular composition and the architecture of this biofilm
           (using proteomics, glycomic superresolution cell imaging approaches) with regard to its
           properties (infectivity, adhesiveness, protection of virions) and to determine whether
           cells from infected patients produce such structures.

        -  to delineate the viral factors regulating the formation of these new infectious
           structures (with a particular attention on Tat, Vpu and Nef HIV-1 encoded using mutant
           viruses or expression vectors).

        -  to investigate the lymphocyte pathways regulating the viral biofilms formation and
           composition in extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins (using quantitative polymerase chain
           reaction (qPCR) and siRNA).

        -  to determine whether those viral biofilms are involved in HIV-1 transmission by
           transinfection

        -  to study the contribution of those infectious structures and the dynamics of their
           transmission in lymph nodes.

      This project may contribute to decipher the role of viral biofilms in HIV-1 transmission.
      Ultimately, we intend to determine how the interference of retroviral infections with T cell
      activation pathways modulates the pattern of ECM production by T cells, tuning viral biofilm
      composition and regulating viral dissemination.
