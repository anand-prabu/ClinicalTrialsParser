    <textblock>
      This study will randomise patients undergoing screening colonoscopy to receive Entonox
      either continuously or as required.

      Both these methods are used in the published studies of Entonox and in clinical practice.

      Null hypothesis There will be no difference in pain levels between these two methods of
      Entonox administration
