            "textblock": "Nearly all children with autism spectrum disorders engage in non-functional repetitive vocal\n      and motor behaviours commonly referred to as stereotypy. These repetitive behaviours may\n      considerably interfere with the child's daily functioning, learning, and social inclusion.\n      As such, stereotypy generally has a negative impact on the child and family's health and\n      quality of life. Several behavioural interventions have been developed to reduce engagement\n      in stereotypy in children with autism spectrum disorders, but the limited number of\n      specialists available, the long waiting lists associated with public health services in\n      Canada, and the high costs of private services have considerably restricted accessibility.\n      One potential solution to the limited availability and high costs of services is using a\n      mobile application to recommend, teach, and monitor interventions designed to reduce\n      engagement in stereotypy. To this end, the purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects\n      of the iSTIM (i.e., individualized Stereotypy Treatment Integrated Modules), a mobile\n      application designed to assist parents in reducing stereotypy in children with autism\n      spectrum disorders. Specifically, we will assess whether the iSTIM correctly estimates the\n      frequency or duration of stereotypy, offers suggestions consistent with recommended clinical\n      practices, effectively reduces engagement in stereotypy, and is socially acceptable, safe,\n      and easy to use for parents of children with autism spectrum disorders. The results of the\n      study will allow us to determine whether the mobile application may be used to treat this\n      core symptom in children with autism spectrum disorders, which could potentially reduce\n      waiting times and costs of providing health services to this population. By reducing\n      engagement in stereotypy, the iSTIM may also promote and facilitate the social participation\n      as well as improve the quality of life and health of children with autism spectrum disorders\n      and their families."
