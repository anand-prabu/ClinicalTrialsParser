  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite recent advances in substance abuse interventions, a large percentage of clients
      entering residential treatment for substance use will drop out of treatment prematurely, and
      of the remaining, many will relapse soon after treatment completion. Previous research
      indicates that an individual's ability to withstand psychological distress is a key factor
      necessary to maintain drug and alcohol abstinence and to remain in substance use treatment
      without absconding. In previous work, Dr. Bornovalova developed a specific distress
      tolerance treatment called Skills for Improving Distress Intolerance (SIDI). This
      intervention features skills training in behavioral and acceptance strategies and
      intentional clinical exposure to emotional distress. SIDI was developed and piloted with a
      sample of urban drug users seeking treatment in a residential facility. Individuals
      receiving SIDI exhibited greater improvement in distress tolerance than those in two
      comparison groups (receiving treatment-as-usual and supportive counseling).

      Current study. The investigators received NIDA funding to conduct a randomized clinical
      trial with 325 clients entering a residential substance use treatment facility. Study
      participants will be randomized into two treatment groups: (1) those receiving SIDI and (2)
      those receiving Supportive Counseling (SC). Participants will receive 10 treatment sessions
      over a period of 4 months. Then, the investigators will follow clients for one year to
      examine treatment retention and abstinence.
