Based the patients medical condition, the doctor may decide to change the timing of the drugs, the interval between the drugs in a cycle, or the interval between the cycles. After receiving all cycles you will continue with a 36 months treatment part that is called Maintenance."

The standard treatment for adults with ALL consists of many chemotherapy\n      drugs that are given in different combinations and in several steps. In adult ALL there is\n      no standard which drugs to give and how to combine them. Some leukemias have a chromosome\n      abnormality called Philadelphia chromosome (also called Ph Positive) and some leukemias do\n      not (called Ph Negative). In this study we want to see whether this combination of\n      chemotherapy drugs will be safe and effective in treating adult patients with Ph Negative\n      ALL."
