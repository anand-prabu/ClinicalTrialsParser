Adults with autism will be randomly assigned\n      to receive either (a) two hours per week of intervention services for five weeks, or (b) a\n      treatment as usual control. The intervention will focus on enhancing social skills, social\n      cognition, and social functioning. Outcome measures will evaluate changes in these social\n      skills, cognition, and functioning using standardized assessments. We will perform\n      structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans at three time\n      points-before, during, and after treatment (i.e., Time Point #1, 2, and 3)."

High-functioning (so that the treatment can effectively benefit the subjects):\n\n               1. Full Scale Intelligence Quotient (IQ) of WASI at least 70\n\n               2. Able to give informed consent prior to initiation of any protocol required\n                  procedures\n\n          3. Autism Spectrum Disorder:\n\n               1. Having a current primary diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder (including\n                  Asperger's Disorder) from a licensed psychologist/psychiatrist or from a school\n                  diagnostician, as defined by the DSM-IV criteria.\n\n               2. For this project, diagnosis will not be determined by our assessment. The\n                  participants we enroll will already carry a current primary diagnosis of Autism\n                  Spectrum Disorder. This verification of their diagnosis may also come from study\n                  personnel who have seen and/or treated the patient prior to his or her\n                  involvement in the project and can verbally confirm that they carry the proper\n                  diagnosis.\n\n          4. Mean Length of Utterance (MLU) must be at least 4-5 words (the intervention method\n             requires this)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Speech-language criteria:\n\n               1. Those who are not fluent in written and oral English will not be eligible to\n                  participate, as many of the instruments are not validated in other languages.\n\n               2. Significant hearing loss or other severe sensory impairment\n\n               3. Inability to read self-report instruments\n\n          2. Health criteria:\n\n               1.

Those with a history of seizures, or current use of anticonvulsants\n\n               3. A fragile health status\n\n               4. A history of significant head trauma or serious brain or psychiatric illness\n\n               5. Having any other current psychiatric condition or complications, such as\n\n             i. Diagnosed with substance dependence within the last three months. ii. Current use\n             of prescription medications that may affect cognitive processes under study.\n\n             iii.
