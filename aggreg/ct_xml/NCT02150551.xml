  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this trial, investigators will infuse donor bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells
      intravenously, as a treatment for pediatric Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis that has
      not responded to conventional therapies.  The goals of this study are to test the safety and
      tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

      Mesenchymal stromal cells support the development of blood cells within the bone marrow.
      When isolated from a donor and infused into an animal or human, they have been demonstrated
      to travel to areas of inflammation, to alter immune responses, to decrease pro-inflammatory
      cytokines, and to promote tissue repair. Infusion of these cells does not lead to rejection.
      These properties lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be
      beneficial in treating inflammatory bowel disease.

      lead investigators to hypothesize that that these may be they may be beneficial in treating
      inflammatory bowel disease.

      Investigators will culture donated bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells in a unique
      automated system, and infuse the cells in a fresh, replicating stage of growth.  This study
      is to test the safety and tolerability of donor mesenchymal stromal cells in children with
      Inflammatory Bowel Disease.

    <description>In order to obtain unbiased comparisons of each outcome between the three MSC dose levels, patients will be randomized fairly among the three dose groups, with the constraint that exactly 8 patients will be randomized to each MSC dose level. Additionally, toxicity will be monitored in each dose group, using the following safety rule: if a dose is terminated early by the toxicity monitoring rule then the remaining patients, up to the maximum of 24, will be randomized fairly between the two remaining doses, with this randomization constrained to balance these remaining patients between the two remaining doses. If two doses are terminated early by the toxicity monitoring rule then the remaining patients, up to the maximum of 24, will be treated with the one remaining MSC dose. If all three doses are terminated early, the trial will be stopped.Group assignments will not be balanced by diagnosis.</description>
