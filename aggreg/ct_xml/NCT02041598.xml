      The DREAM (Diabetes Research, Education, and Action for Minorities) Project is a Community
      Health Worker (CHW) intervention to improve diabetic management and control among
      Bangladeshis with diabetes in New York City (NYC).  For a two-arm, randomized controlled
      trial (RCT), investigators will recruit a sample of 256 participants, all of whom are 1) of
      Bangladeshi descent, 2) residing in NYC, 3) diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)
      and a recent Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) of ≥ 6.5, and 4) between the ages of 21-85.  The
      treatment group receives a six-month CHW-led intervention consisting of five monthly group
      educational sessions, two one-on-one visits, and follow-up phone calls as needed from a CHW.
       The control group receives an introductory educational session only.  Primary and secondary
      outcomes include clinical and behavioral measures, such as HbA1c and weight change, access
      to and utilization of care (i.e. appointment keeping and use of specialty care), and
      knowledge and practice of physical activity and healthful eating.  Additionally, information
      regarding CHW characteristics, the processes and mechanisms for influencing healthful
      behavior change, and fidelity of the intervention are collected.  Outcomes are measured at
      Baseline, 3-Months, 6-Months for both groups, and at 12-Months for the treatment group.
