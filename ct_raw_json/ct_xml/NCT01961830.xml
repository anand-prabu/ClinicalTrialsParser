  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, open-label, single-dose study. The primary objective is to
      determine Epithelial Lining Fluid (ELF) levels of ME1100 after a single orally inhaled dose.
      The secondary objectives are to determine systemic exposure to inhaled ME1100 and to assess
      tolerability and safety of a single dose of  ME1100 inhalation solution.

             Investigator or Medical Monitor would place the subject at risk through study
             participation or would confound the assessment of the safety of ME1100 inhalation
             solution
