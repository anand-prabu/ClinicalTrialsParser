However, the necessity of\n      radiotherapy has been questioned for a long time especially for patients with enough\n      circumferential margins. Moreover, indiscriminate radiotherapy will result Irreversible\n      ovarian dysfunction for female. In the past decade, there were two major progresses for\n      colorectal cancer. Firstly, oxaliplatin with fluorouracil has become the standard adjuvant\n      chemotherapy for advanced colon cancer. Oxaliplatin improved the survival of colon cancer\n      patients than single fluorouracil. Our experience showed that oxaliplatin with fluorouracil\n      could improve the prognosis of rectal cancer without radiotherapy. It has been proven that\n      oxaliplatin should not add to radiotherapy for rectal cancer. However, whether oxaliplatin\n      can replace radiotherapy for certain rectal cancer patients is still unknown. Secondly,\n      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has been proven that can predict the circumferential margin\n      status for rectal cancer. Now, preoperative MRI scan can recognize the rectal cancer\n      patients with low recurrence risk. The radiotherapy may be omitted to the patients with low\n      recurrence risk. This study is a randomized controlled trial to compare the 3-year\n      disease-free survival (DFS) differences of group of experiment (the patients receive primary\n      surgery followed selective radiochemotherapy) and group of control (the patients receive\n      indiscriminate preoperative radiochemotherapy followed surgery) for locally advanced rectal\n      cancer with negative MRI circumferential margin."
