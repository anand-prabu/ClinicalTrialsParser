Determine the dose-intensity and cumulative dose\n      delivery for these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified into 1 of 3 strata\n      according to extent of residual disease and plans for interval cytoreductive surgery:\n      Stratum A: Optimal (microscopic or macroscopic) residual disease without plans for surgery\n      Stratum B: Suboptimal residual disease without plans for surgery Stratum C: Suboptimal\n      residual disease with plans for surgeryPatients are randomized to 1 of 5 treatment arms. Arm\n      I: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 1.\n      Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 8 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity. Arm II: Patients receive chemotherapy as in arm I and gemcitabine IV\n      over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8. Treatment continues as in arm I. Arm III: Patients receive\n      chemotherapy as in arm I during courses 1-8 and doxorubicin HCl liposome IV over 1 hour on\n      day 1 during courses 1, 3, 5, and 7. Treatment continues as in arm I. Arm IV: Patients\n      receive topotecan IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3 and carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day\n      3. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses. Patients then receive 4 courses of arm I\n      chemotherapy. Arm V: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 8 and\n      carboplatin IV over 30 minutes on day 8. Treatment continues every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n      Patients then receive 4 courses of arm I chemotherapy.
