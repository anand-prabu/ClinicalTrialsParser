Hematopoietic stem cell donors for this trial will include individuals who are 10/10 HLA matched or one antigen or allele mismatched at the HLA-A, B, C, DRB1 or DQB1 locus, as defined by high resolution methods. The administration of WT1-specific cytotoxic T cells (WT1 CTLs) post transplantation is integrated to induce complete remissions in patients with residual disease and to decrease the rate of relapse following the allogeneic transplant."
