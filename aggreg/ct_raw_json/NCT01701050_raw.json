An algorithm for a CTC-Endocrine Therapy Index (CTC-ETI) has been\n      constructed that can be calculated for each patient using the CTC enumeration and marker\n      results.  The primary goal of this study is to determine a CTC-ETI in ER positive, HER2\n      negative metastatic breast cancer patients before the initiation of a new endocrine therapy\n      for the identification of patients that will progress rapidly."

            "textblock": "Patients with estrogen receptor (ER) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC) starting their\n      first line of endocrine therapy (ET) only have a 30-50% chance of receiving clinical\n      benefit.  For the other 50-70% of patients, ET is ineffective and these patients should\n      probably be treated with chemotherapy, as is done for ER negative patients.  More\n      importantly, in nearly every clinical trial of ET in ER positive, MBC patients, between\n      15-30% of enrolled patients progress in the first 2-3 months, regardless of whether they are\n      receiving first or later lines of ET.  Currently there is no validated method to identify\n      which ER positive MBC patients will be refractory to ET.  Therefore, almost all ER positive\n      patients are treated with serial endocrine therapies before switching to chemotherapy.  The\n      investigators propose that a subset of these patients would be better served with\n      chemotherapy, in spite of its increased toxicity profile, rather than delaying chemotherapy\n      during a several month trial of ineffective, albeit less toxic, ET.\n\n      To try and predict benefit from or resistance to ET, an index (the CTC-ETI) has been created\n      that takes into account the number of CTC (which is prognostic) as well as the phenotype of\n      the CTC, based on the hypothesis that relative levels of ER and Bcl-2 (high=benefit) and\n      HER2 and Ki67 (high=resistance) are predictive of ET responsiveness or resistance.  Although\n      the preliminary data demonstrate the ability to detect, enumerate, and characterize CTC\n      utilizing the CellSearch\u00ae System, the purpose of the current study is to establish proof of\n      principle that these 4 markers can be used to generate a CTC-ETI which can be performed at\n      baseline from patients enrolled at different centers, and that baseline CTC-ETI predicts\n      relative outcome for patients with ER positive MBC starting a new ET, and can be monitored\n      in such patients during ET.  Successful completion of this study will set the stage for a\n      larger, definitive study designed to demonstrate the clinical utility of a \"refined\" CTC-ETI\n      in patients with ER positive, HER2 negative MBC."
