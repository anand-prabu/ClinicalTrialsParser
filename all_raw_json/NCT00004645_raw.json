Patients are stratified by\n      disease type; each stratum is randomized separately.\n\n      The first group of patients receives a true plasma exchange using continuous-flow\n      centrifugation with serum albumin and crystalloid replacement every 2 days for a total of 7\n      exchanges.\n\n      The second group receives a sham plasma exchange with no centrifugation every 2 days for a\n      total of 7 exchanges.\n\n      Patients cross to the alternate therapy if there is less than a moderate improvement by day\n      14.  The treatment decision is based on a blinded neurologic assessment.\n\n      Concurrent corticosteroids and other immunosuppressants, and high-dose barbiturates are not\n      allowed.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 and 6 months after the last exchange."
