Evaluate the efficacy of treatment with oxaliplatin, fluorouracil, and\n      leucovorin calcium in terms of the resectability rate in patients with unresectable advanced\n      colorectal carcinoma confined to the liver. II. Assess this regimen in terms of response\n      rate, toxicity, and overall survival in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1, then leucovorin calcium IV\n      over 2 hours with fluorouracil IV bolus, followed by fluorouracil IV over 22 hours on days 1\n      and 2. Courses repeat every 2 weeks. Patients with stable disease continue treatment in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity or until disease is resectable.\n      Patients who achieve complete response (CR), partial response (PR) with unresectable\n      disease, or PR but are not surgical candidates continue treatment in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who demonstrate a response are treated until\n      best response or until disease is deemed resectable. Patients who achieve a CR or PR and are\n      resected may receive 2 to 4 additional courses of therapy at the discretion of the\n      investigator. Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 2\n      years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 44 patients will be accrued for this study over\n      approximately 2-3 years."
