      Background:

      - Plasma cell myeloma is a type of cancer that affects the plasma cells in the bone marrow.
      It can be difficult to treat with chemotherapy. One possible treatment combines chemotherapy
      with a stem cell transplant. To make this treatment more effective, researchers want to give
      another drug along with the transplant. This drug, carfilzomib, is often used to help treat
      plasma cell myeloma. However, it is not usually given along with the transplant. Researchers
      want to see if it is safe and effective to combine the stem cell transplant with
      carfilzomib, and if it improves the results of the transplant.

      Objectives:

      - To test the safety and effectiveness of carfilzomib given with stem cell transplant for
      plasma cell myeloma.

      Eligibility:

      - Individuals between 18 and 75 years of age who are having a stem cell transplant to treat
      plasma cell myeloma.

      Design:

        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine
           samples will be collected. Imaging studies and a bone marrow biopsy will also be
           performed.

        -  Participants will have their own stem cells collected for the transplant. The
           transplant will be performed according to the standard of care.

        -  All participants will receive carfilzomib on the first 2 days after transplant. The
           study doctors will determine the number of additional doses that they may have.

        -  Treatment will be monitored with frequent blood tests and imaging studies.

      Background:

        -  Despite very significant progress in therapy for plasma cell myeloma (PCM) in the last
           decade, the disease remains mostly incurable.

        -  High-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (AHCT)
           continues to be a critical component of early treatment for PCM, but it is clear that
           the disease is not eradicated by the present high-dose therapy strategy, while
           intensifying the preparative regimen has, to this day, resulted in either no
           improvement in disease control or increased toxicity.

        -  Carfilzomib (CFZ) is a newer proteasome inhibitor with increased activity and a safer
           toxicity profile than bortezomib in PCM. The favorable toxicity profile makes it a
           likely candidate for increasing anti-PCM drug exposure in the early post-AHCT period.

      Objectives:

      Primary Objectives

      -Evaluate feasibility and toxicity of an increasing number of doses of CFZ administered in
      the early period post-AHCT for PCM

      Secondary Objective

        -  Evaluate the immune reconstitution post-AHCT following CFZ therapy

        -  Evaluate the effects of the addition of CFZ in the early post-AHCT period on the
           response rate at day 100 post-AHCT

      Eligibility:

        -  Newly diagnosed subjects with PCM following induction therapy

        -  Subjects with documentation of persistent/refractory disease who have received no more
           than 2 salvage regimens following relapse and who have not undergone AHCT

        -  Adequate organ functions with no major co-morbidity

        -  Age greater than 18 years and less than or equal to 75 years

      Design:

        -  Phase I/II study on the backbone of high-dose melphalan on day -2 pre-AHCT

        -  Addition of an increasing number of doses of CFZ in the early post-AHCT period
           introduced in a step-wise fashion in 3 successive cohorts of 3 to 15 subjects:

      Cohort 1: add CFZ 20 mg/m2 on days +1, +2

      Cohort 2 : add CFZ 20 mg/m2 on days: +1, +2, +8, +9

      Cohort 3: add CFZ 20 mg/m2 on days: +1, +2, +8, +9 and add an early post-AHCT consolidation
      following

      engraftment: CFZ 20 mg/m2 given on days 42-43 then CFZ 56 mg/m2 given on days 49-50, 56-57,
      then on days 70-71, 77-78 and 84-85

      -Dose-limiting toxicity, incidence of engraftment failure and treatment-related mortality
      are the objects of early stopping rules for safety purposes
