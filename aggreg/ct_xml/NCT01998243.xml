      Introduction: bariatric surgery shows an important morbidity and there are some reports
      that have used preoperative intragastric-balloons (IGB-BIB®) to decrease surgical morbidity.

      Patients Methods: Since 2009 we are performing a randomized and prospective study to assess
      the usefulness of  (IGB-BIB®) before bariatric surgery [sleeve resection (SR) or gastric
      bypass (GB)] &quot;group A&quot; vs a control group &quot;B&quot; with the same type of surgical procedures but
      without preoperative IGB-BIB.  All patients coming for both groups were followed at 4-week
      intervals by a nurse practitioner and dietitian for 6 months, Nurse practitioner made the
      dietetics adjustments (750-1500 Kcal) , provide advice and assess the evolution  of weight
      loss The hypothesis was that preoperative IGB-BIB  helps  the patients to lose weight ( more
      than 10%) ,and the weight loss will contribute to decrease surgical morbidity by  at least
      30%, and also  will decrease  hospital stay Objective: to check if morbidity, mortality and
      hospital stay decreased in the IGB-BIB ® group, and secondly if the weight before surgery
      was associated with surgical morbidity. secondary objective : Assess the rate of  IGB-BIB
      failure.Intragastric balloon failure  was considered when the weight loss is less than 10%
      from the initial weight. We defined severe complication whenever the patient had to be
      admitted in the hospital after discharge, new surgeries or transfusions were required or the
      hospital stay was longer than 7-10 days.

    <description>An intragastric balloon (BIOENTERICS INTRAGASTRIC BALLOON (BIB) SYSTEM)is placed endoscopically under conscious sedation was kept in the stomach during minimum 6 months. Patients were also treated with proton bomb inhibitors, and prokinetics to control gastroesophageal reflux . The balloon was endoscopically removed with the patient under general anesthesia to avoid bronco-aspiration related problems</description>
