  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      BI 691751 is currently being developed to inhibit growth and prevent rupture of
      atherosclerotic plaques and to consequently reduce the risk of major cardiovascular events
      in patients with established atherosclerotic disease. 1334.5 is a Pan Asian Phase 1 study to
      investigate safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of BI 691751 in healthy Chinese and
      Japanese male volunteers.

             laboratory tests

          2. Chinese ethnicity, Japanese ethnicity according to the following criteria:

             Chinese; born in China or ethnic Chinese born outside of China, and a descendent of 4
             ethnic Chinese grandparents who were all born in China Japanese; born in Japan and

             be of clinical relevance

          3. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

         11. Use of drugs that might reasonably influence the results of the trial or that might
             prolong the QT/QTc interval within 14 days prior to study drug administration

         12. Participation in another trial with investigational drug administration within 60
             days prior to administration of trial medication

         13. Smoker (more than 10 cigarettes or 3 cigars or 3 pipes/day)

         15. Alcohol abuse (consumption of more than30 g/day)

         16. Drug abuse or positive drug screen

         17. Blood donation (more than 100 mL within 30 days prior to administration of trial
             medication or intended during the trial)

         18. Intention to perform excessive physical activities within one week prior to
             administration of trial medication or during the trial

         19. Inability to comply with dietary regimen of trial site

         20. A marked baseline prolongation of QT/QTc interval (such as repeated demonstration of
             a QTc interval greater than 450 ms) or any other relevant ECG finding

         21. A history of additional risk factors for Torsades de Pointes (such as heart failure,
             hypokalemia, or family history of Long QT Syndrome)

         22. Subject is assessed by the investigator as unsuitable for inclusion, for instance,
             because considered not able to understand and comply with study requirements, or has
             a condition that would not allow safe participation in the study.
