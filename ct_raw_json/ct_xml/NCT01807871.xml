  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many smokers who try to stop smoking with nicotine medications (NM) such as gum, lozenge and
      patch, go back to smoking (i.e., a slip or lapse).  Currently, Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA)-approved package labeling tells smokers who lapse while using NM to stop NM
      immediately.  However, some studies suggest it is safe to continue NM upon a lapse and that
      doing so dramatically increases success at quitting.  The investigators will test this by
      doing a randomized trial in which all treatment and measures are done from home with paper,
      phone or computer surveys.  The investigators will recruit smokers who want to quit, provide
      them with 10 weeks of NM and counseling.  One group will be asked to stop NM if they lapse
      and the other group will be asked to continue NM if they lapse.  The investigators will
      compare the groups on their success at quitting and side-effects.

      Objectives:

      To test our hypothesis that among smokers who lapse while using nicotine replacement therapy
      (NRT), those randomized to continue NRT post-lapse will be more likely to be point-prevalent
      abstinent at 4-month follow-up than those randomized to not continue NRT post-lapse.

      To test whether the amount of use of NRT post-lapse,  craving, withdrawal, cigs/day,
      motivation to quit, confidence in quitting,  nicotine reinforcement from cigarettes, and
      self-efficacy mediate any effect of post-lapse NRT use on abstinence.

      To test whether the incidence of adverse events (AEs) during post-lapse NRT is minimal.

      Purpose:

      Over the counter (OTC) NRT is, by far, the most common treatment for smoking cessation in
      the United States (Cokkinides, Ward, Jemel, &amp; Thun, 2005).  Over 80%  of those using OTC NRT
      will lapse (Stead, Perera, Bullen, Mant, &amp; Lancaster, 2008).  One possible reason for this
      high rate of relapse is that NRT package labeling states &quot;do not use if you continue to
      smoke&quot;, and the majority of smokers believe this means it is best to stop using NRT upon a
      lapse; e.g., the only survey on real-world use of NRT during a lapse episode found that 77%
      of smokers discontinued NRT after a lapse (Pierce &amp; Gilpin, 2002).   The investigators and
      others (Bader, McDonald, &amp; Selby, 2009) believe continuing NRT during a lapse episode will
      a) relieve craving and withdrawal (West &amp; Shiffman, 2001), b) block the reinforcing effects
      of smoking (Perkins, Fonte, Meeker, White, &amp; Wilson, 2001; Rose &amp; Behm, 2004),  c) help
      smokers smoke less (Hughes &amp; Carpenter, 2005),  and d) increase self-efficacy, all of which
      should help smokers re-establish abstinence.

      Study design:

      The investigators are proposing a parallel groups randomized controlled trial (RCT) in which
      all treatment and monitoring occur via phone, and medication via mail.   The investigators
      will recruit about 770 smokers to receive phone counseling before and after the quit date
      and nicotine patches for 10 weeks after the quit date.  At study entry, smokers will be
      randomized to a &quot;Continue NRT&quot; or a &quot;Discontinue NRT&quot; condition.  The Continue NRT
      participants will be advised that, if they lapse, they should continue NRT.  Smokers
      randomized to the Discontinue NRT condition will be advised that, if they lapse, they should
      discontinue NRT use.  The messages will also include rationales.  Messages will be delivered
      several times via written material, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) messages and during
      phone counseling. Participants will record cigs/day nightly via a phone-based IVR system for
      10 weeks. If the IVR detects a lapse during the first 10 weeks of the study, it will
      encourage the participant to re-establish abstinence as soon as possible and repeat the
      condition-appropriate message about post-lapse NRT use.  After the 10-week treatment period,
      the investigators will use monthly questionnaires (online or paper) to assess recent
      smoking, cigs/day, NRT use, and other stop-smoking medications.

      Subject selection:

      Men and women, minorities and children over 18 will be included.  Pregnant and breastfeeding
      women, women who plan to become pregnant and those at risk for AEs from NRT will be
      excluded.  Our goal is to recruit a sample of the same gender, ethnicity/race prevalence as
      that of US smokers interested in quitting; i.e. 52% men, 78% White/Non-Hispanic, 11% Black,
      8% Hispanic and 3% other ethnicities/races (Hughes &amp; Callas, 2010).  The investigators do
      not have data on which to estimate the percent who will be children between ages 18-21 but
      most studies suggest very few young smokers are interested in formal treatment (Sussman,
      2002).

      Number of subjects:

      The investigators have chosen an initial inclusion of 770 smokers to obtain a sample size of
      490 smokers who lapse on NRT.
