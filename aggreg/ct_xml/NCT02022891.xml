  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD), a genetically transmitted blood disease, necessitates life-long
      care. In children, the disease may cause intense pain and other severe complications.
      Studies show that sources of stress, as well as complex psychological and intercultural
      issues associated with SCD, often aggravate symptoms. At Louis Mourier hospital, the
      treatment model used is systematic psychological and medical care. Our hypothesis is that
      this care is beneficial for both the children and their families as seen in improved quality
      of life and positive impact on medical symptoms.

    <textblock>
      In this observational multicentric pilot study, our goal is to assess the effectiveness of a
      systematic medical-psychological approach in place for the past 6 years at the Louis Mourier
      Hospital, as compared to the usual practice in 2 other pediatric hospitals for SCD which
      focus essentially on the medical issues associated with SCD. Two psychologists will
      interview 80 children and their primary care-takers at Louis Mourier hospital, and 80
      children and their care-takers of the other two centers, using a standard comprehensive care
      for SCD.  For the parents, we propose to use a semi-structured interview including a
      prepared interview guide, the Loneliness Questionnaire, and the parents' version of
      KIDSCREEN (10 items). For the children, according to their age, The Rey-Osterrieth Complex
      Figure Test (ROCF), the Draw a Person in the Rain Test (DPR), the KIDSCREEN questionnaire,
      and semi-directed interview will be used. Relevant information from the patients' medical
      record directly related to the symptomatic expression of the SCD will be noted on a data
      collection form. This phase is scheduled to last 12 months. A statistical and qualitative
      analysis of the results will be carried out at the end of the study.
