  <brief_summary>

      We are doing this study to find out how well cognitive behavioural therapy for social phobia
      works in people with bipolar disorder, who also have social phobia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Social phobia is a very prevalent anxiety disorder in people with bipolar disorder and is
      associated with adverse outcomes. Yet, social phobia is treatable by cognitive behavioural
      therapy or antidepressant medication. As antidepressants are often contra-indicated in
      people with bipolar disorder, cognitive behavioural therapy is the likely first choice
      treatment for social phobia in this population. However, people with bipolar disorder were
      excluded from previous clinical trials on treatment of social phobia. Our aim is to evaluate
      the acceptability and to provide a rough estimate of efficacy of cognitive behavioural
      therapy protocol for social phobia in people with bipolar disorder in a systematic case
      series. We will also prepare pilot data for evaluating the impact of treatment of comorbid
      social phobia on the long-term course of bipolar disorder.

    <description>The CBT intervention will follow the model of social phobia by Clark &amp; Wells (Clark &amp; Wells, 1995; Clark, 2005). The main elements of CBT for social phobia include reducing self-focus, dropping safety behaviours, and testing negative cognitions.</description>
