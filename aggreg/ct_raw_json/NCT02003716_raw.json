However, the threshold for pharmacological intervention\n      for osteoporosis remains controversial.\n\n      The aim of the present project is to perform a large scale study to identify subjects at\n      risk of osteoporosis by administering the DeFRA questionnaire in a  population never\n      screened or treated before for osteoporosis.\n\n      DeFRA questionnaire will be administered before and after DEXA scanning, to further validate\n      the questionnaire and to highlight the predictive value of this protocol as a tool to screen\n      the general population."
