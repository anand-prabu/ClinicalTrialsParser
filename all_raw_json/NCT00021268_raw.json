Treatment repeats every\n      21 days for up to 10 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of tocladesine until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD is determined, up to 14 additional\n      patients are treated at this dose level.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-38 patients will be accrued for this study."
