Due to the deficiency of functional GCB, glucocerebroside\n      accumulates within the macrophages leading to cellular engorgement, organomegaly, and organ\n      system dysfunction. Gaucher disease has been classified into 3 clinical subtypes based on\n      the presence or absence of neurological symptoms and severity of neurological symptoms.\n      Patients with type 2 Gaucher disease present with acute neurological deterioration, and\n      those with type 3 Gaucher disease typically display a more sub acute neurological course;\n      type 1 Gaucher disease, the most common form accounting for more than 90% of all cases, does\n      not involve the central nervous system.\n\n      Velaglucerase alfa is an approved enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for pediatric and adult\n      patients with type 1 Gaucher disease.  ERTs have been proven to reduce organomegaly, improve\n      hematological parameters and positively impact health-related quality of life; ERTs have not\n      been shown to cross the blood brain barrier and as a result have shown limited ability to\n      improve the neurological (Central Nervous System; CNS) manifestations associated with\n      Gaucher disease.\n\n      This study will provide a basis for exploring the efficacy and safety of velaglucerase alfa\n      in patients with type 3 Gaucher disease."

The patient has received any non-Gaucher disease-related treatment with an\n             investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry.\n\n          5.
