  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Canadian Rheumatologists will be randomized to treat their participants with active
      Psoriatic Arthritis to a target (disease activity score &lt;2.6), or as per their routine care.
      The aim of this study is to determine whether treating to a target results in greater
      disease improvement than treating patients using routine care.

    <description>ACR 20/50/70 defined as:
20%, 50%, or 70% reduction in tender joint count, and
20%, 50%, or 70% reduction in swollen joint count, and
a 20%, 50%, or 70% reduction in 3 of the following 5 measures:
Patient and physician global assessments (VAS)
Patient pain score (VAS)
HAQ-DI
ESR or CRP</description>

    <time_frame>Month 3 Visit, Month 6 Visit, Month 9 Visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>PsARC defined as improvement in at least 2 of the 4 following measures, one of which must be joint swelling or tenderness, and no worsening in any of the 4 measures:
MDGA (0-5 point scale): reduction by 1 point.
PGA (0-5 point scale): reduction by 1 point.
TJC (76 or 68): reduction by &gt;=30%.
SJC (76 or 68): reduction by &gt;=30%.</description>

    <measure>Absolute change in HAQ-DI</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 Visit, Month 6 Visit, Month 9 Visit</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>HAQ-DI is a self-administered questionnaire using the patient's functional ability during the last week. It consists of 20 items converging to 8 scales measuring dressing and grooming, arising, eating, walking, hygiene, reach, grip and common daily activities. The patients rate each activity as 0 = without any difficulty, 1 = some difficulty, 2 = much difficulty and 4 = unable. The final score ranges from 0 to 3 with higher scores indicating more disability.</description>
