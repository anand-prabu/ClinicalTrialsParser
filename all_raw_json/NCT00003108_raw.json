            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the dose limiting toxicity and maximum tolerated dose of\n      combination bryostatin 1 and cisplatin chemotherapy in patients with advanced, incurable\n      solid tumors.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. The first 4 cohorts of patients receive an\n      escalating dose of cisplatin with a fixed dose of bryostatin 1, followed by 5 cohorts\n      receiving an escalating dose of bryostatin 1 and a fixed dose of cisplatin. In the first\n      course, cisplatin is given as a 2 hour infusion followed by a 24 hour continuous infusion of\n      bryostatin 1. In all subsequent courses bryostatin 1 is given first and cisplatin\n      afterwards. Treatment continues every 21 days in patients with stable or responding disease.\n      Dose escalation proceeds until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination\n      chemotherapy is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 or more\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. After the MTD is determined, an additional 10\n      patients are treated at this dose level. Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 24-30 patients will be accrued for this study."
