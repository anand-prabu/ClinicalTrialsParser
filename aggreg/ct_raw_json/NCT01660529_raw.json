            "textblock": "hTERT is widely found in breast cancer cells and has a role in tumor growth and development,\n      making it attractive for immunotherapy.  Also, recent data suggest that breast cancer is\n      potentially responsive to immunological therapies.  In one trial, patients with advanced\n      cancer received a series of hTERT vaccinations and 4 of 7 patients with advanced breast or\n      prostate carcinoma developed hTERT-specific T lymphocytes.  Partial tumor regression was\n      observed in 1 patient.  In a second trial, 19 HLA A2+ patients with metastatic breast cancer\n      were vaccinated with hTERT 1540 peptide in adjuvant with GM-CSF. 68% of patients exhibited\n      immunological responses with development of CD8+ hTERT-specific T-cells.  Overall survival\n      of vaccine responders was signifiantly better than the overall survival on non-responders.\n      In order to expand the number of possible immune responses and to potentially bypass immune\n      tolerance, multiple peptides have been added to the vaccine.  In addition, the monoclonal\n      antibody basiliximab is included to decrease the regulatory T cells which prevent the immune\n      system to work against the tumor, and GM-CSF and Prevnar are used to boost the immune\n      system.  Subjects will receive a maximum of 28 vaccinations over a 24 months period."
