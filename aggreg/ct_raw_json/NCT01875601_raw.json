            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Natural Killer (NK) cells are white blood cells that are important in helping the body\n      fight viruses and tumors. Studies show that NK cells are important to attack leukemia cells\n      after bone marrow transplants. They have also been shown to kill solid tumor cells.\n      Researchers plan to combine NK cells with an immune-boosting drug called interleukin 15\n      (IL-15). They want to see if NK cells and IL-15 can be used to treat children and young\n      adults who have solid tumors that have not responded to other treatments.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To study the safety and effectiveness of NK cells and IL-15 in children and young adults\n      with advanced solid tumors.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Children and young adults between 2 and 25 years of age who have advanced solid tumors\n      that have not responded to standard treatments.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will be used to monitor the cancer before\n           treatment.\n\n        -  Participants will have apheresis to provide NK white blood cells for the study. The NK\n           cells will be collected from the blood.\n\n        -  Participants will have inpatient chemotherapy to prepare for the NK cell and IL-15\n           treatment.\n\n        -  After the chemotherapy, participants will receive the NK cells over several days. They\n           will also receive IL-15 to help the immune system respond to the cells.\n\n        -  After recovering in the hospital, participants will be monitored closely at home. They\n           will have frequent blood tests and imaging studies. They may also have another\n           apheresis to collect NK white blood cells again for study."
