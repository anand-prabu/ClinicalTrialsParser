            "textblock": "Background and Purpose: Incidence rates of esophageal cancer vary internationally with the\n      higher rate found in Eastern Asia. Preoperative concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CCRT) for\n      resectable esophageal cancer has been shown to improve overall survival in meta-analyses.\n      Preoperative pulmonary function and functional capacity are known predictive factors for the\n      development of postoperative pulmonary complications in patient undergoing major cancer\n      surgery. Little is known concerning the impacts of preoperative CCRT on pulmonary function\n      and functional capacity in patients with esophageal cancer. The aim of this study is to\n      examine changes of respiratory performance and functional exercise capacity during RT or\n      CCRT, the relations between these changes, and the impacts of these changes on the\n      postoperative outcomes in patients with esophageal cancer.\n\n      Method: Patients with newly diagnosed esophageal cancer without metastasis will be recruited\n      from the Far Eastern Memorial Hospital. Demographic data will be obtained from the chart.\n      Respiratory muscle strength will be measured by maximal inspiratory and expiratory pressure.\n      Spirometric variables will be tested by force expiratory volume in one second and forced\n      vital capacity. Dyspnea will be measured using modified Borg scale. Functional exercise\n      capacity will be measured by six minute walk distance. Quality of life will be measured\n      using EORTC QOL-C30 and QOL-OES18 instruments. All the measurements will be repeated weekly\n      during the concurrent therapy period.  Repeated measure ANOVA will be used for analyzing\n      difference among various time points. Spearman correlation coefficient will be used to test\n      relationship between multiple variables. For patients who are receiving esophagectomy after\n      CCRT or RT, pulmonary complications and total length of hospital stay will be documented.\n\n      Clinical relevance: The results of this study will help to better understand the indications\n      for chest physiotherapy (e.g., respiratory muscle weakness, reduced functional capacity, and\n      their related sequels)"
