  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an investigation of a mindfulness and interoceptive exposure intervention in
      patients with atrial fibrillation who are referred for catheter based ablation procedures,
      to decrease anxiety sensitivity, symptom burden, and atrial fibrillation recurrence.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have a poorer quality of life and have elevated rates
      of anxiety.  Higher anxiety and somatization has been associated with more severe AF
      symptoms.  Increased anxiety symptoms have also been associated with increased medical
      visits for AF management.  Some studies show that anxiety may increase the risk of AF
      recurrence following medical intervention, including increasing AF recurrence after
      circumferential pulmonary vein ablation. Growing evidence suggests a pressing need to treat
      anxiety and improve quality of life among AF patients, yet few data exist about how to
      accomplish this.  Mindfulness-based behavioral treatments offer promise in this regard.

      Interoceptive Exposure (IE) is an evidence-based cognitive behavioral intervention to
      address intolerance of anxiety-related physical sensations, commonly seen in panic disorder
      and other anxiety disorders.  It involves systematically and repeatedly inducing feared
      physical sensations to promote increased tolerance and reduced distress associated with
      these symptoms.

      Mindfulness is defined as paying attention to the present moment in an open and
      nonjudgmental way.  Mindfulness-based behavioral interventions have been successfully
      applied in various psychiatric and medical patient populations, including cardiac patients.
      Two meta-analyses suggest that mindfulness-based interventions are moderately effective for
      reducing distress related to physical or psychosomatic illnesses.

      The investigators of this study hypothesize that a mindfulness and IE intervention will
      decrease anxiety, AF symptoms and AF recurrence, and will improve quality of life among
      patients undergoing catheter-based ablation for AF.

      This is a pilot, prospective, randomized, controlled trial, with one-half of patients
      randomized to receive a mindfulness and IE intervention and one-half randomized to the
      control condition (medical care as usual).  The mindfulness and IE intervention will be
      delivered in four, manualized, individual sessions of 1.5-2 hours each.  The investigators
      anticipate delivering  3 sessions in the 1-3 months before ablation, and the 4th session 2-4
      weeks following it.

    <description>The Mindfulness and Interoceptive Exposure intervention will be delivered in 4 manualized, individualized therapy sessions, of 1.5 hours - 2 hours each. The intervention is comprised of four established cognitive-behavioral strategies: psychoeducation, mindfulness, interoceptive exposure and skills generalization. We anticipate delivering 3 sessions in the 1-3 months prior to the ablation procedure and the 4th session 2-4 weeks following the ablation procedure.</description>
