Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy followed by\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have hematologic cancer or\n      aplastic anemia."
