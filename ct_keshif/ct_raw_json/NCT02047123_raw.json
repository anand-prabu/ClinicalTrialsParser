            "textblock": "Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is an economically important oilseed. Lifestyle and diet are\n      the firstline interventions to reduced the short-term and long-term cardiovascular risk\n      factors. Due to its high content of lignans, \u03b1-linolenic acid (LNA) and fiber, flaxeed has a\n      beneficial effect on CVD risk factors, components to decrease the risk of cardiovascular\n      disease. Objective: To determine the effect of the consumption of flax seed yogurt on the\n      women lipid profile values to the limit, users of a pharmacy in Elche and in this way reduce\n      the small dyslipidemia. The investigators performed an intervention including 133 women\n      (age= 25-70 years). Participants were randomly and double-blind distributed into three\n      groups: Group 1 (n= 30) consumed flaxseed (FS), yoghurt (Y) and diet (D), Group 2 (n= 32)\n      volunteers consumed (Y) + (D) and Group 3 (n=27) consumed only diet. All groups followed a\n      limit levels-cholesterol diet. Circulating total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,\n      LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides and were determined at the beginning and end of a 30-day\n      test. As a result, group 1 presented significantly reduced total cholesterol levels.\n      Correlation analysis indicated that the intake of (FS) could explain the flaxseed effect of\n      the variation of the cholesterol and TG in this group. Altogether, this study concludes that\n      consumption FS exert a positive impact in total cholesterol level and TG"

Since they were patients with a high cardiovascular risk, the investigators aimed\n      to determine the effect of the administration of (FS+Y+D), (Y+D) and (D) on various\n      nutritional indicators.\n\n      A monitoring of nutritional intervention was carried out for 30 days and blood samples were\n      obtained by capillary puncture for total cholesterol levels, triglycerides, glucose. These\n      parameters were determined in situ by dry chemistry. A series of anthropometric measures\n      were also carried out at the beginning and at the end of the study including weight and\n      height, BMI (Body Mass Index), WHR (waist-hip ratio), systolic and diastolic arterial\n      pressure and heart rate.\n\n      Statistical analysis was carried out using STATGRAPHICS Centurion XV software (StatPoint\n      Technologies, Inc. Warrington, VA, USA); likewise, significance was defined at p \u2264 0.05.\n      Data are reported as mean \u00b1 standard error of the mean (sem). Intra-group statistical\n      comparisons were performed using the following hypothesis tests, both parametric and\n      non-parametric: t-test, sign test and signed rank test for paired samples. Inter-group\n      statistical comparisons were performed using the one-way analysis of variance and the\n      Kruskal-Wallis hypothesis tests. Also, Fisher's least significant difference (LSD) Multiple\n      Range Test and Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) were used in order to determine\n      which means were significantly different from the others. In addition, Generalized Multiple\n      Regression was used to statistically analyze the relationships between the variations in the\n      lipid profile and the different factors included in the study."
