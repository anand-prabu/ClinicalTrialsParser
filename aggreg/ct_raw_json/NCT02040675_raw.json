The lumen of the NAVA tube can be used\n      as a conventional oro/nasogastric tube and the electrodes will be connected to the Servo-I\n      ventilator. Although the Servo-I is a ventilator, it will be used only as a monitor for this\n      study. The position of the nasogastric tube will then be refined using the catheter\n      positioning screen as needed.\n\n      During the course of the EPSA various arrhythmias may become evident. When these are noted,\n      screen shots will be saved on the Servo-i monitor. Surface and electrogram recordings will\n      be saved at the same time. The NAVA catheter will be disconnected from the Servo-I monitor\n      during the ablation part of the procedure to prevent inadvertent damage to the monitor."
