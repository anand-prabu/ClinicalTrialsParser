    <textblock>
      This multicenter, open-label, single arm, long-term extension study will evaluate the safety
      and efficacy of RoActemra/Actemra in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis
      who have completed the 97-week WA22762 core study. Patients will receive RoActemra/Actemra
