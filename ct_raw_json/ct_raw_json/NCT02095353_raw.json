Subjects will be screened utilizing UNMC gadolinium contrast\n             guidelines.\n\n          -  Allergic reactions to MRI contrast agents.\n\n          -  Subjects who do not fit the criteria for the population we are evaluating.\n\n          -  Subjects should not participate in this study if they have any of the following\n             conditions:\n\n               -  Anxiety attacks\n\n               -  Panic disorder\n\n               -  Claustrophobia\n\n               -  Pregnant, or trying to become pregnant\n\n               -  Breast feeding\n\n          -  Subjects should not participate in this study if they have certain kinds of metal in\n             their body, for example: a heart pacemaker, defibrillator, neurostimulator, a metal\n             plate, certain otologic implants, certain types of heart valves, metal slivers in\n             eye, brain aneurysm clips or metal slivers and bullet fragments in or near certain\n             structures in their body.
