  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof-of-concept study, the investigators will assess the ease and usefulness of a
      positive psychology program in patients with acute coronary syndrome and less-than-optimal
      adherence to health behaviors.  The investigators believe that positive psychology (a field
      that studies boosting positive emotions rather than simply reducing negative emotions) will
      help this cardiac population to be more healthy.  The investigators want to determine
      whether this positive psychology program has the potential to be an adjunctive treatment for
      cardiac populations.

    <measure>Rate of exercise completion</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Rate of exercise completion will be measured by the number of exercises completed per subject. There are 8 exercises in total.  A good rate of completion will be defined as an average of 5 or more exercises completed per subject.</description>

    <measure>Ease of exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ease of exercises will be measured by a self-report 10-point Likert scale (0=not easy to complete, 10=very easy to complete). Ease will be defined as an average score of 6 or more on this scale.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-reported psychological impact of exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Psychological impact of exercises will be measured by two self-reported 10-point Likert scales. One scale measures optimism after completing the exercise (0=not optimistic, 10=very optimistic), and the other scale measures helpfulness of the exercises (0=not helpful, 10=very helpful). Psychological impact will be defined as an average score of 6 or more on both of these scales.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective psychological impact of exercises</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Object psychological impact of exercises will be measured by clinician-administered questionnaires given at baseline and again at 8 weeks. These questionnaires include:
Life Orientation Test-Revised (scores range from 6-30; a high score means higher optimism)
Gratitude Questionnaires-6 (scores range from 6-42; a high score means higher gratitude)
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (scores range from 0-42; a high score means higher depression and anxiety).
Objective psychological impact will be defined as having significantly improved scores at 8 weeks as compared to scores at baseline.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of step counter &amp; pill counter devices</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Feasibility of these devices is measured by the amount of data we collect from 1) a step counter used for 2 weeks and 2) a pill counter used for 8 weeks. Feasibility will be defined as receiving data from both devices from more than 80% of subjects.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Adult patients admitted to one of three cardiac inpatient units at Massachusetts
             General Hospital.

          -  Primary diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome (myocardial infarction or unstable
             angina).

          -  Less-than-optimal adherence to health behaviors.  This will be defined as a mean
             score of less than 15 on the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale (scores
             range from 3-18, with higher scores indicating better adherence).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cognitive deficits, assessed via a 6-item cognitive screen used to assess appropriate
             participation of medically-ill patients in research studies.

          -  Patients not prescribed aspirin at discharge.

          -  Inability to communicate in English.

          -  Inability to participate in physical activity.
