Determine the objective clinical response rate and duration of response in patients with\n      unresectable locally recurrent or metastatic melanoma treated with O6-benzylguanine and\n      carmustine.\n\n      II. Compare the toxicities of this regimen in patients with no prior chemotherapy vs prior\n      chemotherapy failure.\n\n      III. Correlate clinical response to this regimen in these patients with O6-alkylguanine DNA\n      alkyltransferase (AGT) depletion and baseline AGT in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and\n      tumor tissue.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to prior\n      chemotherapy (chemotherapy failure vs chemotherapy naive).\n\n      Patients receive O6-benzylguanine IV over 1 hour, followed 1 hour later by carmustine IV\n      over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment continues every 6 weeks for a minimum of 2 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Patients with disease progression are followed every 6 months. All other patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 1 year."
