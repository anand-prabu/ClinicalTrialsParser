Sorafenib is a drug that inhibits the growth of\n      cancer cells and prevents the formation of new blood vessels that would otherwise help the\n      cancer spread.\n\n      Studies in experimental animals have shown that sorafenib may also lower portal vein\n      pressure (the pressure of the blood passing from the intestine through the liver.) This\n      study seeks to determine if sorafenib lowers the blood pressure in liver blood vessels\n      (portal vein pressure) in patients with cirrhosis who have high portal vein pressure. The\n      study will also obtain information whether sorafenib is safe in this patient population.\n\n      Half of the patients will be given sorafenib and half will be given a placebo (a pill\n      without any medicine in it.) This allows a comparison of the reactions of people who take\n      sorafenib to those who do not."

Secondary end-point is safety of sorafenib.\n\n      The trial is structured as a randomized double blind placebo controlled study. After a\n      three-month period of therapy with sorafenib or placebo (double-blind phase), patients will\n      be given open-label sorafenib for an additional 3-month period (open-label phase).
