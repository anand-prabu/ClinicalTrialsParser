Determine the response\n      duration in patients with chronic phase CML treated with this drug.\n\n      IV. Compare the pharmacokinetics of this drug administered as a continuous infusion vs\n      subcutaneously in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a pilot, dose-escalation study. (Phase I completed as of 2/11/2004.)\n\n      Remission induction therapy: Patients receive remission induction therapy comprising\n      homoharringtonine IV continuously over 24 hours on day 1 and then subcutaneously (SC) twice\n      daily on days 2-14 for course 1. Subsequent courses of remission induction therapy comprise\n      homoharringtonine SC twice daily on days 1-14. Treatment continues monthly for at least 2\n      courses.\n\n      Maintenance therapy: Patients with complete hematologic remission receive maintenance\n      therapy comprising homoharringtonine SC twice daily on days 1-7 monthly for 3 years in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of homoharringtonine until the maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose at which 2 of 6 patients\n      experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional cohort of 25-30 patients with chronic phase\n      chronic myelogenous leukemia receives remission induction and maintenance therapy as above\n      at the MTD. (Phase I completed as of 2/11/2004.)\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 50 patients will be accrued for this study."
