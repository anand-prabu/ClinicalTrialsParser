The driving hypothesis of the clinic is that the 'one\n      size fits all' philosophy is untenable with a complex disease such as obesity.  The clinic\n      will serve as a portal for patients to choose standard clinical care or to explore\n      alternatives from a variety of clinical studies offered through the clinic.  These studies\n      will include further investigations into nutrition, the biological basis of weight and\n      weight management and protocols using approved and experimental pharmaceuticals."
