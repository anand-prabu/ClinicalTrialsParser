  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the most common causes of chronic liver
      disease worldwide. It is not known why only some obese subjects develop NAFLD. In recent
      years, a growing body of evidence showed a crucial role of autophagy in in the regulation of
      liver fat storage. The purpose of this study is to determine whether autophagy
      pathway-related genetic polymorphisms affect NAFLD.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will perform a prospective comparison of the genotype distribution of
      autophagy pathway-related genetic polymorphisms between those with and without NAFLD in a
      cohort of obese children and adolescents.

      [Subjects] Obesity is defined as the BMI value &gt; 95 percentile by different age- and gender
      groups according to the standards of the Department of Health in Taiwan.

      [Data collection] The following data were obtained for each subject: age, gender, BMI, waist
      and hip circumference. The investigators will measure total serum bilirubin, alanine
      aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, γ-glutamyltransferase fasting glucose,
      triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, insulin, glucose,
      and adiponectin.

      [Liver ultrasonography] All participants will receive an ultrasonographic study of the
      liver. NAFLD is defined as the presence of an ultrasonographic pattern consistent with the
      following criteria: liver-kidney echo discrepancy, attenuated echo penetration and
      visibility of diaphragm, and obscure hepatic vessel structures.

      [Genotyping] Genomic DNA will be extracted from 3 cc venous blood from each participant.
      After extraction, the genomic DNA will be immediately stored at -80°C. The TaqMan genotyping
      assays will be performed for selected SNPs genotyping on ABI 7300 Real-Time PCR System
      (Applied Biosystems).

      [Sample size] Sample size was estimated by Epi InfoTM 7 (CDC, USA) program. Because there
      was no previous data regarding to the effect of autophagy related gene on NAFLD, the
      investigators estimate the odds ratio to vary between 60-80%. The investigators used a
      confidence level of 95%, power of 80%, the ratio of controls to NAFLD cases of 25%, percent
      of controls exposed of 25-35%, the samples size required would be a total of 291-872
      subjects.
