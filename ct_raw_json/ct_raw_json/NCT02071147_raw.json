A conservative estimate of 70% of visits being unnecessary suggests a\n      potential saving to the NHS of approximately \u00a310M annually.\n\n      What's involved:\n\n      The study involves some questionnaires during the duration of the study. These include\n      questionnaires relating to the quality of life of the patient (conducted before the\n      operation, and at the 3 month research clinic) and a patient satisfaction questionnaire.\n      There is also a research clinic 3 months following the operation.\n\n      What are the risks/benefits:\n\n      There are no real personal benefits to patients on the trial. The trial aims to provide very\n      important information regarding the safety of discharging patients immediately after\n      surgery. However the trial could potentially save many thousands of unnecessary hospital\n      visits each year."

An earlier draft has been\n      presented to a patient panel and has the benefit of external review by a potential steering\n      group.\n\n      Patients undergoing routine elective phacoemulsification cataract surgery will be randomly\n      assigned to either a routine review at 4-6 weeks post-operatively (routine care) or to be\n      discharged from the cataract service immediately post-operatively. All patients will be\n      advised to see their own optometrist at 4-6 weeks for new spectacles if appropriate and will\n      then be reviewed in a research clinic at 3 months post operatively."
