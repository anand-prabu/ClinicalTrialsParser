      Multicenter randomized clinical trial comparing oxytocin versus oxytocin and foley catheter
      for induction in women who present with premature rupture of membranes who are not in labor.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, multi-center clinical trial to test the hypothesis that
      in women with term and near term premature rupture of membranes (PROM), an intrauterine
      Foley catheter plus oxytocin infusion will decrease the mean time from induction to delivery
      by 2.5 hours as compared to oxytocin alone.

    <description>A 30cc/16 French (16F) foley catheter will be inserted by the provider under direct visualization or by palpation, ensuring that the catheter is appropriately and adequately positioned. Oxytocin will be administered concurrently at a rate of  2 milliunits/milliliter (as noted under oxytocin active comparator). If the catheter remains in place after 12 hours, it will be deflated and removed and oxytocin infusion will continue.</description>

    <description>The balloon will be inflated with 30 cc of sterile saline. The catheter will be taped to the patient's leg so that traction is maintained. The catheter will be assessed hourly for expulsion by a health care provider by applying gentle traction on the catheter or a vaginal examination if it is unclear by traction.  Once the Foley catheter is expelled or 12 hours reached, the induction will be continued with oxytocin per this protocol.</description>

             study.

          6. Suspicion of chorioamnionitis

          7. Any contraindications to vaginal delivery, including malpresentation, active herpes,
