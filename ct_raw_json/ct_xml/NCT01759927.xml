    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to investigate if and how a physical activity counselor can
      offer an added value in exercise promotion in physically inactive employees. We will explore
      if the physical activity counselor in the workplace setting can motivate sedentary employees
      to engage into systematic participation in sports and/or exercise by means of a short term
      coaching of 12 weeks. We aim to include 300 employees in the physical activity coaching
      process.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Being physically active on a regular basis has many health benefits. Nevertheless, the
      majority of the Belgian population doesn't reach the recommended amount and intensity of
      physical activity to profit from these health benefits. A physical activity counselor can
      possibly play a crucial role for these physically inactive individuals. He/she can design an
      individualized exercise program to stimulate the person to become lifelong physical active.
      Research has shown that exercise promotion at work can result in a lower absenteeism,
      prevention of burn-out and a positive corporate identity.
