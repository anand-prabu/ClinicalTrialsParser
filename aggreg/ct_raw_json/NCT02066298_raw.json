For each participant, treatments are first compared to see if they differ in terms of treatment failures. If one treatment results in no treatment failures and another treatment does, it is deemed the superior treatment and no further comparisons are made. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by treatment failures, then they are compared by asthma control days (ACDs). If one treatment yields at least 31 annualized ACDs more than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority still cannot be assigned by ACDs, then they are compared by percent predicted FEV1 at the end of a treatment period. If one treatment yields at least 5% greater FEV1 than another, it is deemed the superior treatment. If treatment superiority cannot be assigned by exacerbations, ACDs or FEV1, then that participant is classified as having no differential response.",
