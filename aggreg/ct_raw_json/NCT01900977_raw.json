The design of\n      HPTN 071 (PopART) will allow the study team to distinguish between the impact of universal\n      testing with referral for HIV care in accordance with national guidelines, and the impact of\n      universal testing with referral for early ART initiation for those with HIV infection. In\n      addition, HPTN 071 (PopART) will determine if a program of universal voluntary testing,\n      including early ART initiation, is feasible and acceptable when delivered on a large scale\n      to entire communities. Evaluating the effectiveness of universal voluntary HIV counseling\n      and testing with the offer of early ART is a key global health priority."
