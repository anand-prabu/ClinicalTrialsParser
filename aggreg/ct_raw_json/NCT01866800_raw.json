Physical examination and medical interview\n\n        2. Cardiac echocardiogram assessing systolic and diastolic function as well as valvular\n           function\n\n        3.

Briefly, the\n      femoral artery will be accessed with the standard endovascular technique and it involves\n      advancing a large catheter (18 Fr) through the aortic arch, retrogradely crossing the aortic\n      valve, following by balloon valvuloplasty and stent-valve implantation. During the\n      procedure, the patients will receive analgesics and anxiolytics as per protocol.\n\n      Post procedural pharmacotherapy, sheath removal, and deployment of hemostatic devices will\n      be left to the discretion of the attending physicians. Following treatment in the\n      catheterization laboratory, medical treatment throughout hospitalization and follow up\n      treatment will be left to the discretion of the treating physician managing patient care on\n      the hospital wards. Specific agents added or withdrawn will be made by treating physicians\n      and will not be influenced by the study team.\n\n      Prevention of contrast-induced nephropathy\n\n      Each patient will be randomized to one of the following treatment strategies:\n\n      Group 1-Isotonic saline at a rate of 0.5- 1 mL/kg per hour will be administered beginning 12\n      hours prior to the procedure, and continue for 12 hours after contrast administration. In\n      addition, 1200 mg of N-acetyl-cysteine will be administered orally twice daily the day\n      before and the day of the procedure.\n\n      The patients will be connected to the Renal Guard System that will not be activated (passive\n      mode) as described below:\n\n      Before the procedure:\n\n        -  A standard 18-22 gauge catheter will be inserted into a peripheral vein of the arm (as\n           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).\n\n        -  A standard Foley catheter will be placed in the bladder for urine collection (as\n           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).\n\n        -  The IV line and the urinary catheter will be connected to the RenalGuard System.\n\n        -  The RenalGuard System will be set to 0% match - i.e. the urine rate and volume will be\n           measured but it will not delivered matched IV normal saline. (Diagram A).\n\n        -  The system will be computed to deliver continues IV normal saline at a rate of 100\n           cc/hr (100cc/hr is the routine average fluid infusion rate in TAVI procedure)\n\n        -  During the procedure, additional IV fluids can be added as needed according to the\n           clinical decision of the anesthesiologist or the attending physician.\n\n      Procedure (Diagram B):\n\n        -  Routine IV bolus of will not be given before the procedure.\n\n        -  Routine IV Furosemide will not be given before the procedure.\n\n        -  The urine and infusion volumes will be measured by the RenalGuard system throughout the\n           catheterization procedure and for 6 h after the last contrast dose.\n\n        -  the investigator will analyze the quantity and quality of urine during the duration of\n           the procedure\n\n      Group 2-Treatment as group 1 and in addition, the Renal Guard system will be activated as\n      described below.\n\n      Before the procedure:\n\n        -  A standard 18-22 gauge catheter will be inserted into a peripheral vein of the arm (as\n           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).\n\n        -  A standard Foley catheter will be placed in the bladder for urine collection (as\n           performed routinely for all TAVI procedures).\n\n        -  The IV line and the urinary catheter will be connected to the RenalGuard System.\n\n        -  The RenalGuard System will be set to 100% match - i.e. the urine rate and volume will\n           be measured and the system will deliver volume of IV normal saline that is matched to\n           the volume of urine produced by the patient..(Diagram A).\n\n      Procedure (Diagram B):\n\n        -  ~90 min before the procedure, an initial IV bolus (250 ml) of normal saline over 30\n           min. In patient in heart failure the volume of the bolus can be reduced to 150ml .\n\n        -  Furosemide will then administered as a single intravenous bolus of 0.25-0.5 mg/kg (up\n           to a maximum of 50 mg)\n\n        -  When a urine output rate >300 ml/h will be achieved, the patients will be sent to the\n           catheterization laboratory.\n\n        -  Additional doses of furosemide (up to a maximal cumulative dose of 2.0 mg/kg) will be\n           given in cases where the urine output is below 300 ml/h during treatment.\n\n        -  Matched hydration will continued throughout the catheterization procedure and for 6 h\n           after the last contrast dose.\n\n        -  the investigator will analyze the quantity and quality of urine during the duration of\n           the procedure.\n\n      Diagram A - The \"RenalGuard\" System\n\n      Definition of AKI. Serum creatinine level will be measured prior to TAVI and at 48-72 hr\n      post procedure. AKI will be defined as stage 1, 2 or 3 according to VARC-2 AKI\n      classification16  (table 1).\n\n      Table 1. - AKI post TAVI according to the VARC-2 classification Acute Kidney Injury post\n      TAVI Stage 1 Increase in serum creatinine to 150-199% of baseline OR Increase of \u22650.3 mg/dl\n      (26.4 mmol/L) OR Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for >6 but <12 h Stage 2 Increase in serum\n      creatinine to 200-299% of baseline OR Urine output <0.5 ml/kg/h for >12 but <24 h Stage 3\n      Increase in serum creatinine to \u2265 300% of baseline OR Increase of serum creatinine of \u22654.0\n      mg/dL (354 mmol/L)  with an acute increase of at least 0.5 mg/dl (44 mmol/l) OR Urine output\n      <0.3 ml/kg/h for >24 h OR Anuria for >12 h\n\n      Follow Up After the procedure, the patients will be followed up clinically as well as using\n      laboratory tests. The follow up procedures are detailed in the table below.\n\n      Blood and urinary samples during hospitalization:\n\n      Blood samples:\n\n        -  Taken at baseline (on admission),before the procedure, after 6 hours , after 12\n           hours,after 24 hours, after 48 hours, and at 72 hours post procedure.\n\n        -  the investigator will evaluate the following: full chemistry BNP, NT-BNP, uric acid,\n           blood count, inflammatory biomarker (hs-CRP, fibrinogen, IL-6, IL-1, MMP,  Lp-PLA2,\n           procalcitonin, IL-10, IL-35, TNFa, AchE, cholinergic status, etc.), renal markers\n           (creatinine, NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin ,FGF23, Cystatin-C),\n           serum samples for HPLC analysis of contrast media concentration and serum samples will\n           be frozen for future tests\n\n      Urine samples:\n\n        -  Taken at baseline (on admission),before the procedure, after 6 hours, 12 hours,after 24\n           hours, after 48 hours, and at 72 hours post procedure.\n\n        -  In every sample -50 cc of urine will be drawn to measure: basic urinalysis, ,\n           electrolytes, protein and creatinine, and HPLC analysis of contrast media.\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n      1.
