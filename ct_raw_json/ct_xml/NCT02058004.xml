    <textblock>
      In modern anesthesia practice, the application of cricoid pressure during intubation is not
      infrequently used with the goal of preventing gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration.  The evidence
      to support this practice is very scarce, and there have recently been many reports in the
      literature questioning the safety of cricoid pressure during intubation.  Therefore, the
      goal of this study will be to randomize those at risk for microaspiration to receive cricoid
      pressure versus no cricoid pressure during intubation.  We will specifically exclude those
      patients thought to be at the highest risk of aspiration (it is considered standard of care
      to perform cricoid pressure during intubation of this population).  We will include those
      patients with some risk factors for aspiration (it is not considered standard of care to
      apply cricoid pressure during intubation of this population).

    <textblock>
      Gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration during induction of anesthesia remains a significant risk in
      the modern practice of anesthesia.(1)  Macroaspiration (grossly visible aspiration) has been
      clearly associated with severe pulmonary injury.(1-4)  More recently, microaspiration
      (aspiration without grossly visible gastric material) has also been associated with
      significant morbidity.(2)  Specifically, microaspiration has been associated with acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(5), ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP)(6) and acute
      respiratory failure due to bronchoconstriction and ventilation-perfusion mismatching.
      Pepsin A has been shown to be a very specific biochemical marker for gastric-to-pulmonary
      aspiration.(7)  In our previous studies, we demonstrated the rate of microaspiration in
      normal elective surgical patients without risk factors for aspiration was 4% as detected by
      the ELISA assay for pepsin A.(8) This compared with a rate of 12.5% in patients with risk
      factors for microaspiration including obesity, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and
      diabetes.  One proposed technique to prevent gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration is cricoid
      pressure.  Recently, there has been growing evidence which calls into question the
      effectiveness of cricoid pressure. Radiologic studies by Smith et al yield indirect evidence
      to suggest that cricoid pressure may not reliably occlude the esophagus.(9,10)  Currently,
      cricoid pressure for patients with risk factors for microaspiration (obesity, GERD and
      diabetes) is used commonly but inconsistently.(11)  By using the same sampling and analysis
      techniques employed in our previous microaspiration studies, the currently proposed study
      will provide a very sensitive and specific assessment of the effectiveness of cricoid
      pressure to prevent aspiration during elective induction of anesthesia and intubation.  Our
      proposed study would enroll patients with risk factors for microaspiration who are scheduled
      to undergo high-risk (for pulmonary complications) elective surgery requiring endotracheal
      intubation.  We will exclude those with risk factors for macroaspiration (including bowel
      obstruction, non-fasting status and esophageal pathology associated with increased risk for
      macroaspiration such as achalasia and hiatal hernia), because cricoid pressure remains the
      standard of care for those at risk for macroaspiration at our institution.  Those patients
      enrolled will be randomized to receive cricoid pressure versus no cricoid pressure.
      Immediately following elective intubation, a sample of tracheal secretions from each patient
      will be obtained and the pepsin A concentration determined.  The primary outcome will be the
      rate of microaspiration determined by the presence of pepsin A in the trachea.  Secondary
      outcomes of interest will be rates of postoperative pulmonary complications including acute
      respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).  The findings of
      this study will provide the most direct evidence yet regarding the effectiveness of cricoid
      pressure for the prevention of gastric-to-pulmonary aspiration during induction of
      anesthesia and endotracheal intubation.  Ultimately, the findings of this study will improve
      patient safety by providing accurate prospective evidence regarding the effectiveness and
      safety of cricoid pressure in this setting, and will further explore the clinical
      significance of microaspiration.
