Presence of renal function impairment (creatinine greater than 120 uM), or\n             predisposition for acute renal failure (e.g., any degree of pre-existing renal\n             insufficiency or routine treatment with known nephritic drugs).\n\n         11. Treatment with oral or parenteral steroids for equal to 30 days or when given\n             intermittently or as bolus at daily doses equal to 0.15 mg/kg.\n\n         12. Treatment with immunosuppressive or immunomodulatory drugs.\n\n         13. Live viral vaccination (such as measles, rubella, mumps and varicella) within the\n             last 2 months prior to first infusion of octanorm.\n\n         14.
