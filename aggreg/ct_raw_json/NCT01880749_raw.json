This is a \"phase 0\" PK (pharmacokinetic) and PD\n      (pharmacodynamic) study of RAD001 in patients with Neurofibromatosis Type 2-related and\n      sporadic VS and meningiomas. Enrolled patients will take RAD001 prior to a scheduled VS or\n      meningioma surgery, and blood and tissue samples will be obtained for further analysis."
