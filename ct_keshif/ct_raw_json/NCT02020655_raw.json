            "textblock": "Background: A pressure ulcer is localized tissue injury to the superficial layer of the skin\n      and/ or the underlying tissue. Pressure ulcers are most likely to develop in skin areas\n      exposed to pressure, shear and friction. Shear- force is an important contributing factor\n      and wound dressing are possibly capable to reduce shear force at the skin. At this moment\n      there's no good marker to detect the effect of shear- force at the skin. A potential marker\n      could be cytokines (IL-1\u03b1) which are released after mechanical loading of the skin. A\n      previous study have shown a significant increased level of IL-1\u03b1 after the application of\n      pressure. We want to investigate if these cytokines are significant increased after the\n      application of shear- force at the skin.\n\n      Objective: The objective of this study is to gather knowledge about cytokine concentrations\n      (IL-1 \u03b1) in the skin of healthy volunteers after the application of shear- force. We want to\n      use this knowledge in the future to investigate if different prophylactic wound dressings\n      are capable to reduce shear force at the skin. This could be interesting in the prevention\n      of pressure ulcers.\n\n      Study design: With the use of a special developed shear- force model are we going to\n      administer 20 Newton (2 kg) shear at the palmar side of the under arm in 10 healthy\n      volunteers for 30 minutes. As a control we ware going to put the shear- force model at the\n      other arm without the application of shear- force. Before the use of the shear- force model\n      we will perform cytokine measurements with the use of Sebutape. Sebutape is capable to\n      absorb cytokines from the skin. After the use of the shear force- model we will perform\n      cytokine measurements again. Then we will extract the cytokines from the Sebutape with the\n      use of ELISA.\n\n      Study population: 10 Healthy volunteers Age 18- 30 years\n\n      Primary outcome: IL-1 \u03b1 concentration (pg/ml)"
