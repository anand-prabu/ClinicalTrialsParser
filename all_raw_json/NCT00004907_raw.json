Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation may allow the doctor to give\n      higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and radiation therapy and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I/II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation therapy\n      plus bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have\n      refractory or relapsed T-cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Patients with minimal response after completion of chemotherapy receive\n           cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -8 and -7, followed by etoposide IV over 30\n           hours beginning on day -6, followed by total body irradiation twice daily on days -4 to\n           -1.\n\n        -  Group B (prior radiation greater than 2,000 cGy): Patients with CR or PR after\n           completion of chemotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days -7 to -4,\n           followed by cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -3 and -2. Patients with minimal\n           response after completion of chemotherapy receive oral busulfan every 6 hours on days\n           -9 to -6, followed by cyclophosphamide IV over 1 hour on days -5 and -4, followed by\n           etoposide IV over 30 hours beginning on day -3.\n\n        -  Both groups: Bone marrow or PBSC are reinfused on day 0. Patients with bulky nodal\n           disease (greater than 5 cm) may undergo involved field radiotherapy two weeks before\n           transplantation.\n\n      Patients are followed every month for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Not specified"
