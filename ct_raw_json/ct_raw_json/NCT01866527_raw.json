Severe sonographic\n      dysplasia and/or dislocatable/dislocated hips were treated with abduction splints. Mild\n      dysplasia and/or pathological instability, i.e. not dislocatable/dislocated hips were\n      followed clinically and sonographically until spontaneous resolution, or until treatment\n      became necessary.

Another 2700 (3,3%) normalised spontaneously after watchful waiting from\n      birth. Twenty-six infants (0,32 per 1000, 92% girls, two from the risk group) presented with\n      late subluxated/dislocated hips (after one month of age). Another 126 (1,5 per 1000, 83%\n      girls, one from the risk group) were treated after isolated late residual dysplasia.\n      Thirty-one children (0,38 per 1000) had surgical treatment before age five years. Avascular\n      necrosis was diagnosed in seven of all children treated (0.27%), four after early and three\n      after late treatment.\n\n      Interpretation The first 16 years of a standardised selective US screening programme for DDH\n      resulted in acceptable rates of early treatment and US follow-ups, and low rates of late\n      subluxated/dislocated hips compared to similar studies."
