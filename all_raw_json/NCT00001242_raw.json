Resistance to a factor is manifested by deficient bioeffect\n      despite high levels of the factor in blood.  Patients will be tested with multiple indices\n      of mineral metabolism to establish the diagnosis and examine the spectrum of the underlying\n      disorder.  The principal therapies will be combinations of calcium, phosphate, and a vitamin\n      D analog.  Selected patients will have localization and surgery to remove a tumor that\n      causes renal wasting of phosphate.  Patients will be considered for entry into other\n      research protocols."
