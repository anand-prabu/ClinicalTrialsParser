    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia
      based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 52 weeks of treatment. To
      provide further assessment of the long-term efficacy and safety of deferasirox in NTDT
      patients with iron overload (LIC ≥ 5 mg Fe/g liver dw and SF ≥ 300 ng/mL) over 260 weeks.

    <textblock>
      To assess the efficacy of deferasirox in patients with non-transfusion dependent thalassemia
      based on change in liver iron concentration from baseline after 24 and 52 . Also, to
      evaluate the impact of deferasirox on the Quality of Life for adults and pediatric patients;
      correlate changes in serum ferritin and LIC, evaluate efficacy changes according to
      genotype, evaluate higher doses of deferasirox, assess endocrine function and examine pk
      parameters.To also assess the efficacy of treatment in patients with very high LIC (&gt;15 mg
      Fe/g dw) at baseline and those who need re-treatment after having reached the target LIC &lt; 3
      mg Fe/g dw during the study

    <description>The PedsOL is a modular approach to measuring health-related quality of life in pediatrics (13 to 18 years). The approach includes both a child self-report and a parent proxy-report. The 23-item PedsQL Generic Core Scales encompass the essential core domains for pediatric health related quality of life measurement: Physical functioning, emotional functioning, social functioning and school functioning.</description>
