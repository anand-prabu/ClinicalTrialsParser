  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Opiate dependence is a serious problem, and oxytocin has many properties which make it
      attractive as a treatment for this type of substance dependence.  This experiment will test
      the effects of oxytocin on a variety of brain-based processes in patients with opiate
      dependence.  The investigators hypothesize that intranasal oxytocin in these conditions will
      enhance emotional processing and will have beneficial effects on stress responses in
      opiate-dependent patients.

    <description>The Cold Pressure task involves placing a hand or forearm in cold water, a stimulus that produces a slowly mounting pain of mild to moderate intensity and is terminated by voluntary withdrawal of the limb.   The cold pressor task has been used in many studies of pain, autonomic reactivity, and hormonal stress responses.</description>

             with the objectives of the study

          -  any active, severe mental illness, neurological disorder, including schizophrenia,
             autism, Asperger's syndrome

             excluding drug or alcohol rehabilitation

          -  any clinically significant chronic pain condition, as determined by the principal
             investigator

          -  positive salivary drug screen at the time of the visit, for any substance other than
