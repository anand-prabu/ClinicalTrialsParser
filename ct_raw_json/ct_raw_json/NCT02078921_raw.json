Inorganic nitrate in the\n      diet is absorbed into the bloodstream, concentrated and reduced by bacteria in the mouth to\n      nitrite, which is then absorbed into the bloodstream. .\n\n      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of oral inorganic nitrate\n      supplementation on clinical markers of heart ischaemia and the frequency of angina."
