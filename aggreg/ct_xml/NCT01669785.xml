  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is intended to verify through clinical measurement that the NUPRO Sensodyne
      Prophylaxis Paste with Novamin provides immediate sensitivity relief as well as extended
      relief up to 28 days.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the prophy paste with Novamin will give patients immediate
      sensitivity relief, as well as sensitivity relief up to 4 weeks (28 days) after measurement.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Availability to complete in the 28 day duration.

          -  Two sensitive teeth, which are not adjacent to each other and preferably in different
             quadrants, which demonstrate cervical erosion, abrasion and gingival recession.

          -  Qualifying response to tactile stimuli as defined by a score of &lt;/= 20 grams.

          -  Qualifying response to air blast stimuli as defined by a score of &gt;/= 1 on the Schiff
             Cold Air Sensitivity Scale.

          -  Subjects need to satisfy the qualifying response to stimuli for both parameters
             assesses (Tactile or Air Blast) on at least two teeth (non-adjacent) to be entered
             into the study.

          -  Good general health with no known allergies to products being tested.

          -  Use of a non-desensitizing dentifrice for 2 weeks prior to entry into the study.

          -  Subjects must have a minimum of 10 natural teeth, excluding 3rd molars.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Females who may be pregnant or lactating or intending to become pregnant.

          -  Individuals who require anesthetic during scaling.

          -  Dental pathology which may cause pain similar to tooth sensitivity.

          -  Individuals with large amounts of calculus.

          -  Subjects with active infectious diseases such as hepatitis, HIV, or tuberculosis.

          -  Any condition requiring antibiotic prophylaxis for dental treatment.

          -  Excessive gingival inflammation.

          -  Individuals who had their teeth cleaned within 30 days of the screening appointment.

          -  Individuals who have had desensitizing treatment or tooth bleaching within 90 days of
             screening appointment.

          -  Oral pathology, chronic disease, or history of allergy to test products.

          -  Advanced periodontal disease or treatment for periodontal disease (including surgery)
             within the past twelve months.

          -  Sensitive teeth with mobility greater than one.

          -  Teeth with extensive/defective restorations (including prosthetic crowns), suspected
             pulpitis, caries, cracked enamel, or used as abutments for removable partial
             dentures.

          -  Regular use of sedatives, anti-inflammatory drugs, or analgesic.

          -  Participation in a desensitizing dentifrice study or regular use of a desensitizing
             dentifrice within the past 4 weeks.

          -  Current participation in any other clinical study or receipt of an investigational
             drug within 30 days of the screening visit at the start of the study.

          -  Personnel; a) an employee of the sponsor; b0 A member or relative of teh study site
             staff directly involved with the study.
