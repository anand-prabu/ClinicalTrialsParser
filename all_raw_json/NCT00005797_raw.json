It also helps stop the patient's immune\n      system from rejecting the donor's stem cells. When the healthy stem cells from a donor are\n      infused into the patient they may help the patient's bone marrow make stem cells, red blood\n      cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\n\n      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well donor bone marrow transplant works in\n      treating patients with hematologic cancers."
