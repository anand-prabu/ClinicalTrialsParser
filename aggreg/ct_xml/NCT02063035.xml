      Hypothesis: Topical application of Tranexamic acid into the surgical wound during spine
      surgery will decrease the overall blood loss post-operatively. This reduction in blood loss
      will reduce the need for transfusion. In addition it will also significantly reduce the cost
      of the surgical procedure.

      Specific Aim 1: The goal of this study is to quantitatively assess whether topical
      application of tranexamic acid placed into the surgical wound during lumbar spine surgery
      will decrease post-operative blood loss, thus lowering the need for blood transfusions. By
      reducing the number of transfusions patients can avoid the well known complications
      associated with them. The investigators do not plan on measuring serum tranexamic acid
      levels.

      Several meta-analyses and level I studies have shown that IV administration of tranexamic
      acid is effective in reducing post operative blood loss and the need for transfusion

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tranexamic acid, an antifibrinolytic agent, has been studied at great length across a myriad
      of medical specialties to reduce blood lost during these surgeries. More specifically,
      widespread use of this agent has proven safe and effective in cardiothoracic; ear, nose, and
      throat (ENT); oral and maxillofacial; and orthopaedic surgeries (total hip, total knee, and
      spine surgeries) (1, 2, 3, 4). Additionally, an oral version of tranexamic acid, which is
      FDA approved, has historically been used in the Gynecological literature for patients with
      menorrhagia. Even large doses of prophylactic antifibrinolytic agents, and more
      specifically, tranexamic acid have also proven safe and effective for major orthopaedic
      spine surgeries (5). Tranexamic acid has been FDA approved in oral and IV form for over 25
      years with a wealth of safety and efficacy documented in the literature. In a recent
      prospective double blinded study involving total knee arthroplasty a 25-30% reduction in
      blood loss compared to negative control was shown when using tranexamic acid topically(6).

      While systemic (Intravenous) use of tranexamic acid has been studied in spine surgery, there
      has been little studied to show its effectiveness at reducing blood loss when used
      topically.         This study proposes to determine if the topical application of tranexamic
      acid into the surgical wound of posterior multi-level lumbar spine surgery will decrease
      postoperative blood loss, thus decreasing the need for potential transfusions. Tranexamic
      acid has been well documented for its safety and efficacy, the investigators believe that
      this agent will become an important tool to reduce the blood loss in spinal surgeries. It
      offers a reduction in blood loss and, ultimately, a decrease in the transfusion rates which
      pose risks to the patient and significant cost.
