The purpose of the study is to test the\n      safety and efficacy of Tocilizumab at differing dose schedules.  There are 2 phases to this\n      study. Both phases include subjects with acute GVHD have not responded to steroid treatment.\n      Subjects enrolled in Phase IIp will receive Tocilizumab 8 mg/kg every week or every 2 weeks.\n      Subjects enrolled in Phase II will receive one of two dose schedules determined by the\n      results of Phase IIp. Depending on the dose they are assigned to, subjects will receive\n      Tocilizumab every week or every 2 weeks for a total of 8 doses. The study medication may be\n      interrupted, withheld or stopped for different reasons. However, subjects will be asked to\n      follow up periodically for one year after starting Tocilizumab treatment."
