    <textblock>
      A non interventional, descriptive, longitudinal cohort study is designed, trying to obtain
      local data about the prevalence of non remitted depressed patients after an antidepressant
      treatment, and to get information about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
      these patients as well as features of their treatments and compare them with those of the
      patients that achieve remission. Also the effect of patient´s expectation in the treatment
      outcome will be examined.

      A non interventional, descriptive, longitudinal cohort study is designed, trying to obtain
      local data about the prevalence of non remitted depressed patients after an antidepressant
      treatment, and to get information about sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of
      these patients as well as features of their treatments and compare them with those of the
      patients that achieve remission. Also the effect of patient´s expectation in the treatment
      outcome will be examined.

      Non psychotic depressed patients that are initiating an antidepressant treatment will be
      recruited. Socio demographic and clinical features will be recorded as well as their
      expectations before the treatment. Severity of depression and treatment characteristics will
      be recorded after 4 to 8 weeks of drug treatment at an adequate dose. Variables will be
      compared between the patients that will achieve remission and those that do not.
