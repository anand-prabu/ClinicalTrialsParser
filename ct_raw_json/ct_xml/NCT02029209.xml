    <textblock>
      1. To reveal  changes of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo tumor
           in the phase II study of  anlotinib in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
           cancer.

        2. To clarify the meaning of peripheral markers and blood perfusion parameters in vivo
           tumor  in predicting the effect of anti-angiogenic therapy.
