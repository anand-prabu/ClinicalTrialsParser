      This is a single center, open-label, single arm Phase 2 clinical study of the oral Selective
      Inhibitor of Nuclear Export (SINE) Selinexor (KPT-330) in patients with metastatic
      castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, open-label study to explore the effect of selinexor (KPT-330) therapy in
      patients with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Approximately 50
      patients are planned for enrollment.  Patients will receive an initial oral dose of
      selixenor at 50 mg/m2 oral twice weekly (e.g Monday/Wednesday) per cycle.  Each cycle is 28
      days.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate with evidence for skeletal
             metastases on bone scan and/or CT scan.

          -  Must have received one agent known to impact survival (abiraterone, enzalutamide,
             ect.)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) &lt; 2

          -  Serum testosterone levels &lt; 50ng/ml

          -  Ongoing gonadal androgen deprivation therapy with LHRH analogues or orchiectomy.
             Patients, who have not had an orchiectomy, must be maintained on standard dosing of
             LHRH analogue therapy at appropriate frequency for the duration of the study

          -  Progression of disease despite androgen ablation (either documented osseous or soft
             tissue metastatic disease progression or by PSA criteria progression).  Progressive
             disease will be defined by PSA evidence: a PSA level of at least 5 ng/ml which has
             risen on at least 2 successive occasions, at least 2 weeks apart.  The participant
             will need a baseline test and a test to show that the PSA has increased.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologic variants other than adenocarcinoma in the primary tumor

          -  Patient with mCRPC who requires urgent treatment with docetaxel

          -  Therapy with samarium, strontium or radium within 8 weeks prior to first dose of
             study drug.

          -  Prior radiation therapy completed &lt; 3 weeks or single fraction of palliative
             radiotherapy within 14  days prior to first dose of study drug.

          -  Active or uncontrolled autoimmune disease that may require corticosteroid therapy
             during study

          -  Severely compromised immunological state, including known human immunodeficiency
             virus (HIV)

          -  Known acute or chronic hepatitis B or C

          -  Chemotherapy and other investigational therapies (targeted or immunotherapy) will
             require a 3-week washout period before treatment initiation
