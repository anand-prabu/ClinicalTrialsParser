Based on these indications, cancer\n      patients with unsuspected pulmonary embolism would be anticoagulated for at least 6 months\n      or until the disease is active, which in most cases would mean indefinite treatment. In\n      fact, dedicated studies on the treatment of unsuspected pulmonary embolism are missing,\n      leaving doubts over the need for (indefinite) anticoagulation which exposes these patients\n      to an increased risk of major bleeding events. Concerns over the need for anticoagulant\n      treatment may especially hold for pulmonary embolism of the distal pulmonary tree since\n      segmental and sub-segmental PE seem to have a more benign course than more proximal\n      embolism.\n\n      The scope of this study is to evaluate the current treatment approaches for unsuspected\n      pulmonary embolism and to assess their efficacy and safety in a large prospective cohort of\n      cancer patients."
