Computerized provider\n      order entry, with embedded clinical decision support, has great promise in reducing\n      medication errors but preventable adverse drug events may still occur despite such systems.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The purpose of the study was to evaluate whether adding medication profiling (by using a\n      retrospective drug utilization review program) to computerized provider order entry with\n      embedded order checks (drug alerts) reduces the incidence of adverse drug events.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Medication profiles mainly focused on possible drug-drug and drug-disease interactions, with\n      some drug duplications.  To do the medication profiles we licensed a proprietary\n      computerized retrospective drug utilization review system.  We randomly assigned over 900\n      patients to Usual Care or Provider Feedback.  For patients in the latter group, selected\n      providers were contacted by letter with pertinent information; electronic mail was used for\n      follow-up contact.  Clinical and other relevant data was retrospectively abstracted from the\n      medical records for up to one year from the last medication profile for all patients.  This\n      was done by a pharmacist reviewer, using a study-derived instrument, and blinded to patient\n      assignment.  ADE incidence is the primary outcome of interest, with other outcomes such as\n      ADE severity and preventability also assessed.  We also developed and implemented provider\n      surveys in pre- and post-profiling periods.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Pre and post survey results published. Adjunct study on clinical actions as a result of drug\n      alerts published. Main study (profiling): manuscript in proces."
