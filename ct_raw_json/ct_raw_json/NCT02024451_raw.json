            "textblock": "Myofascial pain syndrome is common in Rehabilitation clinic. The pain occurs asymmetrically\n      in isolated or regional muscles, and is associated with acute muscle strain or chronic\n      muscle overuse.  Myofascial pain is characteristics with localized muscle tenderness,\n      palpable intramuscular taut band, typical referred pain, and local twitch response.\n\n      Treatment of myofascial pain syndrome includes physical therapy, stretch exercise, dry\n      needle insertion and trigger point injection. Acupuncture originated from ancient Chinese\n      medicine which involves the insertion of fine needle to stimulate specific points of the\n      body along the 12 meridians. The mechanism of pain relief may be initiated by activation of\n      both spinal segmental and supraspinal centers. Acupuncture is commonly used for pain relief.\n\n      Recently, radial shock wave has been shown to be effective in the treatment of chronic\n      musculoskeletal pain, including calcific tendinitis, epicondylitis, and plantar fasciitis.\n      The energy and pressure produced by radial shock wave is focused on the treated\n      musculoskeletal tissue. The mechanism of action has been hypothesized that the energy could\n      result in analgesic effect and stimulation of angiogenesis and healing response and then\n      relief of the symptoms. The effectiveness of radial shock wave on treatment of myofascial\n      pain was reported by Jeon and colleagues in 2012.\n\n      The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of acupuncture and radial shock wave\n      therapy in patients with myofascial pain syndrome."

Treatment point is the origin attachment of upper trapezius at the\n      external occipital protuberance. RSWT will be performed once per week, and will be continued\n      for 3 weeks.\n\n      Acupuncture is performed at Fenfchi (GB20) point over upper back. This acupoint is a common\n      local point for treating upper back pain. Acupuncture therapy will be provided by the same\n      physiatrist to all patients.\n\n      The primary outcome measures are VAS for pain and pain threshold. The secondary outcome\n      measures are neck disability index, and patients' satisfaction. All subjects will be\n      assessed by an independent, blinded investigator at baseline, post treatment and at 1-month\n      after the treatments are completed.\n\n      Demographic data, including age, sex, employment status, and sleep quality, history of head\n      or neck surgery, or other psychiatric and medical disorders will be recorded at baseline. A\n      history will be taken concerning the duration of complaints (months), previous treatments\n      (injections, physical therapy), and current pain medications. Concomitant diseases and the\n      use of medications will be registered."
