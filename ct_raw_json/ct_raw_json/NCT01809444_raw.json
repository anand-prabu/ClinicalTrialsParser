            "textblock": "Graves' orbitopathy is an autoimmune disease characterized by an inflammatory phase followed\n      by fibrosis. Surgery to correct eyelid swelling, proptosis, and diplopia is effective, but\n      can not be done until the inflammatory phase has passed. To arrest the inflammatory phase,\n      several types of immunosuppressive treatments have been investigated. Corticosteroids are\n      the first-choice immunosuppressive treatment, having a successful outcome of 50-70% in\n      patients. However, long time usage of corticosteroids often cause severe side-effects.\n\n      Sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline posses known anti-inflammatory effects that are separate\n      from their antibacterial mode of action. This mode of action has lead to the routine use of\n      sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline for treating inflammatory or autoimmune diseases, such as\n      rosacea, periodontitis and multiple sclerosis. The mechanism is by inhibiting lymphocyte\n      proliferation and production of colony-stimulating factor, inflammatory cytokines, and\n      immunoglobulins, factors thought to play a role in the orbital autoimmune process.  These\n      mechanisms make them, in theory, an attractive option of doxycycline for treating Graves'\n      Orbitopathy. In addition, only few adverse events were reported when doxycycline were\n      administered for 3 months in patients with periodontitis or rosacea.\n\n      We propose to compare the effect and safety of sub-antimicrobial dose doxycycline versus\n      prednisone for treating non-sight threatening, moderate-severe, inflammatory GO."
