Previous studies reported near-infrared spectroscopy provides\n      information on the occurrence of cerebral desaturation resulted in POCD. But evidence of\n      POCD after general surgery has been lacking. Especially, the prone position is used\n      primarily for surgical access to the posterior spine, if there is any significant lowering\n      of the legs or tilt of the entire table, venous returns may be decrease or augmented\n      accordingly. The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between POCD and\n      intra-operative cerebral oxygen saturation after spine surgery in elderly patients."

After the induction, baseline prone rSO2 was defined over a 5min period after the change of position.\nThere is no intervention were made according to rSO2 values. Physiologic variables including BIS, PaCO2,PaO2, glucose, electrolyte, hematocrit, HR, MAP, and nasopharyngeal temperature were measured every 1 hours during the surgery.",
