Develop and evaluate novel methods for the treatment of genetic disorders including\n      metabolic manipulation, enzyme manipulation, enzyme replacement, enzyme transplantation, and\n      gene transfer techniques in these patients.\n\n      III.  Develop and evaluate methods for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders using\n      improved cytogenetic, biochemical, and nucleic acid techniques and amniotic fluid cells or\n      chorionic villi in these patients."

Patients undergo specialized laboratory\n      studies including plasma and leukocyte enzyme assays, quantitative urinary\n      mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides, urine and plasma glycolipids, plasma and urine\n      amino acids, urine organic acids, lymphoblastoid culture, DNA isolation from peripheral\n      leukocytes, skin biopsy for fibroblast culture (if indicated), and medical photography.\n      Patients also receive consultations with various specialties including ophthalmology, ENT,\n      cardiology, pulmonary, gastroenterology/nutrition, hematology, neurology, orthopedics,\n      rehabilitation medicine/physical therapy, and dermatology."
