This increased risk has been\n      attributed to a decreased ability to concentrate urine caused by sickling-induced\n      nephropathy. The sociodemographic, psychosocial, and medical factors associated with\n      nocturnal enuresis are not well defined.  In addition, the impact of these behaviors on\n      emotional and behavioral functioning, along with health-related quality of life are not\n      clear. Despite the availability of evidence-based interventions for nocturnal enuresis, very\n      few families with a child with sickle cell disease have utilized these methods. The reasons\n      for this underutilization of interventions are not clear."

Participants who report nocturnal enuresis will\n      identify interventions they have used in the past, along with barriers to intervention\n      implementation.\n\n      The future goal will be to use this information to develop an effective intervention\n      strategy for nocturnal enuresis specific to the needs of children and adolescents with\n      sickle cell disease."

Pearson's chi-square or Fisher's Exact test for categorical data and the two-sample t-test for continuous data will be performed to examine the group differences.
