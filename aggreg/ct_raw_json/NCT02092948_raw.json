How much of the PSCA Minibody needs to be used to see the prostate, pancreatic or\n           bladder cancer?\n\n        3. Does the PSCA Minibody see more/same/fewer lesions than are identified on traditional\n           scans such as bone scan or CT scan?\n\n      To answer these questions, we want to evaluate how [124 I] PSCA-Minibody is distributed\n      throughout the body in 20 patients with prostate, pancreatic or bladder cancer. This is done\n      with PET/CT imaging. A PET/CT scan is a non-invasive x-ray test that uses a special camera\n      to take pictures of the inside of your body. It can \"see\" the radiation given off by tiny\n      particles called positrons in the radioactive drug injected into you while also taking\n      pictures of the organs within the body. For this study the radioactive substance is [124 I]\n      PSCA-Minibody.\n\n      The scanning for this study is done with an imaging procedure in the department of Nuclear\n      Medicine during which the experimental drug [124 I] PSCA-Minibody will be administered by\n      intravenous (i.v.) infusion. An experimental drug is one that is not yet approved by the US\n      Food and Drug Administration (FDA). [124 I] PSCA-Minibody is a combination of a monoclonal\n      antibody, and I-124, a radioactive type of iodine. The iodine will make the antibody and the\n      cancer cells visible in a PET scan. PET stands for positron emission tomography and uses\n      radioactivity to image the inside of the body. A CT scan uses x-rays to look at the internal\n      organs in the body. This study will use a combination PET/CT to look at the cancer cells in\n      your body that have taken up the study agent as well as to see their location in your body."
