  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (OA) is commonly treated using laterally wedged insoles. Although these
      insoles typically reduce knee abduction moments (KAM) - a variable associated with knee
      osteoarthritis - and thus are believed to be beneficial for OA management, recent research
      has indicated that in some cases lateral wedge insoles actually increase knee joint loads.
      In such cases, a medial wedge may be more appropriate. In addition, recent research has
      begun to indicate that separate subtypes of osteoarthritis exist, and that these different
      subtypes may respond differently to a mechanical intervention such as a wedged insole. These
      subtypes include metabolic-OA (linked to obesity), post-traumatic OA (linked to knee
      injury), and genetic-OA (linked to family history).

      The purposes of this study are to (a) evaluate the influence of reduced KAMs loading on pain
      over 6-months for patients with knee OA, and (b) evaluate how patients from different OA
      subtypes respond to a mechanical treatment (i.e. wedged insole). It is hypothesized that
      pain reduction and function improvement will be directly related to KAM reduction.

      One-hundred and thirty participants with knee OA will be recruited to participate. Each will
      undergo biomechanical gait analysis to determine the wedge type that most greatly reduces
      knee adduction moments. In addition, each participant will undergo a Dual Energy X-Ray
      Absorptiometry (DXA) scan to quantify adiposity. Finally, participants will complete a
      series of questionnaires to evaluate pain, function, physical activity, diet and family and
      injury history. Participants will be randomized into either a control group (sham insole) or
      experimental group (wedged insole), and monitored for 6 months.

      Comparisons will be made between the control and experimental group to determine if reduced
      knee adduction moments contribute to reduced pain and improved function over 6 months. In
      addition, patients will be stratified based on OA subtype to determine if treatment response
      is dependent on OA subtype.

    <description>Wedged insoles are designed to reduce frontal plane knee joint mechanical loads during gait. Specifically, they can alter the knee adduction moment during gait - a variable associated with progression of knee osteoarthritis. In the experimental arm of this study, participants will undergo biomechanical gait analysis to identify the wedged insole that reduces the moments the most. The two options are medial wedge, where the medial aspect of the foot is elevated relative to the lateral aspect, and the lateral wedge, where the lateral wedge is elevated relative to the medial aspect.</description>
