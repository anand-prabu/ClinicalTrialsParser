It is anticipated that intake of antihistamine before\n      initiation of Grazax treatment would most likely reduce the discomfort associated with\n      initiation of Grazax treatment.

            "textblock": "Many grass pollen allergic subjects treated with immunotherapy tablets experience treatment\n      related adverse events when initiating treatment. The adverse events are considered\n      consistent with the introduction of allergens in sensitised subjects. The majority are local\n      allergic reactions within the mouth and/or throat. Most of these reactions are mild or\n      moderate in intensity, have an onset almost immediately after taking a tablet, and last from\n      minutes to hours after intake. Appearance of adverse events in relation to tablet intake\n      tends to subside spontaneously within 1 to 7 days. Thus, initiation of treatment with Grazax\n      may be associated with discomfort. It is anticipated that intake of antihistamine before\n      initiation of Grazax treatment would most likely reduce the discomfort associated with\n      initiation of Grazax treatment. Therefore, the rationale for this trial was to investigate\n      if administration of antihistamine prior to initiation of Grazax treatment results in a\n      reduction of subjects reporting local allergic reactions."
