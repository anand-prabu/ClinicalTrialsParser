    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators investigated changes in hemodynamic parameters and cerebral
      oxygen saturation (rSO2) associated with 10 cmH2O PEEP, which is assumed beneficial for the
      respiratory functions and oxygenation during the laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) applied
      at the 30°head-up left side position, is compared with using two individual devices
      (INVOS-FORESIGHT).

      Methods: Afterwards the ethics committee approval of the hospital and receiving the written
      patients' consents, patients to undergo ASA I-II group elective laparoscopic surgery were
      randomly divided into two groups. Sensors of INVOS and FORESIGHT devices were placed on the
      right side forehead region. Totally 11 evaluation periods were formed, respectively:
      Pre-induction (1st Period), post-induction (2nd period), abdominal insufflation outset (3rd
      period): post-insufflation 5-minute intervals (4th, 5th, 6th, 7th 8th period), end of
      insufflation (9th period), end of operation (10th period) and end of anaesthesia (11th
      period). While one of the groups was not applied PEEP(ZEEP), the other group was applied 10
      cmH2O simultaneously with the abdominal insufflation proceeding. Demographic data,
      hemodynamic values and rSO2 values were recorded for both groups at all 11 periods.
