This system does not\n      require blood to be drawn from the body, and it does not require a glucose sensor to be worn\n      under the skin (subcutaneously). This device instead estimates blood glucose levels by\n      shining infrared light on the skin and then using sophisticated statistical analysis on how\n      the light bounces back or gets absorbed (spectral data). The researchers in this study will\n      compare the accuracy of the new device to glucose measurement devices that are already\n      approved by the FDA, including glucose meters and subcutaneous continuous glucose monitoring\n      (CGM) sensors. Information learned from this study will be used in the development of tools\n      for managing diabetes."

The testing for each patient includes fingerstick and alternate site\n      capillary blood measurements taken nearly simultaneously with a series of near-infrared\n      spectra collected via a novel, proprietary fiber-optic probe. Simultaneously, subjects will\n      be wearing a commercial continuous glucose measuring system (Medtronic iPro 2). The spectral\n      data are converted to a prediction of tissue glucose using a proprietary pre-defined\n      universal algorithm.  Subjects are tested every 20 minutes for up to 12 hours per day and up\n      to 6 visits per patient over a period of up to 4 months."
