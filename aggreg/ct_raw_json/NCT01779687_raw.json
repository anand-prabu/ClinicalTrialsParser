Atorvastatin lowers plasma\n      low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels and is used for prevention of\n      artherosclerotic disease. Raltegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor, could be one of the\n      preferred antiretroviral agents in HIV patients with dyslipidemia because it has a\n      beneficial lipid profile.\n\n      Theoretically, no clinically relevant drug interaction is expected between atorvastatin and\n      raltegravir. However, atorvastatin and raltegravir share similar metabolic pathways which\n      could be relevant in the occurrence of pharmacokinetic interactions. In order to be able to\n      recommend raltegravir and atorvastatin concomitant use, a pharmacokinetic study in healthy\n      volunteers is proposed."
