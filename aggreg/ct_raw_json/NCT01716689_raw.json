Toxicity will be monitored throughout treatment.\n      The study's primary end point is defined as clinical benefit rate (CBR) at 12 weeks as a\n      measure of disease control. The study is designed to distinguish a favorable true PFR of 40%\n      from a null rate of 20% [Van Glabbeke et al. EJC 2002]. With a CBR of 40%, metronomic oral\n      cyclophosphamide at this dose and schedule in this patient population will be considered\n      worthy of further evaluation."

Participants must have histologically or cytologically confirmed, metastatic and/or\n             unresectable high grade sarcoma for which standard multi-modality curative therapies\n             do not exist or are no longer effective. Patients with low grade sarcoma need to\n             additionally demonstrate disease progression in the last 6 months prior to study\n             entry.\n\n          2. Age > 21 years\n\n          3. Prior anti-sarcoma chemotherapy\n\n               -  Participants who are 21 to 64 years of age at the time of study entry must have\n                  received at least one line of established chemotherapy, if such treatment\n                  exists; or refused such treatment, which includes either an anthracycline and/or\n                  ifosfamide. Patients whose sarcomas do not have known established therapy are\n                  eligible for this study without the requirement of a prior therapy.\n\n               -  Participants > 65 years of age at the time of study entry are eligible for this\n                  study without the requirement for prior treatment\n\n          4.

Patients diagnosed with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)\n\n          2.

Palliative radiotherapy or major surgery within 3 weeks of study entry\n\n          4. Concurrent use of any other anti-cancer therapies or study agents\n\n          5. Symptomatic or uncontrolled brain or central nervous system metastases\n\n          6. Participants may not be receiving any other concomitant investigational agents\n\n          7.

Individuals with a history of a different malignancy, other than cervical cancer in\n             situ, basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, are ineligible, except if\n             they have been disease-free for at least 5 years, and are deemed by the investigator\n             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy OR other primary malignancy is\n             neither currently clinically significant nor requiring active intervention."
