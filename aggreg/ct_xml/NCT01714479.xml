  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Warfighters often experience physical overload, as the uniform and associated gear that they
      carry burdens them with substantial loads.  The loads increase energy expenditure to levels
      that exceed a Warfighter's typical energy intake.  The typical assault load is approximately
      25 kg, although loads as high as 55 kg are often carried, which when combined with extreme
      energy expenditures can degrade health and performance, and increase the risk of injury.
      Branched-chain amino acid (leucine) supplementation may confer protection against the
      negative effects of operational stress by stimulating muscle protein synthesis and reducing
      degradation.  This study will determine if leucine-enriched nutrition supplementation
      confers protection against the negative consequences of sustained load carriage exercise,
      and explore the mechanisms by which leucine might impart protection.
