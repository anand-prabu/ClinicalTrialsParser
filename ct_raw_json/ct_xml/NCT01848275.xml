  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter-based renal sympathetic modification has been documented to be effective option for
      blood pressure control in patients with resistant hypertension, but the safety is still
      concerned around worldwide. Based on anatomic findings, blocking renal sympathetic nerves at
      proximity may be enough for successful renal sympathetic modifications. This study was
      designed to compare the efficacy and safety of full length versus proximal ablation of
      bilateral renal arteries.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After baseline assessment was completed, patients with resistant hypertension were enrolled,
      and randomly divided into two groups. This study is going to recruit 40 patients (group 1 VS
      group 2 = 1:1) with a follow-up duration of one year. Group 1 received ablation from distal
      to ostial of bilateral renal arteries, group 2 received ablation at proximal of bilateral
      renal arteries. RDN was performed with saline irrigated catheter. Office and ambulatory
      blood pressure was measured.
