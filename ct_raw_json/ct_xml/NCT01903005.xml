             are being delivered.

          4. Participants with any known allergy or sensitivity or intolerance to BUP, NAL or any
             related drug, or history of any drug hypersensitivity or intolerance which in the

          6. Participants who are at suicidal risk as determined by meeting any of the following:
             history of suicidal ideation ≤ 3 months prior to baseline with a score of 4 (intent
             to act) or 5 (specify plan and intent) on the C-SSRS; history of suicidal behavior
             (actual attempt, interrupted attempt, aborted attempt, and/or preparatory
