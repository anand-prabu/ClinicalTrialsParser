The investigators propose to conduct a clinical trial in 52\n      communities in Kongwa, Tanzania that on average have trachoma infection at 3.5%. The\n      investigators plan that all communities would have annual rounds of MDA if infection is\n      greater than 1% or follicular trachoma (TF) is 5% or more, but half would be randomized to a\n      surveillance and treatment program to identify and treat new families and families who\n      travel after mass treatment. Communities will have MDA stopped if infection is 1% or less,\n      or TF is less than 5%. MDA will be reinstated if infection re-emerges to 6% or more.  The\n      proportion of communities that are able to stop mass treatment will be compared in the group\n      of communities randomized to mass treatment plus the newcomer/traveler treatment program\n      compared to the communities randomized to mass treatment alone after 24 months."
