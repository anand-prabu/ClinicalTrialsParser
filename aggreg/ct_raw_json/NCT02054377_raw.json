Symptoms include coughing, poor lung\n      ventilation, recurrent infections, poor weight gain, diarrhoea, malnutrition, stress,\n      frustration, depression, irritability, worry, insomnia, behavioural issues and missed\n      school/work.\n\n      Tai chi, a Chinese form of exercise, uses slow choreographed movements, breathing exercises\n      and mindfulness. Research suggests tai chi can improve physical and emotional wellbeing for\n      various chronic conditions.\n\n      This study compares methods of teaching tai chi to 70 people with CF, and evaluates the\n      effect on symptoms and quality of life. Adults and children with CF will be recruited and\n      randomly allocated to an intervention group or a control group. The former will receive 8\n      individual face to face sessions of tai chi over a 3 month period and a video and handouts\n      to aid home practice. The latter will have routine care for the first 12 weeks, followed by\n      8 individual online sessions of tai chi over a 3 month period, and a video and handouts for\n      home practice.\n\n      Both groups will be encouraged to practice tai chi at home in the months following the\n      taught sessions.\n\n      Questionnaire data on how participants and their carers are coping with CF,  any general\n      improvements in wellbeing, and differences in other clinical outcomes (medication etc.)will\n      be collected.  Data will be collected at the beginning and end of the intervention, and at 6\n      and 9 months post intervention and differences between the 2 groups compared over time.\n\n      Feedback from on line focus groups will ask about their experiences, feasibility of learning\n      and practicing of tai chi, engagement with the process, perceived health impact, and\n      experiences of participation.\n\n      It is hoped that the study may show how Tai Chi can help people with CF to maintain their\n      health through mindful exercise, and improve troublesome symptoms like sleep and anxiety."
