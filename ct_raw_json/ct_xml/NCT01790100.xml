  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of orally
      administered VX-135 with ribavirin in treatment naive subjects with chronic hepatitis C
      infection.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to twenty (20) subjects with CHC GT1 infection will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio (with
      stratification by IL-28B genotype (CC versus non-CC)) to evaluate VX-135 low dose or high
      dose both given in combination with RBV for 12 weeks.

      Safety and tolerability will be evaluated on an ongoing basis through assessment of adverse
      events (AEs), lab evaluations and physical examinations.  Subjects will be monitored from
      Day 1 through end of follow-up for virologic breakthrough or relapse.
