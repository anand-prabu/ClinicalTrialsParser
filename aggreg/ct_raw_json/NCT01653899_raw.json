Two pilot studies are proposed to establish the\n      optimal safety and efficacy dose of IDN-6556 (25 mg or 100 mg twice daily). Participants of\n      both pilot studies will receive islet cell transplants under the University of Alberta's\n      standard-of-care therapy.\n\n      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of the IDN-6556 caspase\n      inhibitor in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant.\n\n      Secondary objectives include:\n\n        1. To determine the proportion of subjects treated with IDN-6556 who achieve and maintain\n           insulin independence after the first or subsequent islet transplant.\n\n        2. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of IDN-6556 to maintain adequate\n           immunological protection against both allo- and autoimmunity of islet transplant\n           recipients."

An initial LFT panel with any values  > 1.5\n             times the upper limit of normal (ULN) will exclude a patient without a re-test; a re\n             test for any values between ULN and 1.5 times ULN should be made, and if the values\n             remain elevated above normal limits, the patient will be excluded.\n\n         14.
