By the invented and adopted energy surgical instruments, surgical\n      procedure is safer and easier than before. The newly surgical instruments reduce the\n      post-operative mortality and morbidity combined easy procedures of surgery. As the most\n      popular instruments used in the gastric surgery, ultrasonic scalpel and monopolar\n      electrocautery were received lots of attention and concern. Some studies have shown some\n      advantage of the two instruments, which were they can facilitate the surgical treatment and\n      make the surgery safer and more effective. Although, some small retrospective sample reports\n      claimed that ultrasonic scalpel brought benefit in blood loss, dissection lymph-node\n      intraoperative complications and even postoperative complications. And Korea small sample\n      randomized controlled trail presentation that ultrasonic scalpel can reduced blood loss and\n      surgical duration. However, postoperative complications were with no statistical\n      significance between the two instruments. Cost- effective analysis of the energy instruments\n      is still controversial. Large sample randomized control trail with high quality is needed.\n\n      By the reasons above, a multicenter randomized controlled trial conducted by 9 hospitals\n      from North to South in China aims to compare the clinical characteristics and outcomes, when\n      using of the ultrasonic scalpel or monopolar electrocautery in traditional open gastrectomy.\n      The aim of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of ultrasonic scalpel compared with\n      monopolar electrocautery in D2 distal gastrectomy or D2 total gastrectomy, include,\n      intraoperative parameters, postoperative complications, cost data, and post-operative\n      quality of life."

The information of the postoperative\n           quality of life is collected by the EuroQol-5 Dimensions (EQ-5D) questionnaire in four\n           postoperative time intervals.
