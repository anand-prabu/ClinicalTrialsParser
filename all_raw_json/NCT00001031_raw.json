AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: To\n      determine the ability of immunization with MN rgp120/HIV-1 in combination with alum or SF-2\n      rgp120 in combination with MF59 to induce an HIV-1 envelope-specific delayed-type\n      hypersensitivity (DTH) response in volunteers  who receive rsgp120/MN skin testing.\n\n      The amino acid sequence of HIV-1 gp120 can vary as much as 40 percent from isolate to\n      isolate. Thus, the identification of an immunogen that can elicit broadly neutralizing\n      antibodies to HIV-1 is a major challenge in AIDS vaccine development. Two candidate\n      vaccines, recombinant envelope subunit proteins from the SF-2 and MN isolates of HIV-1, have\n      shown immunogenicity and good tolerance in healthy immunocompetent adults. This study will\n      expand testing into a larger population base, particularly targeting individuals at high\n      risk for HIV infection."

This study will\n      expand testing into a larger population base, particularly targeting individuals at high\n      risk for HIV infection.\n\n      HIV-seronegative volunteers (including four populations at higher risk for HIV infection and\n      two populations at lower risk) receive one of four regimens.  Two treatment groups receive\n      50 mcg SF-2 rgp 120 (BIOCINE) in MF59 adjuvant or 600 mcg MN rgp120 (Genentech) in alum. Two\n      control groups receive vehicle (placebo) in MF59 adjuvant alone or alum adjuvant alone.\n      Immunizations are given at months 0, 1, and 6. AS PER AMENDMENT 10/93: patients enrolled by\n      June 15, 1993, receive a fourth immunization at month 12 or 18 (50 percent of patients for\n      each schedule). Patients are followed until 2 years after the first injection. AS PER\n      AMENDMENT 05/10/94: a special study of vaccine acceptability and HIV-related risk behavior\n      will be conducted at some time between months 12 and 18. AS PER AMENDMENT 07/02/97: a\n      special DTH study will be conducted in consenting volunteers who have received three or four\n      immunizations. The injections will be given at the end of the study (on or after day 1, &\n      56). Followup is extended to 56 days after administration of the intradermal injection."
