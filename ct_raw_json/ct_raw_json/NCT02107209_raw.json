The mechanism of action involves resorption atelectasis\n      from airway occlusion, subsequent airspace inflammation, and then remodeling. This\n      remodeling will lead to scarring that induces contraction of lung parenchyma and functional\n      volume reduction can be expected within 6-8 weeks. Biological lung volume reduction occurs\n      independent of the presence or absence of collateral ventilation."
