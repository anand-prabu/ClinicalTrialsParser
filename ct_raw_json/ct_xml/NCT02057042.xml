    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized clinical trial of Peer-Supported cCBT versus
      enhanced usual care (EUC) for 330 patients with new episodes of depression in primary care
      at three VA sites and their associated CBOCs.

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Functional status will be measured using the Veterans RAND 36-Item Health Survey (VR-36), formerly called the Short-Form 36 for Veterans.  This is a measure of functional status adapted from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 for use among Veterans. The measure assesses physical functioning (PF), role limitations due to physical problems (RP), bodily pain (BP), general health perceptions (GH), energy/vitality (V), social functioning (SF), role limitations due to emotional problems (RE), and mental health (MH). The VR-36 has somewhat greater precision at the lower end of the health status continuum than the SF-36.  The VR-36 has been used in numerous prior VA focused studies.</description>

    <measure>depression symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Depressive symptoms will be measured with the BDI-II at baseline, 3 months post intervention and 6 months post intervention. The BDI-II is a 21-item self-report instrument for measuring the severity of depression among individuals aged 13 years and older. Each item is rated on a four-point scale (0-3), and aggregate scores range from 0 to 63.  The BDI has been widely used and shows acceptable reliability, with Cronbach's  's in the range of 0.81-0.86.</description>

    <measure>recovery orientation</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Recovery orientation will be measured using the Recovery Assessment Scale - Short Form (RAS-SF).  This 20-item scale is a shorter version of the RAS and has four factors: personal confidence and hope, willingness to ask for help, reliance on others, and no domination by symptoms. The RAS-SF shows evidence for both convergent and discriminate validity when compared to quality of life, social support, and symptomatic scales.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF) is a valid proxy for the longer Q-LES form and will be used to assess quality of life. It consists of 14 items that patients rate on a 5-point scale to indicate their satisfaction with a variety of life domains, including physical health, mood, work, household activities, social relationships, etc. The Q-LES-Q-SF has been shown to have high levels of reliability and has been used in numerous studies of depression, including the NIMH funded STAR*D study.</description>

    <measure>depression coping</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Depression coping will be assessed with the Depression Coping Self-Efficacy Scale (DCSES). The DCSES is a 24-item, self-report rating scale used to assess the coping self-efficacy of psychiatric patients with depression.  Items include depression management tasks and techniques related to activity level, tension, interpersonal behavior, problem-solving, thought reformulation, and sleep patterns.  Individuals respond to each item using a probability scale, in which they numerically rate their confidence in their abilities to perform each task.   This measure has demonstrated to have good reliability, with a Cronbach's   of .93, and subsequent studies have provided support for the construct, concurrent, and discriminant validities of the DCSES.</description>

    <measure>antidepressant adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>We will construct medication possession ratios for antidepressants prescribed for the 3 months following enrollment and for 3-6 months following enrollment. In addition to pharmacy data, The Brief Medication Questionnaire will also be used to assess adherence and may be particularly helpful if patients receive some antidepressant medication fills outside of the VA.  It has been validated using MEMS caps and found to be 80-100% sensitive for repeat non-adherence and 90% sensitive for sporadic non-adherence.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive Behavioral Therapy Skills</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>CBT skills will be assessed using the Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy Skills Questionnaire (CBTSQ).  The CBTSQ is a 16-item scale consisting of two factors, Behavioral Activation and Cognitive Restructuring. The scale shows construct validity, appears sensitive to change among patients undergoing CBT treatment, and predicts reduction in depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>initiation and completion of traditional psychotherapy</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Receipt of VA and non-VA Traditional In-Person Psychotherapy: We will review enrolled patients' VA medical record notes to determine their receipt of any traditional in-person psychotherapy and their completion of 8 in-person psychotherapy visits within 3 and 6 months following enrollment. We will also assess whether the Veteran received psychotherapy that was depression focused and evidence-based, assessing the presence of key phrases in notes that denote CBT, ACT, or IPT treatment. We will also determine non-VA psychotherapy use, using the Cornell Services Index, as patients may have started non-VA psychotherapy after enrollment.  Finally, we will construct variables that indicate if the Veteran received any in-person psychotherapy (y/n), completed an adequate trial of any psychotherapy (y/n), received any evidence-based VA psychotherapy (y/n), and completed a trial of evidence-based VA psychotherapy (y/n).</description>

    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Generalized Anxiety will be measured with the GAD-7.  Total score ranges from 0 to 21, with &quot;cut scores&quot; for mild, moderate and severe anxiety.  Although originally developed for generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, the GAD-7 has good operating characteristics for detection and severity ratings of panic disorder and social anxiety disorder.</description>

    <measure>Suicidal Ideation</measure>
    <time_frame>change over time  (baseline, 3 months, 6 months)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Suicidal Ideation will be measured with the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS).  The BSS is designed to measure the intensity, pervasiveness, and characteristics of suicide ideation. The BSS has five screening items to decrease the length and the intrusiveness of the questionnaire for non-suicidal patients. If patients have a positive screen, they go on to answer the remaining 14 items, for a total of 21 items.  The 21 items are scored on a 3-point Likert scale from 0= not present to 2= maximum severity of suicidal ideation.   The score is calculated by summing the ratings for the first 19 items, with scores ranging from 0-38.  The scale has good internal consistency with a Cronbach's alpha ranging between 0.87-0.97.  The scale also shows evidence of construct and discriminant validity.</description>
