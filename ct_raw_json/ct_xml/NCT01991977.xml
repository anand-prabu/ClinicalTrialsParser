  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to use a nutrient called 18F-FDOPA and PET/CT scan to help
      determine where and how big the tumor is, as well as how aggressive the tumor is. This will
      help treating physicians to target diseased areas with higher than standard doses of
      radiation, in order to improve the effectiveness of radiation in this tumor.

    <description>There will be a scan of the brain to determine where to focus the radiation treatment, the 18F-DOPA PET/CT, standard and advanced MRI Imaging will occur about 2 weeks prior to radiation therapy. After radiation therapy (3 - 6 weeks post therapy) another 18F-DOPA PET/CT standard and advanced MRI Imaging will occur. Then the 18F-DOPA PET/CT standard and advanced MRI Imaging will occur as clinically indicated until progression or 5 years have passed since radiation therapy occurred.</description>
