For patients with scores above the threshold for SRS or QA validation of a\n      possible diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders will be performed with commonly used\n      diagnostic tools (ADIR (Lord et al, 1994), ADOS-G (Lord et al, 1999) and diagnostic criteria\n      of DSM IV-TR).\n\n      Secondary criteria will include the results of standardized tests to assess autistic\n      features (AQ, ADI-R, ADOS, DSM IV-TR criteria), intellectual efficiency (Wechsler scales),\n      psychiatric comorbidities (Kiddie-SADS) and sociocognitive profile (SpeX test, Social\n      cognition, Perception, eXecutive functions).\n\n      A DNA sample will be collected from the patient and her mother. The observation period is 2\n      days for the patient and about 1 hour for the mother. The total duration of the study is 3\n      years."
