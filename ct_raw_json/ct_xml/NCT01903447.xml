  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Internalizing psychopathologies (IPs) involving depression and anxiety are among the most
      prevalent, costly and disabling illnesses. Treatments for IPs are available but the extent
      to which individual patients respond is quite heterogeneous. Little information exists,
      particularly in the biological domain, which helps to explain individual differences in
      treatment response. IPs share similar patterns of dysfunction within the Fronto-Limbic
      Affect Regulation and Emotional Salience (FLARES) brain circuit, and two commonly used,
      'gold standard' treatments - selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and cognitive
      behavioral therapies (CBTs) - are equally effective for both anxiety and depressive
      disorders, and appear to change brain activity in the same areas within the FLARES circuit.
      The overarching goal of the project is delineate what are common versus specific FLARE brain
      targets for SSRI and CBT and identify specific aspects of FLARE dysfunction that might
      better predict response to both and to a specific modality of treatment. This experiment
      integrates emotion and its interaction with cognition across several stages of emotional
      experience, encompassing studies that probe sensitivity to acute and potential threat and
      automatic and volitional forms of affect regulation in relation to the FLARES brain network.

      We will enroll 200 patients presenting to our Mood and Anxiety Disorders Program seeking
      treatment for disabling 'anxiety, worry, depressed mood' (IPs, including those characterized
      as Not Otherwise Specified) and randomize them to a 12-week course of SSRI or CBT.
      Dimensional, transdiagnostic negative valence systems (NVS) constructs, including FLARES
      function, will be measured before and after each treatment. Specifically, the project will
      examine 2 Specific Aims: 1) Where and how do SSRI and CBT treatments exert their effects on
      NVS constructs?; and 2) Which NVS construct can predict the likelihood of success from SSRI
      and CBT treatment? Such findings can be used to guide the right patients to the right
      treatments with the highest likelihood of success. They also elucidate a
      pathophysiologically-driven mechanistic model of where and how treatments work in the brain
      and thus hasten the development of new treatments that target the underlying pathophysiology
      across internalizing conditions.
