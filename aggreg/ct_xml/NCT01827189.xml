      Participating practices all have electronic health records, submitted applications to
      participate in this demonstration program designed to improve primary care practices, and
      were selected as the most advanced of the applicants in terms of use of health information
      technology and certification as a medical home or possessing features similar to those of a
      medical home. Participating practices will receive monthly payments from Centers for
      Medicare &amp; Medicaid (CMS) for Medicare patients attributed to the practice, and from other
      payers in the market taht are participating in the initiative. The demonstration began in
      October 2012 and will continue for 4 years. This early paper focuses on describing these
      practices at the outset of the demonstration.
