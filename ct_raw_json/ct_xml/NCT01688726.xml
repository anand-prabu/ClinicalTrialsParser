  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Bulbar conjunctival staining</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The conjunctival staining present in the bulbar area will be evaluated 120 minutes post eyedrop instillation using a slit lamp with digital image capture and lissamine green strips.  The extent of true staining (the number of puncti and their individual size and the total area of coverage) will be measured and compared to the total area.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>High contrast logMAR time controlled visual acuity (TCVA)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This visual acuity test will be carried out prior to eyedrop instillation and at 60, 90, and 120 minutes post eyedrop instillation with the subject's up-to-date vision correction in place.  For each acuity level, 20 single optotypes will be presented at 4 meters under high illumination, and the percentage of correctly identified will constitute the score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Non invasive tear film break-up-time (NIBUT)</measure>
    <time_frame>One month</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This assessment will be carried out prior to eyedrop instillation and at 60, 90, and 120 minutes post eyedrop instillation.  The time elapsed between eye opening after a blink and the appearance of the first dark spot within the tear film, as observed with a specialized illumination source, will be recorded.</description>
