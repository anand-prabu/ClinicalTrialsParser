            "textblock": "Patients with beta-thalassemia (Cooley's Anemia) continue to suffer from the\n      transfusion-induced iron overload due to the inadequacies of current iron-chelation therapy.\n      Compliance with the use of the only FDA-approved drug for removing excess iron from patients\n      (Desferal) continues to be a major problem despite convincing evidence that it markedly\n      reduces morbidity and prolongs life. The full potential of iron-chelation therapy will not\n      be realized until an orally-effective drug is available. This small trial is testing the\n      premise that a combination of drugs as a new approach to iron chelation therapy may reduce\n      side effects and increase efficacy. If both drugs can be given orally, there may be a better\n      chance of finding a suitable alternative to Desferal.  Several combinations of experimental\n      iron chelating drugs are being used in this trial."
