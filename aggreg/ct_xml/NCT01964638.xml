  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center trial to examine the rates of cancer diagnosis when
      using computerized software to target suspicious lesions within the prostate identified on
      mpMRI.  The primary evaluation involves comparing the rate of cancer diagnosis when using
      software-based MRI-Ultrasound image fusion guided biopsy  to sample mpMRI findings to the
      use of visual guided biopsy (cognitive or mental targeting) of the same target.  The
      hypothesis being tested is that fusion guided biopsy will increase detection prostate cancer
      within mpMRI findings as compared to visual guided biopsy of these areas

    <description>Men being evaluated for prostate cancer based upon standard of care clinical parameters (e.g. elevated PSA levels, abnormal DRE, mpMRI) will be considered for enrollment.  Men who have undergone prostate mpMRI that has revealed an area(s) of suspicion for prostate cancer are eligible for enrollment.  All men enrolled in the study undergo fusion targeted biopsy, visual estimation biopsy, and systematic biopsy.  As a result the study includes a single arm with direct comparison of biopsy techniques.</description>
