Catheter Related Blood Stream Infections(CRBSI) is a frequent\n      complication leading to increased morbidity, hospital admissions, cost, and risk of repeated\n      replacement of their tunneled catheter. The infections often originate from contamination of\n      the catheter hub, and growth of microorganisms on the inner lumen of the catheter imbedded\n      in a biofilm. To prevent infections good hygiene guidelines and the use of a catheter lock\n      solution is applied.\n\n      The primary objective is to compare two catheter lock solutions, TaurolockTMHep100 and\n      Heparin 100 IE/ml, on the occurence of CRBSI. The secondary objectives are to compare the\n      two devices according to other efficacy parameters, time to infection, cost and resource\n      utility, tolerability and safety.\n\n      Patients with a prior high risk of CRBSI will be included. Patients will instill the\n      solution in their CVAD after each infusion of HPN, varying between minimum twice per week to\n      once daily, depending on their individual HPN programme.\n\n      Before the blinded randomization the patients will be paired according to gender, age and\n      prior infection risk.\n\n      Duration of the instillation will be 12 month or until outcome(CRBSI) accure."
