      The Investigational device is a dual wavelength laser system developed for treatment of
      pigmented lesions and for tattoo removal. The base unit is a GentleMax system modified to
      emit light at wavelengths of 532 and 1064 nm and deliver pulse energy up to 400mJ, and pulse
      duration of 700 ps.
