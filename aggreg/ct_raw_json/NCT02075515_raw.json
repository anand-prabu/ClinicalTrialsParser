Inhaled, topical and intra-articular corticosteroids are allowed.\n\n          -  Administration or planned administration of a live vaccine in the period starting 30\n             days before the first dose of study vaccine and ending 30 days after the last dose of\n             study vaccine, or, administration or planned administration of a non-replicating\n             vaccine within 8 days prior to or within 14 days after either dose of study vaccine.\n\n          -  Administration of long-acting immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the\n             first vaccine dose or expected administration at any time during the study period.\n\n          -  Concurrently participating in another clinical study, at any time during the study\n             period, in which the subject has been or will be exposed to an investigational or a\n             non-investigational product.\n\n          -  Previous vaccination against HZ or varicella.\n\n          -  Planned administration during the study of an HZ or varicella vaccine other than the\n             study vaccine.\n\n          -  History of HZ.\n\n          -  Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition resulting\n             from disease or immunosuppressive/cytotoxic therapy.\n\n          -  History of any reaction or hypersensitivity likely to be exacerbated by any component\n             of the vaccine.\n\n          -  Acute disease and/or fever at the time of enrollment.\n\n               -  Fever is defined as temperature \u2265 37.5\u00b0C (99.5\u00b0F) on oral, axillary or tympanic\n                  route, or \u2265 38.0\u00b0C (100.4\u00b0F) on rectal route. The preferred route for recording\n                  temperature in this study will be oral.\n\n               -  Subjects with a minor illness  without fever may be enrolled at the discretion\n                  of the investigator.\n\n          -  Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within 3 months preceding\n             the first dose of study vaccine or planned administration during the study period.\n\n          -  Pregnant or lactating females.\n\n          -  Females planning to become pregnant or planning to discontinue contraceptive\n             precautions (if of childbearing potential) before Month 4.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the opinion of the investigator, prevents the subject from\n             participating in the study.\n\n          -  Any other condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, might interfere with\n             the evaluations required by the study.\n\n          -  Any condition which, in the judgment of the investigator would make intramuscular\n             injection unsafe."
