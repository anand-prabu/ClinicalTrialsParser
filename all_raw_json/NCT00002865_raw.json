Determine the complete response rate to high-intensity, brief-duration\n      chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, vincristine, doxorubicin, and\n      dexamethasone followed by ifosfamide, methotrexate, vincristine, cytarabine, etoposide, and\n      dexamethasone in patients with relapsed or refractory acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). II.\n      Determine the toxic effects of these regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: All patients receive up to six alternating courses (every 3-4 weeks) of two\n      chemotherapy regimens: cyclophosphamide, oral dexamethasone, methotrexate with leucovorin\n      rescue, vincristine, and doxorubicin over 5 days; and ifosfamide/mesna, oral dexamethasone,\n      methotrexate with leucovorin rescue, vincristine, cytarabine, and etoposide over 5 days.\n      G-CSF is given following each course until recovery of the neutrophil count. All patients\n      receive triple intrathecal chemotherapy on day 1. Patients with CNS disease receive\n      intrathecal therapy twice weekly until the CSF is clear, then weekly for 4 weeks, and\n      monthly for 1 year; those who have not received prior CNS irradiation also receive\n      whole-brain radiotherapy. Patients are followed monthly for 6 months, every 3 months for 18\n      months, every 6 months for 2 years, then annually.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 37 evaluable patients will be accrued if at least 4 of the\n      first 17 patients respond."
