Determine the toxicity profile of\n      this drug in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic\n      relationships of this drug in these patients. IV. Determine the duration of response, time\n      to disease progression, 6-month progression-free survival, time to treatment failure, and\n      overall survival of patients treated with this drug. V. Assess the quality of life of these\n      patients treated with this drug.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients receive ecteinascidin 743 IV over 3 hours on\n      day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for at least 6 courses in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with a complete response (CR) receive 2\n      additional courses after achieving CR. Quality of life is assessed at baseline and at the\n      beginning of each course of therapy. Patients are followed every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-36 patients will be accrued for this study within 12-24\n      months."
