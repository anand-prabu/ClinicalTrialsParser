  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have examined the usefulness of pulse oximetry or oxygen saturation to
      screen for left-sided cardiac lesions.  These studies have shown that the occurrence of
      critical congenital cardiac malformations among asymptomatic newborns is high; the technique
      of pulse oximetry is reliable for detection of ductal dependant left-sided lesions, simple
      to operate(requires little time and can be done in the newborn nursery) and is cost
      effective; there is effective follow-up test (heart ultrasound) and available interventions
      have an effect on outcome for diagnosed newborns.  The importance of this research project
      is to examine the overall helpfulness of measuring oximetry in newborn infants using somatic
      oximetry, as well ast to prepare for a population based study in the state of Florida.

      This study will evaluate up to 50 unaffected newborns and up to 10 known congenital heart
      disease (CHD) newborns using a new oximetry system. This system is interfaced to a laptop
      computer which computes the difference between central and lower extremity peripheral
      values, upper and lower body peripheral values, and records all data. This information may
      differentiate unaffected newborns and CHD newborns, and determine the effectiveness of pulse
      oximetry as a newborn screening for congenital cardiovascular malformations.
