            "textblock": "It is now well documented that platelets play an important role in the pathogenesis of acute\n      coronary syndromes. This phenomenon has significantly strengthened the position of\n      antiplatelet drugs in treatment, and prevention of these syndromes. In terms of\n      administration, antiplatelet drugs are divided into two categories, the oral and intravenous\n      medications. Of these, oral medications are the choice for long-term or prophylactic\n      treatment of patients with acute coronary syndrome. Among them, is clopidogrel, which\n      together with aspirin is now the cornerstone of antiplatelet therapy. Indeed, clopidogrel is\n      a widely used antiplatelet drug. It is second in sales worldwide after atorvastatin and has\n      been prescribed to more than 100 million patients worldwide. Can be used as monotherapy or\n      in combination with aspirin. The efficacy in reducing ischemic events in patients with ACS\n      has been shown in more than 15 major clinical studies involving more than 200,000 patients.\n      These studies also proved the safety of clopidogrel to the bleeding complications (only 1-2%\n      per year).Clopidogrel is a second generation thienopyridine that inhibits the binding of ADP\n      to purinergic receptors of platelet membrane. The ADP activates platelets through different\n      receptors coupled to G-proteins. The main receptor for platelet activation by ADP is P2Y12,\n      associated with the adenyl cyclase and cause deactivation of the resulting reduction in the\n      levels of c-AMP. The identification of this receptor led to the complete elucidation of the\n      mechanism of action of clopidogrel, which proved to be an irreversible antagonist P2Y12.\n\n      Clopidogrel is a prodrug that, once granted, is absorbed in the intestine by a process in\n      which an important role is played by the protein carrier ABCB1/MDR1. Then clopidogrel is\n      converted in the liver to the pharmacologically active metabolite by the action of\n      cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and mainly isoform CYP2C19 and isoforms CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP1A2,\n      CYP2B6 and CYP2C9. It should be noted that 85% of clopidogrel absorbed, hydrolyzed by\n      esterases in the intestinal mucosa and blood to form biologically inactive products while\n      only 15% of the administered drug is converted to its active metabolite, which is a potent,\n      irreversible, selective inhibitor of receptor P2Y12 ADP. The inhibition of binding of ADP\n      receptor P2Y12 of the active metabolite of clopidogrel have the effect of increasing the\n      levels of cyclic AMP (c-AMP) in the cytoplasm of platelets, which inter alia induces\n      phosphorylation phosphoprotein VASP (vasodilator stimulated phosphoprotein ), resulting in\n      the inhibition of the activation of receptor GPIIb / IIIa and thereby preventing platelet\n      aggregation. The end result of the administration of clopidogrel (inhibition of platelet\n      stimulation by ADP) is affected by multiple levels of interactions. The absorption\n      (intestinal mucosa) and the metabolism of clopidogrel (esterases and cytochrome isoforms) is\n      a sequence of steps that determine the final amount of active metabolite produced. Also\n      close correlation between the concentration of the active metabolite and the speed and the\n      degree of inhibition of platelet activation. Finally factors affecting the affinity of\n      clopidogrel with ADP receptor on the membrane of platelets can modify the action.The\n      importance of these stages that determine the rate and quantity production of the active\n      metabolite, acquires particular relevance today as clopidogrel generic forms are available\n      in the market. Indeed, in 2010 and after 10 years of circulation of the original formulation\n      (clopidogrel bisulfate) under the trade names Plavix or Iscover, released new generic\n      formulations of clopidogrel (generic) due to expiration of the period of exclusive marketing\n      using the original formulation. Main difference of generic forms of clopidogrel to the\n      original formulation (clopidogrel bisulfate) is pharmacochemical recommendation salt of\n      clopidogrel, which in the case of generic formulations is benzenesulfonic (besylate) or\n      hydrochloride salt. Generic formulations of clopidogrel have received marketing approval\n      from the health authorities of the European Union. Studies in healthy volunteers have\n      demonstrated the bioequivalence of generic salt of clopidogrel (clopidogrel besylate) in the\n      original clopidogrel bisulfate. However, there is lack of pharmacokinetic and\n      pharmacodynamic data on the bioequivalence of different salts of clopidogrel to the original\n      salt in patients with a history of ACS or in patients undergoing angioplasty. The lack of\n      data regarding the full therapeutic equivalence of generic forms of clopidogrel and original\n      form of ACS in patients as well as in patients undergoing angioplasty, cardiac led national\n      companies to initially propose the use of generic drugs only in secondary prevention of\n      atherothrombosis after acute myocardial infarction, stroke, or established peripheral\n      arterial disease. A similar approach has been adopted by the Greek Medicines Agency as well\n      as the European authorities. Recently, studies have shown that clopidogrel besylate\n      formulations exhibit similar antiplatelet activity to that of the original salt, both in\n      patients with a history of ACS and in patients with ACS who underwent angioplasty. Recently,\n      clopidogrel besylate formulations got approval for use in patients with ACS and in patients\n      undergoing angioplasty. Given the plurality Proprietary clopidogrel besylate is currently\n      commercially available, they should any clinical data or research results arising from the\n      use of such preparations in patients with cardiovascular disease can refer to this product\n      which has not generally used in the salt besylate clopidogrel."
