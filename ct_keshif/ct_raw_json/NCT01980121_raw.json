            "textblock": "Food residue in the stomach of patients scheduled to have surgery is considered a major risk\n      factor for pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. The resulting respiratory compromise\n      after aspiration is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The risk of\n      pulmonary aspiration is especially important in pregnant women, as they may often require\n      surgery without having observed appropriate fasting. In pregnant patients scheduled for\n      elective surgery, standard preoperative guidelines apply as the general non-pregnant\n      surgical population (8-hour fasting of solid food and 2-hour fasting of clear fluids). A\n      bedside ultrasound assessment of the status of the gastric content and volume would be of\n      great value for the clinician. This technique has recently been shown very promising in\n      fasted non-pregnant patients scheduled for elective surgery. Therefore, it is important to\n      study its feasibility in the pregnant population scheduled for elective Cesarean Delivery.\n\n      We hypothesize that no residual solid contents will be found in the gastric sonography, and\n      a small volume of gastric fluid will be observed in the antrum in both supine and right\n      lateral decubitus."
