The\n      specific objective is to establish an auto-calibration algorithm that conveniently yields\n      cardiac output (CO) in units of liters-per-minute. To achieve this objective, the waveforms\n      for analysis and reference pulmonary artery catheter CO measurements will be recorded from\n      critically ill patients and then analyzed off-line at Retia Medical.  Successful completion\n      of this study may ultimately help lead to improved outcomes of critically ill patients."
