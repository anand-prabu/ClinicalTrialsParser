A reproducible marker would be helpful to adapt the\n      therapeutics and maybe limit their deleterious effects.\n\n      The investigators made the hypothesis that patients moderate to severe ARDS (comparable\n      PaO2/FiO2 ratio) with a higher strain may have higher inflammation.\n\n      Moderate/severe ARDS will be ventilate with protective ventilation (low tidal volume and\n      PEEP set to limit plateau pressure under 30cmH2O). Markers of inflammation will be measured\n      in the broncho Alveolar Lavage the first day and in the blood the following days. Strain\n      will be measured at the bedside using the nitrogen washout-washin. Markers of inflammation\n      and strain will be analysed with ventilatory and oxygenation."
