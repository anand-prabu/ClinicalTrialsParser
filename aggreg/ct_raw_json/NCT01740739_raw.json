The ClearView\n      device is a bio-electrographic tool that may assist medical professionals in rapid\n      assessment of the systemic origin of the patient's presenting symptom(s). The ClearView is a\n      potentially valuable resource that may benefit a physician's office by offering expedited\n      differentiation capabilities.  The subsequent results have the potential to include more\n      data that would allow rapid patient diagnosis, triage, and treatment; optimized precious\n      resource expenditure (nursing, physician, etc.); lower costs to facility, patient and\n      insurance company; and decreased office wait time."
