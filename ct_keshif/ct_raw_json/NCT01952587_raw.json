            "textblock": "Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are key actors of innate immunity that produce high\n      levels of interferon (IFN)-alpha after activation of their Toll-Like Receptors (TLR) by\n      pathogens. A difference between men and women has recently been shown in the level of\n      IFN-alpha produced by pDCs after TLR activation. The production of IFN-alpha in response to\n      TLR7 activation is higher in the presence of estrogens. This could be responsible for gender\n      differences in the level of plasma HIV-1 RNA, that is lower in female as compared to male by\n      about 50%, and for the sex-based differences in the susceptibility to HIV infection. Besides\n      the role of estrogens, X-linked genetic factors could also be involved in the sex-dependent\n      differences in the TLR7-mediated responses of pDCs. TLR7 gene is located on the X\n      chromosome. A single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) of the TLR7 gene, c.32A>T, have been\n      associated with accelerated disease progression in male HIV patients, and was found over\n      represented in female HIV as well as HCV patients, suggesting that the T allele is\n      associated with a gender-dependent increase of susceptibility to RNA virus infections. A\n      peripheral blood sample will be collected from HIV-infected women and healthy control to\n      measure TLR-7 SNP frequency by PCR. IFN-alpha production from pDCs after HIV-1 RNA sensing\n      by TLR7 will also be assessed."
