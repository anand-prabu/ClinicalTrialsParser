Many of the materials used as bone graft substitutes\n      suffer from disadvantages such as soft tissue invasion of the fracture area, inadequate\n      blood supply, failure to encourage the production of bone and ectopic bone formation.\n\n      A guided bone regeneration (GBR) environment may help in solving these clinical concerns.\n      GBR has been widely used in the field of dentistry since the 1980s to provide stable\n      placement for dental implants\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety, performance and initial efficacy of\n      Regenecure's, AMCA Bone Membrane, as a bone stimulating aid for orthopedic trauma\n      applications."
