            "textblock": "Recent studies suggest that older stored blood is associated with worse outcomes in certain\n      hospitalized patients. Red cells may be stored in a refrigerator prior to transfusion for up\n      to 42 days by current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Refrigerator storage of\n      red cells is associated with a storage lesion and the survival of transfused red cells\n      decreases with increasing storage time, thus older blood is associated with an increased\n      delivery of hemoglobin-iron to certain parts of the body. The investigators have preliminary\n      data in mice and humans suggesting that delivery of a significant iron load from aged red\n      cells leads to the production of a potentially toxic form of circulating iron called\n      non-transferrin-bound iron. This study will determine the minimal duration of red blood cell\n      (RBC) storage that leads to increases in circulating non-transferrin-bound iron in healthy\n      human volunteers post-transfusion. The results from this study will help guide national\n      guidelines for appropriate duration of RBC storage prior to transfusion, which is currently\n      6 weeks by FDA criteria. The overall objective of this research is to improve the safety of\n      refrigerated storage of red blood cells before transfusion."
