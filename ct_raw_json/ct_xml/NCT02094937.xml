  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to clarify the position of FF and FF/Vilanterol (VI) 100/25
      micrograms (mcg) compared with existing therapies by assessing FF dosage equivalent to low
      to middle-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS). The study is divided into Run-in period,
      Period 1 (open-label treatment), Period 2 (double blind treatment) and Follow-up. Subjects
      with well controlled asthma after completing a run-in period of 4 weeks will be switched
      from middle-dose ICS/long acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) equivalent dose to once-daily FF/VI
      100/25 mcg for an 8 weeks treatment period (Period 1). After this, subjects will be
      randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive either FP 250 mcg twice daily, FP 100 mcg twice daily
      or FF 100 mcg once daily in a 12 week double blind treatment period (Period 2). There will
      be a 1 week Follow-up Period following completion of the double-blind treatment period, or
      early withdrawal from the study.  Overall , the total duration of subject's participation in
      the study will be for 25 weeks. RELVAR is a registered trademark of the GSK group of

             a diagnosis of asthma as defined by the National Institutes of Health at least 1 year
             prior to Visit 1.

          -  Gender: Male or Eligible Female, defined as non-childbearing potential or
             childbearing potential using an acceptable method of birth control consistently and

             subject; Oral contraceptive (either combined estrogen/progestin); Any intrauterine
             device (IUD) with a documented failure rate of less than 1% per year; Double barrier
             method - spermacide plus a mechanical barrier (e.g., spermacide plus a male condom or
             a spermacide and female diaphragm); Females of childbearing potential who are not
             sexually active must commit to complete abstinence from intercourse throughout the
             clinical trial and for a period after the trial to account for elimination of the
             drug (minimum of six days); Female subjects should not be enrolled if they are
             pregnant, lactating or plan to become pregnant during the time of study
             participation. A serum pregnancy test is required for females of childbearing
             potential at the initial screening visit (Visit 1) and Visit 11 or Early Withdrawal.
             In addition a urine pregnancy test will be performed on all females of childbearing
             potential at Visit 2, Visit 5 and Visit 12.

          -  Severity of Disease: A best pre-bronchodilator FEV1 of &gt;=80% of the predicted normal
             value at the screening visit (Visit 1). Predicted values will be based upon National
             Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III. As subjects are Asian, the
             Asian adjustment will be used.

          -  Stable Asthma: Subjects must have stable asthma, as judged by the Investigator. This
             includes no change in asthma medication for at least 8 weeks prior to Visit 1 and an
             ACT score of &gt;=20 at Visit 1.

          -  Current Anti-Asthma Therapy: All subjects must be using the middle-dose ICS/LABA
             which is equivalent to twice-daily combination of fluticasone propionate and
             salmeterol 250 mcg for at least 12 weeks prior to the registration visit. In
             addition, the prescription of the middle-dose ICS/LABA shouldn't be changed at least
             8 weeks prior to Visit 1.

          -  Short-Acting Beta2-Agonists (SABA): All subjects must be able to use salbutamol
             aerosol inhaler which will be provided as a rescue medication at Visit 1 during the
             study as needed. Subjects must be able to avoid using salbutamol for at least 6 hours
             prior to study visits.

          -  12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG): Evidence of significant normality in the 12-lead ECG
             performed at Visit 1, as judged by the investigator Selected specific ECG findings
             that are not considered to be significant and will not exclude the subject from study
             participation include, but are not limited to, the following: T interval corrected
             for heart rate (QTc) &lt;450 milliseconds (msec) or QTc &lt;480 msec for patients with
             bundle branch block. The QTc is the QT interval corrected for heart rate according to
             Fridericia's formula (QTcF), machine overread. The QTc should be based on single or
             averaged QTc values of triplicate electrocardiograms (ECGs) obtained over a brief
             recording period. If there are any clinically significant abnormalities including but
             not limited to a T interval for heart rate (QT) prolonged, confirm with two
             additional ECGs taken.

        Other inclusion criteria at Visit 2 and Visit 5:

          -  Subjects whose asthma meets the criterion of &quot;well-controlled&quot; (as defined in the
             protocol), and in the Investigators judgement it is acceptable for subject to &quot;switch

          -  Compliance: A subject will not be eligible if he/she or his/her parent or legal
             guardian has any infirmity, disability, disease, or geographical location which seems
             likely (in the opinion of the Investigator) to impair compliance with any aspect of
