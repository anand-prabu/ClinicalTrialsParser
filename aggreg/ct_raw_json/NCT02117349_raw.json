Baseline abnormalities of international normalized ratio (INR) > 2.5 or activated\n             partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) > 100 seconds during screening that are not\n             explained by current drug treatment (e.g., warfarin, heparin)\n\n          4. Aspartate Aminotransferase (ASAT/AST) and Alanine aminotransferase (ALAT/ALT) > 3 x\n             upper limit normal range during screening, except for subjects undergoing liver\n             resection surgery or with a diagnosis of liver disease where there is no upper limit\n             for these analytes due to nature of their disease\n\n          5. Subject is unwilling to receive blood products\n\n          6. Platelets < 100 x10\u1d279 PLT/L during screening\n\n          7. Subject has history of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (only for vascular subjects\n             where heparin use is required)\n\n          8. Known hypersensitivity to Fibrocaps or any of its components\n\n          9. Subject has known antibodies or hypersensitivity to thrombin or other coagulation\n             factors\n\n         10. Known allergy to porcine gelatin\n\n         11. Medical, social, or psychosocial factors that, in the opinion of the Investigator,\n             could impact subject safety or compliance with study procedures\n\n         12. Subject is currently participating or has participated in another clinical study\n             involving an investigational agent within 30 days of the planned date of surgery\n\n         13.
