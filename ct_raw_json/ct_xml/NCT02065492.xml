  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with thalassemia may have high iron levels after receiving blood transfusions.
      These high iron levels can have damaging effects on the body, especially the heart.
      Conventionally only chelation therapy was given for prevention of iron buildup in the heart.
      However, current research has shown that another drug, amlodipine, also helps to slow down
      the deposition of iron in the heart. This study is designed to see if patients receiving
      amlodipine along with their regular chelation therapy have a slower rate of iron buildup in
      the heart when compared with patients who are receiving chelation only.

      Null Hypothesis There is no difference between the efficacy of chelation plus amlodipine
      therapy and chelation therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in
      thalassemia patients with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      Alternate Hypothesis Chelation plus amlodipine therapy is more efficacious than chelation
      therapy alone in retarding the rate of myocardial iron deposition in thalassemia patients
      with iron overload and a constant transfusion need.

      The aim of the investigators study is to determine if amlodipine, an L-type specific calcium
      channel blocker, in addition to the standard aggressive chelation therapy, can retard the
      deposition of iron in the myocardium of thalassemia patients with significant myocardial
      iron load with or without cardiomyopathy.

    <description>Each patient will be randomized into either of two study arms: amlodipine plus chelation or chelation alone. All patients will undergo MRI and T2* imaging at baseline and then at 6 and 12 month follow-up visits. Efficacy of Amlodipine will be assessed using change in T2* times.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Cardiac MRI and echocardiogram will be utilized to assess both systolic and diastolic function. Basic parameters such as left ventricular end diastolic volume, left ventricular systolic volume and the ejection fraction will be measured.
Mitral Inflow Doppler as well as Tissue Doppler Imaging will be used to assess diastolic dysfunction.
Conventional Pulsed Doppler Echocardiography will be utilized to derive the myocardial performance index (Tei Index) of each patient which will serve as a surrogate for systolic function.
Peak global and segmental longitudinal left and right ventricular strain and strain rate will be calculated using speckle tracking by tracing images obtained from the apical 4-chamber view. Peak global and segmental right and left ventricular circumferential strain and strain rate will also be calculated from a parasternal, mid-cavity short axis view using speckle tracking also.</description>

    <description>Data on adverse effects will be be collected using the adverse event form. The adverse effects anticipated include fatigue, nausea, edema, palpitations, flushing, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, somnolence, cough, hypertension and sinus bradycardia. Any other adverse event will also be reported. Adverse events that require only symptomatic management will be treated by the participant's primary hematologist.	Adverse events that require hospitalization will also be managed by the participant's primary hematologist and the costs incurred will be covered by the research fund. Cardiovascular adverse events that require outpatient or inpatient management will be treated by the Principal Investigator and his cardiology team and all costs incurred will be covered by the research fund.</description>
