Systematic review evidence indicates that\n      enhanced oral health care (OHC) has a preventative effect on the incidence of pneumonia\n      amongst nursing home populations (absolute risk reductions 6.6% to 11.7%; numbers needed to\n      treat 8.6 to 15.3 individuals). There are strong theoretical reasons to suggest similar\n      benefits might be observed in stroke care settings but current empirical evidence is weak -\n      trial quality (randomisation, blinding, sample size, reporting), intervention description\n      and thus feasibility of translation into clinical practice is very poor.  Following an\n      extensive pre-clinical programme of work, investigators now plan the pilot phase (Phase II)\n      of a stepped-wedge cluster RCT of a well-developed and defined complex OHC intervention\n      versus usual OHC. Investigators aim to establish a robust web-based randomisation process,\n      refine the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence,\n      record linkage and sampling methodologies. Investigators also aim to establish the\n      relationship between SAP and plaque and any diversity between sites."

Ward level cluster randomisation will progress in a stepped wedge\n      manner where after a period of baseline data collection each ward in a randomly allocated\n      order will 'convert' from usual care to an enhanced oral health care intervention.\n\n      This pilot trial will assess the feasibility of delivering this enhanced OHC intervention\n      across four sites and will inform the trial design of a full scale phase III trial including\n      refining the proposed intervention (training, tools, equipment), recruitment, adherence,\n      record linkage, sampling methodologies, sample size calculations and pilot our health\n      economic evaluation.
