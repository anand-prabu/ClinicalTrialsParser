Dolutegravir is a second-generation integrase inhibitor that is effective in\n           suppressing HIV replication in individuals with resistance to first-generation\n           integrase inhibitors. Ibalizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G monoclonal antibody\n           directed against a human T-cell receptor (CD4) and thus suppresses HIV replication by\n           blocking entry of HIV into CD4+ lymphocytes. Both Dolutegravir and ibalizumab are in\n           the pipeline for FDA approval to treat HIV infection. For both medications phase I and\n           II clinical studies have been completed in HIV-negative and HIV-infected individuals\n           showing that both are safe and effective for suppressing HIV replication.\n\n        2. Use of these medications requires that a single patient IND be obtained from the FDA\n           for each patient requiring dolutegravir and/or ibalizumab. Because treatment of HIV\n           infection requires multiple active antiretroviral medications, the FDA requested that a\n           single Investigational New Drug Application (IND) be utilized to cover both of these\n           investigational medications. An individual use IND has been approved by the FDA; The\n           IND number is 114515. The manufacturers of dolutegravir (ViiV Healthcare) and\n           ibalizumab (TaiMed Biologics, Inc) will ship the drug directly to the Denver Health\n           pharmacy."
