According to\n      the Guideline for the Identification of Adverse Reaction after Immunization issued by the\n      Chinese Ministry of Health in 2008, Sichuan CDC and local prefectural CDC must organize an\n      expert panel to investigate adverse events and assess causality, using criteria based on\n      Chinese Standard Procedures for Vaccination.\n\n      At the time of vaccination, vaccinees were instructed to report any adverse event to\n      physicians or vaccination providers. Adverse events that were fatal or that resulted in\n      disability and clusters of events (i.e., notably high numbers of similar adverse events\n      related to a certain vaccine) were required to be reported within 2 hours after their\n      occurrence. The following adverse events were required to be reported within 2 days after\n      their occurrence: anaphylaxis or other allergic reactions occurring within 24 hours after\n      vaccination; fever (axillary temperature, >37.5\u00b0C), angioedema, or a local injection-site\n      reaction (diameter, >2.5 cm) occurring within 5 days after vaccination; purpura, an Arthus\n      reaction, febrile convulsion, seizure, or polyneuritis occurring within 15 days after\n      vaccination; and the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome occurring within 3 months after vaccination.\n      Other reactions that were common and minor (e.g., mild pain and fatigue) were not required\n      to be reported."
