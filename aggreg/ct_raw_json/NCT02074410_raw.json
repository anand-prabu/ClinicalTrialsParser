Capacity to provide informed consent will be determined by the\n             MoCA and investigator judgment according to the following:\n\n               -  Have a score of greater than or equal to 21 on the MoCA and is competent to\n                  provide informed consent, in the judgment of the investigator.\n\n               -  Have a score of less than 21 on the MoCA and is competent to provide informed\n                  consent, in the judgment of a mental health professional (independent of the\n                  investigator).\n\n               -  Have a score of less than 21 on the MoCA and is not competent to provide\n                  informed consent, in the judgment of a mental health professional (independent\n                  of the investigator), and has a LAR provide informed consent with assent by the\n                  subject.\n\n          2. Have a clinical diagnosis of HD, confirmed by either CAG repeat number of greater\n             than or equal to 39 or a positive family history (a first degree relative with a\n             clinical diagnosis of HD) if CAG repeat number is not known.\n\n          3. Are 18 to 65 years inclusive at screening visit (Visit 1).\n\n          4. Have a UHDRS Total Functional Capacity greater than or equal to 7 at Visit 1.\n\n          5. If currently taking antipsychotic medication(s), have been on a stable regimen for at\n             least 60 days prior to randomization.\n\n          6. Have completed at least 10th grade or equivalent of formal education.\n\n          7. Are fluent in English.\n\n          8. If female, are either a) not of childbearing potential (i.e., surgically sterilized\n             or post-menopausal for more than 1 year) or b) have a negative pregnancy test and if\n             sexually active must agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception\n             throughout the study. Acceptable methods of contraception include a reliable\n             intrauterine device, hormonal contraception or spermicide in combination with a\n             barrier method.\n\n          9. If male, are either a) not of reproductive potential or b) if sexually active must\n             agree to use a medically reliable form of contraception throughout the study.\n             Acceptable methods of birth control include spermicide in combination with a barrier\n             method, or subjects' female partner is willing to use medically acceptable methods of\n             birth control.\n\n         10. Have normal clinical laboratory test results and ECG, or results with minor\n             deviations, which are not considered to be clinically significant by the\n             investigator.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Have a history or presence of significant cardiovascular, respiratory, hepatic,\n             renal, gastrointestinal, endocrine, or neurological disorders other than HD which, in\n             the opinion of the investigator, increases the risk of the study drug or may confound\n             the interpretation of study measures.\n\n          2. Have unstable or severe depression, in the opinion of the investigator.\n\n          3. Have alcohol or drug abuse or dependence, as defined by the Diagnostic and\n             Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision.\n\n          4. Have received treatment with an investigational drug or device within 60 days prior\n             to Visit 1.\n\n          5. Are pregnant or lactating.\n\n          6.
