    <textblock>
      Open-label, Phase 0, dose-escalation study of 3 successive cohorts (3 subjects per cohort),
      to determine and characterize the plasma PK of gemcitabine HCl oral formulation (D07001-F4)
      administered once on Day 1 with 7 Days of study follow-up.  In addition, oral tolerability
      and safety will also be assessed during this 1-week period.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female subjects aged 18 years and older.

          2. Signed and dated informed consent form.

          3. Subjects with malignancies with histological or pathologic confirmation and who are
             clinically stable.

          4. History of treatment with at least 1 cytotoxic chemotherapy regimen for the current
             malignancy.

          5. If the subject has received cytotoxic chemotherapy within the past 14 days, the
             subject is beyond the nadir of white blood cell and platelet counts.

          6. At least 28 days have elapsed since the subject's prior radiotherapy or any major
             surgery (excluding diagnostic biopsy or venous access device placement).

          7. World Health Organization (WHO) performance status 0 to 2

          8. Subject has an ANC ≥1500 cells/mm³, platelet count ≥ 100,000 cells/mm³, and
             hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL.

             limits (aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase), total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 mg/dL
             (unless due to Gilbert's syndrome), albumin ≥ 2.5 g/dL, international normalized
             ratio [INR] &lt; 1.5).

         10. Subject has adequate renal function: serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x upper limit of normal.

         11. Subject has a life expectancy &gt;24 weeks.

         12. If a women of child-bearing potential, subject has a negative pregnancy test and is
             not breast-feeding.

         13. If a women of child-bearing potential, subject is using a medically acceptable form
             of birth control prior to screening and for the duration of their study participation
             and for 1 month after the end of the study.

         14. Subject is willing to comply with protocol-required visit schedule and visit
             requirements and provide written informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has rapidly progressive disease or rapid clinical deterioration as assessed
             by the Investigator.

          2. Subject is receiving full-dose (therapeutic) anticoagulation therapy.

          3. Subject is receiving concomitant radiotherapy.

          4. Subject is intolerant or allergic or has a known hypersensitivity to gemcitabine.

          5. Subject has clinically significant cardiovascular disease (for example: uncontrolled
             hypertension, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, or New York Heart
             Association Grade 2 or greater).

          6. Subject has uncontrolled serious cardiac arrhythmia.

          9. Subject has documented cerebrovascular disease.

         10. Subject has a seizure disorder not controlled on medication.

         11. Subject received an investigational agent within 30 days of screening.

         13. Subject has known human immunodeficiency virus infection or viral hepatitis.

         14. Subject has any other serious medical condition that, in the investigator's medical
             opinion, would preclude safe participation in a clinical trial.

         15. Subject has gastrointestinal disease or prior gastrointestinal surgery that may
             interfere with adequate oral therapy absorption.
