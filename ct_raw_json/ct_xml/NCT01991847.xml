      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility of a one year exercise training
      program in post-surgical patients with colon cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Apart from a genetic predisposition lifestyle factors (low physical activity, nutrition, and
      obesity) increase the risk of colon cancer. Furthermore, in observational studies increased
      physical activity has shown to improve the prognosis in patients after the diagnosis of
      colon cancer. However, there are currently no prospective randomized controlled trials which
      prove the causal relationship between exercise and prognosis in colon cancer patients. The
      long-term aim of this study is to evaluate whether physical activity of ≥ 18 MET-h per week
      significantly improves disease free survival in colon cancer survivors (stage UICC II/III).
      In the first instance, structure-, process- as well as outcome-characteristics need to be
      investigated within a feasibility study (F-PROTECT). Essential aims are to establish
      collaborations with clinics and training centres, to achieve the required recruitment
      numbers, and to conduct the training intervention.
