  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether Nuedexta is effective in the treatment of
      symptoms (impaired speech, swallowing, and saliva control)associated with Amyotrophic
      Lateral Sclerosis (ALS).
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Muscle weakness, the cardinal feature of ALS, leads to progressive loss of motor function
      affecting the limbs, tongue, respiratory and pharyngeal muscles. Symptomatic treatments such
      as the placement of a feeding tube, can compensate for the inability to swallow. Riluzole,
      the only approved treatment for ALS, may slow disease progression but no treatment is
      curative and none have improved function.

      Unexpectedly, Nuedexta®, approved for the treatment of labile emotionality that occurs in
      association with ALS and other neurological disorders, has been observed to improve bulbar
      function, primarily speech and swallowing, in a number of neurological disorders, including
      ALS. The basis for this is conjectural but likely due to a direct effect of the drug on
      motor neurons in the part of the brain that controls speech and swallowing. The same part of
      the brain appears to modulate the expression of emotions and interestingly the site of
      action of the drug is the same as a site that has been implicated in a juvenile form of ALS.

      This is a multicenter, randomized double-blind, placebo controlled, cross over study
      evaluating the palliative effect of Nuedexta® on bulbar dysfunction. It is expected that
      approximately 60 ALS patients from 7 clinical centers in the US will be enrolled.

    <description>The Center for Neurologic Study-Bulbar Function Scale (CNS-BFS) is a 21-item self report scale that assesses three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation. The scale was modeled on the Center for Neurologic Study Emotional Lability Scale (CNS-LS) that has been a robust endpoint in four clinical trials. The scale was validated in a large population of ALS patients (n=122) and detects impaired bulbar function at a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 0.97%. Test re-test correlation was 0.92% at six-months (n=53).</description>

    <description>The Center for Neurologic Study-Lability Scale (CNS-LS) is a 7-item self report scale that assesses pseudobulbar affect (PBA) by measuring the perceived frequency of PBA episodes (laughing or crying).</description>

    <measure>Change in ALS Functional Rating Scale- Revised (ALSFRS-R) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening Visit, Baseline Visit, Visit 1 (28 ± 3 days from Baseline Visit), Visit 2 (10-15 days from Visit 1), and Visit 3 (28 ± 3 days from Visit 2), and a Telephone Call (28 + 5 days from Visit 3)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The ALSFRS-R is a quickly administered (5 minutes) ordinal rating scale (ratings 0-4) used to determine subjects' assessment of their capability and independence in 12 functional activities.  All 12 activities are relevant in ALS. Initial validity was established by documenting that in ALS patients, change in ALSFRS-R scores correlated with change in strength over time, was closely associated with quality of life measures, and predicted survival.</description>

    <measure>Change in Slow Vital Capacity (SVC) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Screening Visit, Baseline Visit, Visit 1 (28 ± 3 days from Baseline Visit), Visit 2 (10-15 days from Visit 1), and Visit 3 (28 ± 3 days from Visit)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The vital capacity (VC) (percent of predicted normal) will be determined, using the slow VC method. The SVC can be measured using conventional spirometers that have had a calibration check prior to subject testing.  A printout from the spirometer of all SVC trials will be retained.</description>

    <measure>Change in Visual Analog Scale (Bulbar Function) Score</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Visual analog scales are useful for measuring complex clinical events and offer the advantage of self-administration and responsiveness to change over time.  The scales designed for this study inventory three domains of bulbar function: speech, swallowing and salivation. For each of these, subjects score themselves by indicating, on a scale of 1 to 10 (from normal to severe impairment), their level of function.</description>

    <measure>Change in Ashworth Spasticity Scale Score</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>This is a standard measure for spasticity that has been used in numerous ALS clinical trials to assess spasticity due to upper motor neuron dysfunction in ALS.  Data is generated from the clinical exam and scored from 1-5, the lowest score indicating normal tone and the highest muscle rigidity.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Subjects will be asked to read 'The Rainbow Passage' a commonly used test paragraph utilized by speech pathologists to assess speech rate (words/minute).  Study staff will time the subject to determine how many words the subject reads per minute. It is used primarily because it contains every sound in the English language.  Subjects will also be observed for loudness, nasality, and intelligibility.</description>

    <measure>Change in Water Swallowing Test (WST) Result</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, Visit 1 (28 ± 3 days from Baseline Visit), Visit 2 (10-15 days from Visit 1), and Visit 3 (28 ± 3 days from Visit 2)</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The Water Swallowing Test (WST) estimates swallowing speed, a useful and reproducible measure. While sitting, subjects are asked to drink 30 milliliters (mL) of liquid. The time for subjects to complete this task is a sensitive measure for the detection of swallowing dysfunction and is a simple measure for serial assessment of subjects. The test will be completed three times, with the best two scores recorded to obtain an average score. Following completion of the WST, the subject's swallowing abilities (choking, spillage, and effort) will be observed.</description>

    <description>The Time Swallowing Test assesses the subject's ability to swallow solids. For this test, the subject will be asked to consume a tablespoon of cereal containing 5 cheerios. The subject will be instructed to close their mouth, chew and subsequently swallow the bolus.  The time to complete this task will be recorded. The test will be completed three times to obtain an average score.</description>
