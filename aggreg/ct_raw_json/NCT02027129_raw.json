A possible explanation is that HFO increases the\n      probability of right ventricular dysfunction due to the combination of high mean airway\n      pressures (mPaws) and hypercapnia. In contrast, available preliminary data on low-frequency\n      HFO-tracheal gas insufflation (TGI) with cuff leak vs. CMV are suggestive of an HFO-TGI\n      related benefit. Low-frequency HFO-TGI with a cuff leak is associated with relatively low\n      mean tracheal pressures and adequate control of PaCO2. Thus, the investigators intend to\n      test the hypothesis that low frequency HFO +/- TGI with a cuff leak is associated with\n      better right ventricular function relative to high-frequency HFO without a cuff leak."

            "textblock": "Rationale of the study Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) is an acute inflammatory\n      state of the pulmonary parenchyma that causes hypoxemia, atelectasis, pulmonary congestion,\n      and reduction in pulmonary compliance. Mechanical ventilation is actually life-saving, but\n      it may traumatize the lungs (e.g. volutrauma, barotrauma, atelectrauma, and biotrauma). The\n      use of low tidal volumes and high positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), aims at\n      attenuating ventilator-associated lung injury. However, ARDS mortality still remains high.\n      High frequency oscillation (HFO) is an alternative ventilatory technique that employs very\n      low tidal volumes (1-4 ml/kg) administered at high frequencies (3-15 Hz). Prior\n      observational studies have reported improvements in oxygenation, whereas recent two-center\n      data on severe ARDS suggest a survival benefit from the intermittent, combined use of\n      low-frequency HFO with a cuff leak, Recruitment maneuvers (RMs), and tracheal gas\n      insufflation (TGI). The addition of TGI improves oxygenation and CO2 elimination; however,\n      it is still unclear whether it affects survival.  Two recently published multicenter studies\n      showed either neutral (10) or negative results (11) with respect to survival when high\n      frequency HFO without a cuff leak was used in the treatment of early ARDS. However, these\n      negative results may be partly due to right ventricular overload/dysfunction/failure caused\n      by the combination of high intrathoracic pressures and hypercapnia, with consequent\n      hemodynamic instability and increased need of inotropic/vasopressor support. Accordingly,\n      the investigators hypothesize that a different HFO strategy [employing a combination of a\n      low frequency and a cuff leak - which augments CO2 elimination and is associated with\n      relatively low mean tracheal pressures - could lead to different results.\n\n      A high intrathoracic pressure may impede venous return and increase pulmonary vascular\n      resistance. This concurrent right ventricular preload reduction and afterload increase might\n      cause right ventricular dysfunction/failure. On the other hand, the placement of a cuff leak\n      results in a lower (by approx. 5-6 cmH2O) mean tracheal pressure relative to the set\n      HFO-ventilator mean airway pressure (mPaw), with consequent unloading of the right\n      ventricle. In addition, further unloading of the right ventricle can be expected through the\n      combined use of a cuff leak, TGI, and a high HFO bias flow; these measures improve PaCO2\n      control and may prevent excessive, hypercapnia-induced increases in pulmonary vascular\n      resistance. Right ventricular function can be assessed by transesophageal echocardiography\n      (TEE) as previously described. Right ventricular dysfunction and associated dilatation may\n      cause cardiac output reduction and coronary hypoperfusion; the latter may further compromise\n      right ventricular performance and contribute to right ventricular failure.\n\n      The main goal of the present study is to document and compare the effect of lung protective\n      conventional mechanical ventilation (CMV) and of different HFO strategies (already\n      clinically tested in trials with conflicting results) on 1) right ventricular performance\n      and 2) the coronary blood flow as determined by TEE. More specifically, we intend to compare\n      high-PEEP, lung protective CMV with a \"high\" mPaw/no cuff leak, high-frequency HFO strategy,\n      and a \"high\" mPaw with cuff leak, \"low\" frequency    HFO strategy with and without TGI.\n\n      Methods METHODS Eligible patients (relevant criteria provided below) with early and severe\n      ARDS will be enrolled after the obtainment of informed, written, next-of-kin consent.\n\n      Patient monitoring will include electrocardiographic lead II, intra-arterial pressure (+/-\n      cardiac index with PICCO plus, Pulsion Medical Systems, Munich, Germany)], and peripheral\n      oxygen saturation (SaO2). Anesthesia will be maintained with midazolam and/or propofol, and\n      fentanyl or remifentanil. Nrutomuscular blockade will be accomplished with cisatracurium,\n      which will be used in concordance with current recommendations and as part of the attending\n      physician-prescribed medical treatment. During the study period, all patients will be\n      receiving a continuous infusion of cisatracurium.\n\n      CMV strategy Eligible study participants will have received at least 60 min of lung\n      protective CMV with the following combinations of FiO2/PEEP: 0.5/10-12 cm H2O, 0.6/14-16 cm\n      H2O, 0.7/14-16 cm H2O, 0.8/14-16 cm H2O, 0.9/16-18 cm H2O, 1.0/20-24 cmH2O. A\n      high-PEEP-associated survival benefit has been recently documented. Whenever oxygenation\n      deteriorates, PEEP will be increased first, followed by the increase in FiO2 according to\n      the aforementioned FiO2/PEEP combinations.\n\n      Tidal volume will be within 5.5-7.5 mL/Kg predicted body weight. The maximal plateau\n      pressure limit will be 40 cmH2O, and target plateau pressure will be \u226432 cmH2O; rationale:\n      as in the study of Meade et al , a higher plateau pressure will be tolerated to allow for\n      the use of a higher PEEP level. When plateau pressure exceeds 32 cmH2O for >15 min, the\n      following adjustments will be conducted: tidal volume reduction up to 4.0 mL/kg predicted\n      body weight, respiratory rate increase up to 35/min, and PEEP reduction by \u22652 cmH2O. These\n      adjustments will have to concurrently result in the achievement of the below-provided\n      gas-exchange targets.\n\n      The respiratory rate will be titrated to a pHa of 7.20-7.45. The inspiratory-to-expiratory\n      time (\u0399:\u0395) ratio will be \u22641/2. The oxygenation target will be SaO2=90-95%, and/or PaO2=60-80\n      mmHg. At pHa<7.20, breathing circuit deadspace will be minimized by replacing the routinely\n      used catheter mount by a short, low-volume angular connector, the tidal volume will be\n      increased up to 8.0 mL/kg predicted body weight, and respiratory rate will be increased up\n      to 35/min. If these measures fail, the criterion of \"poor control of pHa/PaCO2,\" and the use\n      of a bicarbonate infusion will be permitted. An additional option will be extracorporeal CO2\n      removal.\n\n      Algorithm of RMs and PEEP/FiO2\n\n        1. RM - Continuous positive airway pressure of 40-45 cmH2O for 40 sec, at an  FiO2 of 1.0)\n           and titration of PEEP and FiO2 so that SaO2=90-95%, or  PaO2=60-80 mmHg (RMs may be\n           repeated twice daily, once every 5 hours)\n\n        2. Reduction in FiO2 always precedes reduction in PEEP.\n\n        3. At FiO2=0.5 and PEEP<8 cmH2O - Weaning trial.\n\n        4. RMs may be administered for up to 5 days following the onset of the ARDS\n\n      HFO-RMs strategy\n\n      Previously published recommendations regarding HFO use (Sensormedics 3100B ventilator,\n      Sensormedics, Yorba Linda, CA, USA) include the following steps:\n\n        1. Sufficient level of deep sedation/anesthesia for the abolishment of respiratory muscles\n           activity, with or without neuromuscular blockade, so that patient-ventilator\n           dyssynchrony is avoided.\n\n        2. Confirmation of endotracheal tube patency and placement of the tube at 3-4 cm above\n           carina.\n\n        3. RMs: immediately after patient-oscillator connection, an RM will be performed (increase\n           in the circuit pressure to 45 cmH2O for 40 sec with the oscillator's piston off). The\n           RMs will be repeated just prior to changes in HFO frequency or just prior to/just after\n           the initiation/termination of TGI.\n\n        4. FiO2 will initially be set at 1.0.\n\n        5. Bias flow will be set at 60 L/min to improve CO2 clearance from the breathing circuit.\n\n        6. I:E ratio will be maintained at 1:2.\n\n        7. According to the methods and results of preceding studies of the investigators, TGI\n           will be equal to 50% of the preceding CMV minute ventilation.\n\n        8. The initial HFO mPaw will exceed the mPaw of the preceding C\u039cV by 8-10 cm H2O and will\n           be titrated (by \u00b13 cmH2O) to the best oxygenation response during a 60-min period of\n           standard, low frequency HFO with cuff leak. The aforementioned period will precede the\n           below-described 180-min period of HFO strategy testing.\n\n        9. Initial oscillation frequency will be randomly set at either at 3.5-4 Hz or at 7 Hz.\n           The low frequency setting will be combined with a 3-5 cmH2O cuff leak and TGI for 60\n           min followed by \"no-TGI\" for another 60 min in random order. The high frequency setting\n           will not be combined with either a cuff leak or TGI and will be maintained for an\n           additional 60 min. Oscillatory pressure amplitude (\u0394P) will be set at 90 cmH2O.\n\n      TEE measurements\n\n      The following parameters will be determined during baseline CMV:\n\n      Right ventricular diastolic area, left ventricular diastolic area, and Eccentricity Index.\n      Assessment of coronary blood flow in the right main coronary artery and the left anterior\n      descendant branch of the left main coronary artery. The same measurements will be repeated\n      at 120, 180, and 240 min after HFO initiation, and at 60 min following return to CMV. At the\n      same time points, we will determine gas exchange, and hemodynamics including cardiac output\n      with PICCO plus. Lastly, respiratory mechanics will be assessed with rapid\n      end-expiratory/end-inspiratory airway occlusion during CMV.\n\n      Rescue oxygenation Rescue oxygenation methodology may include low-frequency HFO-TGI with\n      cuff leak, prone positioning, inhaled nitric oxide, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.\n      The duration of a rescue oxygenation session will be at least 10 hours with allowance for an\n      unlimited extension if PaO2<60 mmHg. Rescue initiation criterion: PaO2<60 mmHg for more than\n      30 min at FiO2=1.0 during the high-PEEP, lung protective CMV, in the absence of any\n      reversible cardio-respiratory pathology and/or ventilator malfunction.\n\n      Patient follow up Physiological variables (hemodynamics gas-exchange, and respiratory\n      mechanics) and medication will be recorded within 2 hours before study enrollment and at 9\n      a.m. of days 1-10 following study enrollment. Organ dysfunction according to the Sequential\n      Organ Dysfunction Assessment score and clinical course complications will be documented\n      until day 60 post-enrollment. Lastly, the final outcome (i.e. survival to hospital discharge\n      or in-hospital death) will also be recorded.\n\n      POTENTIAL RISKS OF INVESTIGATIONAL INTERVENTIONS AND THEIR PREVENTION. Potential risk:\n      Barotrauma. Preventive measures: This potential risk is equally high during CMV or HFO.  We\n      also do not anticipate any notable clinical complications due to the use of high-frequency,\n      high mPaw HFO without cuff leak, as its duration of use will not exceed the\n      protocol-pre-specified time limit of 60 min.\n\n      POSSIBLE BENEFITS For the participating patient: possible increase in the probability of\n      survival to hospital discharge if HFO-TGI is used as a rescue oxygenation method and\n      detailed TEE evaluation of the cardiac function. For Medical Science:  Possible improvement\n      in the understanding of the interaction among ventilatory strategy, heart, and lungs."
