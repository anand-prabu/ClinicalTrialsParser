Sexually active male participants\n             must agree to use an effective form of birth control such as condoms.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:(both open label phase IB safety and Phase IIA study):\n\n          1. Enrollment or history of enrollment in a drug, or biologic therapy study sponsored by\n             TrialNet.\n\n          2.

Patients requiring chronic systemic corticosteroids.\n\n          7. Any other immune disorder including but not limited to other autoimmune diseases,\n             HIV, HBV, HCV, HPV, HSV positivity.\n\n          8. Impaired renal function with a creatinine level > 1.5.\n\n          9. Administration of the following therapies while patients are undergoing treatment on\n             this protocol: i) radiation therapy; ii) chemotherapy; iii) corticosteroids (except\n             when administered in life-threatening circumstances); iv) other particle or\n             cell-based  therapies; v) other biologic therapies; vi) other therapies aimed at\n             modulating the immune system; vii) other endocrine-related therapies, hormone\n             replacement (other than thyroxine and contraceptive), glucoregulation.\n\n         10. A hemaglobinopathy known to interfere with the ability to accurately determine HbA1c.\n\n         11. No prior radiation therapy, immunotherapy, or chemotherapy."
