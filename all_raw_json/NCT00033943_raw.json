Study drug will be administered\n      by subcutaneous (under the skin) injection and patients will be taught how to\n      self-administer these injections.  Following an initial Screening Visit, eligible patients\n      will return to the clinic for initiation of study treatment and then again for follow-up\n      visits after 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks of treatment.  A follow-up telephone call will be scheduled\n      2 months (and possibly also 4 and 6 months) after completing study treatment.  Study\n      procedures will include a flexible sigmoidoscopy at the Screening Visit and at the Week 6\n      visit."
