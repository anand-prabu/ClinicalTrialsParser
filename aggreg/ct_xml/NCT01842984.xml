    <description>Loneliness will be assessed via several measures: (a) Frequency of loneliness will be measured via one item (&quot;How often would you say you feel lonely?&quot;; (Mullins, Woodland, &amp; Putnam, 1990) on a 6-point scale from &quot;never&quot; (1) to &quot;several times an hour&quot; (6); (b) The UCLA Loneliness Scale- 8 items (ULS-8; (Hays &amp; DiMatteo, 1987). Each item is rated on a 5-point scale from &quot;not at all&quot; (1) to &quot;to a great extent&quot; (5), with a higher score indicating more loneliness. Based on experience from another study (Cohen-Mansfield et al., 2013) one item (&quot;I am unhappy being so withdrawn&quot;) was replaced with two items (&quot;I feel physically distant from other people&quot;; &quot;I feel emotionally distant from other people).</description>

    <description>The I-SOCIAL intervention is based on findings from Cohen-Mansfield and Parpura-Gill (2007), which highlighted the important role of barriers in contributing to loneliness in older persons. These barriers include a perceived lack of opportunities for social contacts, low social self-efficacy, and health and mobility difficulties. The intervention includes: (1) identifying the barriers for the specific person; (2) up to 10 meetings with an activities counselor. The meetings include discussions concerning options for social contacts and use of techniques and resources to tackle the barriers; and (3) group meetings of participants and the activities counselors in order to provide a concrete social event and as a venue to discuss barriers and ways to address them.</description>
