            "textblock": "Fractional flow reserve (FFR) is an established invasive method for assessing the\n      physiological significance of coronary artery stenosis. Adenosine, an important endogenous\n      regulator of coronary blood flow during both stress and ischemia, is widely used to achieve\n      conditions of stable hyperemia required for measurement of FFR.\n\n      Studies in healthy volunteers and in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) post\n      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) receiving ticagrelor revealed a differential\n      coronary blood flow velocity response during increasing doses of adenosine compared to\n      placebo or prasugrel treated subjects, respectively. It has also been demonstrated that\n      patients treated with ticagrelor have increased plasma adenosine levels. Therefore, it has\n      been hypothesized that the degree of hyperemia obtained with adenosine infusion may be\n      greater in patients on ticagrelor than that obtained in patients taking clopidogrel or\n      prasugrel.  If this proves to be true, it would lead to a lower FFR value with possible\n      important clinical implications in ticagrelor receiving patients in need for FFR\n      measurement.\n\n      This is a prospective, single center, randomized study of parallel design. Consecutive\n      ticagrelor naive patients who are referred for coronary angiography and have an\n      angiographically moderate to severe de novo stenosis (>50% and <90% diameter by visual\n      assessment) in at least one major epicardial coronary artery amenable to PCI are candidates\n      for this study. Patients after informed consent will be randomized (hour 0) to receive\n      immediately post FFR (with adenosine iintravenous  infusion at 140 \u03bcg/Kg/min for a 3 minute\n      period) either ticagrelor 180mg loading dose or prasugrel 60mg/clopidogrel 600mg loading\n      dose (as clinically indicated). FFR examination will be repeated 2 hours post loading dose."
