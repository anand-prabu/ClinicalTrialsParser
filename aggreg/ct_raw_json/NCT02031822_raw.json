Each patient\n      receives an injection of 2ml of 0.5% bupivacaine with 40mg of methylprednisolone. The null\n      hypothesis is that there is no difference in intensity scores for headache at one month\n      after the interventions. Outcomes related to efficacy (numbness immediately after the\n      injection, reduction in episodes of severe headache, sleep quality), performance (time taken\n      for and discomfort during procedure), and safety (incidence of hematoma, intravascular\n      injection) are measured after one month."
