To investigate reported candidate genes, in addition to DAT1 variant, related to\n           dopamine and noradrenergic neurotransmitter systems in the association with\n           neurocognitive endophenotypes such as DRD1, DRD2, DRD4, DRD5, DBH, MAO-A, ADRA2A,\n           ADRA2C, NET, and COMT."

DSI employs a pulsed-gradient\n      spin-echo echo planar imaging (EPI) sequence by applying 102 diffusion gradient vectors and\n      the maximum diffusion sensitivity = 4000 s/mm2, and rsfMRI is a 6-minute scan using a\n      gradient-echo EPI sequence with 180 volumes. (2) Structural connectivity analysis: DSI\n      tractography will be performed using in-house software (DSI studio,\n      http://dsi-studio.labsolver.org/Home). Tracts-of-interest in the frontostriatal circuit and\n      the frontoparietal circuit will be identified, and tract-specific analysis will be used to\n      analyze the microstructural integrity along individual tract bundles. (3) Functional\n      connectivity analysis: SPM8 program and in-house MATLAB codes will be used for analyses of\n      rsfMRI data. Region-of-interests (ROIs) will be placed in the nodes of the corresponding\n      circuits according to an anatomical template (WFU_PickAtlas 3.03). These ROIs will serve for\n      tract determination in the tractography procedure and for seed regions in which BOLD signals\n      are extracted for regression analysis among nodes."
