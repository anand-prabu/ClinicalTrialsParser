Patients will receive \u00bd of the\n      Toca 511 intravenously, followed approximately 11 days later by removal of the tumor and\n      injection of the remaining \u00bd of the Toca 511 into the resection cavity.  The tumor specimen\n      will be tested for the presence of Toca 511.  Approximately 4 weeks later, the patient will\n      take an oral 10-day course of Toca FC, an antifungal antibiotic. These 10-day courses of\n      Toca FC will be repeated approximately every 5 weeks until study completion.  MRI scans will\n      be performed approximately every 2 months. One subject each will be evaluated at 3 dose\n      levels of Toca 511. Three subjects each will be evaluated in the 4th and 5th dosing cohorts.\n      These cohorts will evaluate multiday intravenous administration of Toca 511: 3 consecutive\n      days for the 4th cohort and 5 consecutive days for the 5th cohort. The dose of Toca 511 a\n      patient receives will depend upon the number of previous study participants and how well\n      they have tolerated the study drugs. All patients enrolled in this study will be encouraged\n      to participate in a continuation protocol that enables additional 5-FC administration and\n      the collection of long-term safety and response data."
