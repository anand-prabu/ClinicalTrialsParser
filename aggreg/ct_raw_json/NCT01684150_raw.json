A protein called\n      DOT1L plays an important role in the malignant process in these leukemias. EPZ-5676 is a\n      molecule that blocks the activity of DOT1L, and is therefore being evaluated in the\n      treatment of patients with MLL-rearranged leukemias.\n\n      This is a first-in-human study of EPZ-5676. The primary purpose of this study is to\n      determine what dose of EPZ-5676, when administered as a 21-day continuous intravenous\n      infusion, can be given safely to patients with hematologic malignancies. The study will have\n      two phases. The first phase will assess escalating doses of EPZ-5676 in order to determine\n      the maximally tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of EPZ-5676.  Once the\n      MTD or RP2D is established, a second phase of the study will further evaluate the safety of\n      EPZ-5676 given as a 28-day continuous IV infusion and assess the anti-leukemia activity of\n      EPZ-5676 in MLL-rearranged leukemia.\n\n      Currently this study is in the MLL-r restricted/expansion phase and patients will receive\n      EPZ-5676 as a continuous intravenous infusion."
