To explore physical activity levels, exercise capacity and quality of life in a healthy\n           population age-matched to a population with bronchiectasis.\n\n        3.

            "textblock": "The current study is running alongside an externally funded project measuring physical\n      activity levels in patients with bronchiectasis (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT01569009).  In\n      order to more fully understand physical activity behaviours in bronchiectasis, it is\n      important to compare the patterns of physical activity, exercise capacity and quality of\n      life of the patients with bronchiectasis to a healthy age-matched population.\n\n      For a healthy population of similar age to patients with bronchiectasis, little applicable\n      research currently exists with regard to normative values of physical activity and sedentary\n      behaviour.  In this particular study, we will measure physical activity levels in healthy\n      individuals age-matched to patients with bronchiectasis.  The most commonly used\n      questionnaire to assess physical activity is the International Physical Activity\n      Questionnaire.  Pedometers are inexpensive devices which can be used to assess daily step\n      count and time spent in walking.  Activity monitors are more expensive and require technical\n      expertise for analysis and interpretation.  However, they provide more in-depth information\n      on pattern, quantity and intensity of activity including daily sedentary time.  In this\n      study, the investigators will use the ActiGraph activity monitor, ActivPAL activity monitor,\n      DigiWalker pedometer and IPAQ to measure the physical activity levels in healthy individuals\n      age-matched to patients with bronchiectasis.  This study will not focus on participants who\n      engage in high levels of physical activity as they are unlikely to represent the physical\n      activity levels of patients with bronchiectasis.\n\n      This study will include the Modified Shuttle Test.  Exercise capacity measured by the\n      Modified Shuttle Test is normally only utilized in respiratory disease populations such as\n      patients with cystic fibrosis.  However, it has recently been highlighted that there is a\n      need for reference data in healthy populations.  This study will also use the EQ-5D-5L\n      questionnaire to assess quality of life.  Preliminary testing of the EQ-5D-5L questionnaire,\n      an update to the well-researched EQ-5D-3L, has only recently been conducted.  There is a\n      need for studies to provide more normative data on the EQ-5D-5L.\n\n      This study will also assess readiness to change physical activity behaviour in a healthy\n      population utilising transtheoretical model components such as stages of change,\n      self-efficacy, decisional balance and processes of change; which have all been shown to be\n      important in physical activity behaviour.  Understanding healthy individuals' perspectives\n      on readiness to change physical activity behaviour and the links between important outcomes\n      will help to inform future physical activity interventions."
