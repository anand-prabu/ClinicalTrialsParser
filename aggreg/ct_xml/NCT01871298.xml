  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine factors associated with frequency and
      type of internet and mobile technology use among illegal drug users, specifically use of
      internet and text-messaging to obtain health care information and engage in health care
      utilization, specifically  human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention and treatment
      services. We will target high drug activity neighborhoods in New York City and enroll
      participants recruited through targeted street outreach. All participants (n=336) will
      undergo an audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) that will assess
      socio-demographics, health care access and utilization, sex/drug use behavior, health
      status, and characteristics of general and health-related internet/mobile technology use
      including factors that promote or hinder use. Participants identified as using the internet
      â‰¥1/month (n=151) will return for a 4-week ACASI to report on use of the pilot website (which
      will largely display information currently available in the community in print/ pamphlet/
      video form).

    <description>While this pilot intervention is not a randomized trial, study participants who report internet use at least once a month will told of a pilot website that they will be able to access for a 4-week study period.  This website will contain a educational information tailored to the health needs of drug users.  Web content will be similar to materials and public health messages released by the NYC Department of Health and therefore, harm is not likely to arise from viewing such content.</description>
