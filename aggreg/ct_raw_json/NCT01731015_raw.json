Lung morphology and function will be acquired using conventional 1H MRI followed by 1H MRI with oxygen as a gaseous contrast agent.  For both series the subject will lie down in a supine position on the magnet bed with a standard 1H Torso coil for imaging.  Subjects are scanned on room air and then the subjects are switched from room air to 100% oxygen and exhaled O2/CO2 are monitored (Oxigraf Capnograph) until steady state is achieved (in our experience ~ 1-2 minutes).  The 100% oxygen MRI imaging is commenced (the average exposure time is usually 5-6 minutes with a maximum exposure of 15 minutes) after which the subjects are switched to room air. After steady state is achieved a second room air scan is completed.",
