Current approved treatment includes\n      intravenous trimethoprim - sulfamethoxazole (TMP / SMX) and intravenous pentamidine, which\n      are both effective in treatment of the first episode of PCP pneumonia. However, both\n      therapies have a 50 percent or greater incidence of adverse reactions. Because of serious\n      toxicities, drug treatment has had to be discontinued. Animal studies show that aerosolized\n      pentamidine (pentamidine given through inhalation) is as effective as intravenous\n      pentamidine. It is hoped that the aerosolized route will be less toxic than intravenous\n      pentamidine. The study is the first step in evaluating the delivery of aerosolized\n      pentamidine to children."

Group 2b (six patients) receives\n      aerosolized pentamidine 2 times. Group 2b will be studied only if initial dose is well\n      tolerated. Small amounts (1 - 2 cubic centimeters) of blood is taken from all groups at 40\n      minutes, and 2, 3, 7, 14, and 24 hours from the beginning of pentamidine treatment and at\n      the same time as the lung biopsy or bronchial alveolar lavage.

Bronchial\n      alveolar lavage fluid or lung tissue from biopsy will be obtained between 2 - 48 hours after\n      initiation of pentamidine treatment (optionally 10 - 24 hours post dose)."
