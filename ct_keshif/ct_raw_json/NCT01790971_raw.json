Opioids can depress the ventilator response to airway obstruction and inhibit the\n      awakening response to hypoxia and hypercarbia, resulting in central respiratory depression.\n      OSA is therefore an important risk factor for serious postoperative complications, including\n      perioperative death. While OSA is increasingly recognized as a serious perioperative\n      concern, current clinical practices are highly inconsistent with regard to the management of\n      surgical patients with OSA. Additionally, the relative safety of intrathecal opioids in this\n      patient population remains unknown."

            "textblock": "Total hip arthroplasty (THA) is one of the most common orthopedic procedures performed\n      worldwide1. It has been shown to reduce chronic pain, increase the ability to function\n      independently, and improve quality of life. With an aging and increasingly obese North\n      American population, the use of THA is increasing and is estimated to reach 600,000\n      procedures annually by the year. One of the main challenges associated with THA continues to\n      be the perioperative management of patients who are elderly or obese, and their associated\n      co-morbidities. THA is commonly performed under neuraxial anesthesia. Neuraxial anesthesia\n      has been reported to provide multiple benefits when compared to general anesthesia and/or\n      systemic analgesia including superior post-operative analgesia, reduced opioid consumption6,\n      improved rehabilitation, and reduced morbidity and mortality. The addition of opioids to the\n      neuraxial local anesthetic solution has been common practice since 1979, when morphine was\n      first shown to provide effective and prolonged analgesia after intrathecal administration.\n      For THA surgery, intrathecal morphine provides effective analgesia allowing for a reduction\n      of the dose of intrathecal local anesthetic (thus minimizing side effects), and has a marked\n      postoperative opioid-sparing effect. However, these benefits of intrathecal morphine must be\n      weighed against its risks of pruritis, nausea/vomiting, urinary retention, and, of most\n      concern, respiratory depression18."
