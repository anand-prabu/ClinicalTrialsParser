Able to understand the importance of adherence to program treatment (pirfenidone)\n             and protocol, and willing to follow all program requirements, including the\n             concomitant medication restrictions, throughout the program.\n\n             4.

Is receiving an investigational agent (defined as any drug that has not been approved\n             for marketing for any indication in the US); prior use of pirfenidone is permitted.\n\n          2. Has received fluvoxamine therapy \u2264 28 days prior to the first dose of program\n             treatment (pirfenidone) in PIPF-031, or is unable or unwilling to avoid fluvoxamine\n             for the duration of the program.\n\n          3. Has any known contraindication for the use of pirfenidone, specifically:\n\n               -  Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the drug product\n                  excipients\n\n               -  Severe hepatic impairment including end stage liver disease\n\n               -  Severe renal impairment (CrCl < 30 mL/min) including end stage renal disease\n                  requiring dialysis\n\n          4. History of cigarette smoking within 3 months prior to the completion of screening or\n             is unwilling to avoid tobacco products throughout program.\n\n          5. Known explanation for interstitial lung disease other than IPF, including but not\n             limited to radiation, drug toxicity, sarcoidosis, hypersensitivity pneumonitis,\n             bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\n             infection, viral hepatitis, and cancer.\n\n          6.

Pregnancy or lactation. Women of childbearing capacity are required to have a\n             negative serum pregnancy test before treatment and must agree to maintain highly\n             effective contraception by practicing abstinence or by using at least two methods of\n             birth control from the date of consent through the end of participation in the\n             program. If abstinence is not practiced, one of the two methods of birth control\n             should be a hormonal contraceptive (e.g., oral contraceptive and a spermicide)."
