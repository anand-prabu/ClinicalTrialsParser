  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is an exploratory study in order to determine whether the ingestion of one  type
      of protein (milk protein/CHO/Fat) vs.placebo (CHO/Fat) 2 hours before bed time results in
      the extension of the post-prandial window of anabolism during the night by increasing whole
      body protein balance as well as muscle protein fractional synthesis rate (FSR).

    <description>Muscle protein FSR (fractional synthesis rate) will be determined using primed constant infusions of [13C6] phenylalanine for 5 hours starting around from 03:00 a.m. (see flow chart attached). Whole body protein balance will be measured throughout the night using [15N]glycine (200mg) which will be orally taken with the trial product in the evening.</description>
