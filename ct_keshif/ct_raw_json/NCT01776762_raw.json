Furthermore the aim is\n      to demonstrate that this model has a positive effect on the functioning and well-being of\n      the elderly patient.\n\n      The purpose of the Follow-home-programme is to facilitate the transition of the elderly\n      patient between hospital and private home in order to follow-up on any medical, nursing- or\n      retraining-related intervention necessary to the rehabilitation of the patient. However this\n      offer does not focus on nutrition in particular. This is a problem as many elderly patients\n      are known to develop a poor nutritional status due to low appetite, disease etc. Our\n      hypothesis is that adding a systematic nutritional focus to the Follow-home intervention\n      programme will promote the rehabilitation of the elderly patient further.\n\n      The nutritional intervention in our study will focus on improving energy- and protein intake\n      and we will measure the effect on the patient's functional abilities, quality of life and\n      rate of hospital readmissions. The intervention model will be based on individualized\n      nutritional counselling by a registered dietician in the patients home."
