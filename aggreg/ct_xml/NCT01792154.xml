  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with active Wet AMD often receive intraocular Anti-VEGF injections such as Macugen,
      Lucentis and Avastin on a monthly basis for an extended period of time.  While these
      medications are very effective at controlling the Choroidal Neovascularization associated
      with this disease, the impact of monthly intravigtreal Anti-VEGF injections on the viability
      of corneal endothelial cells has yet to be fully characterized.  The availability of CESM as
      a diagnostic test that can be performed quickly and painlessly in the clinic offers a method
      of tracking corneal endothelial cell count in this patient population.
