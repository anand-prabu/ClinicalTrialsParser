        Inclusion Criteria

        Each patient must meet all of the following inclusion criteria to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. Male patients 18 years or older

          2. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma

          3. Candidate for androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) for the management of
             hormone-sensitive prostate cancer with 1 of the following clinical disease states: 1)
             advanced localized disease not suitable for primary therapy, 2) evidence of
             prostate-specific antigen (PSA) biochemical or clinical relapse following primary
             surgery or radiation therapy of curative intent, or 3) newly diagnosed metastatic
             disease that is asymptomatic or not threatening to vital organs

          4. Appropriate serum testosterone and serum PSA concentration at screening as specified
             in the protocol

          5. A body mass index (BMI) â‰¥ 18.0 at screening and/or baseline

          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status of 0 or 1 at screening
             and/or baseline.

          7. Male patients, even if surgically sterilized, who agree to practice effective barrier
             contraception or agree to practice true abstinence.

          8. Voluntary written consent must be given before performance of any study-related
             procedure not part of standard medical care, with the understanding that consent may
             be withdrawn by the patient at any time without prejudice to future medical care

          9. Suitable venous access for the study-required blood sampling, including PK and PD
             Sampling

        Exclusion Criteria

        Patients meeting any of the following exclusion criteria are not to be enrolled in the
        study:

          1. In patients with advanced, localized M0N1 or M1 disease, the presence of clinically
             significant symptoms or threat to vital organs requiring immediate GnRH/CAB therapy,
             chemotherapy, or radiotherapy

          2. Previously received ADT for more than 8 months total duration (if ADT was received
             for 8 months or less, then that ADT must have been completed at least 2 years prior
             to screening)

          3. Visceral metastases (liver or lung)

          4. Features of the patient's medical condition that may make ADT unnecessary or not
             indicated.

          5. Scheduled for additional surgical or (salvage) radiation therapy within 6 months
             after baseline evaluations

          6. History of surgical castration

          7. Diagnosis of or treatment for another malignancy within the 2 years before the first
             dose of study drug, or previously diagnosed with another malignancy and have any
             evidence of residual disease. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or carcinoma in
             situ of any type are not excluded if they have undergone complete resection

          8. Abnormal screening and/or baseline laboratory values as specified in the protocol

          9. History of any significant cardiac condition within 6 months before receiving the
             first dose of study drug

         10. ECG abnormalities as specified in the protocol

         11. Congenital long QT syndrome

         12. Current use of Class IA (eg, quinidine, procainamide) or Class III (eg, amiodarone,
             sotalol) antiarrhythmic medications

         13. Uncontrolled hypertension despite appropriate medical therapy. Patients may be
             re-screened after referral and further management of hypertension

         14. Known, previously diagnosed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, active
             chronic hepatitis B or C, life-threatening illness unrelated to prostate cancer, or
             any serious medical or psychiatric illness that could, in the investigator's opinion,
             potentially interfere with participation in this study. Specific screening for
             chronic viral illness is at the discretion of the site and/or local institutional
             review board (IRB)

         15. Treatment with any investigational products within 3 months before the first dose of
             study drug

         16. A primary family member (spouse, parent, child, or sibling of the patient) is
             involved in the conduct of the study or is a study site employee

         17. Known gastrointestinal (GI) disease or GI procedure that could interfere with the
             oral absorption or tolerance of TAK-385, including difficulty swallowing tablets

         18. Use of any medication, or food products listed in the excluded medications and
             dietary products table within 2 weeks before the first dose of study drug. Patient
             must have no history of amiodarone use in the 6 months before the first dose of
             TAK-385

         19. Admission or evidence of alcohol or drug abuse or use of illicit drugs
