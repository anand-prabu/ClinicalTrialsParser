            "textblock": "Complex aortic aneurysms are those involving the renal, and visceral, arteries that require\n      more extensive dissection, aortic clamping above the renal or mesenteric arteries, and\n      possible reconstruction of aortic branches. Complex aortic aneurysms comprise two major\n      entities, pararenal and thoracoabdominal aneurysms.\n\n      Pararenal aneurysms represent the simplest form of complex aortic aneurysms that have no\n      adequate neck between the renal arteries and the aneurysm and would require suprarenal\n      clamping for open repair.\n\n      Thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAAs) involve dilatation of the descending thoracic\n      aorta into the abdomen. The aneurysms may extend from the left subclavian artery to the\n      iliac arteries. The most common etiology is from spontaneous degeneration of the aortic wall\n      adventitia, but other causes of accelerated or secondary dilatation of the aortic wall\n      include spontaneous aortic dissection, infection, trauma, and disorders of connective\n      tissue, such as Marfan's, Turner's, and Ehlers-Danlos syndromes.\n\n      Population studies have documented approximately 5.9 to 10.4 new TAAAs per 100,000\n      person-years with nearly equal incidence in the sexes (males, 44%).The mean age at diagnosis\n      is 63 to 65 years for men and 75 to 77 years for women. A study of deaths associated with\n      TAAA captured by the Swedish National Bureau of Statistics and Swedish hospital records\n      found that almost three quarters of TAAA ruptures occurred in women, mostly aged 70 to 84\n      years. This dramatic difference in gender-associated rupture rates does not correlate with\n      the incidence of TAAAs reported from single-center reports of treated TAAAs.\n\n      The number of patients needed to treat thoracoabdominal aneurysms (TAAA) is estimated at\n      two, making the benefit for patients undergoing repair of their TAAA obvious.\n      Surgeon-modified fenestrated-branched stent-grafts (sm-FBSG) with branches for the visceral\n      vessels in patients with complex aortic conditions could represent a therapeutic option for\n      high-risk patients unfit for open surgery.  Open surgery for complex aneurysms of the\n      abdominal aorta (AAA) including thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA) has greatly\n      developed over the past decades to provide patients adequate management with good functional\n      results and reduced perioperative morbidity and mortality.  However, despite much\n      advancement in preoperative evaluation and perioperative care of patients with\n      thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysms (TAAA), open surgical repair of TAAAs remains a formidable\n      challenge for the vascular surgeon.  In a recent meta-analysis by Piazza and Ricotta of\n      7,833 patients who underwent open surgical repair of TAAA between the years 2000 and 2010,\n      the overall risk of death within 30 days was 7%, while in-hospital mortality was 10%. The\n      30-day mortality was 5% for elective cases, with significant associated morbidity ranging\n      from a 7.5% incidence of spinal cord ischemia, to 19% rate of renal failure and 36% rate of\n      pulmonary dysfunction. The 30-day mortality for open repair of ruptured TAAA has been\n      reported as high as 40%, with an average of 19% in this meta-analysis.\n\n      Many high-risk patients with aneurysms of the abdominal aorta (AAA) and who have significant\n      co-morbidities will not be good candidates for elective open surgery.  Endovascular aneurysm\n      repair has been shown to be an effective alternative in treating uncomplicated infrarenal\n      and thoracic aneurysms in both the elective and urgent setting, yet there is limited\n      experience with this technology in complex conditions.  Fenestrated grafts have been\n      developed as a minimally invasive treatment for patients with complex aortic aneurysms who\n      are unfit for traditional open surgery. However, construction of these fenestrated grafts\n      requires that they are custom-made to fit the specific anatomical requirements of each\n      patient, and can take up to 12 weeks to manufacture. Restricted access to investigational\n      devices and delays for device customization limit the treatment with these endografts to a\n      small group of patients with relatively stable aneurysms.    Particularly in urgent cases,\n      this time frame is not acceptable."
