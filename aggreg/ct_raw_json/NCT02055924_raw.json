This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory expansion phase in 3\n      groups of 12 patients each (Group A, Group B and Group C).\n\n      During Part 1 Dose Escalation, the \"3+3\" design will be applied. Three doses of ibrutinib\n      (280, 420 and 560 mg) will be examined sequentially in each cohort by the Dose Escalation\n      Committee. Dose escalation will begin at dose level 1 = 420 mg.\n\n      The dose escalation will be performed for two types of associations in two separate groups :\n\n        -  Group A : ibrutinib + R-DHAP\n\n        -  Group B : ibrutinib + R-DHAOx This dose escalation will be followed by an exploratory\n           expansion phase in the same 2 groups plus a third one including only mantle cell\n           lymphoma (MCL) in first line patients: group C. Patients included in the Group C will\n           receive ibrutinib in combination with R-DHAP or R-DHAOx according to the choice of the\n           local investigator at time of inclusion of each patient."
