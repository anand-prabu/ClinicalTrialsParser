This trial will attempt to show the efficacy of the Toad Brace and is based\n      on the hypothesis that the Toad brace completely offloads the foot and hastens healing rates\n      of diabetic ulcers. The trial will randomize 74 patients with diabetic pedal ulcers to the\n      Toad Brace or conventional therapy.  . Quantitative assessment of ulcer rate healing rates\n      will be determined clinically and by blinded, computer-assisted planimetry of digital images\n      over a 12 week period.  The pressure on the plantar surface will be measured via a pressure\n      sensor in a subset of patients. The trials will attempt to show markedly reduced pressure on\n      the plantar surface and significantly higher ulcer healing rates with using the Toad Brace."
