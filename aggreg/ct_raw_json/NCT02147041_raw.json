            "textblock": "Obesity has become a noticeable and worldwide public health problem recently. According to\n      the WHO survey in 2005, 1.6 billion and 400 million adults were found overweight and obese,\n      respectively. In Taiwan, there are more than 30% found overweight in the national survey in\n      2009. Compare with the ones done in 1999 and 2005, a rising trend of the prevalence of\n      obesity is found. Furthermore, the incidence and prevalence of obesity are also increasing\n      worldwide, especially in the developing and newly industrialized nations. In addition,\n      obesity is related to some chronic diseases, like diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia and\n      cardiovascular diseases, which are major lethal health concerns in Taiwan and many\n      developing countries. Taken together, obesity emerges as an important issue lately. The aim\n      of the study is to evaluate the therapeutic effect and safety of green tea extract on\n      demographic characteristics and obesity-related hormone peptide of obese women and to\n      establish an obesity Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) syndromes questionnaire, which will\n      undergo well assessing of reliability and validity. Second, we intent to utilize the TCM\n      syndromes and Quality of Life (SF-12, WHO) questionnaire to 200 obesity women for the\n      correlation analysis of TCM syndromes, obesity related hormone peptides and quality of life.\n      The results of this study are expected to assess the effect and safety of green tea extract\n      on obese women and improve the scientific diagnosis of TCM with a quantitative measurement\n      by this questionnaire."
