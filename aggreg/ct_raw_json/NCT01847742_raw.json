Randomly selected refugees will be assessed through\n      MINI PLUS for the diagnose of PTSD. Eighty refugees with PTSD will be randomly allocated to\n      either 7 sessions EMDR or wait-list control group.Symptoms of PTSD (MINI PLUS, HTQ, IES-R)\n      and depression and anxiety (BDI, HSCL)will be assessed at pre- and post-treatment and 4\n      weeks follow-up.\n\n      However, to our knowledge this is one of the first intervention studies which will be\n      conducted in a refugee camp. Therefore we expect to have some practical and logical\n      problems. In order to see the feasibility and efficacy of EMDR among Syrian refugees, before\n      the main study we aim to run a pilot study with less participants. In the pilot we will\n      assess the posttraumatic stress symptoms with Impact of Event Scale-Revised (IES-R) and the\n      depressive symptoms through Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II)."
