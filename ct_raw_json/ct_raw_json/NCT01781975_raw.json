Although exogenous insulin is widely available, it is not possible for affected\n      individuals to consistently achieve euglycemia with current technology, and thus they are at\n      risk for devastating long-term complications. This phase II study is designed to evaluate\n      the safety and efficacy of imatinib mesylate as a novel therapy for new-onset T1DM. Imatinib\n      is a first-in-class tyrosine kinase inhibitor.\n\n      This study will explore the potential role of short-term therapy with imatinib to induce\n      tolerance and possibly lead to a durable long-term remission of T1DM."
