Pain will be assessed using the self-report Faces pain scale revised (FPS-R).  We\n      hypothesize that oral morphine will result in significantly lower pain scores on the Faces\n      Pain Scale Revised (FPS-R) compared to ibuprofen. It is hoped that the results of this trial\n      will create a new option for post-operative pain management in children."
