The investigators would like to contribute to this sort of\n      research, but focus on what effect music therapy has on a patient's cognitive recovery after\n      undergoing epilepsy surgery.  Although research exists regarding music therapy on memory and\n      communication, its overall effect on this patient population is unclear.\n\n      The Dell Children's Epilepsy program hopes that this research project on memory and\n      communication will have a positive effect on their patients with epilepsy."
