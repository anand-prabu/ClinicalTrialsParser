  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilation used to support the sick newborn infant is associated with many
      complications including the development of chronic lung disease. Limiting prolonged invasive
      ventilation remains an important strategy to decrease lung injury and prevent chronic lung
      disease. Currently, there is no objective measure available to predict readiness for removal
      of the endotracheal tube (&quot;extubation&quot;) and discontinuing mechanical ventilation in this
      fragile population.

      The investigators propose to predict extubation success by evaluating the electrical
      activity of the diaphragm (Edi), which provides important information about the &quot;drive&quot; to
      breathing coming from the brain and the function of the diaphragm, two essential factors
      determining extubation readiness and success.

      In this observational study, very low birth weight preterm infants with RDS who require
      mechanical ventilation in first 24 hour of life will be recruited. A size appropriate
      nasogastric tube with multiple array of electrodes (Edi catheter) will be inserted in each
      eligible infant.  The average EdI (Edi_avg) and maximum Edi with breath occlusion (Edi_max)
      will be measured during mechanical ventilation just before extubation and then up to 3 days
      after extubation. All infants will be extubated to non-invasive positive pressure
      ventilation (NIPPV or CPAP) delivered through nasal cannula

      The specific aim is to determine whether there is a relationship between measures of Edi
      (Edi_avg and Edi_max with breath occlusion) taken just before extubation and the extubation
      success in a sample of preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). We
      hypothesize that  Edi-avg and Edi-max of infants with successful extubation will be
      significantly different from the infants who fail extubation
