    <textblock>
      This study will assess middle childhood outcomes of an intervention for neglecting parents
      that was implemented in the children's infancy.  We expect that parents who received the
      Attachment and Biobehavioral Catch-up Intervention in infancy will be more nurturing and
      will follow children's lead more in middle childhood than parents who received a control
      intervention, and that children will show better outcomes in inhibitory control, emotion
      regulation, and peer relations than children of parents who received the control
      intervention.

      Children were randomly assigned to receive the ABC intervention or a control intervention
      (DEF) in infancy.  These two groups, plus a group of low-risk children, will be studied in
      middle childhood.  Of interest will be differences in parent and child outcomes that result
      from the intervention.

      Hypothesis 1: Neglected children whose parents received the ABC intervention and low-risk
      comparison children will show better inhibitory control than neglected children whose
      parents received the DEF intervention.

      Hypothesis 2: Children in the ABC intervention condition and low-risk comparison children
      will show better emotion regulation than children in the DEF condition.

      Hypothesis 3: Children in the ABC intervention condition and comparison children will show
      less reactive aggression and less hostile attributional bias than children in the DEF
      condition.

      Hypothesis 4: Children in the ABC condition and comparison children will show more normative
      cortisol production than children in the DEF condition.

      Although we expect that sustained changes in parenting are critical for sustained changes in
      child behaviors, several alternative models will be tested.  First, it is possible that when
      parents change as a result of the intervention in a child's infancy, there are positive
      outcomes for children regardless of whether the changes in parenting are sustained. If this
      is the case, early parenting will mediate the effects of the intervention when controlling
      for later parenting.  Second, if concurrent parenting is what is critical to child
      functioning, current parenting (i.e., when child is 8-10 years old) will mediate
      intervention effects on child outcomes when controlling for early parenting. Third,
      longitudinal modeling of both parent and child behaviors allows for analysis of cross-lagged
      associations using structural equation modeling. Such modeling can examine concurrent and
      transactional associations between parent and child.  We can also examine associations
      between change at behavioral and biological levels.

      Longitudinal modeling will be used to examine models of change in parenting behaviors and
      how those influence child outcomes.
