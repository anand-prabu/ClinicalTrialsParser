TIDE will target energy balance behaviors to prevent the onset of obesity in\n      children. The system will be used by physicians and parents/primary care givers in pediatric\n      primary care practices with the aim of improving parent-pediatrician interactions related to\n      counseling and anticipatory guidance on energy balance behaviors. The aim of this study is\n      to develop a one-two page, paper-pencil proxy questionnaire that is used to query the parent\n      of the child in the waiting room and assesses topic areas related to energy balance\n      behaviors (EBB). The questionnaire will be referred to as the energy balance behaviors\n      questionnaire (EBB-Q). This will require focus groups, cognitive testing of the\n      questionnaire, and survey administration."
