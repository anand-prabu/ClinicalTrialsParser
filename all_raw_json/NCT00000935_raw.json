Transplant rejection is more likely among highly sensitized patients\n      than in patients who are not highly sensitized.

However, many patients do not receive this treatment due to immune sensitization to\n      HLA antigens. IVIG has been shown to somewhat reduce anti-HLA antibody activity. By blocking\n      this activity, IVIG may make transplants more feasible and increase graft survival in\n      transplant recipients.\n\n      Patients are randomized to receive IV infusion of either 2 g/kg (maximum dose 180 g) IVIG\n      10% S/D (Gamimune-N, 10%, manufactured by Bayer) or placebo (0.1% human albumin,\n      manufactured by Bayer) at time of dialysis at study entry and monthly for 3 months. If\n      patients have not received a transplant at 1 year, they receive a \"booster\" dose of IVIG or\n      placebo; patients receive another booster at 24 months if transplant still has not occurred.\n      If transplant occurs, patients receive 2 g/kg (up to 180 g) IVIG or placebo monthly for 4\n      months, beginning at time of transplant. Before and after initiation of IVIG/albumin placebo\n      treatment, specific immune parameters, including panel reactive antibodies (PRA) levels,\n      MLR, serum inhibition of MLR, and cytokine gene transcription in the MLR, and AECA levels\n      are measured. Outcomes studied include time on dialysis and graft survival rates."
