    <description>The EnligHTN™ Renal Denervation System is designed to deliver radiofrequency (RF) energy to the renal nerves to achieve targeted denervation. The system consists of the EnligHTN™ RF Ablation Generator (generator), the EnligHTN™ Renal Artery Ablation Catheter (ablation catheter), and the EnligHTN™ Guiding Catheter (optional).</description>
