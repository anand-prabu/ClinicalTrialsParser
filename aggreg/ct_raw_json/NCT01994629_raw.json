Previous confirmed or suspected disease caused by N. meningitidis.\n\n          2. Previously exposed to clinically proven meningococcal disease or clinical bacterial\n             meningitis without further microbiologic characterization, i.e. possible\n             meningococcal disease.\n\n          3. Previously immunized with a meningococcal vaccine or vaccine containing meningococcal\n             antigen(s) (licensed or investigational).\n\n          4.

Received or planning to receive any vaccines within 14 days before and 30 days after\n             administration of the study vaccine (Exceptions: Injectable influenza vaccine may be\n             administered up to 14 days prior to study vaccination and at least 14 days after\n             study vaccination).\n\n          6. Major congenital defect or a serious chronic disease.\n\n          7.

Requiring chronic administration (defined as more than 14 days) of immunosuppressants\n             or other immune-modifying drugs within six months prior to the study vaccination.\n             (For corticosteroids, this means prednisone, or equivalent, \u2265 0.5 mg/kg/day. Inhaled\n             and topical steroids are allowed).\n\n          9. Receipt of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products within six months prior to study\n             vaccination or who have administration planned during the study period.\n\n         10. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition, based on\n             medical history and physical examination.\n\n         11. Any bleeding disorder which is considered as a contraindication to intramuscular\n             injection.\n\n         12.
