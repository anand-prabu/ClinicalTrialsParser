      Regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells (Treg) derived from the thymus and/or peripheral tissues have
      been demonstrated to broadly control T cell reactivity (14). Importantly, Tregs have been
      shown to control immune responsiveness to alloantigens and significantly contribute to
      operational tolerance in transplantation models (15, 16). However, there have been limited
      efforts to harness the therapeutic potential of directly isolated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells for
      controlling graft rejection and inducing transplantation tolerance, such as for kidney
      transplants. In order for CD4+CD25+ Treg cells to be used as a clinical treatment, the
      following cell properties could be necessary: ex vivo generation of sufficient numbers of
      cells, migration in vivo to sites of antigenic reactivity, ability to suppress rejection in
      an alloantigen-specific manner, and survival/expansion after infusion for a critical, but
      currently unknown, period of time. Our published work and that of other investigators has
      demonstrated 1) the feasibility of expanding Treg ex vivo, 2) the ability of these cells to
      downregulate allogeneic immune responses in vitro, and 3) the efficacy of Treg for
      prevention of allograft rejection in animal models (15,16). We have developed strategies for
      the ex vivo expansion of naturally occurring human Tregs (nTregs) that allow for the
      practical employment of this cellular therapy in the clinic. Our central hypothesis is that
      sufficient human nTreg can be expanded ex vivo and used to both prevent renal transplant
      rejection and facilitate the reduction and subsequent withdrawal of drug-based
      immunosuppression. This study will allow for us to define the safety of Treg adoptive
      cellular transfer (TRACT) in living donor renal transplant recipients that draws upon our
      extensive preclinical experience with expanded Tregs, as well as our recognized clinical
      expertise with designing immunosuppressive regimens compatible with this type of therapeutic
      cell transfer.

    <textblock>
      Transplantation is the treatment of choice for most causes of end stage renal disease.(1, 2)
      However, without some modification of the recipient's immune system all allografts succumb
      to rejection. To prevent this, patients must take immunosuppressive drugs for life,
      generally a combination of steroids, a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI), such as cyclosporine or
      tacrolimus, and an antiproliferative agent (azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil or
      sirolimus).(3-6)  Induction with a brief course of an anti-T lymphocyte antibody preparation
      (daclizumab, basiliximab, muromonab, alemtuzumab, polyclonal anti-thymocyte globulin) is
      also used in approximately 70% of U.S. transplant centers.

      Dependence on immunosuppression tempers the substantial benefit obtained from
      transplantation (1-13). The typical regimens are relatively complex and expensive. More
      importantly, they increase the risk of opportunistic infection and malignancy, and have many
      non-immune side effects that hamper their tolerability. Specifically, CNIs are nephrotoxic,
      a side effect of significant concern in renal transplantation. Steroids exacerbate
      osteoporosis and hyperlipidemia, and cause avascular osteonecrosis. Both classes of agent
      worsen glucose tolerance and hypertension, and are associated with cosmetic effects causing
      non-compliance. As such, methods of transplantation that lessen the dependence on chronic
      immunosuppression stand to reduce the risk and expense of transplantation. They must,
      however, also prevent rejection. Development of alternate therapies that help to minimize
      the need for lifelong immunosuppression, or eliminate entirely the need for drugs through
      the induction of tolerance, are therefore of great interest.

      Regulatory CD4+CD25+ T cells  (Treg) derived from the thymus and/or peripheral tissues have
      been demonstrated to broadly control  T cell reactivity (14). Importantly, Tregs have been
      shown to control immune responsiveness to alloantigens and significantly contribute to
      operational tolerance in transplantation models (15, 16).  However, there have been limited
      efforts to harness the therapeutic potential of directly isolated CD4+CD25+ Treg cells for
      controlling graft rejection and inducing transplantation tolerance, such as for kidney
      transplants. In order for CD4+CD25+ Treg cells to be used as a clinical treatment, the
      following cell properties could be necessary: ex vivo generation of sufficient numbers of
      cells, migration in vivo to sites of antigenic reactivity, ability to suppress rejection in
      an alloantigen-specific manner, and survival/expansion after infusion for a critical, but
      currently unknown, period of time. Our published work and that of other investigators has
      demonstrated 1) the feasibility of expanding Treg ex vivo, 2) the ability of these cells to
      downregulate allogeneic immune responses in vitro, and 3) the efficacy of Treg for
      prevention of allograft rejection in animal models (15,16).  We have developed strategies
      for the ex vivo expansion of naturally occurring human Tregs (nTregs) that allow for the
      practical employment of this cellular therapy in the clinic.  Our central hypothesis is that
      sufficient human nTreg can be expanded ex vivo and used to both prevent renal transplant
      rejection and facilitate the reduction and subsequent withdrawal of drug-based
      immunosuppression.   This study will allow for us to define the safety of Treg adoptive

      extensive preclinical experience with expanded Tregs, as well as our recognized clinical
      expertise with designing immunosuppressive regimens compatible with this type of therapeutic
