Determination of skin types was\n             based on sunburn and tanning histories, as well as subjects' opinions of their\n             responses to the first 30 to 45 minutes of sun exposure.\n\n          -  Sexually active females of childbearing potential who agreed to use a medically\n             acceptable method of contraception while receiving protocol-assigned product. A woman\n             of childbearing potential was defined as one who was biologically capable of becoming\n             pregnant, including perimenopausal women who were less than 2 years from their last\n             menses. Acceptable contraceptive methods included the following:\n\n          -  Hormonal contraception, including oral, injectable, or implantable methods started at\n             least 2 months prior to screening. If hormonal contraception was started less than 2\n             months prior to screening, then a form of non-hormonal contraception was to have been\n             added until the third continuous month of hormonal contraception was completed.\n\n          -  Two forms of non-hormonal contraception, including intrauterine devices or properly\n             used barrier methods (eg, male or female condoms, diaphragm, or cervical cap).\n             Subjects with surgical sterilization, including tubal ligation or partner's\n             vasectomy, were to have used a form of non-hormonal contraception.
