  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine whether buprenorphine can be at least as effective
      as other opioid medications in relieving chronic pain in patients who suffer from dependence
      on their opioid medications, while patients simultaneously  experience progressive decline
      of pain along with absence of opioid withdrawal symptoms and improved quality of life.

      The study will utilize sublingual buprenorphine for the treatment of chronic pain patients
      with co-occurring opioid dependence.  Adult male and female chronic pain patients with
      co-occurring opioid dependence/disorder, being treated at MMC will be enrolled in a home
      induction procedure. Subjects will be switched from their current opioid pain medication to
      buprenorphine/naloxone to assess whether buprenorphine is at least as effective, if not more
      effective, as other opioid medications in controlling their pain while simultaneously
      improving their psychological distress, functional status, and other aspects of patients'
      lives. We will utilize a home induction procedure, and maintain subjects on this oral
      medication for a duration of 6 months. During this period
