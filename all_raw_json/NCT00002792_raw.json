Combining bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation\n      with chemotherapy may allow the doctor to give higher doses of chemotherapy drugs and kill\n      more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combination chemotherapy plus either\n      bone marrow or peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients with\n      myeloproliferative disorders."

Patients then receive allogeneic\n      bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells on day 0. Patients registered on protocol\n      FHCRC-1106.00 randomized to stem cell transplant receive unmodified G-CSF-mobilized stem\n      cells from an HLA-identical donor.\n\n      Patients receive cyclosporine/methotrexate or tacrolimus/methotrexate as prophylaxis for\n      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). Patients receiving marrow from unrelated donors are\n      eligible for appropriate GVHD prophylaxis studies.\n\n      Patients are followed at 6 and 12 months after transplant.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20 patients will be accrued for this study over\n      approximately 3.5 years."
