The diagnostic performance and\n      reproducibility of FFRct as well as the qualitative and quantitative correlation between\n      FFRct and the regional coronary blood flow will be examined."

            "textblock": "Coronary Computed Tomography Angiography (cCTA) is a non-invasive imaging modality that\n      provides high-resolution images of coronary lesions. cCTA shows good diagnostic performance\n      in detecting or excluding coronary artery stenoses, but the severity of the lesions is often\n      overestimated. With invasive coronary angiography (ICA) the hemodynamic consequences of\n      obstructive lesions can be estimated using Fractional Flow Reserve measurement (FFR). There\n      is a good correlation between FFR and non-invasive ischemia tests such as stress\n      echocardiography, exercise tolerance test or Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography\n      (SPECT). Measurement of FFR during ICA represents the \"gold standard\" for assessment of the\n      hemodynamic significance of coronary artery lesions. The major disadvantage of FFR is that\n      it is an invasive measurement, and consequently there is a risk of complications. Recently a\n      non-invasive method to determine FFR has been developed (FFRct). FFRct is performed using\n      standard cCTA images, and is based on computational fluid dynamics. The hemodynamic\n      consequence of stenotic lesions is determined at rest and under simulated condition of\n      hyperemia.\n\n      Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is divided into STEMI and NSTEMI on the basis of ECG\n      changes. In Denmark patients with STEMI are treated with primary percutaneous intervention\n      (PPCI) of the culprit lesion. Any non-culprit lesions are typically assessed with FFR after\n      3-4 weeks.\n\n      Even though the rate of complications during ICA with FFR is low, these complications can be\n      severe. Also the procedure is quite resource demanding. Thus it would be desirable if it in\n      these patients could be non-invasively evaluated whether further revascularisation is\n      indicated."
