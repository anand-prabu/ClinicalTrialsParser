Treatment courses repeat every 2 weeks in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      The maximum tolerated dose for part I is defined as the dose level at which 33% of patients\n      experience dose limiting toxicity.\n\n        -  Part II: Patients receive the same treatment schedule as part I. Three patients with\n           CNS tumors are entered at the dose of CCI-779 determined to be the MTD in Part I. At\n           least 3 patients are entered at each dose level in part II.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 20 patients will be accrued for part I for this study\n      within 8 months, and 12 patients will be accrued for part II within 7 months."
