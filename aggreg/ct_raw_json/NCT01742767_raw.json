In the standard regimen the cisplatinum dose is 75 mg/m2 on day 1 of\n      a 21-day cycle. Due to the high platinum-dose patients do need a strict hyperhydration and\n      often have to be hospitalized for survey. Split-dose cisplatinum with two administrations on\n      Day 1 and 8 of a 21-day-cycle has already been administered in other platin-containing\n      chemotherapy regimens (cis/gem cis/nav cis/paclitaxel cis/docetaxel) with favourable\n      toxicity profiles and generally with an excellent patient compliance."

            "textblock": "There is a current need to develop a split-dose cisplatinum regimen in combination with\n      pemetrexed with high efficacy, excellent treatment compliance, administration convenience\n      and the possibility to open up easier outpatient administration of the chemotherapy\n      protocol. Dosing of cisplatinum at 40 mg/m2 d 1 and day 8 seems to be very effective and\n      useful for this strategy. The current trial will address this issue within a prospective\n      randomized phase-II trial. Treatment will be given on day 1 and 8 in the split-dose arm. A\n      comparator arm of the current three-weekly higher cisplatinum schedule will be added to this\n      study. For evaluation of this strategy observation of the toxicity/efficacy ratio within\n      this trial will be of major importance. Efficacy will be analyzed by objective response\n      rate, symptom control and life-quality. Toxicity will be looked at with treatment toxicity,\n      treatment compliance and adherence to protocol."

Prior radiotherapy\n                  must be completed at least 4 weeks before study enrollment.  Patients must have\n                  recovered from the acute toxic effects of the treatment prior to study\n                  enrollment.\n\n               8. Patient must understand and sign an informed consent document before the start\n                  of specific protocol procedures.\n\n               9. A pretreatment FFPE tumour biopsy must be available for central biomarker\n                  analysis. If consented by the patient and clinically feasible, a fresh\n                  pretreatment biopsy is obtained and submitted for central biomarker analysis.\n\n              10. Female patients with childbearing potential must use highly effective methods of\n                  contraception (combined oral contraceptives, hormon-releasing intrauterine\n                  contraceptive device, hormonal contraceptive implants, hormonal contraceptive\n                  injectables) or have sexual intercourse with a vasectomised partner only during\n                  and for 6 months after the study and their pregnancy test must be negative\n                  within 7 days prior to study enrollment.\n\n                  A female subject is considered to be of childbearing potential unless she is age\n                  \u2265 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for \u2265 2 year or unless she is surgically\n                  sterile.\n\n                  Male patients must agree to use condoms during the study and for 6 months after\n                  the study if their partner is of childbearing potential and does not use highly\n                  effective method of contraception.\n\n              11. Estimated life expectancy of 12 weeks\n\n              12. Patient compliance and geographic proximity that allow adequate follow up.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients will be excluded from the study if they meet any of the following criteria:\n\n               1. Active participation in other clinical studies or treatment with any\n                  experimental drug within 30 days prior to study enrollment or during study\n                  participation.\n\n               2. Patients with known somatic activating mutations of EGFR, as these patients\n                  should be offered EGFR- tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI) treatment as\n                  first-line therapy. Detection of EGFR mutations and additional somatic mutations\n                  with relation to treatment will be performed centrally at the\n                  Universit\u00e4tsklinikum Essen. In case immediate treatment initiation is required\n                  for medical reasons (such as superior vena cava syndrome, severely symptomatic\n                  disease) patients may be enrolled before results from EGFR testing are\n                  available. As EGFR-TKI treatment is equally effective in second-line therapy,\n                  such patients may remain on study treatment if a clinical benefit is derived.\n\n               3. Peripheral neuropathy of \u00b3CTCAE Grade 1\n\n               4. Inability to comply with protocol or study procedures\n\n               5. A serious concomitant systemic disorder that, in the opinion of the\n                  investigator, would compromise the patient's ability to complete the study.\n\n               6. A serious cardiac condition, such as myocardial infarction within 6 months prior\n                  to study enrollment, symptomatic coronary artery disease, cardiac arrhythmia, or\n                  other heart disease, as defined by the New York Heart Association Class III or\n                  IV (functional capacity)\n\n               7. Second primary malignancy that is clinically detectable at the time of\n                  consideration for study enrollment\n\n               8. Documented brain metastases unless the patient has completed successful local\n                  therapy for central nervous system metastases and has been off of\n                  corticosteroids for at least 4 weeks before enrollment. Brain imaging is\n                  required in symptomatic patients to rule out brain metastases,but is not\n                  required in asymptomatic patients\n\n               9. The effect of third space fluid, such as pleural effusion and ascites, on\n                  pemetrexed is unknown. In patients with clinically significant third space\n                  fluid, consideration should be given to draining the effusion prior to\n                  pemetrexed administration.\n\n              10. Significant weight loss (that is 10%) over the previous 6 weeks before study\n                  entry\n\n              11. Significant hearing function impairment, especially high-frequency hearing\n                  function impairment\n\n              12. Any active or uncontrolled infection\n\n              13. Concurrent administration of any other antitumour therapy\n\n              14. Inability to interrupt aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents,\n                  other than an aspirin dose <1.3 grams per day, for a 5-day period (8-day period\n                  for long-acting agents, such as piroxicam)\n\n              15. Inability or unwillingness to take folic acid or vitamin B12 supplementation\n\n              16. Inability to take corticosteroids\n\n              17. Hypersensitivity to cisplatinum or to any other platinum compound\n\n              18. Hypersensitivity to pemetrexed or to any of the excipients of ALIMTA\u00ae\n\n              19. Pregnant or breast-feeding patient\n\n              20. Yellow fever vaccination within the 30 days previous to study entry."
