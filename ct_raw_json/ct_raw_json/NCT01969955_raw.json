And albumin-bound paclitaxel was characterized with high tolerated\n      doses with greater efficacy, and with greater concentration in tumor tissue compared with\n      normal tissues. A multicenter randomized controled trial (coded as CA031) showed that\n      nab-paclitaxel in combination with carboplatin had higher response rate than traditional\n      paclitaxel plus carboplatin, especially in squamous lung cancer. This is a single center,\n      non-randomized, open-label Phase II clinical study to investigate the efficacy and\n      tolerability of nab-paclitaxel monotherapy in previously treated advanced or metastatic\n      squamous lung cancer after failure of platinum-based doublet therapy."
