Researchers in the United States, Sweden,\n      Australia, and Denmark will collect clinical information and blood samples from over 8,000\n      individuals with anorexia nervosa and individuals without an eating disorder.\n\n      ANGI represents a global effort to detect genetic variation that contributes to this\n      potentially life-threatening illness. The goal of the research study is to transform\n      knowledge about the causes of eating disorders to work toward greater understanding and\n      ultimately a cure.\n\n      If you have suffered from anorexia nervosa at any point in your life, you can help us\n      achieve this goal. Your contribution would include a brief interview and a blood sample. If\n      you have never had anorexia nervosa, but still want to contribute, we invite your\n      participation as well."

Once the sample is drawn, participants will place it in a box and\n      contact FedEx for pick up. There is no cost for the FedEx shipment. Participants will also\n      fill out the reimbursement form and send it and the receipt to our office. Investigators\n      will reimburse participants for the cost of the blood draw.
