            "textblock": "In the last two decades, remarkable technological progress has been made with the\n      development of continuous glucose sensors, miniature devices, implantable pumps and sensors\n      and wireless communications, interest in the closed-loop insulin delivery was revived.\n\n      Control trails that evaluate the clinical benefits of continuous glucose sensor have shown\n      improved HbA1c with no significant increase in sever hypoglycemia, trend towards lower\n      hypoglycemic episodes although not significant and no significant change in sever\n      hypoglycemia. One of the main drawbacks of continuous glucose sensor is noncompliant of the\n      patient, the flow of information and the need to act accordingly makes this devise a burden\n      for some patients. Theoretically subcutaneous insulin pumps and glucose sensors attached to\n      an artificial pancreas in a closed-loop system can mimic the activity of functioning\n      pancreatic beta cells, with strict control of blood glucose levels. Such a system may also\n      offer an opportunity to free the patients from the daily burden of dealing with their\n      diabetes.\n\n      Study Objectives are to determine the safety and efficacy of using the MDLAP system to\n      automatically control overnight blood glucose in type 1 diabetic patients. Overnight glucose\n      control time defined as the time range between bedtime (21:00-23:00 PM) and awaking time\n      (7:00 AM).\n\n      This is a randomized prospective single blind trial to evaluate blood glucose control\n      overnight under closed-loop insulin delivery with MD-Logic Artificial Pancreas (MDLAP)\n      system in patients with type 1 diabetes, being conducted in: Tel Aviv, Israel, Ljubljana,\n      Slovenia and Hannover, Germany; 75 eligible patients will be enrolled.Each subject will\n      participate in four consecutive over nights under closed-loop with MDLAP, and four\n      additional over nights under regular sensor augmented pump therapy at home with a washout\n      period of 10 \u00b1 3 days between arms."
