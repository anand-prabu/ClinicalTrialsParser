  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: To validate our previously developed model of risk factors for diagnosis of
      eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), and to assess the utility of serum levels of biomarkers in
      diagnosis and monitoring of treatment of EoE. Participants: A total of 180 adult outpatients
      (60 with EoE and 120 without EoE) who are referred for upper endoscopy. Procedures: This is
      a prospective cohort study.

      Patients will be compared with newly diagnosed EoE to non-EoE controls, obtain baseline
      measures, reassess EoE patients after treatment, and also reassess untreated controls. Data
      collection will include questionnaire results, blood collection, and tissue collection
      (esophageal biopsies performed during upper endoscopy per pre-specified protocol). Blood
      will be analyzed for the presence of the candidate biomarkers.

    <description>To validate our model of clinical, endoscopic, and histopathologic risk factors for diagnosis of EoE by calculating the EoE risk score which includes subject's age, allergic conditions, endoscopic findings, and eosinophil count. Subject's EoE risk scores will be compared between EoE patients and two non-EoE control groups: patients with dysphagia and patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) who are not responsive to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy.</description>

        The source of the study population will be patients aged 18-80 presenting at the
        gastrointestinal (Gl) Endoscopy Clinic at UNC-Chapel Hill for elective upper endoscopy
        with a primary or secondary indication of dysphagia and/or reflux symptoms. Any patient
        undergoing endoscopy with dysphagia and/or reflux symptoms is eligible to participate in
        the study.
