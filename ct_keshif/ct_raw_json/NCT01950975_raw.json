Indeed, as this mosaicism is a consequence of a genetic event\n      occurring at an early stage of embryogenesis, it would be possible to confirm the sporadic\n      nature of the observed disorder and therefore to predict a very low or even negligible risk\n      of recurrence for the couple concerned. For the affected infant, the risk for his/her own\n      offspring will be assessed according to the nature of the genetic anomaly discovered. For\n      medical practice, investigators hope that this study will lead to a clearer definition of\n      the screening modalities for mosaicism in the disorders concerned. In particular, they hope\n      to determine whether or not it is possible to dispense with a skin biopsy, which is more\n      invasive than a blood sample."
