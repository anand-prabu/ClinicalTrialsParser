Methods Sixty\n      female subjects, selected according to the inclusion/exclusion criteria, suffering from\n      unilateral TMD in remission were assigned to MTS, STS or untreatment. Pre- and\n      post-treatment differences in the sEMG activity of temporalis anterior (TA), masseter (MM),\n      digastric (DA) and sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM), as well in the interocclusal distance\n      (ID), within group were tested using the Wilcoxon test, while differences among groups were\n      assessed by Kruskal-Wallis test; the level of significance was set at p \u2264 0.01."
