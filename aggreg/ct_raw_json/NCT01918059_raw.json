Subjects will be followed\n      in an outpatient setting at 1 week and 1 month post-repair at which time standardized\n      photographs will be taken and later assessed using two standardized appearance assessment\n      tools: Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and Hollander Wound Evaluation Score (HWES)."
