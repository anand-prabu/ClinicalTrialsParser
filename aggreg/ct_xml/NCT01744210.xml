  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Historically, transthoracic Doppler echocardiography has been unable to provide
      interpretable data of blood flow within the lung parenchyma because of air attenuation of
      Doppler signals.  Recently, a transthoracic Doppler system known as the Sonara/tek
      Transcranial Doppler (TCD) System has been developed that can identify parenchymal pulmonary
      blood flow (PPBF) signals. The ability to non-invasively collect information regarding the
      pulmonary aspect of the cardio-pulmonary system may provide valuable information and new
      insights into the structural and functional characteristics of the lung parenchyma and
      vasculature in health and disease states.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This new system was previously studied among 31 healthy volunteers and one subject with
      atrial fibrillation.1 Pulsed spectral Doppler signals were obtained over the chest wall
      using a signal processing and algorithm package in conjunction with a non-imaging Doppler
      device coupled with an electrocardiogram. Clear reproducible lung Doppler signals (LDS)
      originating from different elements and phases of cardiac activity that generate mechanical
      waves which propagate throughout the lung were expressed in pulsatile changes in ultrasound
      reflections.

      After the completion of the first 25 patients in our pilot study, we have received some
      valuable information.  After assessing patients with CHF and pulmonary hypertension, we
      identified signals particular to the CHF group. There were unique features that were never
      observed in the normal patients. On top of the regular Lung Doppler signals seen in normal
      patients, high velocity &quot;disorganized&quot; variable signals that were not synchronous with the
      heart beat, but rather sometimes with respiration were observed. We believe that the signals
      may represent popping open of small bronchi surrounded by &quot;water filled&quot; parenchyma. These
      events that generate very strong reflector like signals may represent the movement of fluid
      at the blood vessel-alveolar air junction.

                  B. Compensated CHF: patients with significant CHF (NYHA II-IV) who are well
                  controlled and without evidence of pulmonary congestion or pulmonary edema on
                  admission.

                  C. Non-CHF controls: patients without CHF and without any of the following:
                  pulmonary hypertension, any known pulmonary disease, uncontrolled hypertension.
