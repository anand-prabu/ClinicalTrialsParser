Three modes were created for each exercise:\n           assisted active, active and resisted active executions. Besides explanatory text, there\n           were illustrative photos for all exercises and their modes.\n\n        2. Program Execution: All groups were submitted to a motor evaluation utilizing the\n           Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) and functional evaluation utilizing the Functional\n           independence measure (FIM). After assessment, for the patients of the home-based\n           exercise group (HBG) a group of home exercises was selected for each patient; these\n           exercises were explained and performed one by one. The home-exercises were re-executed\n           at each fortnightly visit, when any necessary correction was made. The next steps\n           stipulated by the manual were taken, providing the patients with more complex exercises\n           according to their progress. The patients in the supervised exercise training group\n           (SEG) participated in supervised individual exercise sessions two times per week. A\n           physical therapist supervised these sessions. Exercise sessions included: 30 minutes of\n           global exercises that involved stretching, range of motion, muscle strengthen and\n           another 30 minutes of functional training (gait, balance and use of the arm in daily\n           activities).The control group (CG) was assessed but reluctant or unable to regularly\n           attend a supervised exercise program. The groups were reassessed after six months.\n\n        3. Program assessment: The Fugl-Meyer Assessment score and the Functional independence\n           measure score, measured at baseline and after six months, were compared between the\n           groups."
