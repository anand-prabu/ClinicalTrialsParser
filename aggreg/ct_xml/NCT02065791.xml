  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to assess whether canagliflozin has a renal and vascular
      protective effect in reducing the progression of renal impairment relative to placebo in
      participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), Stage 2 or 3 chronic kidney disease (CKD)
      and macroalbuminuria, who are receiving standard of care including a maximum tolerated
      labeled daily dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin
      receptor blocker (ARB).

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (the study medication is assigned by chance), double-blind (neither
      physician nor participant knows the identity of the assigned treatment), placebo-controlled
      (an inactive substance that is compared with a medication to test whether the medication has
      a real effect), parallel-group, multicenter study of the effects of canagliflozin on renal
      and cardiovascular outcomes in participants with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and
      diabetic nephropathy, who are receiving standard of care including a maximum tolerated daily
      dose of an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blocker
      (ARB).

      The study will consist of a pretreatment phase (several weeks), and a double-blind treatment
      phase (up to 66 months). During the pretreatment phase all participants will also receive
      diet/exercise counseling for lipid and blood pressure management as well as counseling on
      renal and cardiovascular (CV) risk factor medication. A post-treatment follow-up contact or
      visit will take place approximately 30 days after the last dose of study drug or the
      completion of the study. The total duration of the study is estimated to be about 5.5 years.
       Approximately 3,700 participants will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to canagliflozin or
      matching placebo. Participants randomized to canagliflozin will receive a dose of 100 mg
      once daily. The overall safety and tolerability of canagliflozin will be evaluated by
      collecting information on adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs (pulse, blood
      pressure), physical examination, and body weight.
