Treatment repeats every 6 weeks for up to\n      4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients who\n      achieve complete response (CR) receive 2 additional courses beyond documentation of CR.\n      Patients who achieve partial response (PR) receive 4 additional courses beyond documentation\n      of PR.\n\n      Patients are followed at 4 weeks and then every 3 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-8\n      months."
