Individuals will complete a\n      health history questionnaire to determine if they qualify for this study.  We will measure\n      your leg girth with a measuring tape and take a pain measurement of your hamstrings by using\n      a spring to press down on your leg. Individuals will then warm-up on a bike without\n      resistance for 5 minutes followed by 10 regular leg extension and flexion exercises.\n      Individuals will then perform 6 sets of 10 leg extension and flexion exercises on a biodex\n      machine (similar to leg curl machines in the gym). Individuals will perform each set to the\n      maximum effort of their capables. After each set of 10 individuals will have a 2 minute\n      rest. We will ask you to rank your leg soreness on a scale from 1-10.\n\n      Individuals will then be assigned to a modality of either ice, control group or compex.\n      Individuals will perform the modality (ice, control, compex) we assign you to until you are\n      no longer sore.\n\n      Over the next five days individuals will return to measure their level of soreness, leg\n      girth and pain pressure.\n\n      This study will examine the following hypotheses:\n\n      H1:  There will be no difference in pressure pain threshold after using the Compex compared\n      to other groups.\n\n      H2: There will be no difference in perceived soreness after using the Compex compared to\n      other groups.\n\n      H3: There will be no difference in muscular strength after using the Compex compared to\n      other groups.\n\n      H4: There will be no difference in active range of motion after using the Compex compared to\n      other groups."
