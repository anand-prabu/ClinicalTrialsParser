AIDS patients with extensive KS require treatment with\n      effective cytotoxic (anti-cancer) agents to reduce the tumor size and with antiretroviral\n      agents such as AZT to prevent or ameliorate the development of opportunistic infections. Due\n      to the significant toxic effect of both cytotoxic and antiviral agents on the bone marrow\n      where new blood cells are generated, the combination of these agents is expected to result\n      in complications such as granulocytopenia (very low granulocyte counts). Hematopoietic\n      growth factors such as GM-CSF may reduce the severity and duration of marrow suppression.\n      This may improve survival. Clinical trials of GM-CSF in HIV infected individuals with or\n      without granulocytopenia have shown that the progenitor cells (early blood cells) are\n      responsive to GM-CSF."

Original\n      design: Patients receive the combination of AZT, antineoplastic chemotherapy, and GM-CSF in\n      groups of three patients each. The first group receives baseline doses, and if the treatment\n      is well tolerated, the subsequent groups of patients receive higher doses of the\n      chemotherapy, in which the dose of doxorubicin is increased while bleomycin, vincristine,\n      and AZT doses remain fixed throughout the study. The dose of all drugs remains fixed for a\n      given patient. The anticancer drugs are given intravenously every 2 weeks. AZT is given\n      every 4 hours by mouth. GM-CSF is self-injected subcutaneously every day from day 2 - day 12\n      of each treatment cycle. Patients repeat the chemotherapy every 2 weeks, for a maximum of\n      seven cycles, with AZT being given continuously. When the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of\n      chemotherapy combined with GM-CSF is determined, the next phase of the study begins. Again\n      the dose of chemotherapy is increased in groups of patients, but the every-day dose of\n      GM-CSF is increased. Again, these chemotherapy cycles are repeated every 2 weeks up to a\n      maximum of seven cycles. Patients receive physician examination and laboratory tests every\n      week during the study and again at 4 weeks after the study. AMENDED: Dosages for AZT and\n      GM-CSF have been changed to reflect ongoing results."
