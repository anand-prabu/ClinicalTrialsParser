In testicular Azoospermia the testes are abnormal, atrophic, or\n      absent, and sperm production severely disturbed to absent. FSH levels tend to be elevated\n      (hypergonadotropic) as the feedback loop is interrupted. The condition is seen in 49-93% of\n      men with Azoospermia. The purpose of this study is to assess the ability of bone marrow\n      derived stem cells to differentiate into germ cells and their role in treatment of\n      testicular Azoospermia"

Sixty men with Azoospermia will be recruited in this study after a written\n      informed consent.\n\n      The diagnosis of Azoospermia will be established on the basis of two semen analysis\n      evaluations done at separate occasions; this will be followed by detailed history taking,\n      physical examination and investigations. History taking will include general health, sexual\n      health, past fertility, libido, sexual activity and previous exposure to surgery, drugs,\n      mumps infection and irradiation. Physical examination includes genital and local examination\n      for detection of signs of Klinefelter syndrome, testicular atrophy, absence of vas.\n      Investigations include serum FSH, LH, karyotyping and testosterone levels, and may include\n      testicular biopsy or transrectal ultrasound if indicated (Low levels of LH and FSH with low\n      or normal testosterone levels are indicative of pretesticular problems, while high levels of\n      gonadotropins indicate testicular problems. However, often this distinction is not clear and\n      the differentiation between obstructive versus non-obstructive Azoospermia may require a\n      testicular biopsy).\n\n      Subjects will be enrolled based on specific inclusion/exclusion criteria and evaluated at\n      regular post transplant intervals. Human adult bone marrow derived stem cells will be\n      transplanted by an andrological surgeon through a standard surgical approach.  Subjects will\n      be monitored frequently for a total of one year after adult bone marrow stem cells cell\n      injection. For safety of participants, Bone Marrow Stem cells will be injected in one testis\n      only and the other testis will be spared."
