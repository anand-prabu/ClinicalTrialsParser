      RATIONALE: Placing a tumor antigen chimeric receptor that has been created in the laboratory
      into patient autologous T cells may make the body build immune response to kill cancer
      cells.

      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is to study genetically engineered lymphocyte therapy in
      treating patients with EGFR positive advanced solid tumors, such as lung cancer, colorectal
      cancer and ovary cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Determine the safety and feasibility of the chimeric antigen receptor T cells transduced
      with the anti-EGFR vector (referred to as CART-EGFR cells).

      II. Determine duration of in vivo survival of CART-EGFR cells. RT-PCR (reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction) analysis of whole blood will be used to detect and quantify
      survival of CART-EGFR TCR zeta:CD137 and TCR (T-cell receptor) zeta cells over time.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. For patients with detectable disease, measure anti-tumor response due to CART-EGFR cell
      infusions.

      II. Estimate relative trafficking of CART-EGFR cells in tumor bed.

      III. Determine if cellular or humoral host immunity develops against the murine anti-EGFR,
      and assess correlation with loss of detectable CART-EGFR (loss of engraftment).

      IV. Determine the relative subsets of CART-EGFR T cells (Tcm, Tem, and Treg).

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 group according to order of enrollment.

      Patients receive anti-EGFR-CAR (coupled with CD137 and CD3 zeta signalling
      domains)vector-transduced autologous T cells on days 0,1, and 2 in the absence of
      unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed intensively for 6 months, every 3
      months for 2 years, and annually thereafter for 13 years.

      Estimate relative trafficking of CART-EGFR cells in peripheral blood.
