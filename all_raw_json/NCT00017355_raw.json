Patients undergo apheresis on days 6 and 7 or 6-8 to obtain peripheral blood\n      mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMC are processed for CD34+ cell isolation. These autologous\n      CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells are cultured to generate dendritic cells (DC). DC are\n      then pulsed with endotoxin-free keyhole limpet hemocyanin and HLA-A2-01 restricted\n      flu-matrix peptides derived from melanoma-associated tumor antigens (MART-1:27-35,\n      gp100:209-217, and MAGE-3). Antigen-pulsed DC are incubated with interferon alfa to induce\n      DC maturation.\n\n      Patients receive priming injections of antigen-pulsed DC vaccine SC once every 2 weeks for 8\n      weeks. Treatment repeats at 2, 3, 4, and 5 months after the last priming injection in the\n      absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression.\n\n      Patients are followed at 2 and 4 weeks and then every 3 months for 1.5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study."
