In particular, the recent dissemination of a serine\n      carbapenemase (e.g., KPC) in Enterobacteriaceae in US hospitals now poses a considerable\n      threat to the carbapenems and other members of the beta-lactam class of antimicrobial\n      agents.\n\n      Rempex is developing a fixed combination antibiotic of a carbapenem (RPX2003 or biapenem)\n      plus a new beta-lactamase inhibitor (RPX7009) which has activity against serine\n      beta-lactamases, including KPC.  This Phase 1 study will assess the safety, tolerability and\n      pharmacokinetics of biapenem, administered alone, in healthy adult subjects."
