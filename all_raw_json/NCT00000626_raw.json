ABVD (doxorubicin / bleomycin / vinblastine / dacarbazine) is\n      administered on days 1 and 15 of each cycle, and G-CSF is given on days 2 through 14 and 16\n      through 28 of each cycle. All patients receive four cycles of treatment and are then\n      restaged. Patients with a complete response (CR) following the initial four cycles receive\n      two additional cycles of ABVD / G-CSF. Patients with a partial response following the\n      initial four cycles receive two additional cycles of ABVD / G-CSF and are again restaged;\n      those who have achieved a CR at that point then receive two more cycles, while those without\n      CR discontinue study therapy. Patients with disease progression following the initial four\n      cycles of therapy discontinue treatment on the study. Concomitant PCP prophylaxis is\n      administered."
