All anticoagulants will be discontinued 10 days prior to\n      the operation, if this will not be possible the patient will be excluded. The investigators\n      will perform the specified procedure in accordance with accepted clinical practice\n      standards. At the end of the thyroidectomy, a meticulous hemostasis will be achieved. Before\n      wound closure, the sealed affiliation envelopes will be opened and 1-2\u00d72 cm oxidized\n      cellulose patch will be placed over the thyroid bed depending on patient randomization.\n      Next, a suction drain will be placed. The drains will be removed when the secretion\n      volume/day will be less than 20 cc.\n\n      All operations will be performed under general anesthesia by three head and neck surgeons\n      who had experience in thyroid surgery. Outcome measures will include duration of operation,\n      hemodynamic variables on emergence (blood pressure and heart rate), volume of secretion in\n      the drain, time to removal of wound drain, length of postoperative hospital stay, and\n      incidence of postoperative complications, i.e. hemorrhage, transient hypoparathyroidism,\n      wound infection, seroma, and recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy. Evaluation of the\n      postoperative course and recording of data will be done by one surgeons blinded to the\n      intervention (MA). Follow-up for this study will be ended one month after the surgery."
