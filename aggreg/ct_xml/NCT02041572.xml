  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study has two goals. First to develop a computer-based intervention meant to alter
      cognitive biases that contribute to ongoing PTSD symptoms. Second, we sought to pilot test
      the intervention in a small sample of veterans for feasibility and acceptability.

    <description>Each participant receives 12 sessions. The first three sessions are baseline (assessment only) sessions.  The last four sessions must be treatment sessions.  The attentional bias intervention starts randomly on sessions 4 - 8, and continues until the end of the 12 sessions.</description>

    <description>Participants complete a computer-based intervention, which is designed to correct cognitive biases associated with PTSD by training to attend to neutral information rather than the trauma-related cue words.</description>
