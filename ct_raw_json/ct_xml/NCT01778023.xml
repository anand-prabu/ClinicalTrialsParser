        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent obtained from subject's parents or legally acceptable representative
             before any trial-related activities. (Trial-related activities are any procedure that
             would not have been performed during normal management of the subject.)

          -  Pre-pubertal status (males aged from 4 to 11 [both inclusive], females aged from 4 to
             9 [both inclusive]): an absence of breast development in females (Tanner 1 only) and
             testicular volume below 4 mL in males

          -  Growth hormone level above 10 ng/mL following a stimulation test (test result within
             6 months from screening can be used)

          -  Height below 3 percentile

          -  Bone age below or equal to 12 year

             (adrenocorticotropic hormone), ADH (antidiuretic hormone), FSH (follicle-stimulating
             hormone), LH (luteinising hormone), TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone))

          -  Known primary hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency or hypogonadism (treated or
             untreated)

          -  Specific types of growth failure including, but not limited to, known chromosomal
             abnormalities associated with growth failure and altered sensitivity to growth
             hormone

          -  Bone age is advanced over chronological age more than 3 years

          -  Active malignancy, CNS (central nervous system) trauma, active chemotherapy or
             radiation therapy for neoplasia
