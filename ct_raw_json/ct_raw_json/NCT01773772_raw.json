In this study, the\n      investigators aim to discover whether or not giving 2 small doses of progesterone to early\n      pubertal girls will prevent the nighttime increase of GnRH and LH pulses. From the\n      information gathered in this study, the investigators may be able to learn more about how\n      menstrual cycles are normally established in girls during puberty. Ultimately, if these\n      normal processes can be understood, the investigators may be able to better understand\n      abnormalities of puberty."

Progesterone (P)\n      levels increase overnight in peripubertal girls, and P is the primary effector of LH pulse\n      frequency slowing in adult women. The investigators hypothesize that nocturnal LH increases\n      stimulate ovarian P, which in turn suppresses LH pulsatility during the following day. The\n      investigators will assess this further using a protocol in which two doses of P or placebo\n      are given to early pubertal girls, with subsequent assessment of LH pulses over 14 hours.\n      The investigators hypothesize that in early pubertal girls, LH pulse frequency will be lower\n      in girls receiving P compared to girls receiving placebo."
