            "textblock": "Chest pain is one of the most common symptoms evaluated in the Emergency Department (ED).\n      One of the primary diagnostic concerns during the evaluation of this presentation is whether\n      there is evidence of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) as ACS is a major risk factor for short-\n      and long-term major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE, defined as acute myocardial\n      infarction, revascularization, or all-cause death).  Two of the cornerstones of the\n      guidelines-based evaluation of this patient group are serial electrocardiograms (ECG) and\n      troponin measurements (a serological marker of myocardial ischemia), which have shown to be\n      both independently and incrementally predictive of ACS.  Recently, second-generation\n      troponin assays have been adopted into clinical practice as they have higher sensitivity and\n      specificity for ACS compared to older assays.  Given the increased diagnostic accuracy of\n      these novel second-generation assays, the proposed study's research question is to\n      investigate whether serial ECG changes significantly increase the diagnostic accuracy of\n      serial second-generation troponin changes in predicting MACE in patients presenting with\n      symptoms consistent with ACS.  In order to investigate this question, we originally proposed\n      an observational pilot study ancillary to the HEART Pathway trial (WFUHS IRB00021074), a\n      funded randomized controlled trial investigating a recently developed decision aid tool (the\n      HEART score) designed to identify patients being evaluated for chest pain that can safely\n      forgo further objective testing.  We proposed to add the collection of two additional\n      12-lead ECGs to the protocol in the HEART Pathway trial, which included serial\n      second-generation troponin collection, in order to generate pilot data regarding the\n      research question. As recruitment for the HEART Pathway trial ended in February 2014, we now\n      propose to continue enrollment for the ASAP CATH study independently, as a prospective\n      observational study evaluating the additional prognostic value of serial ECGs to standard\n      care in patients with chest pain being evaluated for acute coronary syndromes in the\n      Emergency Department.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      The goal of this project is to produce preliminary data to investigate whether the presence\n      or absence of serial ECG changes suggestive of myocardial ischemia aids in reclassifying\n      participants' risk for MACE and objective evidence of ACS over and above serial\n      second-generation troponin testing.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Adult patients, over 21 years old, presenting to WFBMC ED with chest pain or symptoms\n      concerning for ACS, in which the provider orders cardiac biomarkers and an ECG will be\n      eligible for enrollment.  We aim to add serial ECG analysis (one at the time of study\n      enrollment and a second at the time of the study blood draw) to the protocol in the proposed\n      study.  The primary outcomes are major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) at 30 days and\n      evidence of acute myocardial ischemia via objective cardiac testing performed during the\n      index hospitalization."
