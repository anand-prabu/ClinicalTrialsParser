  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the negative impact of sleep apnea on the clinical course of acute ischemic stroke
      (AIS) is well known, data regarding non-invasive ventilation in acute patients are scarce.
      Several studies showed its tolerability, safety and signals-of-efficacy, yet no controlled
      randomized sequential phase studies currently exist that aim to establish the efficacy of
      early non-invasive ventilation in AIS patients. The main hypothesis for this study is that
      early non-invasive ventilation with automated bilevel positive airway pressure (auto-BPAP)
      positively affects short-term clinical outcomes in AIS patients. This is a multicenter,
      prospective, randomized, controlled, third rater-blinded, parallel-group trial. Patients
      with AIS with proximal arterial obstruction and clinically suspected sleep apnea will be
      randomized to standard or standard stroke care plus auto-BPAP. Auto-BPAP will be initiated
      within 24 hours from stroke onset and performed for a maximum of 48 hours during diurnal and
      nocturnal sleep. Patients will undergo cardiorespiratory polygraphy between day 3 and 5 to
      assess sleep apnea. The primary endpoint is any early neurological improvement on the NIHSS
      at 72 hours from randomization. Safety, tolerability, short-term and 3 months functional
      outcomes are assessed as secondary endpoints by un-blinded and blinded observers
      respectively. This study will provide data to power a subsequent phase III study.

    <description>Safety will be assessed by:
(i) frequency of serious adverse events (i.e., aspiration, aspiration pneumonia defined as combined radiologic, white blood count and clinical findings, respiratory failure with/without intubation) during treatment period that in the opinion of the study physician are causatively and timely (for a maximum of 72 hours from treatment initiation) related to auto-BPAP and all deaths during hospital stay. For comparison, patients in the control group will be monitored for respiratory complications within 72 hours from randomization; (ii) frequency of all complaints and possible side effects of auto-BPAP (i.e., local irritation of skin/mucosa, mucosal dryness, nausea/vomiting); (iii) any concerns by hospital nursing staff will be documented as adverse events since patients will be under standard of care repeated assessments set by admission protocols and treating physicians.</description>

    <description>Signal-of-efficacy:
Clinical and functional outcomes will be assessed by:
(i) frequency of neurological deterioration (increase in baseline NIHSS score ≥4 points) at 24, 48 and after 72 hours from randomization by blinded observers; (ii) frequency of early neurological improvement (decrease in baseline NIHSS score ≥4 points) at 24, 48 and after 72 hours from randomization by blinded observers; (iii) good functional outcome (mRS score 0-2) at discharge and at 3 months by blinded observers; (iv) any TIA or new ischemic stroke during hospitalization or within 3 months of protocol initiation.</description>
