While there are some commercially available devices that may treat some of\n      these patients these devices may not be suitable or available for a given patient.  In this\n      study we will use off-the-shelf, FDA approved devices and alter them by creating\n      fenestrations (holes) in the stent graft that allow additional stents to be inserted into\n      the blood vessels that supply blood to these critical organs.  These modified stent grafts\n      will be created using advanced imaging techniques that allow the investigator to tailor the\n      device to the patient's specific anatomy.\n\n      The finished device is inserted into the body through two small punctures or incisions in\n      the groin.  Small stents will be inserted through the stent graft fenestrations into the\n      major blood vessels affected by the aneurysm so that blood flow is maintained to these\n      organs."
