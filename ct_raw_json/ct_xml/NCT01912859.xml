    <textblock>
      The purpose of Next Steps pilot intervention is to develop and test a new program designed
      to help low-income multiethnic families with overweight or obese children achieve long-term
      maintenance of healthful behaviors following completion of Hennepin County Medical Center's
      (HCMC) 16-week intensive obesity management course (Taking Steps Together (TST)).

      Next Steps is a community based pilot intervention study conducted in collaboration between
      community leaders, the University of Minnesota, Hennepin County Medical Center (HCMC) and
      The Family Partnership. The study collaborators will develop and test a new program designed
      to help low-income multiethnic families with overweight or obese children achieve long-term
      maintenance of healthful behaviors following completion of HCMC's 16-week intensive obesity
      management course (Taking Steps Together (TST)). Next Steps, the focus of this study, will
      comprise a network of parent-led, community-based health maintenance programs that will be
      offered to TST graduate families.

      Project Aims:

      Aim 1: Establish a core parent leadership group and health maintenance program network that
      is self-sustaining and can serve the community for years to come.

      Aim 2: Test the feasibility, acceptability and sustainability of the Next Steps programs.

      Aim 3: Assess the impact of the Next Steps programs on helping participant families sustain
      or improve healthful behaviors and achieve or maintain healthy body mass index (BMI).
