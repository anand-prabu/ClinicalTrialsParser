To\n      obtain plasma following the fourth immunization. To evaluate skin test reactivity.\n\n      ORIGINAL (replaced): To determine in healthy volunteers the safety and immunogenicity of two\n      immunizations of MN rgp160 vaccine (Immuno-AG) in combination with a live recombinant\n      vaccinia virus LAV HIV-1 gp160 vaccine (HIVAC-1e) versus DryVax (the standard smallpox\n      vaccine that was used for many years) control in combination with placebo.\n\n      ORIGINAL (replaced): A gp160 vaccine derived from the MN strain, the most prevalent strain\n      of HIV-1 in the United States, has been developed. A previous study showed that a\n      combination vaccine strategy, consisting of priming with HIVAC-1e followed by boosting with\n      a gp160 subunit vaccine, resulted in humoral and cellular immune responses of greater and\n      longer duration than either vaccine alone. Thus, a live vector/subunit boost approach using\n      the MN rgp160 vaccine merits investigation."
