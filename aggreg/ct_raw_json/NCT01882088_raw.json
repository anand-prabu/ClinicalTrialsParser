            "textblock": "Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a chronic condition, which may significantly\n      decrease patients' quality of life due to the typical symptoms - heartburn and\n      regurgitation. These are caused by increasing number of transient lower esophageal sphincter\n      relaxations, regularly recurring reflux of gastric content into oesophagus, acidification of\n      the esophagus and consequent esophageal mucosa damage. In addition, an important role is\n      played by the increase in production of hydrochloric acid in the stomach, the slowdown in\n      the evacuation of the contents from the stomach and increase of gastric and intra-abdominal\n      pressure. All of these factors may depend on the patient's diet.\n\n      Theoretical premises of the positive influence of including dietary fiber on the course of\n      gastroesophageal reflux disease may be the fact that dietary fiber may absorb nitric oxide\n      (NO) containing in food, which in turn has relaxing effects on the lower esophageal\n      sphincter. In addition, fiber deficiency has been shown to be associated with increased\n      chance of developing hiatal hernia, which is associated with greater risk of the disease\n      manifestations. There is lack of data about diet modification with its enreaching by dietary\n      fibers and their type on the symptoms frequency and objective (i.e. esophageal pH-impedance\n      and manometric) parameters.\n\n      Mucofalk\u00ae is a drug of plant origin, consisting of a shell seeds of Plantago ovata\n      (isphagula, psyllium). High content of mucuses in the composition of psyllium seed allows it\n      to include to group of soft food fibers, which has fundamental value for the appointment of\n      a drug at a number of diseases, when, for example, the use of coarse food fibres not\n      recommended or contraindicated.\n\n      Mucofalk is the registered medicinal (registration number of the Russian State register of\n      medicines P N014176/01, registration date 14.07.2008, manufacturer: Lozan Pharma GmbH,\n      packager: Dr. Falk Pharma GmbH, Germany). Recommended dosage and administration: orally,\n      adults and children over 12 years - 1 pack. 2-6 times a day. Before use, the contents of 1\n      packet poured in a glass, in which slowly poured with cold water (150 ml), stir and drink\n      immediately. Then drink another glass of liquid."
