The Instrument of Consent is signed by all patients.\n\n      Eighty-three patients will be included. Ages between 18 and 70 years both genders, 2 and 3\n      American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status, which present moderate to severe pain\n      source postoperative surgical oncology, head and neck, medium and large, elective,\n      non-emergency,  able to swallow tablets whole (not chewed, broken or crushed) in the\n      immediate postoperative period after recovery of cognitive functions. Will be excluded\n      pregnant or breastfeeding, allergic to oxycodone and other opioids, gastrectomized or\n      colostomized, asthmatics with severe organ dysfunction, with a history or suspected\n      paralytic ileus, or a history psychiatric disorders, severe respiratory depression, patients\n      who are receiving opioid analgesics in baseline, history of abuse of alcohol and illicit\n      drugs, patients who present in plasma glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase above 48 U / l (men)\n      and 40 U / I (women) and / or glutamic pyruvic transaminase above 53 U / l (men) and 40 U /\n      I (women) and patients who present plasma creatinine above 1.7 mg / dl and / or urea above\n      65 mg / dl. All patients will be assessed preoperatively seven to one day before surgery\n      (visit 1) when will the signed consent form, proceeded to pre-anesthetic evaluation and\n      blood will be collected for laboratory tests: complete blood count, \u03b2-human chorionic\n      gonadotropin(women), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase,\n      creatinine and urea.\n\n      In the immediate postoperative period (visit 2), the pain will be assessed by verbal numeric\n      scale (VNS) and when pain is moderate to severe (\u2265 4 EVN) and the patient is lucid and able\n      to swallow, will start orally controlled-release oxycodone (Oxycontin, Zodiac\n      Pharmaceuticals, Brazil) at a dose of 20 mg (tablets whole without crushing or division),\n      administered by the investigator. Every 12 hours and a subsequent period of 48 hours after\n      the first dose of oxycodone controlled-release, the pain will be evaluated again, and the\n      occurrence and intensity of adverse events (visits 3, 4, 5 and 6 respectively 12 , 24, 36\n      and 48 hours after the first dose of oxycodone). The doses of controlled-release oxycodone\n      will be standardized as follows: on the first day postoperatively, 40 mg / day divided into\n      20 mg of 12 in 12 hours and in the second postoperative day, 20 mg / day divided into 10 mg\n      of 12 in 12 hours.\n\n      The rescue medication will be used non opioids analgesics as paracetamol, dipyrone,\n      diclofenac or tenoxicam, only after the first administration of controlled-release oxycodone\n      postoperatively. During the visits described above will be annotated to rescue analgesia and\n      its frequency, should it ever be used between doses of oxycodone.\n\n      Between post-operative 7 and 13 days will be held the visit 7, which will be evaluated pain\n      intensity (EVN), the occurrence and severity of adverse effects, and the investigator's\n      opinion about treatment. Finally, the patient's blood  will be collected to perform the same\n      tests listed at visit 1, except \u03b2-human chorionic gonadotropin (women), and the study was\n      terminated.\n\n      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis\n\n      When considering the occurrence of nausea of 25% as a safety parameter, assessed by\n      literature data, the number of patients required will be 72. Taking into consideration a\n      dropout of about 20% will require 86 patients in total (to an accuracy of 10%, around the\n      percentage confidence interval (CI) 95%). The study of normal age variable will be conducted\n      with the test Kolmogorov - Smirnov. The Friedman test is used to compare medians of pain\n      intensity from visit 2 to visit 7. The Dunn test will be used for post-hoc comparisons\n      (between two) of median pain intensity (p <0.001 - significant). The McNemar test for\n      pairwise comparisons of proportions will be employed for comparisons of adverse events\n      (visits 4, 5, 6 and 7 with respect to visit 3) (p <0.05 = significant). The remaining data\n      will be presented by frequency."
