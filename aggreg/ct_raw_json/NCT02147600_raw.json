Patients who interrupted their treatment schedule during the\n      24 weeks prior to blood sampling are excluded. Samples of patients who were treated with\n      adalimumab for any other inflammatory disease and later developed psoriasis are also\n      excluded. Percentage of PASI improvement compared to baseline (\u2206PASI) represents clinical\n      response. Patients are classified as nonresponders (\u2206PASI<50), moderate responders (\u2206PASI\n      50-75) or good responders (\u2206PASI 75-100).Serum is collected for adalimumab trough level and\n      anti-drug antibody determination (Sanquin, The Netherlands). By receiver-operator\n      characteristics (ROC) analysis, a cut-off value of adalimumab trough level can be determined\n      to distinguish insufficient from adequate responders."
