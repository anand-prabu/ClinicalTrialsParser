The specific objectives were to determine the effect of vitamin A alone\n      vs. vitamin A and zinc supplements on changes in anthropometric measurements specifically\n      weight and length/height and to assess the effect of the study interventions on the\n      incidence of anemia, diarrhea and pneumonia. It also assessed the tolerability of the\n      supplements and determined the change in zinc status by measuring plasma zinc concentration\n      using atomic absorption spectrometry before and at the end of the intervention. The study\n      also determined the change in vitamin A status as assessed by the modified relative dose\n      response (MRDR) test during and at the end of the intervention."
