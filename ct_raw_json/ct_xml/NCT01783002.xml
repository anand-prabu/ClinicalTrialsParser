      STUDY OBJECTIVES Primary: To compare the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of
      11C-methionine (MET) PET/CT and 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT in the detection of pathologic
      parathyroid glands in patients with primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

      Secondary:To compare the accuracy, sensitivity and specificity of 11C-MET and 18F-FDG PET/CT
      scans in the detection of pathologic parathyroid glands in patients with primary or tertiary
      hyperparathyroidism.

      STUDY DESIGN A phase II diagnostic imaging, single-centre study to compare the accuracy of
      11C-MET PET/CT with standard 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and with 18F-FDG PET/CT imaging in patients
      with primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

      STUDY POPULATION Number of Subjects: 50 patients Number of groups: 2: 25 with primary
      hyperparathyroidism, 25 with tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

      Age/Gender: Age greater than or equal to 19 years / Male and Female Study specific
      requirements: Subjects with clinically suspected primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism who
      require 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT parathyroid imaging.

      INVESTIGATIONAL PRODUCT Product: 11C-Methionine Route of administration: Intravenous
      Dosage(s) and frequency: Radioactive dose of 11C-Methionine of 6 MBq per kilogram body
      weight per injection (maximum dose of 555 MBq); one injection per patient.

      COMPARATOR PRODUCTS Product: 99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite; 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Route
      of administration: Intravenous Dosage(s) and frequency: (1) Radioactive dose of
      99mTc-Methoxyisobutylisonitrite of 555 - 740 MBq per injection; one injection per patient.
      (2) Radioactive dose of 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose of 296 - 521 MBq per injection; one injection
      per patient.

      EVALUATION CRITERIA Efficacy: The comparison of the accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity
      of 11C-MET PET/CT with 99mTc-MIBI SPECT-CT and 18F-FDG PET/CT in the detection of pathologic
      parathyroid glands in patients with primary or tertiary hyperparathyroidism.

      Safety: Vital signs before and following 11C-MET administration; adverse events collection.

    <description>All adverse events will be recorded. An Adverse Event (AE) is any untoward, undesired, unplanned medical occurrence in a participant and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study intervention. Expected adverse events from PET/CT scans include bruising, bleeding or infection at the site of intravenous radiotracer injection. Other expected adverse events include feeling of discomfort or claustrophobia from being in the scanner.</description>

    <description>PET with the radiopharmaceutical carbon-11 methionine (11C-MET) has been considered to improve diagnosis due to a superior spatial resolution and higher specificity compared to other radiotracers such as 18F-FDG. For the 11C-MET PET/CT, the patient will receive an intravenous bolus injection of 11C-MET as manufactured at the BCCA production facility at a dose of 6 (0.16 mCi) MBq per kilogram but not to exceed 555 MBq (15 mCi).</description>

    <description>For PET/CT scans, the patient will first receive an intravenous bolus injection of 18F-FDG as manufactured at the BCCA production facility in a dose determined by body weight but not to exceed 521 MBq (14.1 mCi).  Our standard adult prescription (70kg adult) for 18F-FDG is 296 MBq (8.0 mCi). The target dose for body scans is increased by 59.2 MBq (1.6 mCi) for every 20 kg increase in body weight to a maximum target dose of 474 MBq (12.8 mCi).</description>

    <description>For the SPECT-CT scan, each injection of intravenous 99mTc-MIBI is dosed at a maximum of 20 mCi (740MBq), as per usual standard of care.  The energy window of each scan is at 140 keV, consistent with the standard of SPEC-CT imaging techniques.</description>
