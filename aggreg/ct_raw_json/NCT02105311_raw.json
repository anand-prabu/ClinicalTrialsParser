Clinical evaluations of its effectiveness in\n      individual patients usually are derived from baseline and post-laser measurements of\n      intraocular pressure during office hours in the sitting position. Only a few studies have\n      examined the efficacy of laser trabeculoplasty beyond office hours. Although the 24-hour\n      effect of laser trabeculoplasty has been studied ,the study was conducted before the use of\n      these new and more potent intraocular pressure lowering drugs. So it doesn't have any study\n      to determine the effect of selective laser trabeculoplasty and travoprost to reduce the\n      diurnal and nocturnal variation of Iintraocular pressure."
