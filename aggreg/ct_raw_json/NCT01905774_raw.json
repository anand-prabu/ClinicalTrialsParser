In the last five years an oral Iron chelator was introduced and approved by\n      the FDA, Deferasirox, (Novartis, Switzerland and USA). The purpose of this study is to\n      assess the renal function in Thalassemia Major patients treated with this new oral iron\n      chelator and compare the results with our previous study."
