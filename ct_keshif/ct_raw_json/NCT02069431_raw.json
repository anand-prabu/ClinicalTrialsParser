            "textblock": "The life expectancy of older Americans continues to increase, with persons aged > 65 years\n      representing the fastest growing segment of the US population (Manton et al., 1995). While\n      prolongation of life remains an important public health goal, a goal of even greater\n      significance is that extended life should involve preservation of the capacity to live\n      independently and to function well physically, cognitively, and socioemotionally (Katz et\n      al., 1983). Therefore, identification of proven interventions to maintaining functioning\n      across these domains and prevent disability is a major public health challenge (Branch et\n      al., 1991). Greater physical and cognitive independence in older adults has been shown to\n      crucially influence social integration in old age (Cornwell & Waite, 2009), resulting in\n      significant increase in quality of life and reduction of risk for morbidity and mortality,\n      social stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (Bassuk et al., 1999; Seeman, 1996). A\n      promising candidate to promote functional levels across physical, cognitive, and\n      socioemotional domains is the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) (Barraza et al., 2013; Bartz et\n      al., 2011; Feifel et al., 2012; Meyer-Lindenberg et al., 2011; Szeto et al., 2012).\n      Combining neuroendocrine with behavioral approaches (e.g., performance-based measures of\n      physical and cognitive function), the proposed multidisciplinary research therefore sets out\n      to clarify the extent to which intranasal administration of OT over a period of 4 weeks can\n      reduce inflammation and improve physical and cognitive function in older men. Constituting a\n      complementary piece to the IRB approved currently ongoing Faces Study (IRB # 39-2013), this\n      project will also allow examination of interactions between OT's effect on physical health,\n      cognition, and socioemotional function."

            "textblock": "Overview: This study has the following parts:\n\n        -  Initial screening visit\n\n        -  2 baseline study visits\n\n        -  4-week treatment phase\n\n        -  2 study visits after treatment\n\n        -  Follow-up phone contact\n\n      All study visits will be conducted at the Institute on Aging or the McKnight Brain Institute\n      at the University of Florida. The treatment phase will take place in your home.\n\n      You will be assigned by chance, much like the flip of a coin, to receive either the oxytocin\n      or the placebo. The placebo is a substance, like salt water, that looks like and is given in\n      the same way as the oxytocin but contains no oxytocin. Neither you nor the research\n      assistant will know which type of dose you are getting. This information is coded and\n      securely stored away until the data is analyzed. This is called a \"blind study\" for that\n      reason, but that information is available if it is needed.\n\n      Screening Visit: Together with the information obtained in the phone pre-screening that the\n      investigators have already conducted, the main purpose of the screening visit is to find out\n      if you are eligible to participate in the study.\n\n        -  The investigators will ask you questions about your health condition and recent\n           activities and the investigators will review your current and past medical health as\n           well as your education and living situation.\n\n        -  You will then have a short physical exam by a licensed physician including measurement\n           of your blood pressure and pulse (called vital signs or \"vitals\") and a brief\n           consultation to go over your medical review. This will not be a clinical doctor visit\n           for routine medical care, but a visit to confirm that you are eligible and it is safe\n           for you to participate in the research study.\n\n        -  A blood draw (~30milileters (mL) or ~2 tablespoons (tbs)) and urine collection (~2mL or\n           ~0.14 tbs) will follow. Result of blood or/and urine testing may indicate that you\n           should not participate in the study (e.g., certain blood tests' results could be out of\n           normal range). The blood test will also be used to determine the level of oxytocin\n           occurring normally in your blood and to determine level of inflammation in your body.\n           If any incidental or clinically significant findings occur, we will inform you of this\n           and give you a copy of the lab results. We will also encourage you to see your primary\n           care physician.\n\n        -  Some of the blood and a saliva sample (~2mL or ~ 0.14 tbs) that you will be asked to\n           provide will help to find out how the activity of your genes may impact how you perform\n           on some tests. All samples will be stored in a locked space at the Institute on Aging.\n\n      Baseline Visit 1: In the first baseline study visit you will be asked to participate in the\n      following:\n\n        -  We will ask you to participate in a series of tests and answer questionnaires related\n           to physical, auditory (hearing), and your social and emotional functioning. Some of\n           these tests will be administered on paper, some on the computer, and some in person.\n\n        -  Physical Test Battery\n\n        -  You will be asked to walk at your usual pace for a distance of 13 feet (4 meters) two\n           (2) separate times\n\n        -  You will be asked to stand from a sitting position, without using your arms. If you are\n           able to perform this task, you will be asked to stand up from and sit down on a chair\n           five (5) times as fast as you can.\n\n        -  You will be asked to maintain your balance while standing in three different positions,\n           1) with your feet together, 2) with the heel of one foot beside the big toe of the\n           other foot, and 3) the heel of one foot in front of and touching the toes of the other\n           foot.\n\n        -  You will be asked to walk a distance of 400 meters (1/4 mile) at your preferred pace.\n\n        -  You will be asked to perform upper- and lower-body muscle strength and endurance\n           assessment\n\n        -  You will be asked to respond to various questionnaires related to your physical health.\n\n        -  Auditory Test Battery\n\n        -  You will be asked to complete tasks that ask you to listen and attend to desired\n           stimuli in the presence of a competing message or noise.\n\n        -  Socioemotional Test Battery\n\n        -  You will be asked to complete questionnaires to measure your social and emotional\n           health, which will include questions to measure your current mood, your general level\n           of trust, your level of loneliness, and your drive to identify emotions and thoughts in\n           others and to respond to these with an appropriate emotion. These questions will also\n           measure your selflessness and concern for the well-being of others, your emotional\n           attention and clarity, your anxiety level and your personality.\n\n      Baseline Visit 2: In the second baseline study visit you will be asked to participate in the\n      following:\n\n        -  At the beginning of this visit, we will ensure that you are eligible and safe to\n           participate in the scanning session that day.\n\n        -  We will ask you to participate in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires\n           related to your memory and your thought process. Some of these tests will be\n           administered on paper and some on the computer.\n\n        -  Cognitive Test Battery\n\n        -  You will be asked to complete tasks that ask you to attend to, respond to, or remember\n           various stimuli on the computer screen.\n\n        -  You will then practice the tasks that you will work on while in the magnetic resonance\n           imaging (MRI) scanner. The tasks will involve viewing geometrical shapes, faces, and\n           images of objects and scenes. You will receive detailed information and have a chance\n           to ask any questions that you may have about the tasks or about the MRI procedure\n           before you go into the scanner.\n\n        -  At this point, you will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute, and get settled\n           into the MRI scanner, all with the assistance of the trained researcher.\n\n        -  While you are resting comfortably in the scanner, we will ask you to work on the tasks\n           mentioned above and while you do the MRI machine will produce images of your brain, as\n           well as scan your brain at rest. You will be in the scanner for less than 60 minutes.\n\n      Treatment Phase: In the 4-week treatment phase you will be asked to engage in the following:\n\n        -  You will self-administer either oxytocin or a placebo into your nose by using a nasal\n           spray bottle. The spray will be administered twice a day over 4 weeks. We will give you\n           guidance about how to administer the spray and will ask you to keep a log book of your\n           oxytocin/placebo administration.\n\n        -  In addition, during the treatment phase we will ask you to fill in a short diary about\n           social activities you engaged in during your day as well as emotions you experienced.\n\n        -  In Week 1 and 4 of your treatment, we will fit you with a device (i.e., bio-harness)\n           that allows us to measure physiological functions of your body such as your heart rate\n           and your breathing rate, for over a period of 24 hours while you engage in your daily\n           activities. You will be asked to wear it on a typical day, representative of your\n           normal daily activity. The 24-hour period will be one in which you are not traveling\n           out of town. We will visit you in your home to fit you with and take off the\n           bio-harness. The bio-harness will be comfortably fitted with a chest strap around your\n           upper body. It generally will not affect the clothes you can wear, it is water\n           resistant, and you will be able to purse the large majority of your daily activities in\n           the usual manner.\n\n        -  During the treatment phase, we will call you once a week to ask you whether you\n           experience any drug side effects or any problem with your health.\n\n      Post-Treatment Visit 1: In the first post-treatment study visit you will be asked to\n      participate in the following:\n\n        -  We will ask you questions about your health condition and recent activities.\n\n        -  You will again be physically examined (including vitals) by a licensed physician.\n\n        -  Another blood draw (~15mL or ~1 tbs) will be conducted to determine the level of\n           oxytocin after the treatment phase and to determine level of inflammation in your body.\n           Urine (~2mL or ~0.14 tbs) will be collected again to ensure that no adverse changes\n           have occurred during the treatment phase. The samples will be stored in a locked space\n           at the Institute on Aging.\n\n        -  We will again ask you to participate in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires\n           related to physical, auditory (hearing), and your social and emotional functioning.\n           These measures will be very similar to the ones you did before the treatment phase.\n\n      Post-Treatment Visit 2: In the post-treatment study visit you will be asked to participate\n      in the following:\n\n        -  At the beginning of this visit, we will ensure that you are eligible and safe to\n           participate in the scanning session that day.\n\n        -  We will ask you to participate in a series of tests and respond to questionnaires\n           related to your memory and your thought process. These measures will be very similar to\n           the ones you did before the treatment phase.\n\n        -  You will then practice the tasks that you will work on while in the magnetic resonance\n           imaging (MRI) scanner. The tasks involve viewing geometrical shapes, faces, and images\n           of objects and scenes. You will receive detailed information and have a chance to ask\n           any questions that you may have about the tasks or about the MRI procedure before you\n           go into the scanner.\n\n        -  At this point, you will be shuttled to the McKnight Brain Institute, and get settled\n           into the MRI scanner, all with the assistance of the trained researcher.\n\n        -  While you are resting comfortably in the scanner, we will ask you to work on the tasks\n           mentioned above and while you do the MRI machine will produce images of your brain, as\n           well as scan your brain at rest. You will be in the scanner for less than 60 minutes.\n\n        -  Upon completion of the study, we will tell you about the general goals of the study and\n           answer any questions that you may have.\n\n           1-Week Follow-Up Phone Call: In the follow-up phone call you will be asked to\n           participate in the following:\n\n        -  We will call you about one week after your last study visit to inquire whether you\n           experienced any drug side effects or any health problems.\n\n      If you participate in this research study, as mentioned above, we will collect blood,\n      saliva, and urine samples in separate containers for laboratory tests. The samples will be\n      stored in a locked space at the Institute on Aging and at the Department of Psychology at\n      the University of Florida. We will use the samples to measure levels of hormones such as\n      oxytocin and their effects on your thought process and behavior in the study. And we will\n      use the genetic material (DNA, RNA, and protein) to look at how the activity of your genes\n      may impact your thought process and behavior.\n\n      The genetic material we obtain from the samples will be stored until the end of the study.\n      By temporarily storing the genetic material, we will be able to examine the importance of\n      different oxytocin genes as well as other genes that are not yet known as being involved in\n      how people think and behave.\n\n      When there is no longer sufficient amounts of blood, saliva, and urine samples collected\n      from you for analysis, or samples  become degraded, or you request in writing that we\n      destroy it, any remaining genetic material will be destroyed. The genetic material will only\n      be accessible to the research staff and will be labeled only by an identification number,\n      not your name. The University of Florida will not sell the samples and will not use the DNA\n      for cloning."
