      This pilot clinical trial studies the feasibility and effectiveness of a new computer-based
      communication intervention in supporting distance caregivers of patients with advanced lung
      or brain cancer. Unlike local caregivers, distance caregivers often receive little, if any,
      professional support and have limited communication with the oncology team. Using a
      computer-based communication intervention to allow distance caregivers the opportunity to
      participate in a physician visit, have questions and concerns addressed, and meet members of
      the oncology team may help reduce stress.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. What is the relationship of primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and
      patient quality of life [QOL]) and structural factors/stressors (age, gender, race, and
      education) with patient and caregiver psychological outcomes at baseline? II. What are the
      effects of the Communication with Long Distance Caregivers Offering a Supportive Electronic
      Resource (CLOSER) intervention on distance caregiver psychological outcomes (anxiety and
      distress), controlling for primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and patient
      quality of life), distance caregiver structural factors/stressors (caregiver age, gender,
      race, and employment), and baseline anxiety and distress? III. What are the effects of the
      CLOSER intervention on patient psychological outcomes (anxiety and distress), controlling
      for primary stressors (type and stage/grade of cancer, and patient quality of life),
      distance caregiver structural factors/stressors (caregiver age, gender, race, and
      employment), and baseline anxiety and distress? IV. What is the feasibility (time, cost,
      resources and acceptability to patients, caregivers and clinicians) of using Adobe Connect,
      a computer-based web communication system, with the distance caregiver, the parent with
      advanced cancer, and the health care providers together in a routine follow-up oncology
      office visit? V. What is the experience of being a distance caregiver participating in the
      CLOSER intervention?

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive usual care for 5 weeks. During the week 5 office visit, distance
      caregivers are not present.

      ARM II: Participants receive usual care for 5 weeks. During the week 5 visit, distance
      caregivers virtually attend using the CLOSER intervention with computer video and audio
      connection.

      After completion of study, participants are followed up within 48-96 hours.
