Impact of the study is to\n           evaluate if patients with advanced solid cancers show advanced clinical benefit under\n           the treatment with the pan FGFR inhibitor. Patients (all comers) will receive the study\n           drug treatment in a dose-escalation scheme (no placebo group) to determine the safety,\n           tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BAY1163877. The relative\n           bioavailability of liquid service formulation and tablets will be determined.\n\n        -  After the MTD is defined patients with solid tumors (all comers), lung cancer (squamous\n           non-small cell lung cancer) or bladder cancer will be enrolled according to their FGFR\n           gene expression profile (biomarker stratification).\n\n        -  The study will also assess the pharmacokinetics, biomarker status, pharmacodynamic\n           parameters and tumor response of BAY1163877.\n\n        -  BAY1163877 will be given twice daily as oral application. Treatment will be stopped if\n           the tumor continues to grow, if side effects, which the patient cannot tolerate, occur\n           or if the patient decides to exit treatment."
