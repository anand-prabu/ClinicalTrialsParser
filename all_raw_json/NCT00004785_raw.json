The first group receives intravenous dexamethasone tapered over\n      42 days.\n\n      The second group receives daily intravenous dexamethasone for 6 days, then intravenous\n      methylprednisolone (MePRDL) tapered over the next 34 days, beginning on day 8.  A placebo is\n      given on \"off\" MePRDL days.\n\n      The third group receives an intravenous placebo for 42 days, with a tapering schedule\n      beginning day 35.\n\n      All patients may receive 6 days of dexamethasone rescue therapy beginning day 15 and/or 30,\n      as clinically indicated.  Study drugs are suspended during rescue therapy."
