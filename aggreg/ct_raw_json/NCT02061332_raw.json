HER-2/neu over-expressing DCIS represents a group of\n      patients with significant risk for development of invasive breast cancer.  In this proposal\n      we will continue to evaluate the development of type I polarized DC for the treatment of\n      DCIS by evaluating whether further improvements in therapeutic response can be achieved by\n      intratumoral administration of HER-2/neu pulsed DC1 compared with our current intranodal\n      administration. Women who are diagnosed with Her-2/neu over-expressing DCIS with no invasive\n      carcinoma will be eligible for this study.  Patients will receive DC1 vaccines by\n      intranodal, intralesional, or both routes of administration. The primary objective will be\n      safety and administration with secondary objectives of immune activation and clinical\n      response. We will also develop a novel assay to monitor ongoing immunity to HER-2/neu, and\n      lastly will begin to develop these vaccines for patients with invasive breast cancer as\n      well.  Fifty-four subjects will be randomized to one of three treatment arms: intranodal\n      injection, intralesional injection, or intranodal and intralesional injection of the\n      vaccine. Upon entering this study, the subjects' blood will be drawn in a way that collects\n      only the white blood cells. Subjects then receive six vaccines over a six week period. They\n      will then undergo the standard surgical procedure to remove any remaining DCIS in the\n      breast."
