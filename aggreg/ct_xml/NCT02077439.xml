  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine robotic hand system is more effective than
      conventional physical and occupational therapy at promoting functional recovery of the
      affected arm in subjects after stroke.

      This study will investigate the recovery in hand and upper limb functions when the physical
      training is assisted by an exoskeleton robotic hand system.

      Subjects with a pure unilateral motor paresis after a stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic). All
      subjects should have sufficient cognition to follow simple instructions as well as
      understand the content and purpose of the experiment, and also should be able to sit up for
      1 hour.

      During the training, you will be asked to do the hand open and hand grasp by
      Electromyography-driven robotic control strategy.

      There will be evaluations on the upper limb motor functions before and after the 20-session
      of training and  follow up session by clinical assessments on functional recovery.

Baseline assessment will be conducted at within one week prior to intervention. Participants will be followed for the duration of hospital stay, an expected average of 5 weeks for the 20-session intervention. The assessment at the end of intervention will be conducted within one week after the intervention. The other two assessments will be conducted at three months and six months after the last session of the intervention.</description>
