            "textblock": "Depression is common among elderly with an estimated prevalence of 5%. Due to ageing the\n      national burden will double in the coming decade. Antidepressants as TCAs and SSRIs are\n      effective in reducing symptoms, especially in people with severe depression. To optimize\n      treatment efficacy and reduce side effects, the Pharmacogenetics Working Group of the Royal\n      Dutch Pharmacists Association developed guidelines for dose-adaptation, for instance for\n      antidepressants such as nortriptyline and venlafaxine based on their main relevant genotype\n      (CYP2D6) accompanied by Therapeutic Drug Monitoring. Such personalized drug dosing based on\n      pharmacogenetic information at the start of therapy can speed up the titration phase of\n      antidepressants to establish an adequate maintenance dose. However, pharmacogenetic\n      screening programs are expensive and evidence on effects and costs of such a program among\n      elderly antidepressant starters from randomized controlled studies is lacking. The\n      investigators will conduct a pragmatic randomized controlled trial to determine the effects\n      and costs of pharmacogenetic screening information to optimize drug dosing in depressed\n      elderly patients who start with nortriptyline or venlafaxine.\n\n      Objective: The primary objective is to determine the effects of pharmacogenetic screening\n      for CYP2D6 on the time to reach adequate blood levels as an accepted proxy for adequate\n      treatment. Secondary objectives include adverse drug reactions and cost-effectiveness\n\n      Study design: pragmatic randomized controlled intervention study"
