  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dexmedetomidine is increasingly used for sedation in children placed on cardiopulmonary
      bypass for heart surgery. It is also often used after surgery and may be particularly
      helpful for children with heart disease. In order for this medication to be helpful and to
      minimize risks associated with taking the medication, it is important to provide correct
      dosing for this medication. Based on evidence from studies of other medications used during
      heart surgery, it is likely that dosing of dexmedetomidine while on cardiopulmonary bypass
      is different from dosing in other settings. The purpose of this study is to evaluate how the
      heart-lung bypass machine affects dexmedetomidine levels in the body.
