      Up to 100 clinical sites will enroll subjects who have received CorMatrix ECM for
      pericardial reconstruction.

      The following clinical data will be collected at a single post-operative visit:

        -  Demographic information

        -  Pre-operative risk factors

        -  Surgical procedure

        -  Blood transfusion information, if applicable

        -  Chest tube placement information

        -  Surgical complications

        -  Use of anticoagulation medication

        -  Cardiac related procedures since surgical procedure

        -  Device related adverse events
