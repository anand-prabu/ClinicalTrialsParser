The study examined the impact of diets\n      high and low in extrinsic sugars, on the metabolism of lipids and lipoproteins in vivo, of\n      two groups of men with a high (>10%)and low (<2%)percentage of liver fat, by the\n      trace-labelling of these lipid moieties with stable isotopes, and detection by gas\n      chromatography mass spectrometry. The study had a two-way cross-over design, with two, 12\n      week dietary interventions separated by a six week wash-out period. The dietary intervention\n      with high and low sugars was achieved by a dietary exchange with supermarket foods, which\n      were consumed within the homes of the participants."
