    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, observational prospective cohort study in France and Germany.
      Treatment centres with a focus on treating subjects with mCRC will be prospectively defined
      for potential inclusion in the study. Eligible subjects will be enrolled and have
      retrospective data collected from Baseline up to the point of enrolment.  All subsequent
      chemotherapy cycles and Vectibix® doses will be recorded prospectively.  Each subject will
      have data collected until approximately 30 days after the end of Vectibix® treatment, death,
      withdrawal of consent, loss to follow-up or up to 12 months from the first dose of
      Vectibix®, whichever occurs first.

        All treatment centres (inpatient and outpatient) with a focus on treating subjects with
        mCRC. Centres will be selected to represent academic, oncology and specialist settings and
        to provide geographical diversity in France and Germany.

        Inclusion Criteria

          -  Subject is ≥ 18 years of age at date of enrolment

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed carcinoma of colon or rectum

          -  Subject with metastatic carcinoma of colon or rectum

          -  Confirmed wild-type KRAS status of tumour

          -  Subjects whose care will be managed primarily by the enrolling physician and/ or all
             records will be available

             infusion.

          -  Subjects treated with at least one infusion of Vectibix® in combination with
             chemotherapy a maximum of 42 days before entering study: first-line in combination
             with FOLFOX or second-line in combination with FOLFIRI in subjects who have received
             first-line fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy (excluding irinotecan) for treatment
             of wild-type KRAS mCRC per approved prescribing information

          -  Subject or subject's legally acceptable representative has provided informed consent
             (for countries where required per local regulations)

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Ongoing or planned concurrent participation in any clinical study where the dosing of
             Vectibix® is determined by the protocol (participation in clinical trials on an
             approved drug and observational trials are permitted but these cannot mandate how
             mCRC should be treated)
