Tusek's Guided Imagery for Pre-Procedure/Surgery\u2122 with nature sounds to\n      determine their effects on a specific group of pre- and post-operative patients, compared to\n      no integrative medicine intervention - considered Standard of Care. A total of 225 patients\n      undergoing surgical hip or knee replacement will participate; one third of the patient\n      population will receive the 'M'-Technique touch intervention, one third will receive Tusek's\n      Guided Imagery intervention delivered by headsets monitored by therapists from our Center\n      for Complementary Medicine (CCM) and one third will comprise the control group, consisting\n      of routine preoperative & postoperative care without integrated intervention.\n\n      Patients will be asked to complete Pain and Anxiety scales at four different timepoints\n      throughout their hospital stay. These will occur at Same Day Surgery (pre-operatively), and\n      Post Operatively Day 0, Day 1 & Day 2.\n\n      Rationale: Patients are often at their most vulnerable just prior to surgery when their\n      stress and anticipation are high and again immediately afterward when their energy is lower\n      and their bodies are trying to accommodate after an invasive procedure. In addition, the\n      patient and his or her family sense a lack of control and feel a rise in anxiety over the\n      possible outcomes. This stress, anxiety, and pain associated with surgery and recovery can\n      increase complication rates and slow recovery times resulting in longer hospital stays."
