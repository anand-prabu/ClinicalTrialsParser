Each lesion was ablated continuously until the local potential amplitude decreased by >80% or RF energy deliveries exceeded 40 s.\nThe endpoint of ablation was complete PVI; this was confirmed when Lasso catheter mapping showed the disappearance of all PV potentials or the dissociation of PV potentials from LA activity. Only in patients with induced left atrial flutter, additional RF ablation lines were created by connecting the left inferior PV to the mitral annulus (mitral isthmus) and the roof of the LA between the two superior PVs."
