            "textblock": "Benzodiazepines (BZD) are the most prescribed psychiatric drugs in Brazil, especially for\n      women. Although it is recommended that the use of BZD is not greater than four weeks, there\n      are many cases of prolonged use due to the lack of treatment options for dealing with\n      complaints of insomnia. Given this, the aim of this project is to evaluate the program\n      Mindfulness-Based Relapse Prevention (MBRP) for adult women with chronic use of\n      benzodiazepine (BZD) to induce sleep. Specifically aims to evaluate if the MBRP program, can\n      reduce the pattern of use and level of dependence of chronic users of BZD under gradual\n      reduction (tapering) or cessation of the use of BZD. This study will be conducted at the\n      Drug Dependency Unit (UDED) of the Department of Psychobiology of Federal University of S\u00e3o\n      Paulo. The study will count with two groups: intervention group (IG) and control group (CG)\n      (that will stay in the waitlist until the eighth month . The sample will comprise 100 women\n      with chronic use of BZD as hypnotics, 50 will be randomized in the IG condition and 50 in\n      the CG condition. Changes will be evaluated on several variables such as cessation and\n      dependence of BZD, quality of life, sleep, anxiety, depression and sexual satisfaction\n      before and after the intervention in both groups. The data will be submitted to descriptive\n      and inferential bivariate and multivariate statistic analyzes. It is hoped that this study\n      create subsidies for the development of complementary interventions for the management of\n      withdrawal symptoms in chronic users of BZD."
