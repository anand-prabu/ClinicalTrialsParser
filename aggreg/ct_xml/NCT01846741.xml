      Obtain baseline clinical outcome data (Stage 1) upon which to base a subsequent study (Stage
      2) of the Model 106 VNS implantable pulse generator

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, observational, un-blinded, multi-site study designed to collect data on
      patients implanted with a Model 106 VNS Therapy System from baseline through an EMU stay of
      up to 5 days, and 6-month follow-up.  After the 6-month follow-up, patients will continue
      follow-up for safety for approximately two years or until final regulatory approval of the
      product.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with a clinical diagnosis of medically refractory epilepsy with partial
             onset seizures suitable for implantation with the VNS Therapy System.

          -  Patients willing to undergo an EMU evaluation for a period of at least three days
             with activation of the AMM feature during that time.

          -  Patients must be at least 12 years old.

          -  Patients must be in good general health and ambulatory.

          -  Patient or guardian must be willing and able to complete informed consent/assent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients have had a bilateral or left cervical vagotomy.

          -  Patients currently using, or are expected to use, short-wave diathermy, microwave
             diathermy, or therapeutic ultrasound diathermy.

          -  A VNS Therapy System implant would (in the investigator's judgment) pose an
             unacceptable surgical or medical risk for the patient.

          -  Patients expected to require full body magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

          -  Patients have a history of implantation of the VNS Therapy.

          -  Patients with an IQ known or estimated to be &lt; 70, history of depression requiring
             hospitalization, or suicidality as defined by DSM IV-TR that in the investigator's
             judgment would pose an unacceptable risk for the patient or prevent the patient's
             successful completion of the study.

          -  Patients with a history of status epilepticus within 1 year of study enrollment.

          -  Patients with known clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmias as well as
             patients with clinically meaningful cardiovascular arrhythmias determined by a
             24-hour Holter recording obtained during the baseline period.

          -  Patients dependent on alcohol or narcotic drugs as defined by DSM IV-TR within the
             past 2 years.

          -  Patients with a history of psychogenic non-epileptic seizures.

          -  Women who are pregnant. Women of childbearing age must take a pregnancy test and
             agree to use an approved method of contraception during the study.

          -  Patients currently enrolled in another investigational study.
