Subjects will be randomized to receive either FF/VI 100/25 via NDPI or\n      Fluticasone Propionate/Salmeterol 250/50mcg via ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Matching placebos will be\n      available in NDPI and ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each morning (approximately 6-10 AM) subjects will\n      take 1 inhalation from the NDPI followed by 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Each\n      evening (approximately 6-10 PM), approximately 12 hours after the morning dose with blinded\n      study medication, subjects will take 1 inhalation from the ACCUHALER/DISKUS. Subjects will\n      return to the clinic at the end of the treatment period.\n\n      A follow-up phone contact will be performed approximately 7 days after the last clinic\n      visit. The overall study duration (Screening to Follow-up) for each subject is approximately\n      15 weeks."
