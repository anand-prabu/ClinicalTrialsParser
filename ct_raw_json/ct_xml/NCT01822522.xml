      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of cabozantinib-s-malate in
      treating patients with advanced solid tumors and human immunodeficiency virus.
      Cabozantinib-s-malate may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes
      needed for cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of cabozantinib (XL184) (cabozantinib-s-malate)
      as a single agent in solid tumor patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection
      and to determine the maximal tolerated dose (MTD) in this patient population.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To investigate possible pharmacokinetic interactions between cabozantinib and
      antiretroviral therapy in persons with HIV infection.

      II. To investigate the effects of therapy on patient immune status and HIV viral load.

      III. To preliminarily assess objective response rates associated with treatment for commonly
      represented tumors.

      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.

      Patients receive cabozantinib-s-malate orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Courses
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

             regardless of antiretroviral medication (including no antiretroviral medication)
             provided there is no intention to initiate therapy or the regimen has been stable for
             at least 4 weeks with no intention to change the regimen within 8 weeks following

                  before the first dose of study treatment

               -  History of major surgery as follows:

                    -  Major surgery within 3 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there
                       were no wound healing complications or within 6 months of the first dose of
                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

                    -  Minor surgery within 1 months of the first dose of cabozantinib if there
                       were no wound healing complications or within 3 months of the first dose of
                       cabozantinib if there were wound complications

               -  In addition, complete wound healing from prior surgery must be confirmed at
                  least 28 days before the first dose of cabozantinib irrespective of the time
                  from surgery

          -  The subject is unable to swallow tablets that are whole (do not crush or chew or
             administer via nasogastric [NG]-tube)

          -  The subject has a corrected QT interval calculated by the Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt;
             500 ms within 28 days before randomization; note: If initial QTcF is found to be &gt;
             500 ms, two additional electrocardiogram (ECGs) separated by at least 3 minutes
             should be performed; if the average of these three consecutive results for QTcF is =&lt;
             500 ms, the subject meets eligibility in this regard

          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic
             composition to cabozantinib (XL184)

          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study; breastfeeding should be discontinued if
             the mother is treated with cabozantinib
