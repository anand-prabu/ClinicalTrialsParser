In\n      developing countries resources are scarce and it is difficult to provide expensive\n      treatments as neonatal care.\n\n      Aim of the Work: To assess the effect of prophylactic dexamethasone administration before\n      elective cesarean section at term in reducing neonatal respiratory complications.\n\n      Patients and methods:  600 women were included in the study and were planned to have\n      elective caesarean section. 300 received dexamethasone 12 mg twice, 12 hours apart 48 hours\n      before delivery. 300 patients were the control group.\n\n      The outcomes were: incidence of admission to neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), incidence\n      of transient tachypnea of newborn (TTN), the incidence of respiratory distress syndrome\n      (RDS) and the need for mechanical ventilation."
