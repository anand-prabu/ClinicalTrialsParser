It can be systemic by affecting other organs including the\n      gastrointestinal tract, skin, lungs, vasculature, kidneys, bladder and vagina.  Involvement\n      of the musculature can lead to fibromyalgia-like symptoms and chronic fatigue, while\n      approximately 20% of patients develop various neuropathies, including sensory, peripheral,\n      cranial and myelopathic neuropathies exhibited by cognitive impairments such as dementia,\n      lack of concentration, memory loss and various psychiatric disorders.  Like most autoimmune\n      connective tissue diseases, SjS shows a sexual dimorphism with women affected 10-times more\n      frequently than men, suggesting a role for sex hormones in disease susceptibility or\n      progression.  One common feature of SjS is it infiltration of mononuclear cells into the\n      salivary and lacrimal glands, aggregating into clusters referred to as lymphocytic foci\n      (LF).  Critical to the studies proposed is the fact that a predominant cell population of LF\n      is the pathogenic TH17 cell that produces IL-17 cytokine and autoreactive B cells reactive\n      to M3R, Ro, and La autoantigens.  The goal of this study is characterize the change in\n      receptor gene repertoires of autoreactive B and T cells at different time points during the\n      disease process and examine the correlation with various disease parameters."
