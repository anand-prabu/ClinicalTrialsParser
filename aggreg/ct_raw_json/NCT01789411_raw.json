AtheroRemo-IVUS is a prospective,\n      observational, cohort study of patients who underwent coronary catheterization for acute\n      coronary syndrome or stable angina pectoris. Prior to the catheterization procedure, blood\n      samples were drawn for biomarker measurements and genetic analyses. Subsequent to the\n      catheterization procedure, intravascular ultrasound is performed in a non-culprit coronary\n      artery. In patients who are also participating in the AtheroRemo-NIRS substudy,\n      near-infrared spectroscopy is additionally performed in the same non-culprit vessel. Primary\n      endpoint is the presence of vulnerable plaque as determined by intravascular ultrasound.\n      Secondary endpoint is long-term incidence of major adverse cardiac events. Results from\n      AtheroRemo-IVUS are expected to improve our knowledge on the role of genetic profile and\n      inflammation in the development of atherosclerosis and vulnerable plaques. Furthermore,\n      novel biomarkers and intracoronary imaging techniques will be validated in this study."
