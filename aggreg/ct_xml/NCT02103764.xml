  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of the present study is to determine the effectiveness of cyclic desogestrel
      (DSG) compared with cyclic medroxyprogesterone acetate for the treatment of anovulatory
      dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) in the following aspects:

        1. Endometrial histopathology changes

        2. Menstrual cycle control.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anovulatory dysfunctional uterine bleeding (DUB) is the most common cause of abnormal
      uterine bleeding especially in postmenarcheal adolescent, perimenopausal women, patient with
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and in obese women. Aims of treatment in women with
      anovulatory DUB are to restore the natural control mechanism of endometrium (introduce
      normal synchronous growth, development, shedding of a structural stable endometrium) and to
      prevent endometrial hyperplasia. The two main treatment options are estrogen-progestin
      therapy and progestin therapy. Women who are sexually active and not immediately prepared to
      pursue pregnancy are best manage by estrogen-progestin treatment especially combined oral
      contraceptive pills (COCs) but in perimenopausal women, obese women or women who can't
      tolerate COCs or have contraindications in using COCs, cyclic progestin will be the
      treatment of choice. Common used progestin in anovulatory DUB is medroxyprogesterone acetate
      (MPA) 5-10 mg/day for 10-14 days each month. This progestin has strong progestogenic effect
      but has some undesirable effect such as glucocorticoid effect, mineralocorticoid effect and
      androgenic effect. Long term using this progestin especially in obese women or
      perimenopausal women who have risk for diabetes mellitus and dyslipidemia may be negative
      effect to glucose and lipid metabolism. DSG is the third generation progestin with no
      glucocorticoid, mineralocorticoid effect and low androgenic effect may be the better choice
      of treatment but the data of DSG in treatment of anovulatory DUB us scanty. So this study
      will evaluate the effect of cyclic DSG in endometrial histology changing and lipid, glucose
      metabolism in patient with anovulatory DUB.

      Comparison : Women with anovulatory DUB are randomized into two groups,  receiving a course
      of either cyclic DSG or cyclic MPA. The main outcome measured is to compare the effect of
      both interventions on endometrial histology changing.
