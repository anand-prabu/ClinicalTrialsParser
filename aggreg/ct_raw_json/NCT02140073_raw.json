Screening - preliminary selection of subjects according to clinical criteria; signing\n           of informed consent; prescription and conduction of screening procedures; decision on\n           inclusion/exclusion of subject from the trial on the grounds of the results of\n           screening procedures according to inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n        2.

Treatment - patients receive either Omez-DSR preparation or Omez preparation in the\n           prescribed regimen according to the randomization number. Treatment shall be\n           ambulatory; patients shall visit research center through specified periods.\n\n        4.
