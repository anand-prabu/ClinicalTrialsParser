  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to identify if there exists a correlation between the preoperative
      cardiopulmonary capacity - measured in MET's - and the perioperative lactate serum level.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The determination of the cardiopulmonary (c/p) capacity is very important for the evaluation
      of every patient undergoing surgery. The ability to climb at least two flight of stairs is
      seen to be an acceptable c/p capacity for surgery. There are several ways to evaluate the
      fitness of patients. A common method to estimate the cardiopulmonary capacity is defining
      patients through the MET's (metabolic equivalents) scale. MET's can be defined relatively
      easy through a simple questionnaire. Patients with a reduced c/p capacity have less than 4
      MET's, patients with a relatively good c/p capacity have 4-10 MET's and patients with a
      excellent c/p capacity have more than 10 MET's.

      The lactate level in blood serum is a common parameter to asses anaerobic metabolism in
      patients. A high lactate level correlates with higher mortality rates and outcome.

      To yet it is not clear if there exists a correlation between the preoperative
      cardiopulmonary capacity measured in MET's and the perioperative lactate level. We
      hypothysed that patients with a reduced cardiopulmonary capacity are associated with higher
      perioperative lactate levels, as these group of patients compensate the stressors
      operation/anesthesia less than patients with a good c/p capacity.
