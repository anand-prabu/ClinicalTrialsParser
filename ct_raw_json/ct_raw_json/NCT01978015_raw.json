The  treatment of glaucoma  is mainly based in reducing\n      intraocular pressure (IOP) with topical medications. Many patients required two or more\n      medications to achieve a target IOP. Combinations of B-blockers and prostaglandin analogs\n      (PGA) are frequently used in clinical practice because their additive effect in lowering IOP\n      levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of fixed combinations of\n      timolol maleate and PGA on the blood-aqueous barrier and evaluate the measurement of foveal\n      thickness in pseudophakic patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG)."
