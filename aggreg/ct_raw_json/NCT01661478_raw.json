Health care providers will be surveyed before\n      the SBIRT Counselors begin and again at 6 months, after full SBIRT program with substance\n      counselors on site has been in place, as a part of their regular staff education\n      requirements.  Part of the goal of the SBIRT counselors is to educate providers about\n      treatment and analyze data collected by and comments of Emergency Room staff."
