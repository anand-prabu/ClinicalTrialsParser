The investigators will\n      test this by assessing autonomic function through a dive reflex protocol."

Here the investigators\n      required a well validated test of the dynamic cardiovascular response to an abrupt stimulus\n      and considered the diving reflex the most reliable and practical. In man, the diving reflex\n      acts as a vestigial reflex aimed at conserving oxygen storage during apnoeic facial\n      immersion. Facial immersion activates a vagally-induced bradycardia and a sympathetically\n      activated alpha-adrenergic peripheral vasoconstriction and hypertension. There are two\n      triggers of the diving reflex, facial immersion in water and breath hold, both of which can\n      impact on heart rate attenuation. Facial immersion can be further delineated into exposure\n      to cold, wetness and pressure."
