  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent, research has focused on the evaluation of non-invasive methods for the assessment of
      liver fibrosis in patients with chronic liver disease. Among these methods, transient
      elastography is the most promising. The method has been investigated mainly in patients with
      viral hepatitis. Several studies have shown, that the optimal cut-off value of TE for
      detection of liver cirrhosis by transient elastography is highly dependent on the aetiology
      of the underlying liver disease. Only a few studies have evaluated the value of transient
      elastography for patients with autoimmune liver disease and here primarily patients with PBC
      and PSC. For patients with autoimmune hepatitis the data is limited. We prospectively
      investigated the diagnostic accuracy of TE in autoimmune hepatitis compared to liver
      histology with and without inclusion of the macroscopic appearance using mini-laparoscopy

      The aim of the current study was to assess the diagnostic performance of transient
      elastography for the determination of cirrhosis in patients with autoimmune hepatitis
      compared to the diagnosis of cirrhosis made on

        1. histopathologic examination and

        2. macroscopic appearance on minilaparoscopy combined with liver histology Patients
           referred for liver biopsy and transient elastography with a clinical diagnosis of AIH
           followed in the liver clinic of the Department of Gastroenterology at the UKE were
           prospectively included in the study.

      Inclusion criteria were as follows: Confirmed diagnosis of AIH based on the diagnostic
      criteria revised by the International Autoimmune Hepatitis Group 2008 (20): 1. liver related
      autoantibodies, 2. hypergammaglobulinaemia, 3.typical histological findings and 4. absence
      of viral markers. Exclusion criteria were morbid obesity (BMI &gt; 40), ascites, ileus or
      subileus, peritonitis, pregnancy, extrahepatic cholestasis and a severe inflammatory flare
      of AIH.

      Blood liver tests including gamma-globulines, IgG, IgM, liver related autoantibodies (ANA,
      AMA, LKM, SMA, SLA) and viral markers (HBsAg, Anti HBs, Anti HBc, Anti HCV, Anti HAV) were
      performed before LB.

      Each patient underwent abdominal ultrasound to exclude extrahepatic cholestasis prior to TE
      and minilaparoscopic liver biopsy. TE and minilaparoscopy were performed by physicians
      blinded to the results the other within a period of less than 3 months.
