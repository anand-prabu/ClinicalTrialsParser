      Project Aims:  The primary aim is to establish normal ultrasound parameters in healthy
      children for internal jugular collapse during respiration.  The secondary aim is to explore
      potential ultrasound parameters which could be used as surrogate markers for pulmonary
      function in the management of children with acute asthma.

      Hypothesis:  Ultrasound measurements of internal jugular vein collapse of children can be
      reliably measured.  Children experiencing an asthma exacerbation will have significantly
      different measurements than of the same age who are healthy.  In addition, ultrasound
      measurements of the lung and vasculature will correlate with pulmonary function testing and
      asthma clinical scoring.

      Intervention:  For patients in the normal respiratory physiology (NRP) group, medications
      and past medical history will be recorded, along with documentation that the patient has not
      had any recent respiratory symptoms or fever.   For the acute asthmatics (AA) group, history
      of present illness, underlying asthma severity, asthma-related treatment including
      admission/discharge from ED, medications, and past medical history will be recorded.

      Spirometry readings will be collected on all patients.  In addition, a clinical asthma score
      will be assigned using the Modified Woods pulmonary index scoring system.

      Using bedside ultrasonography with the Sonosite Titan ultrasound machine, each measurement
      will be taken with the subject lying in bed with the head of the bed elevated at 45 degrees
      with the subject's head in the neutral position.  Initially, measurements of the internal
      jugular vein at maximal inhalation and exhalation will be recorded, and the difference
      between the two will be calculated.

        Inclusion Criteria:

        Aged 6-17 years old presenting to the emergency department (ED) will be enrolled into the
        normal respiratory function group into the age quartiles (6-8 years, 9-11 years, 12-14
        years and 15-17 years).  The 40 subjects enrolled into the acute exacerbation group will
        have a previous physician diagnosis of asthma per parent report and an acute asthma
        exacerbation requiring corticosteroids per ED attending physician or fellow.

        Exclusion Criteria:

        Children in the normal respiratory function group will be excluded from participation if
        they have: a baseline chronic lung disorder (including asthma), current respiratory
        illness, fever, Emergency Services Index (ESI) triage category of less than or equal to 3
        (high acuity), chronic cough, dyspnea with exercise, wheezing, or a history of smoking by
        self and/or parent report.

        Children in the acute exacerbation group will be excluded from enrollment if they have a
        history of baseline chronic lung disease, not including asthma.  In addition, a
        co-existing acute pulmonary process (e.g. lobar pneumonia), and impending respiratory
        failure will exclude from participation.  Those who are unable to perform spirometry
        measurements per spirometry measuring protocol (see Appendix: Figure 1) will be excluded
        from participation.

        Subjects will be excluded from either of the groups if they had prior cardiac/pulmonary
        disease or surgeries (other than asthma for the acute exacerbation group), significant
        musculoskeletal abnormalities (such as scoliosis) that might compromise baseline pulmonary
        function testing, a history of smoking tobacco or marijuana, and prematurity (birth at
        less than 37 weeks gestation.  In addition, those with an allergy to ultrasound gel will
        be excluded from participation.
