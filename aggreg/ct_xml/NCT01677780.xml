    <textblock>
      This open-label, extension study is designed to provide access to RO5045337 to patients who
      have completed studies NO21279, NO21280, NP25299, NP28021 or NP28023. Patients are eligible
      to participate in this study (NP28366) if they have shown clinical benefit on treatment of
      RO5045337 at the completion of their respective parent study. Patients will continue on the
      same formulation, dose and schedule of RO5045337 they were receiving at the time of
      transitioning from the parent clinical study protocol. The anticipated time on study
      treatment is 12 months.
