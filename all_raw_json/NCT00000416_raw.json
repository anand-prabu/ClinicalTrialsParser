This study will determine\n      whether vocational rehabilitation (VR) provided to employed people with rheumatic disorders\n      will improve their ability to remain employed. VR is applied primarily to people who have\n      already lost their jobs. However, using job retention VR services may prevent, or delay, the\n      onset of employment work loss among people with rheumatic disorders. Job retention VR\n      services target important employment-loss risk factors. They do so by modifying jobs to\n      reduce barriers posed by functional limitations and symptoms, promoting future career\n      planning, and establishing an alliance with a VR counselor for ongoing assistance.\n\n      The study is a randomized, controlled trial conducted among patients with rheumatic\n      disorders recruited from the practices of rheumatologists in eastern Massachusetts.\n\n      We will randomly assign 120 study participants to receive job-retention services provided by\n      VR counselors and 120 participants (controls) to receive literature about employment-related\n      resources. We will assess intermediate outcome variables (self-efficacy, work limitations,\n      and job accommodation-seeking behaviors) and the endpoint outcome variable, work instability\n      (a measure that includes employment loss), immediately prior to the interventions and at\n      6-month intervals over a 24-month period after the interventions are carried out. We will\n      compare the outcomes of the two groups to evaluate the usefulness of job retention services\n      in forestalling work instability in this population."
