            "textblock": "Male circumcision is the most often performed operation in male children throughout the\n      world. In the western world it is not accepted to perform this procedure without adequate\n      analgesic support. Hence the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB), first described in the 70ies\n      of the 20th century, is one of the most frequently performed regional anesthetic procedures\n      in both children and adults. There are several methods described in the literature, of which\n      the one described by Dalens et al in 1989 nowadays is the most often quoted and most\n      frequently performed method. The reported rate of insufficient analgesia by DPNB is higher\n      than caudal block or penile ring wall infiltration. It is known from neuroanatomic studies,\n      that the penis is innervated mostly, but not only by the dorsal penile nerve, a final branch\n      of the pudendal nerve. A varying amount of the ventral penile skin, especially of the\n      preputium and the frenulum, is innervated by fine end branches of the perineal nerve, which\n      otherwise gives sensoric innervation to the scrotum and motor innervation to the\n      bulbospongiosus muscle. An injection of local anesthetic underneath Buck's fascia is unable\n      to reach the perineal nerve, which may be the explanation for these failures.\n\n      In this study we compare two different techniques of performing the dorsal penile nerve\n      block (DPNB): the technique according to Dalens, and a modification, where a small amount of\n      the local anesthetic for the dorsal penile nerve block (DPNB) is withheld, and then injected\n      subcutaneously at the ventral transition between the penis and the scrotum in the midline.\n      The latter injection at the site of perineal innervation is a relic of the penile ring wall\n      infiltration, which surely blocks all skin fibres of both the dorsal penile nerve and the\n      perineal nerve.\n\n      All patients included randomly receive either two injections at the dorsum penis according\n      to Dalens' technique, or two injections at the dorsum penis according to Dalens' technique\n      plus on subcutaneous injection in the ventral midline of the penis at the transition between\n      the penis and the scrotum. The amount of local anesthetic (bupivacaine 0,75%, 0,2 ml/kg of\n      body weight) and dosing of narcotics (Sevoflurane 2,2 Vol% end-expiratory gas in an\n      oxygen-air mixture) is the same in both groups."
