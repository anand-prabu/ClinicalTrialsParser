  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that early viral infections alter the
      bacterial flora and inflammatory profile in the airway and accelerate progression of
      pulmonary disease in infants with cystic fibrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a unique international collaboration between three large CF research
      centers. This proposal will determine the impact of early respiratory viral infections on
      bacterial flora and inflammatory profiles in the CF airway as well as the impact of these
      pathogens on clinical, physiologic and structural markers of disease.The proposed study is
      designed to follow infants diagnosed with CF through newborn screening to determine the
      effect of viral infections on the lower airway microbiome, clinical symptoms, pulmonary
      function and structural changes during the first year of life. The proposed study will
      measure lower airway inflammation and infection using BAL, oral swabs, and nasal swabs;
      outcomes will be assessed through infant lung function testing, computerized tomography
      scans of the chest, and pulmonary exacerbation rate.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Diagnosis of CF by newborn screening, at least one clinical feature of CF, and
             documented sweat chloride greater than 60 mEq/L by quantitative pilocarpine
             iontophoresis or compatible genotype with two identifiable mutant CFTR alleles.

          2. Less than 4 months of age at Screening Visit

          3. Ability to comply with study visits and study procedures as judged by site
             investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Intercurrent respiratory illness, defined as increase in cough, wheezing, or
             respiratory rate with onset 14 days before iPFT-bronchoscopy visit.

          2. Measured hemoglobin oxygen saturation less than 95% during the iPFT-bronchoscopy
             visit.

          3. History of adverse reaction to sedation.

          4. Clinically significant upper airway obstruction as determined by the site
             investigator.

          5. Severe gastroesophageal reflux, defined as persistent frequent emesis despite
             therapy.

          6. Major organ dysfunction, not including pancreatic dysfunction.

          7. Physical findings that would compromise the safety of the subject or the quality of
             the study data as determined by site investigator.
