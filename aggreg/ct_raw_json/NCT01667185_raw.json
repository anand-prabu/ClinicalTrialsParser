The system performance will be\n      evaluated in terms of point and rate accuracy of the system in reference to YSI. The point\n      accuracy is measured as the proportion of G4 System values that are within \u00b120% of YSI\n      reference value for glucose levels >80 mg/dL and \u00b120 mg/dL at YSI glucose levels <80 mg/dL.\n      The trend accuracy of the device performance, i.e., continuous glucose error grid analysis,\n      will be evaluated as well as the temporal accuracy at different glucose rates of changes and\n      different glucose ranges (hypoglycemic, euglycemic, and hyperglycemic ranges). The primary\n      matched paired (Sensor-YSI) measurements will be collected during one in-clinic session.\n      System effectiveness will also be evaluated with SMBG measurements similarly.\n\n      Safety data of the system will also be collected and safety will be characterized by the\n      incidence of Adverse Device Effects (ADE) experienced by study participants.\n\n      Other objectives include the evaluation of device performance at an alternate site (the\n      upper buttocks)."
