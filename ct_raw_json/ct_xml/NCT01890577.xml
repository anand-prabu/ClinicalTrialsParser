  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An observational study to describe the treatment of anaemia in patients with chronic kidney
      disease, who are receiving dialysis treatment at selected study centres in South Africa.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This multicentre, prospective, observational study will describe the treatment and clinical
      outcomes of of dialysis patients in South Africa.  No formal hypothesis will be tested in
      this descriptive study.  Eligible subjects will be receiving either peritoneal or
      haemodialysis, will have received Aranesp therapy between 3 and 6 months prior to enrolment
      into the study, do not need to be receiving Aranesp at the time of enrolment and will be
      followed for up to 12 months after commencement of Aranesp.  Data to be collected includes
      ESA therapies, iron usage, relevant concomitant therapies, haemoglobin concentrations, other
      relevant clinical laboratory parameters and red cell transfusions.
