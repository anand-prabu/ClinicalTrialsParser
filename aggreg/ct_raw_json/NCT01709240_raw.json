Some of these methods\n      are time consuming, have potential for infection and may leave a significant scar. The\n      bioWeld1 technology suggests a new approach for incision closure. It is a novel medical\n      device that consists of a Chitosan film and the BioWeld1 plasma ejecting device. The\n      Chitosan film is intended to be applied to the skin incision, while the BioWeld1device is\n      used for welding the Chitosan to the skin by means of cold plasma technology."
