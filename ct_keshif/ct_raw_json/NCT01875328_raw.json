Patients who have\n      follow-up with telemedicine will be compared with patients following up in the usual way, by\n      coming to clinic, and will have the same expectations for medical care and lifestyle changes\n      like quitting smoking, exercising, and controlling their cholesterol.  The study will try to\n      show those stroke patients who live 75 miles or more from Oregon Health & Science University\n      (OHSU) and use a computer for follow up: 1) Will be able to complete the recommended visits\n      using telemedicine in the home as well as those who come to clinic; 2) Will have blood\n      pressures controlled at one year's time as well as those who follow up in the usual way by\n      coming into clinic; 3) The patients followed with telemedicine will be as satisfied with the\n      type of follow up they had as those followed in the usual way in the clinic.  In the future,\n      more patients who live at a distance from a major hospital might be able to get quality\n      stroke care follow up using telemedicine if the study finds that telemedicine does meet\n      these goals."
