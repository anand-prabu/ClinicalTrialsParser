  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A large number of children in developing countries lack access to known effective
      interventions. Almost 9 million die each year before reaching their fifth birthday, and over
      200 million children who survive fail to achieve their full growth or developmental
      potential, trapping them in a cycle of continuing disadvantage. The goal of &quot;SPRING&quot;,
      Sustainable Programme Incorporating Nutrition and Games, is to develop an innovative
      approach to close this access gap, in two of the worst affected countries India and
      Pakistan, using community based agents. Extensive formative research will be carried out to
      help ensure that the content and approach of the &quot;SPRING&quot; intervention is feasible,
      acceptable and appropriately targeted. Findings will be reviewed at an intervention
      development workshop with local and international stakeholders and experts, and the agreed
      intervention piloted with a few community based agents and their supervisors. Cluster
      randomised controlled trials will be carried out in each setting to evaluate the impact of
      &quot;SPRING&quot; on child growth, development and survival. The programme will include process and
      economic evaluations to provide information on the total cost of the intervention and its
      cost effectiveness, as well as development of a framework with lessons learned for
      implementing &quot;SPRING&quot; in other settings.

      The goal of &quot;SPRING&quot;, Sustainable Programme Incorporating Nutrition and Games, is to develop
      an innovative, feasible, affordable and sustainable community based approach that can
      achieve delivery at scale of known effective interventions that will maximise child
      development, growth and survival. The vision is to do this by working in close collaboration
      with government programmes in India and Pakistan, and modifying the approach, content and
      supervision of existing community based programmes to develop an innovative intervention
      package that

        -  Is designed from the outset to be feasible, affordable and appropriate for delivery at
           scale.

        -  Is delivered by low cost community based agents through home visits from pregnancy
           through the first 2 years of life, which

             -  promote evidence based newborn and child survival interventions

             -  use a problem solving and counselling approach, rather than the standard didactic
                approach, using techniques informed by evidence from the cognitive behaviour and
                interpersonal psychotherapy fields.

             -  teach care giving skills, such as early recognition of infant signals and
                capacity, enhancing mother baby interactions, providing stimulation for cognitive
                growth and development.

             -  support optimal infant and young child feeding practices.

             -  encourage participation of other family members, e.g. fathers and grandmothers.

             -  is informed by the Care for Development Package developed by the World Health
                Organization (WHO) and the United Nations International Emergency Children's Fund.

        -  Includes regular supervision, monitoring and evaluation to support the community based
           agents and ensure the quality of the intervention activities carried out.

        -  Includes a range of supporting activities developed to provide an enabling environment
           for mothers and families to carry out the interventions and skills promoted. These
           might include, for example, community group meetings, and sensitisation sessions with
           health staff.

      The specific objectives of &quot;SPRING&quot; are

        1. To test this intervention package through cluster randomised controlled trials in two
           settings, one in India and one in Pakistan, both with high rates of undernutrition and
           well established but somewhat different community based agent programmes.

        2. To evaluate the impact of the intervention on Infant mortality, child development and
           growth Maternal psychosocial distress. Coverage of key promoted interventions.

        3. To evaluate and monitor all aspects of the intervention process and implementation

        4. To cost the delivery of the intervention, and assess its cost effectiveness.

        5. To assess the effectiveness of the intervention in reducing inequities in trial
           outcomes.
