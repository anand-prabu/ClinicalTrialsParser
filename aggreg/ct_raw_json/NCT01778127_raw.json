The growing population of\n      survivors is at an increased risk of physical inactivity and associated adverse health\n      outcomes. Regular physical activity is associated with better cardiovascular and\n      musculoskeletal health.  Despite the known benefits of physical activity, nearly half of all\n      childhood cancer survivors do not meet recommended guidelines for physical activity.\n\n      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (SJCRH) want to determine if a\n      rewards-based physical activity intervention delivered via an interactive website among\n      young adolescent childhood cancer survivors, aged 11 through 14 years, will increase\n      physical activity levels and improve cardiovascular and musculoskeletal health. The\n      investigators also want to learn if this rewards-based intervention is effective. To achieve\n      this goal the investigators have designed a three-arm prospective, randomized study with two\n      reward-based intervention groups and a control group."
