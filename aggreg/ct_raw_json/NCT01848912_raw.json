The investigators are collecting data to determine whether or not subtle\n      differences in heart rate, respiratory rate and temperature will help physicians to detect\n      infection earlier in order to begin faster treatment before a patient's condition\n      deteriorates."

The fabric\n      chest strap is properly placed around and above the patient's chest and the Zephyr monitor\n      is clipped onto the strap.\n\n      The patient is asked to wear the Zephyr BioHarness device for approximately 23 hours a day,\n      beginning the day before he/she begins bone marrow transplant.  The patient is asked to\n      continue wearing the device for a period of up to 10 days or until he/she is no longer\n      experiencing any fever.  The Zephyr BioHarness device records heart rate, respiratory rate\n      and temperature for calculation of heart rate variability (HRV), respiratory rate\n      variability (RRV) and temperature variability (TV) using the Continuous Multiorgan\n      Individualized Variability Analysis (CIMVATM) software engine. The variability outcomes will\n      look at the presence, rapidity and severity of change in variability prior to the onset,\n      diagnosis and treatment of infection."
