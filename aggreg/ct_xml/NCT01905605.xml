  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sensory gating is defined as the automatic process of inhibiting brain response to repeated
      auditory sounds. Infants who brains respond similarly to two identical sounds presented
      about 1/2 second apart are more likely to have later problems with attention than infants
      who suppress response to the second sound. This study will examine whether providing a
      nutritional supplement, phosphatidylcholine, for two months in infancy will result in an
      increased likelihood of developing more robust sensory gating.
