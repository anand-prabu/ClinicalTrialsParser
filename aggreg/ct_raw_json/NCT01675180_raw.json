The state of oral health during pregnancy depends on pregnant woman's preventive oral\n           hygiene behaviour and practice.\n\n        2. Pregnant women with high level of oral health awareness and positive attitude towards\n           oral health are more likely to visit their dentists regularly and have better oral\n           hygiene compared to those with less awareness.\n\n        3. Proper information and guidance on oral hygiene care provided during pregnancy can help\n           to improve oral bacteriological milieu and reduce the dental caries risk among pregnant\n           women."
