  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To develop a computer program that will improve CT image quality and decrease the amount of
      x-ray radiation that future patients may be exposed to when they have a CT examination.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will be asking patients for their permission to save and use the sinogram from their CT
      scan. The sinogram will be de-identified and sent to an archive system for storage. It will
      be exported to a computer for processing using MBIR (model based iterative reconstruction).
      MBIR (model based iterative reconstruction) is a new method being developed to process CT
      sinograms. The newly reconstructed images will be reviewed by experts to determine if they
      are as readable and accurate as CT images created with the software that is currently being
      used. Sinogram data and the reconstructed images will be shared with collaborating
      researchers at General Electric Global Research.

    <description>Sinograms will be retrieved by an archive system and processed by MBIR (model-based image reconstruction) methods that we are developing that improve image quality (reduce noise, improve spatial resolution, reduce artifacts). We will evaluate the image quality both quantitatively and qualitatively.
We hope to develop and benchmark methods for algorithm acceleration to enable routine clinical use of MBIR (model-based image reconstruction) methods.</description>

    <description>Patients will be consented for their permission to save and use the sinogram from their CT chest/lung scan. The sinogram will be de-identified and sent to an archive system for storage.
Later it will be exported to a computer for processing using MBIR (model based image reconstruction).  The newly processed images will then be read by blinded readers. The quality of the images will be reviewed to determine if they are as readable and accurate as CT images created with the software that is currently being used.</description>
