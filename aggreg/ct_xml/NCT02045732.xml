  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PF-06342674 (RN168), being developed for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS), is an
      antibody that binds to and inhibits the human interleukin-7 receptor, a component
      potentially involved in MS.  PF-06342674 (RN168) is expected to play a role in slowing down
      the progression of the disease.

    <description>Counts of participants who had treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs), defined as newly occurring or worsening after first dose. Relatedness to [study drug] was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>

    <time_frame>127 Days</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Clearance of a drug is a measure of the rate at which a drug is metabolized or eliminated by normal biological processes.  Clearance obtained after oral dose (apparent oral clearance) is influenced by the fraction of the dose absorbed. Clearance was estimated from population pharmacokinetic (PK) modeling.  Drug clearance is a quantitative measure of the rate at which a drug substance is removed from the blood.</description>
