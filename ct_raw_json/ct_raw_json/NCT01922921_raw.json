Vaccines\n      made from HER2 intracellular domain (ICD) peptide may help the body build an effective\n      immune response to kill tumor cells that express HER2. Monoclonal antibodies, such as\n      trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some block the ability of tumors to\n      grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or carry tumor-killing\n      substances to them. Polysaccharide-K may stimulate the immune system in different ways and\n      stop tumor cells from growing. It is not yet known whether vaccine therapy and trastuzumab\n      is more effective when given with or without polysaccharide-K in treating breast cancer."
