    <textblock>
      This study was designed as a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, sequential
      multiple ascending dose study to assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of supratherapeutic
      doses of eslicarbazepine acetate in 32 healthy adult male and female subjects, with 8
      subjects per treatment group.  In each study group, subjects were to receive single doses of
      eslicarbazepine acetate or placebo once daily for 5 days.

      A series of screening evaluations was performed within a 21-day period prior to the first
      dose of study medication in order to determine the eligibility of prospective study
      participants for the trial.  Eligible subjects reported to the clinic on Day -1 prior to
      study medication administration and remained in the clinic until clinic discharge on Day 7.
      Plasma and urine samples were collected throughout the study to determine the
      pharmacokinetics of eslicarbazepine acetate and its metabolites.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Healthy male or female 18 to 45 years of age.  Women were required to be

             (hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 months prior to enrollment); using an
             intrauterine device; or double barrier (i.e. diaphragm or spermicide plus male
             condom) non-hormonal contraceptive therapy for the duration of the trial.  Female
             subjects were required to have a negative pregnancy test at screening and upon
             check-in to the study facility.

          -  BMI within the range of 18-30 kg/m2.

          -  Ability to communicate effectively with the study personnel.

          -  No significant disease or abnormal laboratory values as determined by medical
             history, physical examination or laboratory evaluations, conducted at the screening
             visit and on admission to the clinic.

             rate, rhythm or conduction.
