  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incretin effect is impaired in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), thus GLP-1
      receptor agonists are used for the treatment of T2DM. Insulin resistance is a
      pathophysiologic hallmark of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The incretin effect
      in patients with NAFLD has not been studied. The aim of this study is to quantify GLP-1
      secretion in response to oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT) in patients with NAFLD compared
      to healthy controls. The results of this study will expand the knowledge of the
      pathophysiology of NAFLD and serve as a rational for potential future treatment strategies.

        Patients with biopsy proven NAFLD and NASH will be recruited from the Hepatology
        Outpatient Clinic, Division of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, University Hospital Basel.

        Healthy control subjects will be matched to NAFLD and NASH patients.
