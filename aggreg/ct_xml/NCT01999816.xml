  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to conduct a randomized controlled trial of a lifestyle
      redesign intervention's ability to (1)reduce the incidence of medically serious pressure
      ulcers and associated surgeries in adults with spinal cord injury, and (2)assess the
      intervention's cost-effectiveness and potential cost savings and its effects on
      participants' quality of life.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medically serious pressure ulcers are a common complication of spinal cord injury (SCI), and
      are associated with high treatment costs and reduced quality of life.  This study will
      examine the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of a promising lifestyle-based intervention
      designed to reduce the incidence of pressure ulcers among culturally diverse, community
      dwelling adults with SCI who have had serious pressure ulcers.

      The intervention being tested, termed lifestyle redesign (LR), is based on prior SCI
      literature as well as on the results of a qualitative pilot study undertaken by our study
      group.  This intervention targets several psychosocial mediating variables that have been
      shown to be important in prevention of pressure ulcers in daily living contexts.
      Participants assigned to the LR condition receive individualized in-home sessions, personal
      phone calls, and incident-based contacts for a 12-month period, followed by 12 months of no
      intervention.  Participants in the control condition do not receive any study-based
      intervention, but (along with the LR group) have continuing access to the standard options
      for prevention and treatment that are available through Rancho Los Amigos National
      Rehabilitation Center.

      In addition to identifying a pressure ulcer prevention strategy, the planned research will
      lead to the development of testable theoretical models of the intervening process mechanisms
      that link the intervention to pressure ulcer reduction.
