      Phase II, observer-blind, randomized study on the safety, reactogenicity, immunogenicity and
      impact on intestinal shedding of a single dose of monovalent high-dose inactivated
      poliovirus type 2 vaccine (m-IPV2 HD) or a single dose of standard trivalent inactivated
      poliovirus vaccine (t-IPV) when given concomitantly with the third dose of bivalent oral

    <description>To assess and compare descriptively the safety of a single dose of a m-IPV2 HD vaccine in healthy infants to that of a licensed t-IPV vaccine when given concomitantly with the third dose of b-OPV measured by the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) and important medical events (IMEs) from the day of vaccine administration until day of last visit at study week 15 (~ week 21 of life).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Age: 6 weeks (-7 to +14 days).

          2. Healthy without obvious medical conditions that preclude the subject to be in the
             study as established by the medical history and physical examination.

          3. Written informed consent obtained from 1 or 2 parents or legal guardian as per Panama
             regulations.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous vaccination against poliovirus.

          2. Low birth weight (BW &lt;2,500 gm).

          3. Any confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive or immunodeficient condition including
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection.

          4. Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency.

          5. Major congenital defects or serious uncontrolled chronic illness (neurologic,
             pulmonary, gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, or endocrine).

          6. Known allergy to any component of the study vaccines.

          7. Uncontrolled coagulopathy or blood disorder contraindicating intramuscular
             injections.

          8. Administration of immunoglobulins and/or any blood products since birth or planned
             administration during the study period.

          9. Acute severe febrile illness at day of vaccination deemed by the Investigator to be a
             contraindication for vaccination (the child can be included at a later time if within
             age window and all in/exclusion criteria are met.).

         10. Member of the subject's household (living in the same house or apartment unit) has
             received OPV in the last 3 months.

         11. Subject who, in the opinion of the Investigator, is unlikely to comply with the
             protocol or is inappropriate to be included in the study for the safety or the
             benefit-risk ratio of the subject.
