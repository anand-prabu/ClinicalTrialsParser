Maternal sensitivity and responsivness are\n      high in the first hours after birth due to high oxytocin levels. Developing optimal\n      mother-child-interaction is more difficult for preterm mothers because mother and child are\n      separated after birth and the preterm infant is not able to show strong signs to promote\n      maternal sensitivity. We hypothesize that promoting skin-to-skin contact of VLBW infants and\n      their mothers for 60 minutes within the first hours after birth improves\n      mother-child-interaction at 5 to 6 months corrected age. We also hypothesize that reactivity\n      of HPA axis and molecular patterns of stress signaling pathways differ in preterm infant\n      with or without SSC after birth."
