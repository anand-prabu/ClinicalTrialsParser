This study is being conducted by researchers at Primary Children's Medical\n      Center, The John Moran Eye Center, and the University of Utah Department of Electrical\n      Engineering. The investigators have determined that a specific frequency of light is\n      particularly bothersome to migraine patients. The coating they've developed is designed to\n      block this frequency of light. Very few treatments are approved for the treatment of\n      childhood migraine. The investigators hope that these glasses will provide a safe way to\n      improve headaches in children."
