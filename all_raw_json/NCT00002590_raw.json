Estimate the toxicity and feasibility of intensifying the New York I (NYI)\n      regimen by adding etoposide and cytarabine, increasing the dose of methotrexate, using\n      pegaspargase, and compressing the treatment duration (11 months) in previously untreated\n      children with disseminated anaplastic (Ki-1 positive) large cell and large cell T-cell\n      lymphoma. II. Provide preliminary data for a future phase III study that will compare this\n      intensified regimen with the high-risk ALL regimen NYI in children with disseminated\n      lymphoblastic lymphoma. III. Continue to investigate the immunophenotype, cytogenetics, and\n      molecular biology of lymphoblastic lymphoma and their relationship to leukemia. IV. Obtain\n      preliminary data on treatment of anaplastic large cell (Ki-1) and T-cell large cell lymphoma\n      treated with intensive NYI.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients with CNS disease at diagnosis receive craniospinal irradiation on Regimen\n      A at the conclusion of Maintenance chemotherapy.

VCR/PRED/CTX/DNR/PEG-ASP; with\n      G-CSF; plus IT ARA-C/IT MTX. Consolidation: 7-Drug Combination Systemic Chemotherapy with\n      Hematopoietic Stimulation plus Single-Agent Intrathecal Chemotherapy.\n      VCR/PRED/PEG-ASP/VP-16/TG/ARA-C/MTX/CF; with G-CSF; plus IT MTX.

CTX/TG/IT MTX; VCR/PRED/DOX; VCR/MTX/CF/PEG-ASP; ARA-C/VP-16.\n      Regimen A: Radiotherapy. Craniospinal irradiation using megavoltage equipment.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 40 patients will be entered over approximately 10 months. If 4 or more\n      toxic deaths occur in the first 15 patients or 5 or more toxic deaths occur in the first 30\n      patients, accrual will stop. As of 05/96, asparaginase has been replaced with pegaspargase;\n      15-25 additional patients will be accrued. As of 01/97, a maximum of 35 patients will be\n      accrued for PEG asparaginase-containing treatment regimen. As of 5/97, this study is open\n      only to patients with anaplastic large cell and T cell large cell lymphoma. Approximately\n      60-90 patients will be accrued."
