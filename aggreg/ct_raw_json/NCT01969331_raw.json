A significant step forward was made in the current report of the European\n      Helicobacter Study Group ,which states that \"Certain probiotics and prebiotics show\n      promising results as an adjuvant treatment in reducing side effects\". At this\n      stage,probiotics are classified as Grade D recommendation. That is precisely why the\n      investigators believe that clinical studies are necessary in order for such effects to be\n      objectively proven in a clinical setting.\n\n      The investigators decided to conduct a clinical trial based on a clearly defined and\n      sufficiently frequent indication,with a preparation of known probiotic composition that is\n      easily available on the market, and in a real setting where such approach is bound to show\n      both advantages and disadvantages."
