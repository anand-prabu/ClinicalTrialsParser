      This Phase I trial studies the safety and efficacy of vaccine therapy in treating patients
      with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Liposome-based vaccines containing
      an extract of a person's cancer cells and the immunostimulant interleukin-2 may help the
      body to build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of vaccination with Oncoquest-Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL)
      vaccine (autologous tumor cell extract vaccine).

      II. To evaluate the feasibility of Oncoquest-CLL production and administration to previously
      untreated patients with CLL.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the clinical response (as defined by the International Workshop on Chronic
      Lymphocytic Leukemia 2008 [iwCLL2008]) of the Oncoquest-CLL vaccine in treatment-naive
      patients with CLL.

      II. To evaluate the T and B cell immune responses against autologous leukemia cells induced
      with Oncoquest-CLL vaccine.

      III. To measure the progression-free survival of patients treated with the Oncoquest-CLL
      vaccine.

      IV. To evaluate the change in absolute lymphocyte count and lymphocyte doubling time before
      and after vaccine administration and correlate this with immune response.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive autologous tumor vaccine subcutaneously (SC) on Study Day 1 and 15, and
      then monthly for 3 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, and then
      every 3 months for up to 1 year.

          8. All patients must have given signed, informed consent prior to registration on study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients who meet any of the NCI Working Group criteria to initiate treatment for CLL
             are NOT eligible for participation

          2. Patients who have had any prior treatment for CLL, including chemotherapy,
             corticosteroids, biologic therapy, or immunotherapy are NOT eligible for
             participation.

             corticosteroid therapy are NOT eligible for participation.

          4. Patients who are actively receiving steroids or non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs
             (NSAIDs) on a chronic basis and who are unwilling and/or unable to discontinue while
             on study therapy are NOT eligible for participation. NOTE: Patients must have

             eligible for participation.

          5. Patients who exhibit any active or on-going autoimmune processes including, but not
             limited to, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or immune thrombocytopenia purpura, are NOT
             eligible for participation.

          6. Although rare, the only exception to this would be patients with Hashimoto's
             thyroiditis who ARE eligible for participation.

             of hepatitis B surface antigen or other active infectious process that could suppress
             the immune system and potentially interfere with the development of an immune
             response to the tumor antigen are NOT eligible for participation.

          8. Patients who have a previous or concomitant malignancy are NOT eligible for
             participation EXCEPT for the following:

               -  Patients with curatively treated squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin or
