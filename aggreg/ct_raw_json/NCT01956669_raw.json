The first 10 subjects enrolled will receive the suspension formulation in Cycle 1 in order to obtain extended pharmacokinetic sampling.

This is a two-stage open label phase II trial of\n      pazopanib in children, adolescents and young adults with recurrent or refractory solid\n      tumors. Eligible patients will receive pazopanib daily as an oral tablet (450 mg/m2/dose) or\n      as a powder for suspension (160 mg/m2/dose) in 28 day cycles. The maximum dose to be\n      administered daily is 800 mg. Patients will be closely monitored with clinical and\n      laboratory observations for side effects. Response to treatment will be evaluated using\n      appropriate imaging studies. In the absence of unacceptable side effects or progressive\n      disease, patients may continue receiving pazopanib for up to 2 years."
