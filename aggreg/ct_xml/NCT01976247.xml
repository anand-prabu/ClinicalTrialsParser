    <textblock>
      At baseline visit, subjects who meet inclusion and exclusion criteria will be enrolled.
      Subjects will be randomly assigned to receive Zeltiq treatment to either their right or left
      flank The contralateral flank will receive Liposonix treatment. A total of three identical
      treatments will be completed monthly for 3 consecutive months. Subjects will return 4 weeks
      following the last treatment for follow up photography, measurements, and assessments. This
      study is a pilot study designed to determine feasibility of these procedures.

    <description>The primary outcome was a blinded rating of the treatment area (Noninvasive Cryolipolysis Device vs. a High Intensity Focused Ultrasound Device) with the best cosmetic appearance. A dermatologist will blindly evaluate the treated areas of each side from live subjects at baseline and on the final follow up visit (week 12).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Female subjects ages 30-65 years old.

          2. Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 29.99. (BMI is defined as weight in pounds
             multiplied by 703 divided by the square of the height in inches).

          3. Subjects are in good health.

          4. Willing and able to abstain from partaking in any treatment other than the study
             procedure (existing or new) to promote body contouring and/or weight loss during the
             course of study participation.

          5. Subjects agree to maintain their weight (i.e. within 5 pounds) by not making any
             changes to diet or lifestyle during the study.

          6. The subjects have the willingness and the ability to understand and provide informed
             consent for the use of their tissue and communicate with the investigator.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Pregnant or lactating or intends to become pregnant in the next 9 months.

          2. Unable to understand the protocol or to give informed consent.

          3. Any previous and/or pending procedures at the treatment area or that may likely
             affect the treatment area.

          4. Pending and/or anticipated major change in diet or exercise pattern in the six weeks
             following the last treatment or who has taken diet pills within the last 6 months..

          5. History of asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases.

          6. Active skin disease or skin infection in the treatment area.

          7. Bleeding tendency or coagulopathy.

          9. Any other condition that would, in the professional opinion of the investigator,
             potentially affect response or participation in the clinical study, or would pose as
             an unacceptable risk to the subject.
