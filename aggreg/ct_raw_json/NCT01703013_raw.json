In a prior exploratory study investigating patients with exacerbation of chronic\n      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), the investigators demonstrated a highly significant\n      correlation between the expression level of Defensin-alpha 4 (DEFA4) mRNA in blood and the\n      adrenal function assessed via low-dose ACTH tests. The aim of this prospective study is to\n      demonstrate that DEFA4 measured both at the mRNA level (RT-PCR) and at the protein level\n      (Western blot/Elisa) is a reliable biomarker for the prediction of adrenal insufficiency in\n      inflammatory lung diseases (patients with COPD and pneumonia)."
