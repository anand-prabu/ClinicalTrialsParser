The treatment is supported in an interactive advanced computing\n      platform that includes the continuous biomedical registration of the patients and a virtual\n      reality software specifically designed for critical patients.\n\n      The investigators expect an improvement in neuropsychological, psychopathological and\n      functional status at hospital discharge and 3 months follow-up in those patients that have\n      received the early neurocognitive intervention comparing with patients treated as usual.\n      Furthermore the investigators expect a decrease of episodes and/or duration of delirium in\n      ICU patients."
