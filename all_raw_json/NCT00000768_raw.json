Oral ganciclovir is a likely candidate for\n      maintenance because of its possible therapeutic value and ease of administration, but an\n      optimum dose has not been determined. Since oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability and\n      is more soluble in an acid pH environment, the addition of glutamic acid hydrochloride may\n      enhance gastrointestinal absorption of this drug."

Since oral ganciclovir has a low bioavailability and\n      is more soluble in an acid pH environment, the addition of glutamic acid hydrochloride may\n      enhance gastrointestinal absorption of this drug.\n\n      All patients receive an induction regimen of IV ganciclovir administered twice daily for 21\n      to 42 (Per Amendment 3/4/95) days. A permanent venous catheter is implanted for the\n      induction therapy. If clinically improved following induction, patients are then randomized\n      to receive one of three doses of oral ganciclovir, given first without and then with oral\n      glutamic acid hydrochloride, every 8 hours until they reach a steady state. PER AMENDMENT\n      3/14/95: After subjects have reached steady state with oral ganciclovir and glutamic acid\n      hydrochloride then PK samples will be taken. Subjects will continue the dosing regimen they\n      were assigned to (glutamic acid hydrochloride will be added if it resulted in at least 33%\n      increased bioavailability) for up to 12 months or until relapse of CMV GI disease is\n      documented. Subjects will be followed at monthly intervals for safety evaluation and for\n      evidence of CMV GI relapse. Subjects who have clinical symptoms of relapse will undergo\n      repeat endoscopy or colonoscopy to document the relapse."
