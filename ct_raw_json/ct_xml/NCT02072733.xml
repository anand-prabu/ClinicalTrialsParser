  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A Pilot. Randomised Controlled study. Early geriatric assessment and tailored treatment
      applied to patients with widespread Non Small Cel lung Cancer (NSCLC). On the day of
      planning the oncologic treatment Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) will be offered to
      patients aged 60 and up. Based on the CGA a tailored multidisciplinary intervention is
      planned with the patients. The study aim is to test different screening methods to find the
      best suited method to select the frail geriatric patients in order to be able to select the
      frail patients in a planned later study, estimate the effect of CGA on these patients in
      order to be able to calculate the needed number of patients  and to estimate the time
      consumption in this latter study . The hypothesis is that the screening method G8 is
      superior to Performance Status(PS) and clinical oncologist´ evaluation and that CGA improves
      survival amongst Patients aged 60 or more with NSCLC and prevents hospitalisation and
      complications to the oncologic treatment.

    <description>Tailored intervention based on Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA).The Geriatric assessment is performed by testing the patients using Cumulative Index Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) as a comorbidity index. Minimal Mental State Examination(MMSE) test, Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), Barthel index, Instrumental Activities of Daily Living, Minimal Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Timed Up and Go (TUG) and medication review.  The intervention will be based on the findings in the CGA.
If problems are found in CGA the patient will be offered help or intervention</description>

    <description>Intervention is planned to be based on the findings of the geriatric assessment and could include optimizing on comorbidity, planning of physical exercise, improvement of the social situation and nutritional status. If needed in the follow-up period eg.Intravenous medication or blood transfusion can be offered at home. The oncogeriatric team can be contacted by the patients at daytime on weekdays by the patients, and if needed clinical examination of the patients can be performed at home or in the hospital as needed.</description>
