This\n      complication occurs in 4-10% and is associated with fetal complications and macrosomia. In\n      addition, women with GDM have an increased risk to develop type 2 diabetes after delivery.\n      Despite recommendations, it is difficult to follow-up all women with GDM during the\n      postpartum period due to high numbers of subjects that exceed usual healthcare resources. It\n      is therefore necessary to focus clinical attention toward women at high risk of type 2\n      diabetes in order to set adequate preventive strategies."
