  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the relative bioavailability of dabigatran etexilate as pellets on food and
      of dabigatran etexilate as granules resolved in reconstitution solution, each with
      dabigatran etexilate as capsule following oral administration. To evaluate acceptability and

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion criteria:

          1. Healthy males according to the investigator's assessment, as based on the following
             criteria: a complete medical history including a physical examination, vital signs
             (Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate), 12-lead electrocardiogram, and clinical laboratory
             tests

          2. Age 18 to 55 years (incl.)

          3. Body Mass Index 18.5 to 29.9 kg/m2 (incl.)

          4. Signed and dated written informed consent prior to admission to the study in
             accordance with GCP and local legislation

        Exclusion criteria:

          1. Any finding in the medical examination (including Blood Pressure, Pulse Rate or
             electrocardiogram) deviating from normal and judged clinically relevant by the
             investigator.

          2. Repeated measurement of systolic blood pressure greater than 140 mm Hg or diastolic
             blood pressure greater than 90 mm Hg

          3. Any laboratory value outside the reference range that the investigator considers to
             be of clinical relevance

          4. Any evidence of a concomitant disease judged clinically relevant by the investigator

          5. Gastrointestinal, hepatic, renal, respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic,
             immunological or hormonal disorders

          6. Surgery of the gastrointestinal tract that could interfere with kinetics of the study
             drug

          7. Diseases of the central nervous system (such as epilepsy), other neurological
             disorders or psychiatric disorders

          8. Subjects who in the investigator's judgement are perceived as having an increased
             risk of bleeding, for example because of:

               -  Hemorrhagic disorders or bleeding diathesis

               -  Occult blood in faeces or haematuria

               -  Trauma or surgery within the last month or as long as an excessive risk of
                  bleeding persists after these events, or planned surgery during trial
                  participation

               -  History of arteriovenous malformation or aneurysm

               -  History of gastroduodenal ulcer disease or gastrointestinal haemorrhage

               -  History of intracranial, intraocular, spinal, retroperitoneal, or atraumatic
                  intraarticular bleeding

               -  Anemia at screening

               -  Thrombocytopenia (platelet count less than 100/nL)
