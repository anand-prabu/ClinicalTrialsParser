  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at understanding whether oral nitric oxide levels can be used as a
      non-invasive marker for the diagnosis and management of patient with eosinophilic
      esophagitis (EoE).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nitric oxide (NO) is produced by  activated eosinophils and oral  NO levels are known to be
      elevated in asthma and eosinophilic bronchitis. The measurement of oral NO is a
      non-invasive,easy to perform low cost procedure that is used frequently in the diagnosis and
      management of asthma. The diagnosis of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE) requires conscious
      sedation, an upper endoscopy with biopsy, and histologic evaluation of the biopsy specimen.
      This is a costly and somewhat invasive procedure. If oral NO was elevated as a result of
      activity of esophageal eosinophils in EoE, the measurement of oral NO may potentially be a
      very convenient and useful test in the evaluation and treatment of EoE. We propose a pilot
      study  to determine if oral NO levels are elevated in patients with eosinophilic
      esophagitis.

    <description>Oral nitric oxide is measured by a breathing test where the participant will be seated in a chair and asked to breathe out into a small hand-held instrument for about 6 seconds.
Spirometry with bronchodilator testing- is an office based test that is required to measure lung function and the amount and rate of airflow into and out of the lungs. Spirometry involves breathing into a mouthpiece connected to a measuring device (a spirometer), usually while seated. bronchodilators (medications that open up your airways) may be administered via inhalation to check responses to them.
Methacholine challenge testing is a common lung function test used to diagnose asthma.</description>
