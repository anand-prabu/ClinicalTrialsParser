            "textblock": "Cyclophosphamide has been one of the most successful therapies for severe Systemic lupus\n      erythematosus (SLE). However, cyclophosphamide can cause severe side effects, including bone\n      marrow suppression, infection, gastrointestinal reaction, hemorrhagic cystitis, and the etc.\n      Significant variation in efficacy and toxicity of CPA has been observed. Since the\n      development of applicable therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of cyclophosphamide has been\n      reported, it will help to improve the efficacy and reduce toxicities in SLE treatment.\n      However, the TDM is a passive strategy which usually lags behind the appearance of\n      toxicities. Therefore\uff0cit is especially crucial to give individuals genotype-based personal\n      prescription of cyclophosphamide in order to gain the most effective therapies. Thus, the\n      purpose of this study is to compare the genotype-based personal prescription of\n      cyclophosphamide with the traditional prescription, in order to verify the efficacy of the\n      genotype-based personal prescription."

Malar rash (rash on cheeks).\n\n               2. Discoid rash (red, scaly patches on skin that cause scarring).\n\n               3. Serositis: Pleurisy (inflammation of the membrane around the lungs) or\n                  pericarditis (inflammation of the membrane around the heart).\n\n               4. Oral ulcers (includes oral or nasopharyngeal ulcers).\n\n               5. Arthritis: nonerosive arthritis of two or more peripheral joints, with\n                  tenderness, swelling, or effusion.\n\n               6. Photosensitivity (exposure to ultraviolet light causes rash, or other symptoms\n                  of SLE flareups).\n\n               7. Blood\u2014hematologic disorder\u2014hemolytic anemia (low red blood cell count) or\n                  leukopenia (white blood cell count<4000/\u00b5l), lymphopenia (<1500/\u00b5l) or\n                  thrombocytopenia (<100000/\u00b5l) in the absence of offending drug.\n                  Hypocomplementemia is also seen, due to either consumption of C3 and C4 by\n                  immune complex-induced inflammation or to congenitally complement deficiency,\n                  which may predispose to SLE.\n\n               8. Renal disorder: More than 0.5 g per day protein in urine or cellular casts seen\n                  in urine under a microscope.\n\n               9. Antinuclear antibody test positive.\n\n              10. Immunologic disorder: Positive anti-Smith, anti-ds DNA, antiphospholipid\n                  antibody, and/or false positive serological test for syphilis. Presence of\n                  anti-ss DNA in 70% of cases (though also positive with rheumatic disease and\n                  healthy persons).\n\n              11. Neurologic disorder: Seizures or psychosis. For the purpose of identifying\n                  patients for clinical studies, a person has SLE if any 4 out of 11 symptoms are\n                  present simultaneously or serially on two separate occasions. In the meantime,\n                  the case has one of the following conditions or more;\n\n               1. HIV (-);\n\n               2. Signed the informed consent;\n\n               3. Taking contraceptive measures during treatment period.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Poor compliance;\n\n          -  With lupus mental damage complication, occurrence of epilepsy or unable to express\n             subjective symptoms during the observation period.\n\n          -  Taking drugs that affect CYP2B6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, except corticosteroids.\n\n          -  Abnormal liver function."
