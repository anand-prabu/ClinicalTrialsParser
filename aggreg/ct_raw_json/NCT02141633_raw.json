With this protocol the Investigators will test the hypotheses that a) there is a\n      correlation between airway and pulmonary vascular endothelial function within the current\n      smoker and non-smoker groups, and b) ICS treatment improves airway and pulmonary vascular\n      endothelial function in the current smoker group."

All subjects will be instructed to abstain from ingesting alcoholic beverages, coffee\n      or caffeinated drinks for at least 12 hours the night before each study day.
