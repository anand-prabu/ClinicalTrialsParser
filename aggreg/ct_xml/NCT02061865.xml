             PDGFR (platelet-derived growth factor receptor)

          2. Active neovascular AMD in the fellow eye requiring treatment

          3. Scar, fibrosis, or atrophy in the study eye involving the center of the fovea

          4. Presence of retinal pigment epithelial tears or rips involving the macula in the
             study eye

          5. Prior vitrectomy in the study eye

          6. Any history of macular hole of stage 2 and above in the study eye

          7. Any intraocular or periocular surgery within 3 months of day 1 in the study eye,
             except lid surgery

          8. History of corneal transplant in the study eye

          9. Positive serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)/ urine pregnancy test at the
             screening or baseline visit
