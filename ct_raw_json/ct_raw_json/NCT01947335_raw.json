            "textblock": "Contrast-induced acute kidney injury (CI-AKI) is an important adverse effect of percutaneous\n      coronary interventions. Despite various efforts, very few preventive measures have been\n      shown effective in reducing its incidence. The final volume of contrast media utilized\n      during the procedure is a well-known independent factor affecting the occurrence of CI-AKI.\n\n      Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) has been largely used as an adjunctive diagnostic tool\n      during percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). When fully explored, IVUS provides precise\n      information for guiding the PCI strategy. IVUS allows accurate vessel and lesion sizing,\n      determination of plaque calcification (and the need for pre-stent plaque preparation),\n      assessment of post-stent results (including edge dissections and residual lesion, as well as\n      stent underexpansion or incomplete apposition). Therefore, IVUS has the potential to reduce\n      the utilization of contrast media during PCI.\n\n      In the present study, we hypothesize that IVUS guidance is associated with a significant\n      reduction in the volume of contrast media during PCI, in comparison to standard\n      angiography-guided intervention."
