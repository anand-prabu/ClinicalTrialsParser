Neuroimaging by MRI\n\n        2. Neurocognitive function with an extensive neuropsychological battery assessing\n           principally memory, attention and executive functions (Trail-making test A and B, Rey\n           Auditory Verbal Learning Test, Digit span, Digit symbol),\n\n        3. Biological markers of inflammation and endothelial dysfunction.\n\n      Patients included in the study will be monitored and followed for three months. They will be\n      examined at the time of inclusion, after two and six weeks and at the end (12 weeks) for\n      clinical monitoring and the evaluation of adaptation to treatment and compliance."

Previous CPAP treatment.\n\n          6. Psycho-physical inability to complete questionnaires. Inadequate visual and auditory\n             acuity will be excluded.\n\n          7.
