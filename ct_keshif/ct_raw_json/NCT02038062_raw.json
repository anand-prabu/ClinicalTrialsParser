Hence, ischemic preconditioning could reduce\n      ischemic lesion during clamping a femoral artery for vascular surgery. In this prospective,\n      randomized pilot study is investigated if clamping of the femoral artery leads to ischemia\n      of the calf measurable by near-infrared spectroscopy. In addition to this, the effect of\n      sevoflurane preconditioning on ischemia of the calf is measured."
