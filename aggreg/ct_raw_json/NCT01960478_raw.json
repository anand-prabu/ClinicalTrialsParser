CVA is the third main cause of death and the main\n      source of acquired handicap in adults, as a result it is now a key priority in public health\n      and part of \" The CVA National Action Plan 2013-2014\".\n\n      Copeptin is a polypeptide, by- product of Vasopressin metabolism. The increase of Copeptin\n      plasma level, as for Vasopressin, is connected to hydric balance disorders found in\n      cardio-vascular, renal and endocrine diseases. This link has already shown its interest in\n      the early diagnosis of myocardial infarction and, in a more indirect way, CVA.\n\n      Copeptin is associated with acute endogenous stress. It seems to have interesting potential\n      in the diagnosis of CVA by its negative predictive value like D-dimeres in pulmonary\n      embolism. Proadrenomedullin and Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) are both associated with the\n      prognosis of cardio-vascular diseases and could be interesting in evaluating CVA prognosis."
