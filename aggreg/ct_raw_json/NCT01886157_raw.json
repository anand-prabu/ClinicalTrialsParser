            "textblock": "Stenosing tenosynovitis, or more commonly \"trigger finger\" is a disease that can severely\n      impact a patient's quality of life. Its incidence is said to be 28 persons per 100,000\n      annually. The disease is manifested in one or more fingers by finger locking in flexion or\n      extension, leading to pain, discomfort and at times, loss of function. Patients frequently\n      report having to snap their fingers back in position to alleviate symptoms. The\n      pathophysiology relates to thickening of the flexor tendon sheath, which can impair tendon\n      gliding within it.\n\n      Although multiple treatment strategies are available, it is not entirely clear which\n      treatment offers the best outcome, especially when the finger has not reached end stage\n      locking. In general, corticosteroid injection into the tendon sheath is offered as the first\n      line of treatment. Splinting alone has also been described as a reliable method treatment.\n      However, Patel and Bassini indicated that steroid injection results in fewer recurrences\n      than splinting alone. Surgery is typically reserved for recurrent triggering, cases\n      refractory to injection, or digits locked in flexion. The effects of steroid injection\n      followed by splinting however have not been reported in a comprehensive fashion. It may be\n      that this form of treatment could result in a synergistic effect, which can offer a\n      treatment modality superior to either injection or splinting alone. The purpose of this\n      research study is to determine whether steroid injection followed by splinting is superior\n      to injection alone."
