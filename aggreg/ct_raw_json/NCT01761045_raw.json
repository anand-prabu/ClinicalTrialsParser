A\n      total of 80 women aged 30 to 45 y will be randomized to a sequence of test product\n      administration.\n\n      Subjects will be required to meet several inclusion and exclusion criteria, which will be\n      assessed at the screening visit, including a general screening questionnaire,\n      medical/medication history, eating disorder questionnaire, eating inventory questionnaire,\n      dietary inventory questionnaire, and anthropometric and vital sign measurements. At the\n      screening visit, a urine sample will be collected for drug and alcohol screening, cotinine\n      level, and pregnancy. Alcohol breath test will be performed as well.\n\n      After assessment of the eligibility criteria, qualified subjects will be invited to\n      participate in the study. This study will take approximately 3 weeks to complete.\n\n      Subjects will return to the study site within 28 days after the screening visit for testing\n      period 1, followed by 2 additional visits (testing period 2 and 3).\n\n      Subjects will consume 1 of 3 treatments, based on randomization sequence at each test period\n      visit: Consomm\u00e9 soup with Monosodium L-Glutamate (MSG), Consomm\u00e9 soup with MSG and Nucleic\n      Acid (IMP), and Placebo soup with no MSG or IMP.\n\n      When subjects arrive at the research center at approximately 11:30am, admission procedures\n      will be conducted: an alcohol breath test, food and activity diary review, and vital signs\n      and weight will be measured. If vital sign measurements are elevated, subjects will be\n      rescheduled within 2-3 days. Right before serving the standard lunch meal, subjects will be\n      asked to complete a satiety motivational questionnaire. Subjects will consume the entire\n      standard lunch meal and water within 30 min. Immediately after eating the standard lunch\n      meal, subjects will complete the satiety motivational questionnaire.\n\n      Two hours after the standard lunch meal, subjects will be given one of the test soups (based\n      on their randomization) to consume in its entirety, followed by completion of the satiety\n      motivational questionnaire and the soup rating questionnaire. Fifteen minutes from test soup\n      administration, snacks and water (ad lib) will be provided and subjects will be instructed\n      to eat as much as or as little as they desire, followed by completing the satiety\n      motivational questionnaire. At 3 h 15 min and at 4 h, subjects will complete the satiety\n      motivational questionnaire.\n\n      Test periods 2 and 3 will be scheduled between 3-14 days after completing test period visit\n      1: all procedures are identical on each test period visit with the exception of the test\n      treatment soup consumed by subjects."
