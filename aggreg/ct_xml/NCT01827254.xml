      Retrospective and prospective study in mRCC patients treated with sutent in first line and
      rechallenged by Sutent in 3rd and 4th line.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample size of n = 40 patients will allow to estimate of the median PFS with a precision
      around 1.8 months  (based on data from Rini et al.) This retrospective and prospective study
      is designed to estimate the effect of Sutent rechallenge.

      The PFS (estimated from Kaplan-Meier estimate)  will be the primary endpoints. In addition,
      the effects of sunitinib at the 2 periods of treatment (i.e. first line sunitinib vs.
      rechallenge) will be compared by Wilcoxon signed-rank test for PFS values and by McNemar
      test for overall response rate (ORR).

    <description>Percentage of participants with OR based assessment of confirmed complete remission (CR) or confirmed partial remission (PR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). Confirmed remission are those with repeat bone marrow showing less than 5 percent (%) myeloblasts with normal maturation of all cell lines and absolute values of the peripheral blood lasting at least 2 months. PR are those with all CR criteria except at least 50% decrease in the blasts over the pretreatment.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically documented metastatic RCC containing predominantly clear cell
             component.

          -  Previously received sunitinib in first line, 2 or more antitumor therapies
             subsequently and then received sunitinib for a second time.

          -  At least 1 cycle of sunitinib rechallenge (1 cycle= 4 weeks on/2 weeks off).

          -  At least 1 measurable lesion that can be accurately measured in at least 1 dimension
             with the longest diameter (LD) ³ 10 mm when measured by spiral computerized
             tomography (CT) (5-mm slice thickness contiguous) or ³ 20 mm when measured by
             conventional CT (10-mm slice thickness contiguous). The lesion must be ³ 2 times the
             size of the slice thickness per RECIST criteria.

          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who didn't receive Sunitinib in first line.

          -  Patient who received less than one line of treatment .
