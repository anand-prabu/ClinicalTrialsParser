Patients with\n      end-stage renal disease will be assessed for the eligibility, and then be randomized using\n      random number table into one of two groups prior to kidney transplantation.\n\n      Immunosuppression consisted of Cyclosporine(Neoral\u00ae), Methylprednisolone OR prednisone OR\n      deflazacort(Brand name is not designated) and Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate\n      Sodium(Myfortic\u00ae). Basilixumab(Simulect\u00ae) will be given just prior to transplant and 4 days\n      after transplantation. The Enteric-Coated Mycophenolate Sodium will be given orally at the\n      dose of 720 mg BID for Group A (investigational) or 360 mg BID for Group B (comparator),\n      starting at two days after transplantation, as shown in the figure below. Cyclosporine will\n      be given orally at a dose of 10 mg/Kg/day starting at a day before transplantation. Within a\n      month after transplantation, the dose of the drug will be individually adjusted with goal\n      trough blood level between 100 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for Group A or between 200 ng/mL and 300\n      ng/mL for Group B, as displayed in the table below. From a month to 2 months\n      post-transplantation, the target blood trough levels of cyclosporine will be reduced to\n      between 75 ng/mL and 150 ng/mL for Group A or between 150 ng/mL and 250 ng/mL for Group B.\n      From 2 months to 4 months post-transplantation, it will be further reduced to between 50\n      ng/mL and 125 ng/mL for Group A or between 125 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for Group B. After 4\n      months post-transplantation, it will be further reduced to between 50 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL\n      for Group A or between 100 ng/mL and 200 ng/mL for Group B."
