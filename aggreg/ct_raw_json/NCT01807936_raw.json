            "textblock": "Background :\n\n      Esophageal carcinoma is an aggressive disease with a poor prognosis. Surgical resection with\n      radical lymphadenectomy remains the basic method of management of this malignancy. The\n      international Society for Diseases of the Esophagus has classified the extent of\n      lymphadenectomy as standard, extended, total, and three-field lymphadenectomy. However,\n      lymph node metastases can be present as regional metastasis, skip metastasis and distant\n      metastasis, the optimal extent of lymphadenectomy remains controversial by now. Three-filed\n      lymphadenectomy was criticized for higher surgical risks, but have the merits of removing\n      all potential positive nodes and reducing the local recurrence. The purpose of this study is\n      to conduct a large scale prospective randomized Phase \u2162 clinical trial to test that based on\n      the long-term outcomes(overall survival and disease free survival )and postoperative\n      short-term outcomes(mortality, morbidity),whether one extent of lymphadenectomy is superior\n      than the other approach or not.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        1. To compare overall survival after three-field lymphadenectomy and two-field\n           lymphadenectomy\n\n        2. To compare locoregional recurrence, disease free survival after three-field\n           lymphadenectomy and two-field lymphadenectomy\n\n        3. To compare postoperative morbidity and mortality in the two groups\n\n        4. To evaluate short and long term quality of life after the two procedures Design:\n           Prospective randomized controlled Setting: Fudan University Cancer Center, Shanghai,\n           China. Patients and methods : All patients with biopsy proven carcinoma of the middle\n           or lower third of the esophagus presenting to our hospital will be considered for the\n           study.\n\n      Staging investigations will be standard and will include\n\n        1. Computed Tomography (CT) scans in all patients\n\n        2. Esophagogastroscopy\n\n        3. Barium swallow\n\n        4. Endoscopic Ultrasonography (EUS) wherever possible\n\n        5. PET-CT scan wherever possible\n\n      Randomization:\n\n      Block randomization will be done using a computer generated sheet. Randomization will be\n      performed 3 days to 1 week before the operation.\n\n      All surgeries will be performed under general anesthesia with epidural analgesia. The\n      surgery will be either performed by or under the direct supervision of consultant thoracic\n      surgeons with experience in esophageal surgery. Operative time, blood loss, blood product\n      replacement and all intraoperative details will be recorded in the proforma. Patients will\n      be shifted postoperatively to the intensive care unit (ICU) for observation and subsequently\n      to the recovery or high dependency ward once stabilized. Postoperative details including\n      period of postoperative ventilation, hemorrhage, pulmonary and cardiac complications,\n      arrhythmias, thoracic duct leak, anastomotic leak, wound infection and recurrent laryngeal\n      nerve paresis or palsy will be recorded. Postoperative mortality will be defined as 30-day\n      mortality plus death before discharge after surgery. The total duration of ICU stay and\n      hospital stay will also be recorded.\n\n      Follow up:\n\n      Patients will be followed up three monthly for the first two years and six monthly for the\n      third to fifth years and annually thereafter. A detailed history and clinical examination\n      and CT scan, barium swallow and ultrasound will be done routinely on every follow up.\n\n      Data management: All collected data will be entered into a statistical software package for\n      subsequent analysis\n\n      Main research variables:\n\n      Primary end point: Disease free survival in the two arms\n\n      Secondary endpoints:\n\n        1. Overall survival\n\n        2. Locoregional recurrence\n\n        3. Postoperative morbidity and mortality\n\n        4. Quality of life : assessed with EORTC QLQ-C30 scale and EORTC QLQ- OES18 scale."
