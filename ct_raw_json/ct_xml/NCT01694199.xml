    <textblock>
      The clinical study's primary objective is to compare the overall analgesic effect of the
      Provant Therapy System (test device) to an identical sham device (placebo) in subjects
      experiencing post-operative pain following first metatarsal bunion surgery. The study
      hypothesis is that, over the first 72 hours (3 days) after the initial test device
      treatment, subjects treated with an active test device will show a statistically significant
      difference (reduction) in pain intensity scores when compared with subjects treated with a
      sham (placebo) device. Treatment with the test device will continue through the 168 hour (7
      day) timepoint. Safety will be followed through 28 days.

             disease or disorder, or any uncontrolled medical illness that in the investigator's
             judgment places the Subject at unacceptable risk for surgery or receipt of
             investigational therapy.

          -  Subject has an ongoing, uncontrolled painful condition that in the opinion of the
             Investigator might have a confounding influence on the safety or efficacy analysis
             for this study.

          -  Subject has current evidence of alcohol abuse (regularly drinks more than four units
             of alcohol per day; 1 unit = Â½ pint of beer, 1 glass of wine, or 1 ounce of spirit).

          -  Infection (acute or chronic) involving the first metatarsal (or history of such
             infection) or any other disease of the foot/ankle that in the opinion of the
             investigator, places the Subject at increased risk for surgical complications or
             receipt of the investigational therapy.

          -  The Subject does not report a score of moderate or severe on a 4-point categorical
             rating scale (with categories of none, mild, moderate, or severe) plus a score of â¥4
             on an NPRS 11-point categorical rating scale within 8 hours after the end of surgery.
             End of surgery is defined as time of last suture.

          -  The surgical procedure from incision to closure was longer than 2 hours.

             that is less than 8 breaths per minute and arterial oxygen saturation by pulse
             oximetry of less than 95% with supplemental oxygen.

          -  There have been any significant deviations from the surgical or anesthetic protocols
             that would, in the opinion of the investigator, put the Subject at risk of
             participation in the trial, confound the analgesic endpoints of the trial or cause
             concern regarding the Subject's ability to participate in the trial.
