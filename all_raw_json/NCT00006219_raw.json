Patients are\n      stratified according to disease (monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance vs\n      monoclonal gammopathy of borderline significance) and monoclonal protein abnormality (IgG vs\n      IgA). Patients are randomized to 1 of 4 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) once daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral clarithromycin once or twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive oral placebo once daily.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive oral placebo twice daily. Treatment continues for 6 months in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, 6 months, 12 months, and then at disease\n      progression.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 1.5 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 75 patients (25 per treatment arms I and II and 25 between\n      arms III and IV) will be accrued for this study within 2.5 years."
