      To determine if MRI imaging can be used to determine the amount of iron in areas of the
      brain affected by a stroke, which may help in the future to see if this can predict the
      amount of brain damage and therefore the effects on the patient.  New research treatments
      are being used to reduce the amount of iron build up in the brain; the effects of that
      treatment may also be seen using new MRI techniques.

    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic stroke has devastating consequences. The mechanisms resulting in early and
      delayed brain injury following a hemorrhagic stroke is poorly understood. One of the
      mechanisms demonstrated in animal studies points towards deposition of iron in the brain
      tissue following hemorrhage. Preliminary data in animal studies also support a favorable
      effect of iron chelate agents on the extent of neural tissue damage. preliminary human
      trials based on this hypothesis demonstrate safety of escalating doses of desferroxamine in
      the human population. The evaluation of iron chelate agent in the context of hemorrhagic
      stroke is entering into phase II/III trials.

      There is no modality till date that can quantify this tissue iron non invasively. Some
      preliminary studies have demonstrated the role of MRI in identifying parenchymal iron
      deposition in traumatic brain injury. We propose to validate an MRI based method to not only
      identify but also quantify the non heme iron levels deposited in brain tissue following
      hemorrhagic stroke. Once validated this method will be a robust mechanism to reliably
      quantify tissue iron in the brain which then can be closely followed through iron chelate
      therapy in a trial setting.

    <description>Intervention: Multiple MRI To develop a reliable MR based measurement of Non heme iron in brain tissue of patients with hemorrhagic stroke. We propose to intervene with multiple MRIs at various points after the hemorrhage such as at day 3, 7, 10, 14 to assess the non heme iron levels on MRI.
To evaluate the role of iron chelators following a  hemorrhagic stroke/parenchymal hemorrhage.</description>

    <description>MRI examinations of the head will be performed to determine the amount of Non heme iron in areas of the brain of hemorrhagic stroke patients and hopefully predict the amount of brain damage.  Each MRI will take up to 1 hour to complete and will be done on day 1, day 4, day 7, day 10 and day 14. Some of the (MRIs) Magnetic Resonance Imaging will be clinically indicated and sequences will be added to the clinical scan with each sequence adding 10 minutes to the scan, and some will be performed solely for research.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

        1.  Males and females between the age of 18 and 85 who have suffered a stroke confirmed by
        a CT of the head.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. You cannot take part in this study if you have no evidence of a previous stroke
             (hemorrhage).

          2. You cannot take part in this study if you are not clinically able to have an MRI
             exam.

          3. Women cannot take part in this study if they are pregnant.

          4. Women may not participate in this study if they are attempting to become pregnant or
             suspect you might be pregnant.  We will provide a one-time pregnancy test for you, at
             no cost to you, if you are uncertain about the possibility of your being pregnant.

          5. You cannot take part in this study if you have evidence of a large amount of
             calcifications found on CT exams that have been performed as part of the clinical
             evaluation for your current condition.
