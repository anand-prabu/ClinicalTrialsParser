    <textblock>
      This is a 5-year long-term follow-up study of open label, single-center, phase I clinical
      trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of PNEUMOSTEM® in premature infants with
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is the most common cause of death for prematurely born
      babies with low birth weights. In addition, many children who recover from this disease
      suffer from various complications such as prolonged hospitalization, pulmonary hypertension,
      and failure to thrive.

      It has been reported that bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BM-MSC) can
      differentiate into pulmonary epithelial and pulmonary endothelial cells. Some animal studies
      showed that BM-MSCs differentiate into bronchial cells and type 2 pneumocytes in rats with
      pneumonia and improve the fibrosis that occur after administration of bleomycin. Based on
      the findings, it is considered that mesenchymal stem cell therapy can help regenerate the
      damaged lung as well as BPD that cause lung inflammation, fibrosis, deficiency of type 2
      pneumocytes, and so on.

      PNEUMOSTEM® consists of human umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells and is
      intended to treat BPD in premature infants. The purpose of the study is to evaluate 3-5 year
      long term safety and efficacy in patients who completed the earlier part of the phase I
      clinical trial of PNEUMOSTEM®.
