      This is a study to test how safe the combination of the drugs Romidepsin and Pralatrexate
      are in patients with lymphoid malignancies and to determine the dose of the combination of
      drugs that is safest.  If the combination is determined to be safe, we'll continue the
      study, but only accrue patients with peripheral T-Cell lymphoma (PTCL).

      Study Procedures

      Screening Procedures:

      The screening process may take place over a period of up to 28 days. It may take more than
      one visit to complete and will include the following:

        -  Physical examination, with vital signs and assessment of performance status.

        -  A PET/CT scan (or other types of scans to determine the size, locations, and extent of
           disease).

        -  An electrocardiogram (ECG).

        -  Approximately 2 tablespoons, or 30 mL, of blood will be taken for standard laboratory
           tests.

        -  Urinalysis.

        -  Females of childbearing potential will have a pregnancy test performed during screening
           and again within 72 hours prior to the first dose of study drug.

        -  Optional lymph node, bone marrow and/or tissue biopsy or fine needle aspirate.

        -  Bone marrow biopsy may be needed (performed at the discretion of the treating
           investigator).

        -  Patients with multiple myeloma will also have the following: approximately 15 mL of
           blood will be taken for standard myeloma specific laboratory tests. A 24-hour urine
           sample will be collected.

      Procedures during Treatment:

        -  Each cycle is 28 days long and patients will receive pralatrexate and romidepsin once a
           week for three weeks.

        -  Vitamin Requirement: There are 2 vitamins that patients must take while they are
           receiving study treatment and for at least 30 days after the last dose of study
           treatment. Patients will receive vitamin B12 injected into a muscle every 8-10 weeks.
           They will also take 1 mg of folic acid by mouth every day. Patients will receive the
           first dose of pralatrexate after taking the supplementary doses of folic acid for at
           least 7 days and having received a vitamin B12 injection within 10 weeks.

        -  Pralatrexate: Pralatrexate will be given over 5 minutes intravenously (IV), on days 1,

           15 of a 28 day treatment cycle.

        -  During cycle 1 pralatrexate will be given to patients during the last five minutes of
           the romidepsin infusion. However,during cycle 2 and subsequent cycles, pralatrexate
           will be administered prior to romidepsin.
