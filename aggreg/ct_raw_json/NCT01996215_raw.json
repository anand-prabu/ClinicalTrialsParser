These MRIs will be obtained while participants are in the \"resting state\" meaning they are awake but not instructed to perform specific scanner.  Two years after baseline exams, participants will return for repeat data collection.  Participants who received an MRI at baseline will receive repeat resting-state, brain MRI at 2-year follow-up, unless they have developed contradictions to MRI scans in the interim.",
