It will try to determine how often brain aneurysms occur in families\n      in which more than one member has had an aneurysm and to find the gene or genes that\n      contribute to their development.\n\n      People in families in which more than one family member had a cerebral aneurysm are eligible\n      for this 1-day study.  They will undergo the following procedures:\n\n        -  Blood will be drawn (no more than 3 to 4 tablespoons) for research to identify genes\n           that contribute to the development of brain aneurysms.\n\n        -  A magnetic resonance angiograph (MRA) scan will be done to examine a specific brain\n           area where aneurysms typically occur.  Magnetic resonance imaging uses a strong\n           magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of the brain and detect abnormalities.\n\n      If a more detailed picture of the brain is needed than can be obtained with MRA, a more\n      specific MRA scan will be done using a contrast dye to enhance the images.\n\n      Patients may be invited to participate in related NIH research studies."
