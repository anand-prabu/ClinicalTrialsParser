It is not yet known whether doxorubicin is more effective than\n      daunorubicin for AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized double-blinded phase III trial to determine if doxorubicin is more\n      effective than daunorubicin in treating patients who have AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma."

Determine tumor\n      response to Doxil as a corollary to clinical benefit. III. Evaluate the safety of Doxil.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, prospective, double blind, multicenter study. Patients are\n      randomly assigned to receive doxorubicin HCl liposome (Doxil) or daunorubicin (DaunoXome) in\n      a 3:1 ratio. Both Doxil and DauonoXome are given every 2 weeks for 6 courses by intravenous\n      infusion over 60 minutes into a peripheral vein.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 80 patients will be studied."
