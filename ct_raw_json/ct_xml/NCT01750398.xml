      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and clinical effects of alternating
      androgen deprivation therapy with testosterone therapy in men with recurrent prostate cancer
      as first line hormonal therapy, to assess the effect of alternating therapy on quality of
      life and metabolic changes associated with androgen-deprivation therapy.

      This is an open-label, single site, single arm pilot study designed to determine the
      efficacy and safety of alternating androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) and parenteral
      testosterone in men with recurrent or newly metastatic prostate cancer. Eligible patients
      will initiate ADT with LHRH agonist (e.g. goserelin or leuprolide) if not surgically
      castrated for a total of 6 months. After this initial 6 month lead-in phase, patients will
      continue on ADT every three months but will also receive an intramuscular gluteal injection
      with either testosterone cypionate or testosterone enanthanate(T) at a dose of 400 mg every
      4 weeks for a total of 3 injections (i.e.12 weeks of therapy).Both formulations of T have
      identical pharmacokinetics; exhibiting the same serum testosterone profile after
      intramuscular injection into healthy volunteers.  Patients will then cycle back to ADT only
      for 12 weeks. This route and dose of T was selected based on data demonstrating that it
      produces an initial supraphysiologic serum level of testosterone (i.e. &gt; 3-8 times normal
      level) with eugonadal levels achieved at the end of two weeks and return to low serum T
      levels by the fourth week post-injection. The investigators have termed this rapid cycling
      between supraphysiologic to low/castrate serum T Bipolar Androgen-based Therapy (BAT). One
      BAT cycle will be defined as 24 weeks (i.e. 12 weeks on T; 12 weeks off T). Patients will
      receive two cycles (i.e. 48 weeks) of BAT in total (see Study Scheme below).  Upon
      completion of the 18 month study period patients will be assessed for response and will then
      have the option to continue on intermittent or continuous ADT at the discretion of their
      treating physician.

      Patients will have PSA and imaging studies during the screening period. A second set of
      studies will be performed at the end of the 6-month LHRH agonist therapy lead-in period.
      Based on prior studies the investigators expect &gt;80% of patients to have a PSA &lt;4 ng/ml and
      without evidence of PSA progression after 6 months of ADT (Hussain et al. 2006; Crook et al.
      2012). At the end of the lead-in phase only patients who either achieve a ≥50% reduction in
      PSA from their screening baseline (i.e. a major PSA response) or have a PSA &lt; 4 ng/ml and
      are without signs of progression will be allowed to continue on the study. All others will
      be removed from study and replaced. Those replaced individuals will be considered to have
      not met the primary endpoint in our final analysis. PSA progression will be assessed at the
      end of the 18 month study period. Standard PCWG2 criteria for PSA progression will be used
      (Scher et al. 2008).

      The primary endpoint for this trial will be the percent subjects with a PSA &lt;4 ng/ml and
      without PSA progression at the end of the 18 month treatment period. Secondary endpoints
      will include: the rate of progression based on imaging and clinical assessments, percent of
      patient who have a complete PSA response (PSA &lt; 0.2 ng/ml), metabolic changes, changes in
      quality of life as assessed through standard questionnaires, and safety.

      CT and bone scans will be performed at the end of the second full cycle of BAT (i.e. at the
      end of the 18 month study period) and be used to assess for radiographic progression. Soft
      tissue metastasis will be evaluated by RECIST criteria (v1.1). Bone metastasis will be
      evaluated per the standard PCWG2 criteria. This requires the appearance of at least 2 new
      lesions with a confirmatory bone scan. For patients demonstrating radiographic progression
      the investigators will require a confirmatory scan after an additional 8 weeks so as not to
      misconstrue a tumor flare with true disease progression. A subject will be considered to
      have clinically progressed if he develops pain that, in the opinion of the investigator, is
      secondary to his cancer; he develops a pathologic fracture or other skeletal event. If there
      is uncertainty regarding whether a symptom is due to a patient's cancer, the subsequent
      workup will be at the investigator's discretion. Of the endpoints, only clinical progression
      will result in early study termination.

      To evaluate the effect BAT has on the metabolic syndrome associated with ADT the
      investigators will monitor a number of parameters at baseline prior to initiation of ADT,
      after 6 month &quot;Lead-in&quot; phase of ADT and after the 2nd cycle of T. Studies will include
      measurements of bone density,estradiol, sex hormone binding globulins, fasting lipids,
      metabolic parameters (insulin, fasting glucose, hemoglobin A1c, leptin, TSH, T3, fibrinogen,
      C-reactive protein, serum C-telopeptide, blood pressure, Body Mass Index (BMI), body
      weight). Quality of life (QOL) will be recorded through a series of questionnaires. These
      surveys include the RAND-SF36 Quality of Life Survey, the FACT-P, the International Index of
      Erectile Function (IIEF), the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and a visual pain
      scale. Each of these instruments has been previously validated and is used extensively in
      clinical trials to assess the effects of treatment intervention on quality of life. QOL will
      be assessed at screening, after Lead-In Phase and at the end of each cycle of T or ADT.

      Additional plasma and serum samples will be drawn and banked at -80°C at baseline prior to
      initiation of ADT, prior to initiating a cycle of T or ADT and upon completion of the study.
      These samples will be used for biologic and immunologic correlates. Examples of studies that
      may be performed include, but are not limited to: quantitative immunoglobulins,TREC levels
      and circulating DNA studies.
