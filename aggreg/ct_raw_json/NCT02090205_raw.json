            "textblock": "Respiratory insufficiency is a common complication after cardiac surgery, ranging between\n      mild subclinical events to severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).\n      Physiopathology is complex and involves atelectasis, hyper-oxygenation and systemic\n      inflammatory activation, with recruitment of neutrophils and increased pulmonary vascular\n      permeability. The practice of stopping mechanical ventilation during cardio-pulmonary bypass\n      (CPB) is widely diffused, because it is not necessary to maintain blood oxygenation and\n      elimination of carbon dioxide, and furthermore respiratory movements can interfere with the\n      surgical procedure. Nevertheless the ventilation stop during CPB is associated with the\n      formation of post-operative micro-atelectasis, idiopathic pulmonary edema, higher incidence\n      of infections and alterations of respiratory mechanics. Moreover the movement of\n      compression/decompression of pulmonary tissue can be important for pulmonary lymphatic flow.\n      Recent studies suggest that the application of a CPAP during CPB can reduce the\n      post-operative shunt fraction. Similar results can be achieved with recruitment maneuvers\n      before the end of the CPB. Mechanical ventilation during the CPB seem to reduce the systemic\n      inflammatory response.\n\n      In this study we want to test the hypothesis that a mechanical ventilation at low\n      frequency/volume or the application of a CPAP ventilation during CPB can reduce the\n      incidence of post-operative pulmonary complications. This is a randomized controlled\n      multi-centric trial."
