    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation trial of MSB0010718C (antibody targeting
      programmed death ligand 1 [anti PD-L1]) in Japanese subjects with metastatic or locally
      advanced solid tumors, followed by a consecutive expansion part in Asian subjects with
      gastric cancer.

          -  For dose escalation part: Histologically or cytologically proven metastatic or
             locally advanced solid tumors, for which no standard therapy exists or standard
             therapy has failed

                  Cancer/Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [UICC]/International Association
                  for Study of Lung Cancer Tumor Node Metastasis Classification of Malignant
                  Tumors [TNM] Staging System 7th edition) and received first-line chemotherapy
                  using fluoropyrimidine and platinum combination without disease progression

               -  Presence of at least 1 measurable lesion according to RECIST version 1.1

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG)  performance status of 0 to 1 at the trial
             entry and an estimated life expectancy of at least 3 months

          -  Adequate hematological, hepatic and renal function as defined in the protocol

          -  All subjects must agree to use effective means of contraception with their partner
             from entry into the trial through 6 months after the last dose of MSB0010718C

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Concurrent treatment with a non-permitted drug

          -  Prior therapy with any antibody/drug targeting T cell co-regulatory proteins (immune
             checkpoints)

          -  Concurrent anticancer treatment or concurrent systemic therapy with steroids or other
             immunosuppressive agents, or use of any investigational drug within 30 days before
             the start of trial treatment. Short-term administration of steroids (that is, for
             allergic reactions or the management of immune-related adverse events [irAE]) is
             allowed

          -  Previous malignant disease within the last 5 years with the exception of adequately
             treated non-melanoma skin cancer, in situ cancer, or other cancer

          -  Clinically significant (that is, active) cardiovascular disease

          -  All other significant diseases (for example, inflammatory bowel disease), which, in
             the opinion of the investigator, might impair the subject's tolerance of trial
             treatment

             informed consent

          -  Legal incapacity or limited legal capacity
