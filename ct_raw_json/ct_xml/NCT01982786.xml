    <textblock>
      This research is being done because investigators involved in this study would like to
      compare image guided external beam radiation therapy (IGRT) to IGRT plus HDR brachytherapy
      boost to see which treatment is better and what the side effects of treatment are.

  <detailed_description>

      Before a big study is done, a smaller study (called a &quot;feasibility study&quot;) is required to
      make sure that patients and physicians are willing to participate in a study comparing the
      two kinds of treatments, and to verify how the radiation therapy is given in different
      centres across Canada.

      The standard or usual treatment for this disease includes treatment with IGRT or IGRT plus
      HDR brachytherapy boost.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed, prostate adenocarcinoma diagnosed within the last 9 months.

          -  Intermediate-risk cancer patients based on the NCCN Guidelines (www.nccn.org):

             • TNM classification:

          -  T2b-T2c and Gleason Score &lt; 8/10 and PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml; or

          -  T1c-T2a and Gleason Score 7/10 and PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml; or

          -  T1c-T2a and Gleason Score ≤ 6/10 and 10 ≤ PSA &lt; 20 ng/ml

        For patients who have been on alpha reductase inhibitors within the last 6 months, use the
        following guidelines:

          -  T2b-T2c and Gleason Score &lt; 8/10 and PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml; or

          -  T1c-T2a and Gleason Score 7/10 and PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml; or

          -  T1c-T2a and Gleason Score ≤ 6/10 and 5 ≤ PSA ≤ 10 ng/ml

          -  No alpha reductase inhibitors (i.e. avodart, proscar) use within 2 weeks of
             randomization. A washout period of 2 weeks is required prior to randomization.

          -  Prostate volume ≤ 75 cc.

          -  Prostate length ≤ 5.5 cm.

          -  American Urological Association (AUA) Symptom Index score &lt; 20.

          -  Judged to be medically fit for IGRT and HDR brachytherapy boost by a radiation
             oncologist.

          -  ECOG Performance Status of 0 or 1.

          -  ≥ 18 years of age.

          -  Patient consent must be appropriately obtained in accordance with applicable local
             and regulatory requirements. Each patient must sign a consent form prior to enrolment
             in the trial to document their willingness to participate.

          -  Patients must be accessible for treatment and follow-up. Patients registered on this
             trial must be treated and followed at the participating centre. This implies there
             must be reasonable geographical limits (for example: 1 ½ hour's driving distance)
             placed on patients being considered for this trial. Investigators must assure
             themselves the patients registered on this trial will be available for complete
             documentation of the treatment, adverse events, and follow-up.

          -  Protocol treatment is to begin within 4 weeks of patient randomization. HDR
             brachytherapy boost treatment is to begin within 3 weeks before or after IGRT for
             those randomized to Arm 2.

          -  Participants must be willing to take precautions to prevent pregnancy while on
             treatment. In addition to routine contraceptive methods, &quot;effective contraception&quot;
             also includes heterosexual celibacy and surgery intended to prevent pregnancy (or
             with a side-effect of pregnancy prevention). However, if at any point a previously
             celibate patient chooses to become heterosexually active during the time period for
             use of contraceptive measures, he is responsible for beginning contraceptive
             measures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  History of transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP).

          -  Patients with a history of other malignancies, except: adequately treated
             non-melanoma skin cancer, or other solid tumours curatively treated with no evidence
             of disease for ≥ 5 years.

          -  Prior or current bleeding diathesis.

          -  Prior pelvic or prostate radiotherapy.

          -  Previous history of (or planned) androgen deprivation therapy.

          -  Evidence of metastatic disease.

          -  Any serious active disease or co-morbid medical condition, laboratory abnormality,
             psychiatric illness, active or uncontrolled infections, or serious illnesses or
             medical conditions that would prevent the patient from participating or to be managed
             according to the protocol (according to investigator's decision).
