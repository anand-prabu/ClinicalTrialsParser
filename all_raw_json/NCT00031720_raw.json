For more information\n      regarding the treatment regimens, please see the treatment arms section.\n\n      Primary objectives:\n\n        1. To compare the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on the daily number\n           of hot flushes experienced by postmenopausal women taking tamoxifen measured at three\n           months from baseline\n\n        2. To compare the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on hot flush severity\n           as measured by the average daily hot flash score in this population of women measured\n           at three months from baseline\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        1. To evaluate the effect of soy supplementation as compared to women randomized to\n           placebo on quality of life as measured by the Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) sleep\n           subscale, the Mental Health Inventory (MHI), the CES-D Short Form, the Menopause and\n           Reproductive Health Questionnaire, and the General Quality of Life Form\n\n        2. To measure the effect of soy supplementation as compared to women randomized to placebo\n           on serum isoflavones, estradiol, SHBG, IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels as measures of hormonal\n           change\n\n        3. To estimate the effect of daily soy supplementation versus placebo on the time to first\n           relief of hot flushes\n\n      A total of 112 patients accrued on this study. Patients were followed 6 months\n      post-randomization."
