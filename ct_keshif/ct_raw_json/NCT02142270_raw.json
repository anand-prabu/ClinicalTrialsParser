Methods The sub-Saharan Africa SCD study is a\n      prospective, multicenter, community-based registry monitoring all cases of cardiac arrest\n      occurring in victims > 15 years old. Investigators will use the definition of established\n      SCD if an unexpected death without obvious extracardiac cause, occurred with a rapid\n      witnessed collapse, or if unwitnessed, occurred within 1 hour after the onset of symptoms;\n      probable SCD if an unexpected death without obvious extracardiac cause occurred within the\n      previous 24 hours. After approval from institutional boards, Investigators will record\n      demographic, clinical, electrocardiographic and biological variables of SCD victims\n      (including survivors of cardiac arrest) in several sub-Saharan African cities. All deaths\n      occurring in residents of districts of interest will be checked for past medical history,\n      circumstances of death, and autopsy report (if possible). Investigators will also analyze\n      the employment of resuscitation attempts during the timeframe of sudden cardiac arrest (SCA)\n      in various patient populations throughout  countries. Conclusion This study will provide\n      comprehensive, contemporary data on the epidemiology of SCD in sub-Saharan Africa and will\n      help in the development of strategies to prevent and manage cardiac arrest in this region of\n      the world."
