  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sedation and anesthesia for diagnostic imaging represents a rapidly growing field of
      practice, especially in children. Propofol is the most common sedative drug administered for
      MRI/CT. However, this drug is associated with adverse events, including pulmonary
      complications, and there has been no report on these complications in Korea.

      The investigators reviewed 3739 charts of pediatric patients sedated for MRI/CT between
      January and November 2012.

      In this study, the investigators will report the nature and frequency of adverse events
      associated with sedation for MRI/CT between January and November 2012.
