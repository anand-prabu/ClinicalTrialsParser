It is not yet known if mitoxantrone is more effective with or\n      without docetaxel.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of mitoxantrone with or\n      without docetaxel in treating women who have metastatic breast cancer with a poor prognosis."

Patients are stratified according to age,\n      treatment center, disease free interval (no more than 18 months vs more than 18 months),\n      hormone receptor status (positive or unknown vs negative), prior adjuvant therapy with\n      anthracyclines (yes vs no), presence of liver metastases (liver involvement as a single\n      organ vs liver plus other organ involvement vs no liver involvement), and presence of lung\n      metastases (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks until\n           disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or maximum cumulative dose. Patients who\n           achieve complete response receive 2 additional courses.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive mitoxantrone IV plus docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1.\n           Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 6 courses in the absence of disease\n           progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      At relapse, reinduction with the original regimen is attempted. Following a second complete\n      response, 2 additional courses of consolidative treatment are given, and patients are then\n      followed off treatment.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed periodically.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 300 patients will be accrued for this study."
