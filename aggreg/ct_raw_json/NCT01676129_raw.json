            "textblock": "The prevalence of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is about 20% to 60% of dental patients.\n      Most patients suffer from myofascial pain (MFP) subtype of TMD.  Analgesics, local muscle\n      injection or oral appliance are often used to treat TMD-related MFP.  Patients are also\n      referred to physical therapists frequently.  Many physical therapy (PT) modalities and\n      techniques are applied to these patients, including non-invasive transcutaneous electrical\n      nerve stimulation (TENS) using TENS devices.  However, the exact application of TENS\n      devices, including the location of the stimulation, duration and intensity of stimulation,\n      is largely decided by physical therapists.  Nocipoint Therapy, a unique combination of\n      precise location, duration and intensity of TENS has been found to substantially relieve\n      general myofascial pain and recover the muscle function with lasting effect.\n\n      In preliminary observations of clinical applications, Nocipoint Therapy has been found to\n      rapidly and substantially relieve TMD-related MFP within 2-3 sessions of the treatment.\n\n      This clinical study compares the effect of Nocipoint Therapy on TMD with that of standard\n      Physical therapy (PT).   TENS will be used in the control group both as a part of the\n      standard of care (i.e., PT) and as placebo."
