One of the main reasons for aseptic loosening in THA is the foreign body reaction\n      caused by the wear particles. Since the late 1990s, the orthopedic industry has been\n      developing highly crosslinked polyethylene (HXLPE) materials to capitalize on the increased\n      wear resistance. In 2007, E1\u00ae Antioxidant Infused Technology was developed to reduce wear\n      rate, maintain mechanical properties and prevent oxidative degradation."
