  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is believed that when androgen (testosterone) levels are below normal that there is a
      disturbance of normal bodily functioning that is associated with priapism in some men.
      Conversely, it is believed that testosterone replacement will improve the condition of
      priapism when the testosterone levels are brought to normal. In turn, this will also improve
      psychological well being in men with sickle cell disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The central hypothesis of this proposal is that a decline in androgen levels and actions
      contributes to the molecular derangements associated with priapism and, conversely,
      optimizing androgen status promotes regulatory molecular mechanisms that protect against
      priapism.  This clinical trial will investigate the potential benefit of precise
      testosterone replacement for ameliorating priapism and improving psychological well-being in
      hypogonadal men with SCD (sickle cell disease).

      This clinical trial will satisfy Specific Aim #3 in the translational research proposal: To
      evaluate the efficacy of testosterone replacement therapy on the frequency of recurrent
      priapism in patients with SCD.  We will test the sub-hypothesis that T replacement to
      achieve serum T concentrations at a target range reduces recurrent priapism.  This aim will
      involve subjective and objective assessments of priapism occurrences and erectile ability
      including priapism inventory instruments, standardized questionnaires of erectile function
      and quality of life, and Rigiscanâ„¢ erection monitoring in a 3-month &quot;pilot&quot; investigation.

    <description>T dosing will be initiated at the lowest possible level (20.25 mg testosterone = 1 pump actuation) which is expected to increase average serum T concentrations no higher than the mid-normal range (500-800 ng/dl), with respect to expected baseline measurements in our population (~300-500 ng/dl).The T dose will be adjusted two weeks after initiation of treatment based on the measurement of serum T levels. Dosing adjustments can be made at 20.25 mg testosteron increments. The medication will be taken transdermally once daily for 3.5 months. Subjects experiencing a reduction in symptoms will be offered open label treatment for an additional 12 months.</description>
