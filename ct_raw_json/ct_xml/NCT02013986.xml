  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Etomidate is an unique drug used for induction of general anesthesia and  sedation. Adrenal
      cortical inhibition by etomidate has received much attention. However wether the circadian
      rhythm and pulse secretion pattern of cortisol in children are the same as that in adults is
      not known. Moreover, the effect of etomidate on circadian rhythm changes and clinical
      outcomes has never been carefully studied in children undergoing surgery. Our hypothesis is
      that etomidate can relieve the changes of circadian rhythm of salivary cortisol in children
      for 24-48 hoursï¼Œand this does not make clinical outcomes worse postoperatively.

      -  Sample size assessment: Using formula to calculate the total number is 30.

        -  Statistical analysis: ANOVA

        -  Reporting for adverse events: During the period of study, if there is any severe
           adverse event happening, such as severe infection, severe low cortisol concentration
           threatening the patient's life we will stop the trial.
