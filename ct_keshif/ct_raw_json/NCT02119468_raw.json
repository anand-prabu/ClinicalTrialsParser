Ixazomib may stop the growth of cancer by\n      interfering with proteasomes (the protein breakdown mechanism in the cells). Pomalidomide\n      and dexamethasone can modify and regulate the immune system and may stop cancer cells from\n      growing.

To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) of MLN9708 (ixazomib), when given in\n      combination with pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or\n      relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. (Phase I) II. To estimate the response rate and to\n      evaluate the antitumor activity of the three drug combination: MLN9708 (at the RP2D),\n      pomalidomide and dexamethasone, in patients with relapsed or relapsed/refractory multiple\n      myeloma. (Phase II)\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To evaluate the safety of MLN9708 at each dose level when given as part of a three drug\n      combination by assessing the following: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course\n      and duration of adverse events; and clinical laboratory tests at various points in the\n      study. (Phase I) II. To characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency,\n      severity, attribution, time course and duration, at the RP2D, for the three drug\n      combination. (Phase II) III. To obtain estimates of response duration, depth of response,\n      clinical benefit response, and survival (overall and progression-free), at the RP2D, for the\n      three drug combination. (Phase II)\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of ixazomib.\n\n      Patients receive ixazomib orally on days 1, 8, and 15; dexamethasone orally on days 1, 8,\n      15, and 22; and pomalidomide orally on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 28 days in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically for 24 months."
