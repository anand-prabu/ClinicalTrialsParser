            "textblock": "Although changes in the lungs, known as remodeling, are a feature of asthma, the causes and\n      mechanisms involved in the process have not yet been found. Recently, it has been\n      established that remodeling can be observed in children prior to a formal diagnosis of\n      asthma. Clinical studies indicate that human rhinovirus (HRV) \"common cold\" infections are a\n      common cause of recurrent respiratory illnesses in childhood, and children with\n      HRV-associated wheezing episodes have an increased risk of developing asthma. This led to\n      the hypothesis that HRV infections may play a central role in the start of the airway\n      remodeling leading to asthma.\n\n      The investigators plan to perform a study in which the investigators will expose subjects\n      with mild-moderate asthma and healthy control subjects to HRV. This will allow us to\n      accurately study the kinetics of HRV-induced inflammatory and remodeling responses in a well\n      characterized group of asthmatic subjects and compare these outcomes to those in a healthy,\n      non-asthmatic control group. The investigators will try to determine if alterations in\n      relevant airway remodeling growth factors differ between healthy controls and asthmatic\n      subjects, pre- and post-HRV infection. These growth factors will be assessed in\n      bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and endobronchial biopsy tissues and correlated with\n      viral levels in both nasal lavage and BAL fluid."
