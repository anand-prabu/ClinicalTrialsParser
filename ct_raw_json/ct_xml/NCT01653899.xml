    <textblock>
      This is an Investigator Initiated, Phase I/II study, where Type 1 diabetic participants will
      receive a 14 day oral treatment of the investigational caspase inhibitor drug IDN-6556
      following their first islet transplant.  Two pilot studies are proposed to establish the
      optimal safety and efficacy dose of IDN-6556 (25 mg or 100 mg twice daily). Participants of
      both pilot studies will receive islet cell transplants under the University of Alberta's
      standard-of-care therapy.

      The primary objective of this protocol is to assess the safety of the IDN-6556 caspase
      inhibitor in adult Type 1 diabetic participants receiving their first islet transplant.

      Secondary objectives include:

        1. To determine the proportion of subjects treated with IDN-6556 who achieve and maintain
           insulin independence after the first or subsequent islet transplant.

        2. To obtain preliminary data on the efficacy of IDN-6556 to maintain adequate
           immunological protection against both allo- and autoimmunity of islet transplant
           recipients.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

        To be eligible the participant must have had T1DM for more than 5 years, complicated by at
        least 1 of the following situations that persist despite intensive insulin management
        efforts:

          -  Reduced awareness of hypoglycemia, as defined by the absence of adequate autonomic
             symptoms at plasma glucose levels &lt; 3.0 mmol/L, indicated by, 1 or more episodes of
             severe hypoglycemia requiring third party assistance within 12 months, a Clarke score
             ≥ 4, HYPO score ≥ 1,000, lability index (LI) ≥ 400 or combined Hypo/LI &gt; 400/300

          -  Metabolic instability, characterized by erratic blood glucose levels that interfere
             with daily activities and or 1 or more hospital visits for diabetic ketoacidosis over
             the last 12 months.

        Participants must be capable of understanding the purpose and risks of the study and must
        sign a statement of informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Severe co-existing cardiac disease, characterized by any one of these conditions: (a)
             recent myocardial infarction (within past 6 months); (b) left ventricular ejection
             fraction &lt; 30%; or (c) evidence of ischemia on functional cardiac exam.

          2. Active alcohol or substance abuse, to include cigarette smoking (must be abstinent
             for 6 months prior to transplant).
