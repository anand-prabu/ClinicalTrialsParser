Subjects are\n      randomized into two groups: immediate spa therapy (18 days of standardized treatment) and\n      control (spa therapy delayed for 6 months). All patients continue usual treatments during\n      the 6-month follow-up period. The main endpoint is the mean change in the DASH score at 6\n      months. Secondary endpoints are the mean change in SF-36 components, treatments used, and\n      tolerance. The effect size of spa therapy is calculated and the proportion of patients\n      reaching minimal clinically important improvement (MCII) is compared between groups."
