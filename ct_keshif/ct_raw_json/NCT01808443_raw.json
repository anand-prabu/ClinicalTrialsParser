There are many kinds of treatments for cutaneous warts, including salicylic acid,\n      cryotherapy, laser, etc. A recent high quality RCT confirmed that the cure rate of topical\n      salicylic acid and frozen has no difference at six months, but the efficacy of laser versus\n      cryotherapy on the treatment of warts remains unclear. Therefore, we designed a randomized\n      controlled trial to test the efficacy of laser versus cryotherapy on the treatment of warts."
