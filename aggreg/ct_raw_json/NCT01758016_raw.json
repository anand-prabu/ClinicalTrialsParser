The risk for vascular complications including: Intra uterine growth restriction (20%),\n      hypertension (31%), preeclampsia (15%), eclampsia and placental abruption are significantly\n      greater than those in background populations. The risk of developing vascular complications\n      in diabetes pregnancies although is correlated with  the severity and length of the disease\n      is not fully understood. Enhanced oxidation  has been suggested to be the underlying\n      abnormality responsible for some of the complications of diabetes.\n\n      Haptoglobin (Hp) is an abundant plasma glycoprotein produced in the liver. The best\n      understood function of Hp is to bind free hemoglobin (Hb) released from red blood cells.\n      Extracorpuscular Hb is a potent Fenton reagent.capable of of inflicting oxidative tissue\n      damage. Hp binds to Hb and serves to inhibit the oxidative potential of Hb by preventing the\n      release of heme iron.\n\n      The haptoglobin (Hp) gene at chromosomal locus 16q22 is polymorphic, with two common alleles\n      denoted 1 and 2.  the prevalence of Hp 1-1, Hp 1-2 and Hp 2-2 genotypes is approximately\n      16%, 48% and 36%, respectively. In the western world. A total  of five independent\n      longitudinal studies have demonstrated that DM individuals with Hp 2-2 genotype have a two\n      to five-fold increased risk of CVD as compared to DM individuals without the Hp 2-2 genotype\n      We sought to determine whether HP genotype plays important role in development of vascular\n      complications in pregastational pregnancies. and whether Hp genotype 2-2  is a risk factor\n      for developing gestational diabetes (GDM)"
