CHL will engage the community, and focus on\n      capacity building and sustainable environmental change.\n\n      The focus of the CHL community-based program is to promote healthy eating and to increase\n      physical activity. In order to demonstrate effectiveness, the investigators will recruit and\n      measure children in six communities selected in each of our jurisdictions in the Pacific.\n      These represent intervention communities, comparison communities, and temporal communities."
