Nine\n      ICUs comprising the Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridgeshire Critical Care Network (NSC CCN)\n      took part. Cambridgeshire 2 Research Ethics Committee approved the study (REC reference:\n      10/H0308/116) and waived the need for informed consent.\n\n      Patients and procedure: All adults treated over the study week at participating ICUs were\n      considered eligible for inclusion. Delirium screening was carried out by patients' direct\n      care clinicians using the Confusion Assessment Method for the ICU (CAM-ICU). All sites used\n      this tool as part of their routine clinical practice and had delirium management guidelines\n      in place at the time of the study. Patients who screened positive for delirium were treated\n      according to local hospital practice."
