In this study, cone beam CT scans\n      will be obtained before individual radiation treatment sessions for head and neck cancer.\n      The information gathered from these scans will be used by the researchers to look at patient\n      movement as well as changes in the amount of normal and tumor tissue throughout the course\n      of radiation therapy.  The researchers will use this information to create hypothetical\n      radiation treatment plans, which will be used as the basis for future research.  The cone\n      beam CT scan data will not be used to alter the actual radiation treatment of any of the\n      patients enrolled on the study. In addition, tests of salivary output and swallowing and\n      questionnaires about quality of life will be made to assess how the doses of radiation\n      affect them."
