Treatment continues every 4 weeks for a total of 6 courses in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 1-6 patients receive escalating doses of cisplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2\n      of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2-3 months for at least 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 1 year."
