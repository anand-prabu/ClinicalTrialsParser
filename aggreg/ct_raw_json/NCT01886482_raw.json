Total protein\n      amount, divided to animal and plant sources in 50%-50% and animal sources distributed\n      (half/half) between meats and dairy products. Fasting blood samples, lipid profile, systolic\n      and diastolic blood pressure and anthropometric measurements were measured based on the\n      standard guidelines."
