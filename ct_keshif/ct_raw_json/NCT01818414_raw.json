Osmotic cervical dilators as well as prostaglandin analogues have been\n      studied for cervical preparation.  However, the optimal method for cervical preparation,\n      especially for D&E procedures that occur on the same day as cervical preparation, is not\n      known.  This study will investigate misoprostol versus placebo as an adjunct to Dilapan-S\n      for cervical preparation for same-day D&E between 16+0 and 20+6 weeks gestation.\n\n      HYPOTHESIS: Administration of 400 \u00b5g buccal misoprostol compared to placebo at least 3 hours\n      prior to D&E as an adjunct to cervical preparation with Dilapan-S will decrease operative\n      time for same-day D&E performed between 16+0 and 20+6 weeks."
