      The investigators assessed the hypothesis that whether RH-PAT index (RHI) as a marker of
      endothelial dysfunction could predict occurrence of ISR after percutaneous coronary
      intervention (PCI).

      This is a prospective observational study of all consecutive patients with coronary artery
      disease (CAD) treated with PCI at Kumamoto University Hospital between January 2010 and
      September 2012. Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who were symptomatic for myocardial
      ischemia and who were undergoing stent implantation for significant CAD.

    <description>Based on the Japanese clinical routine, follow-up (F/U) angiography will be performed at six and nine months after PCI with bare-metal stent (BMS) and drug-eluting stent (DES), respectively. ISR was defined as percent diameter stenosis &gt;50% at F/U angiography assessed by quantitative coronary angiography.</description>

    <description>Fingertip reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT) is a new device that provides noninvasive, automatic, and quantitative evaluation of endothelial dysfunction with low intra- and inter-observer variability. We assess the hypothesis that whether RH-PAT index (RHI) as a marker of endothelial dysfunction could predict occurrence of ISR after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). RHI will be measured using Endo-PAT2000 (Itamar Medical, Caesarea, Israel) before PCI (initial RHI) and at follow-up angiography (F/U RHI) in consecutive patients who had successful PCI in de novo coronary lesions.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Inclusion criteria consisted of patients who were symptomatic for myocardial ischemia
             and who were undergoing stent implantation for significant CAD.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Exclusion criteria were balloon angioplasty only without stent deployment, death
             during hospitalization, and patients who had comorbidities affected RH-PAT results
             such as hemodialysis, advanced cancer, after surgery of breast cancer, dementia,
             collagen disease, and not performing RH-PAT with uncertain reason.
