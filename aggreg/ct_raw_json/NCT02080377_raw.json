This\n      feasibility trial will inform the design of a future substantive multicentre trial to test\n      the hypothesis that combination therapy with glibenclamide and metformin could reduce the\n      number of pregnant women with GDM who require insulin and would be superior to metformin and\n      insulin in terms of acceptability and cost effectiveness.\n\n      Women with GDM who have \"failed\" monotherapy with metformin will be recruited and randomised\n      to either receive glibenclamide (test arm) or standard care with insulin, both in addition\n      to their maximum tolerated dose of metformin. Patients will be recruited from three of the\n      antenatal clinics.\n\n      This is a feasibility study in preparation for a large multicentre randomised trial to test\n      the hypothesis that the addition of glibenclamide to metformin (combination therapy) could\n      reduce the number of pregnant women with gestational diabetes mellitus requiring insulin,\n      without compromising glycaemic control or other clinical outcomes. The investigators\n      hypothesise that combination therapy with metformin and glibenclamide is likely to be\n      preferable to metformin and insulin in terms of acceptability and cost."
