Patients were also asked to stop any former laxative and to\n      continue on a normal diet.\n\n      Each patient was re-evaluated at 7 \u00b1 3 (T1), 60 \u00b1 5 (T2) and 180 \u00b1 15 (T3) days after\n      surgery (Table 2).\n\n      A fluoroscopic colpocystodefecography (with patient sitting upright) was obtained before\n      surgery and between 60-180 days postoperatively in order to assess comparability of the  two\n      groups and exclude negative organic outcomes that could affect functional results.\n\n      Medical events were investigated while checking each patient, with special regard to\n      defecation urgency. From the data collected on concomitant medications, we extrapolated\n      those related to laxative intake.\n\n      The treatment was considered accomplished in patients who had taken at least 70% of the\n      product during each interval of follow-up.\n\n      Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS - PASW Statistics 18.0.0 (IBM \u00a9, 2009).\n\n      For the general and defecographic characteristics, the data are expressed in the form of\n      mean \u00b1 standard deviation for continuous variables and absolute frequency (frequency\n      percentages) for categorical variables. The differences between the two groups were\n      calculated by two-tailed t-test or chi-square when appropriate.\n\n      Scores for the assessment of clinical data are expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation and\n      analysis of the differences in the two groups was performed using the two-tailed t-test. The\n      analysis of not normally distributed variables was conducted using a non-parametric test\n      (Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney).\n\n      Analyses related to defecation urgency and  use of laxatives were carried out using\n      chi-square test and the data are expressed as absolute frequency (frequency percentage).\n\n      For all tests, a value of p <0.05 was considered significant."
