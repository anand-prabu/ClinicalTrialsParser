To determine the effect of eltrombopag on platelet transfusion requirements in the\n      setting of postremission IC - rates of platelet transfusion independence, time to platelet\n      transfusion independence.\n\n      II. To determine the effect of eltrombopag on occurrence of clinically significant bleeding\n      events (CSBE).\n\n      III. To determine any effect on erythrocytic series - rise in hemoglobin levels, time to red\n      blood cell transfusion independence.\n\n      IV. To determine any effect on granulocytic series - time to absolute neutrophil count\n      recovery to > 500 /\u03bcL.\n\n      V. To determine the safety and tolerability of eltrombopag when given at the optimal dose in\n      the setting of postremission chemotherapy - frequency and severity of eltrombopag-related\n      adverse events.\n\n      VI. To determine rates of complete remission (CR), rates of partial complete remission\n      (CRp), time to attain CR, and time to initiation of postremission consolidation therapy.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive eltrombopag olamine orally (PO) once daily (QD) until platelet counts reach\n      >= 50,000/uL or for 8 weeks, whichever comes earlier. Treatment continues in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 2 years."
