        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and
             receive a fully executed copy of the form.

          2. The subject must appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in
             the clinical protocol.

          3. The subject must be between 18 and 45 years of age.

          4. The subject must be an adapted soft contact lens wearer in both eyes.

          5. The subject must be of East or Southeast Asian descent, e.g. ethnic Chinese,
             Japanese, Korean, Malay, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Filipino, etc. (it is preferred but
             not required that both the subject's biological parents are East or Southeast Asian
             ethnicity, by self report).

          6. The subject's vertex corrected spherical equivalent distance refraction must be in
             the range of -1.00 to -6.00 D in each eye.

          7. The subject's refractive cylinder must be no more than 1.00D in each eye.

          8. The subject must have best corrected visual acuity of +0.14 logMAR (equivalent to
             20/25-2) or better in each eye.

          9. Subjects must own a wearable pair of spectacles and wear them on the day of the
             initial visit, during the washout before each phase and during the no lens wear
             phase.

         10. The subject must  have normal eyes (i.e., no ocular medications or infections of any
             type).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Are currently pregnant or lactating by self report (subjects who become pregnant
             during the study will be discontinued).

          2. Have any ocular or systemic allergies or diseases that may interfere with contact
             lens wear.

          3. Have any systemic disease, autoimmune disease, or use of medication, which may
             interfere with contact lens wear. This may include, but may not be limited to,
             diabetes. hyperthyroidism, recurrent herpes simplex/zoster, Sjogren's syndromes,
             xerophthalmia, acne rosacea, Stevens-Johnson syndromes, HIV/AIDS, hepatitis, and
             tuberculosis.

          4. Use of any topical medications such aas eye drops or ointments.

          5. Have entropion, ectropion, extrusions, chalazia, recurrent styes, glaucoma, history
             of recurrent corneal erosion, or aphakia.

          6. Had any previous, or planned ocular or intraocular surgery (e.g. cataract surgery,
             radial keratotomy, PRK, LASIK, etc.).

          7. Have any grade 2.0 or greater slit lamp findings (e.g. edema, corneal
             neovascularization, corneal staining, tarsal abnormalities, conjunctival injection)
             on the Efron classification scale or any other ocular abnormality that may
             contraindicate contact lens wear.

          8. Have any known hypersensitivity or allergic reaction to one of the study products.

          9. Have any ocular infection.

         10. Have any corneal distortion resulting from previous hard or rigid gas permeable
             contact lens wear.

         11. Have participated in any contact lens or lens care product clinical trial within 14
             days prior to study enrollment.

         12. Have any infectious disease (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis) or a contagious
             immunosuppressive disease (e.g. HIV by self report).

         13. Currently wear their contact lenses on an extended wear basis.

         14. Are an employee of the investigational clinic (e.g. Investigator, Coordinator,
