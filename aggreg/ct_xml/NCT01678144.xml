    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to demonstrate the safety, performance and implantability of the
      Medtentia Annuloplasty Ring (MAR) during mitral valve repair surgery. In addition, the trial
      aims to demonstrate that the MAR fulfills the requirements for mitral valve annuloplasty
      rings.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Informed consent form signed by the subjects.

          -  Subjects with indications to undergo mitral valve repair consistent with New York
             Heart Association (NYHA) functional classification II-IV.

          -  Candidate for mitral repair surgery according to European guidelines from the
             European Society of Cardiology (ESC)/US guideline from the American Heart Association
             (AHA).

          -  Technically feasible potential candidate for MAR implantation (appropriate ring size
             confirmed and selected during surgery).

          -  Life expectancy more than 24 months.

          -  Subjects able to attend all scheduled visits and comply with all study procedures.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any previous cardiac surgery.

          -  Any interventional cardiology procedure within 6 months prior to the study

          -  Evidence of acute MI within 30 days of the intended implantation with the
             investigational device.

          -  Prior mitral valve surgery or valvuloplasty or currently implanted prosthetic valve.

          -  Restricted mobility of the mitral apparatus that results in a valvular area less than
             3.0 cm2.

          -  Subjects with fixed pulmonary hypertension.

          -  Recent or evolving bacterial endocarditis or subjects under antibiotic therapy.

          -  Subjects with implanted cardiac defibrillators (ICDs).

          -  Any angiographic or clinical evidence that the investigator feels would place the
             subject at increased risk with the placement of the device.

          -  Subjects who are immunocompromised or with autoimmune diseases.

          -  Subjects suffering from renal insufficiency (creatinine &gt;200 mmol/L) or subjects with
             chronic renal failure undergoing dialysis.

          -  History of stroke within the last 12 months or stroke that has caused major
             neurological dysfunction and/or significant carotid artery disease (subjects with
             carotid stenosis ≥50% and/or ulceration).

          -  History of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy.

          -  Subjects to undergo concomitant cardiac repair or replacement other than CABG (less
             than or equal to 4 vessels), tricuspid valve repair and ablation therapy for
             correction of atrial fibrillation.

          -  Co-morbid conditions that place the subject at an unacceptable surgical risk (e.g.
             severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], hepatic failure,
             immunosuppressive abnormalities and haematological abnormalities).

          -  Significant mitral annular calcification (MAC).

          -  Use of Coumadin, IIlb or IIIa inhibitors, Clopidogrel (Plavix) or other
             anti-coagulants within 5 days prior to surgery.

          -  Participation in any study involving an investigational drug or device within the
             past 30 days or ongoing participation in a study with an investigational drug or
             device.

          -  Intolerance or hypersensitivity to anaesthetics.

          -  Subjects in whom trans-oesophageal ECHO/Doppler is contraindicated.

          -  Patients who are not suitable for the study based on the surgeons evaluation
