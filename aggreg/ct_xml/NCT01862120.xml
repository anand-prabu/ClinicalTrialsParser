    <textblock>
      Human recombinant interleukin-2 (rhIL-2) is a biological signalling protein playing a key
      role in the regulation of the immune system.  At high doses, rhIL-2 activates the immune
      effectors T cells (TEFFS) while at low doses rhIL-2 induces and activates regulatory T cells
      (TREGS), a population of immune cells controlling the immune Teff response. In patients with
      Type 1 Diabetes (T1D), TREGS fail to control the autoimmune destruction by TEFFS of
      pancreatic beta-cells producing insulin. The investigator recently showed that rhIL-2 at low
      dose is well tolerated in patients with an autoimmune disease and in adults with established
      T1D, inducing TREGS without effects on TEFFS. The investigators aim to use rhIL-2 at low
      dose to induce/stimulate TREGS in young recently diagnosed T1D patients. This study will
      investigate the dose effect relationship of low dose rhIL-2 on TREG induction such as to
      optimize the risk benefit ratio of this treatment in T1D. Through Treg induction, the
      investigators aim to protect the remaining/regenerating pancreatic β-cells from autoimmune
      destruction, thus improving or even curing T1D.

      Main objective:

      Define the lowest dose of rhIL-2 inducing TREGS in children with recently diagnosed type 1
      diabetes.

      Conduct of the study:

      Three doses will be studied versus placebo in parallel groups of six patients. Each dose or
      placebo will be studied according to three periods of treatment:

        1. Acute tolerance following a single administration at day 1 [day 1- day 15].

        2. Induction of TREGS following a cure of 5 days repeated once daily administration [day
           15 - day 30].

        3. Maintenance of TREGS following repeated administration once every two weeks for one
           year [day 30 - day 360].

      At each treatment period, Treg response and tolerance will be evaluated. In addition,
      overall response on T1D parameters will be assessed throughout the study.
