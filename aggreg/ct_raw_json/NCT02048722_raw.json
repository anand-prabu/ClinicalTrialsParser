This study is for patients who have angiosarcoma that has gotten\n      worse after they received chemotherapy. Regorafenib is a type of drug called a kinase\n      inhibitor. Regorafenib interferes with how some kinase proteins work. Some of these kinases\n      in cancer cells might normally help the cancer cells grow or form new blood vessels that\n      could feed a growing tumor. By blocking these proteins, regorafenib may help stop the growth\n      of certain cancers."
