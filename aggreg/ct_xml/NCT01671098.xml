  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sinonasal gas exchange is facilitated by the unique anatomy and topography of the sinonasal
      interface that represents a collection of airfoils creating an aerodynamic structure. The
      airflow during respiration generates positive and negative pressures that power the gas
      exchange between the sinuses and the nose. Major surgical alteration of the interface
      reduces the rate and velocity of the exchange. Minimally invasive procedures aimed at
      preserving the natural anatomy, topography and aerodynamic configuration of the interface
      will have negligible effects on sinonasal gas exchange.
