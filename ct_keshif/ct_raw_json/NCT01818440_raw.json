            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - Researchers are interested in comparing two methods that doctors can use to position\n      catheters in blood vessels. These methods are used to deliver chemotherapy and close the\n      blood supply to a tumor. The methods are the standard method called fluoroscopy and a new\n      way called    3-D Roadmap.    The 3-D Roadmap software uses computed tomography (CT) images\n      to help the doctor choose the best position for the catheter to get to the tumor. The\n      computer shows the route on an x-ray screen in real time. This technique may help doctors\n      position the catheter with less x-ray dye and in a shorter time. These methods will be\n      compared in people who are having a procedure to destroy liver tumors. The procedure, called\n      trans-arterial embolization, will deliver chemotherapy and destroy the tumor blood supply.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To compare the effectiveness of fluoroscopy or 3-D Roadmap software for liver tumor\n      treatment.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who are having trans-arterial embolization for liver\n      cancer.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will\n           provide blood and urine samples, and have imaging studies.\n\n        -  Participants will be divided into two groups. One group will have regular fluoroscopy\n           (X-ray) during the procedure. The other group will have the procedure with the 3-D\n           Roadmap software.\n\n        -  In the first group, participants will have a CT scan. The doctor will decide how many\n           vessels need to be treated. The doctor will advance the catheter using fluoroscopy\n           only. Another CT scan will be given after the procedure.\n\n        -  In the second group, participants will have a CT scan. The doctor will look at the scan\n           with the 3-D Roadmap software. The software will show the path to advance the catheter.\n           The doctor will use the software to help destroy the tumors. Another CT scan will be\n           given after the procedure.\n\n        -  Both groups will have the same follow-up care afterward. Other tests will be given as\n           needed for the cancer treatment."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      This is a phase II prospective randomized trial comparing novel tumor segmentation and\n      navigation with 3D roadmap vs. conventional imaging with angiography during trans-arterial\n      embolization procedures. Cone beam CT (CBCT) obtains CT-like images in the angiography suite\n      during trans-arterial chemoembolization procedures and liver chemo-perfusion (PHP). In\n      addition, 2D liver perfusion metrics can be calculated from angiography images. 3D Roadmap\n      is a navigation tool that utilizes the data from the CBCT overlaid on live fluoroscopy to\n      display a segmented tumor, delineate its vascular supply and to navigate catheters to the\n      target vessels. Moreover, with 3D Roadmap, CBCT can be fused to prior CT or MRI for improved\n      target visualization.\n\n      Primary Objective:\n\n      To compare safety, and technical efficiency of navigation with 3D Roadmap vs. conventional\n      image guidance during trans-arterial embolization procedures.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Subjects are eligible if:\n\n        -  They are more than 18 years of age\n\n        -  They have primary or metastatic hepatic tumors scheduled for trans-arterial chemo-\n           embolization or bland embolization in interventional radiology\n\n        -  They are eligible for trans-arterial chemoembolization or bland embolization\n\n      Subjects are excluded if they have:\n\n        -  An altered mental status precluding understanding or consenting for the procedure\n\n        -  Contra-indications to trans-arterial embolization\n\n        -  A gross body weight exceeding 375 pounds (upper limit of angio table)\n\n        -  A pregnancy\n\n        -  A severe allergic reaction to iodine contrast which cannot be controlled by\n           premedication with antihistamines and steroids\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Number of Participants: 30\n\n        -  Recruitment Time Frame: 2 years\n\n        -  Number of sites: 2\n\n        -  Type of Study: prospective randomized clinical trial"
