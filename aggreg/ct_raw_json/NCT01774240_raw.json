Patients are at\n      risk of e.g. pulling catheters and lines and may fall attempting to get out of bed. The\n      aging patient population present with many risk factors for developing delirium, but\n      diagnostic tools have been few. Almost 50% present with hypoactive delirium, which is often\n      not diagnosed, nor treated correctly. To optimize effect, treatment should be initiated\n      early, maintained until clinical improvement is observed, and then tapered gradually.\n      Recently, Delirium Observation Screening scale (DOS scale) was developed and validated in\n      elective cardiac surgery patients in the Netherlands, with interesting results. This\n      encouraged us to evaluate the effects of systematic delirium screening and treatment in\n      cardiac surgery patients. To our knowledge, no prior studies have evaluated use of DOS scale\n      in this context.\n\n      OBJECTIVES To evaluate the incidence and severity of delirium, and the effects of\n      standardized treatment in a population of Danish cardiac surgery patients."
