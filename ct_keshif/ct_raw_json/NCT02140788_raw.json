            "textblock": "One purpose of this study is to test whether adding metformin will limit some of the\n      unwanted effects of clozapine, compared to not adding metformin.  Metformin is a medication\n      that is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment\n      of type-2 diabetes.    Studies have found that people with type-2 diabetes often lose some\n      weight when they take metformin, however the FDA has not approved metformin for weight loss,\n      so for this study the use of metformin is investigational.  This study will test whether\n      metformin can help people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders lose weight.\n\n      Another purpose of this study is to test whether adding fish oil will improve the benefit of\n      clozapine and/or limit some of the unwanted effects of clozapine, compared to not adding\n      fish oil.  Fish oil is a medication used to reduce levels of some fats (triglycerides) in\n      blood.  Some studies have found that adding fish oil reduces psychosis (voices,\n      suspiciousness).  However the FDA has not approved fish oil for reducing psychosis, so for\n      this study the use of fish oil is investigational.  This study will test whether fish oil\n      can help people with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders have less psychosis.  Fish\n      oil is not an antipsychotic medication."
