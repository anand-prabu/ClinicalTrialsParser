men treated or enrolled on this protocol\n             must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of\n             study participation, and 4 months after completion of vorinostat administration\n\n          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document\n\n          -  Patients must be able to swallow capsules/tablets\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients who are not a candidate for an unrelated donor allogeneic HSCT based on the\n             current institutional bone marrow transplant (BMT) program clinical practice\n             guidelines; organ function criteria will be utilized per the current institutional\n             BMT program clinical practice guidelines; there will be no restriction to study entry\n             based on hematological parameters\n\n          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic\n             composition to vorinostat\n\n          -  Patients undergoing a total body irradiation (TBI)-based conditioning regimen (TBI\n             1200 centigray [cGy])\n\n          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active\n             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac\n             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with\n             study requirements; patients still under therapy for presumed or proven infection are\n             eligible provided there is clear evidence (radiographic findings and/or culture\n             results) that the infection is well-controlled; patients under treatment for\n             infection will be enrolled only after clearance from the Principal Investigator (PI)\n\n          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because vorinostat is a histone\n             deacetylase inhibitor agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient\n             effects; because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing\n             infants secondary to treatment of the mother with vorinostat, breastfeeding should be\n             discontinued if the mother is treated with vorinostat\n\n          -  Patients with evidence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seropositivity and/or\n             positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay, human T-lymphotropic virus\n             (HTLV)1/HTLV2 seropositivity; the safety of allogeneic HSCT is not yet\n             well-established for this population\n\n          -  Patients with evidence of hepatitis B or hepatitis C PCR positivity; hepatitis\n             reactivation following myelosuppressive therapy can lead to fatal complications\n\n          -  Patients with a history of prolonged corrected QT interval (QTc) syndrome\n\n          -  Patients asking or who have had prior treatment with a drug like vorinostat (i.e.,\n             valproic acid) within the last 30 days"
