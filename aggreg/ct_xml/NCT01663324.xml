      Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is used to modulate both the auditory and non-auditory
      neural pathways contributing to the perception of phantom sounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tinnitus is the phantom auditory perception of sound in the absence of an external or
      internal acoustic stimulus. It is a frequent problem which can interfere significantly with
      the ability to lead a normal life. Treatment remains difficult. Most available therapies
      focus on habituation rather than treating the cause. Tinnitus has been shown to be
      associated with functional reorganization of auditory neural pathways and tonotopic maps in
      the central auditory system. Consequently, low-frequency Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic
      Stimulation (rTMS) applied to the temporoparietal areas has been investigated for the
      treatment of tinnitus. Additionally, there is growing evidence that a neural network of both
      auditory and non-auditory cortical areas is involved in the pathophysiology of chronic
      subjective tinnitus. Targeting several core regions of this network by rTMS might constitute
      a promising strategy to enhance treatment effects. A new multisite treatment protocol which
      is supposed to have an effect on both auditory and non-auditory cortical areas will be
      examined with regard to feasibility, safety and clinical efficacy in patients suffering from
      chronic tinnitus in a controlled pilot trial.
