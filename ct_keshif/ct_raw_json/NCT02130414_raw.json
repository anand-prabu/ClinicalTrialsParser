Concentrations of unchanged cyclosporine and it's\n      metabolites in the faeces  will also be explored.\n\n      Stage 1 of the study will investigate the 75mg dose (OD and BID) of CyCol\u00ae and IV\n      Sandimmun\u00ae. Then dependent on results Stages 2 and 3 will investigate either lower (37.5mg)\n      or higher (150mg) dose levels. The dosing regimens chosen for Stages 2 and 3 will be based\n      upon safety and tolerability, systemic exposure and colonic mucosa tissue concentrations\n      observed at other doses."
