In\n      completion general health questionnaires as well as hip specific scoring instruments will be\n      used to evaluate patient satisfaction and outcome.The hypothesis of the study is that the\n      different centralizers will result in different migration patterns of the stems, which might\n      affect the risk for late aseptic loosening."
