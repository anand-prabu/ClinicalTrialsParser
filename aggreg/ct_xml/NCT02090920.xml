    <textblock>
      This study looks at the effects of a mothers genes and other characteristics (mothers age,
      baby's age, race, and other diseases) on the ability of nifedipine to end contractions and
      prevent an early delivery.  This information will be used to decide what amount of
      nifedipine women need to best treat preterm contractions.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between the amount of nifedipine
      in a woman's body and its effect on ending preterm (early) labor contractions and delaying
      delivery by at least 48 hours. The study will also look at the effects of genes (materials
      passed from parent to child that determine the make-up of the body) and other
      characteristics (for example mother's age, baby's age, race, and other diseases or drugs) on
      the ability of nifedipine to end the contractions. We will use this information to decide
      what amount of nifedipine women need to best treat preterm contractions.  This study will
      also examine the effect of pregnancy on how fast nifedipine is removed from the woman's
      body.

      This study will be conducted on two phases. The first will study women who are starting
      nifedipine for treatment of preterm labor. Nifedipine dose will be determined by the
      patient's physician.  During the first seven hours of treatment, blood samples will be
      obtained from the mother to determine the concentration of nifedipine and its metabolite,
      oxidized nifedipine.  A blood sample will also be obtained for DNA isolation to examine
      variants in genes involved in the nifedipine pathway.  We will also collect data on uterine
      contractions and blood pressure through clinical monitoring.  After delivery, maternal and
      umbilical cord blood samples will be obtained, along with a piece of placenta.  Women who
      take part in the first phase will be asked to return 6-10 weeks after delivery.  At that
      time, she will take a single dose of 10 mg immediate release nifedipine by mouth and blood
      samples will be collected for up to 6 hours. Blood pressure will also be monitored prior to
      collection of each blood sample

    <description>The primary study outcome is prevention of delivery for 48 hours with attainment of uterine quiescence, defined by 12 hours of six or fewer contractions per hour and no further cervical change. Failure of the primary outcome occurs if, in the first 48 hours, patients deliver, rupture membranes, experience recurrent preterm labor, continue to contract or experience cervical change, or required the use of alternate tocolytics. Secondary outcomes include time to uterine quiescence (â‰¤6 contractions/hour), birth weight, gestational age at delivery, maternal and neonatal adverse effects.</description>

          -  Diagnosed with preterm labor (defined as 1-3 uterine contractions per 10
             minute interval for at least 60 minutes with evidence of change in cervical dilation
             and/or effacement)

          -  Multifetal gestation

          -  Cervical dilation of 5 cm or greater

          -  Ruptured uterine membranes

          -  Administration of medications known to interact with CYP3A (a human gene) other than
             betamethasone or dexamethasone as indicated for stimulating fetal lung maturation,
             within the past 24 hours unless approved by study investigators

          -  Administered a potent mechanism-based CYP3A inhibitor (e.g. erythromycin,
