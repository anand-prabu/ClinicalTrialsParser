Among the worst of the long-term effects of\n      chronic immunosuppression are the nephrotoxicity (toxic to kidney cells) of the calcineurin\n      inhibitors and the myriad complications of steroids. This protocol evaluates the elimination\n      or reduction of calcineurin inhibitors in a protocol that has already successfully\n      eliminated the long-term use of steroids. A considerable need remains for safer therapeutic\n      agents that inhibit T-cell activation (a white blood cell that attacks foreign cells as part\n      of the immune response) via a calcineurin independent or reduced-dose mechanism of action."
