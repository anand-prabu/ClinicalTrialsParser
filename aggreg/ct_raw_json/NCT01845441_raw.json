While Precedex has been shown to be equivalent, if not\n      superior to, conventional sedation in the procedural setting, it has not yet been evaluated\n      in the setting of endovascular treatment of acute stroke.  This setting is particularly ripe\n      for evaluation, as there is currently controversy over the best method for management of\n      patient sedation in light of the auxiliary need to preserve neurologic function.  In order\n      to evaluate the benefit of Precedex in this setting, it must be compared to the usual\n      standard of care.  Through the investigators double blinded randomized trial, the\n      investigators will obtain information on the comparison between two arms, one receiving\n      Precedex and the other the usual standard of care at the investigators institution, for\n      achieving and maintaining a pre-defined level of conscious sedation, while preserving\n      baseline neurologic status. This assessment will optimistically serve as the basis for\n      future large-scale studies and ultimately to the establishment of Precedex as a first-line\n      sedative in the management of acute stroke and cerebral vasospasm patients undergoing\n      endovascular intervention."
