      The purpose of this study is to investigate cleavage products of the urokinase
      plasminogenactivator receptor (uPAR) in plasma from patients with castration resistant
      prostate cancer as a predictive marker of response to abiraterone.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Signed informed consent.

          -  Age ≥18 years and male

             neuroendocrine differentiation or small cell histology

          -  Received at least one but not more than two cytotoxic chemotherapy regimens for
             metastatic CRPC. At least one regimen must have contained a taxane such as docetaxel.

          -  Prostate cancer progression as assessed by the investigator with one of the
             following:

          -  Uncontrolled hypertension (systolic blood pressure ≥160 mmHg or diastolic blood

          -  History of pituitary or adrenal dysfunction

          -  Clinically significant heart disease as evidenced by myocardial infarction, or
             arterial thrombotic events in the past 6 months, severe or unstable angina, or New
             York Heart Association (NYHA) Class III or IV heart disease or left ventricular
             ejection fraction (LVEF) of &lt;50% at baseline.

          -  Known brain metastasis

          -  History of gastrointestinal disorders (medical disorders or extensive surgery) that
             may interfere with the absorption of the study drug

          -  Any acute toxicities due to prior chemotherapy or radiotherapy that have not resolved
             to a NCI-CTCAE (Version 4.0) Grade of ≤1. Chemotherapy induced alopecia and Grade 2
             peripheral neuropathy is allowed.

          -  Use of other anticancer therapy including cytotoxic, radionucleotide, and
             immunotherapy; diethylstilbestrol; PC-SPES; spironolactone (ie, ALDACTONE, SPIRONOL);
             and other preparations such as saw palmetto thought to have endocrine effects on
             prostate cancer, within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Prior systemic treatment with an azole drug (eg, fluconazole, itraconazole,
             ketoconazole) within 4 weeks of Cycle 1 Day 1

          -  Current enrolment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such
             a study within 30 days of Day 1

          -  Condition or situation which, in the investigator's opinion, may put the subjects at
             significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere significantly with
             subject's participation in the study.
