            "textblock": "Background:  Head injury is a common presentation to family medicine clinics and emergency\n      departments (EDs), and the majority will not result in intracranial injury requiring\n      neurosurgical consultation, but will have symptoms of mild traumatic brain injury (MTBI). It\n      is estimated between 15-50% of patients with MTBI develop post-concussive syndrome (PCS).\n      Research in the management of MTBI and prevention of PCS has been scarce to date.  Although\n      expert consensus recommends cognitive rest and graduated return to usual activities, these\n      and other interventions are not based on prospective clinical evidence.\n\n      Objective: The purpose of this study is to determine if providing graduated return to usual\n      activities discharge instructions to MTBI patients in the ED decreases MTBI symptoms\n      post-injury as compared to providing usual ED MTBI discharge instructions.\n\n      Study Design: This will be a pragmatic, single-centered, 2-arm parallel-group, superiority\n      randomized trial.\n\n      Patient Population:  Male and female patients presenting to the ED ages greater than 17 and\n      less than 65 with the Canadian Emergency Department Information System (CEDIS) presenting\n      complaint of \"head injury\".\n\n      Outcomes: The primary outcome of this study is to determine if patients whom receive\n      graduated return to usual activity discharge instructions have more clinically significant\n      decreases in their Post-Concussion Symptom Score (PCSS) 2 weeks after MTBI versus patients\n      who received usual care MTBI discharge instructions.  Secondary outcomes include the\n      intervention group's compliance with the intervention, comparison of PCSS between groups 4\n      weeks after initial ED visit, comparison of groups' number of return visit(s) to either an\n      ED or physician's office, and the mean number of days of school or work missed for each\n      group.\n\n      Hypothesis: Given cognitive rest and graduated return to usual activities are concepts\n      recommended by expert consensus, it is expected patients who follow the graduated return to\n      usual activities and cognitive rest guidelines will have less MTBI symptoms at two weeks\n      after ED discharge."
