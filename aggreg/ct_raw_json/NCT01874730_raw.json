The purpose of this study is to\n      determine if an enhanced recovery strategy paying close attention to the type and amount of\n      fluid given during the surgery with proper monitoring combined with a comprehensive\n      perioperative pain management will have a better post-operative outcome compared to\n      institutional standard of care (SOC), in patients undergoing surgery of the colon. One of\n      the fluids used, Volulyte\u00ae, is an intravenous solution used to treat low blood volume.  The\n      Volulyte\u00ae solution being used in the study and the monitor used are approved by the Korean\n      Food and Drug Administration"
