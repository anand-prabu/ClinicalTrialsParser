      1. Our hypotheses on the relationship between periodontitis and AS are as follows;

             -  The prevalence of periodontitis is higher in AS patients group than that of non-AS
                control group

             -  Anti-TNF-α therapy would favorably affect the disease course of periodontitis.

        2. Based on our hypotheses, the specific objectives of the present proposal are as
           follows;

             -  The primary objective is to compare the prevalence rate of periodontitis between
                AS patient group and non-AS group.

             -  The secondary objectives will be:

                  -  To observe the carriage rate of P. gingivalis in AS and non-AS groups

                  -  To identify clinical parameters associated with the severity of periodontitis
                     in AS group.

                  -  To compare the progression of periodontitis at weeks 12 and 24 between AS and
                     non-AS groups or between AS patients with and without anti-TNF-α treatment

        1. AS group will consist of patients aged 18 years or more who meet the 1984 modified
             New York criteria for AS.

             i. AS group receiving anti-TNF-α agents will consists of AS patients who have
             received adalimumab, etanercept, or infliximab before enrollment (or begin anti-TNF-α
             agents at enrollment) and keep anti-TNF-α agents for 3 months or more after
             enrollment.

             ii. AS group not receiving anti-TNF-α agents will consists of AS patients who are
             treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, sulfasalazine, or
             non-pharmacological therapy and keep non-anti-TNF-α therapy for 3 months or more
             after enrollment.

          2. Control group will consist of age- (± 3 years) and gender-matched volunteers who do
             not have inflammatory arthropathy.
