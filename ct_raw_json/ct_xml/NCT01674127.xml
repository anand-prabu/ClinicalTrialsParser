    <textblock>
      The present study examined the effects of Methyldopa on uterine artery diameter, uterine
      artery blood flow, umbilical artery and fetal middle-cerebral artery in patients with
      Preeclampsia, using Doppler ultrasound.

    <description>In case group, 25 patients, under treatment, using Methyldopa for 7 days, received 500 mgs of Methyldopa in its oral form per day and in control group, participants received placebo for 7 days.Before and after drug use, Doppler ultrasound test was done by a radiology specialist not informed of patients grouping. Also, pulsatility index, resistance index, systolic/diastolic blood flow ratios of uterine artery, umbilical artery and middle-cerebral artery were evaluated. Registered for all patients, age, BMI, gestational week and the number of pregnancies were among other examined variables.
Doppler indices of examined arteries in studied groups were evaluated by color Doppler ultrasound of model &quot;Hitachi 3/6 MHz&quot;.</description>
