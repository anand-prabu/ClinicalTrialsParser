Afterwards, a 28 week open label phase with methotrexate\n      alone is started. Golimumab will be discontinued.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n      First, the investigators hypothesize that initiation of a combination therapy with golimumab\n      + MTX will be safe and superior to MTX alone in MTX-na\u00efve PsA patients, as assessed by the\n      percentage of patients achieving Disease Activity Score (the investigators hypothesize that\n      more patients with the early combination treatment will respond (according to Disease\n      Activity Score (DAS), American college of Rheumatology (ACR), or Psoriatic Arthritis\n      Response Criteria (PsARC) responses) and achieve a state of Low Disease Activity (LDA) or\n      Minimal Disease Activity (MDA) than patients on MTX alone.\n\n      Third, the investigators hypothesize that a significant proportion of the patients will\n      continue to benefit from this early aggressive treatment initiation even after stopping\n      golimumab treatment."
