  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a leading cause of disability in the elderly and this
      disability is commonly attributed to knee pain. Current treatments for knee pain are only
      modestly efficacious, and some common treatments like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
      (NSAIDS) have adverse long-term effects. Acupressure is an inexpensive and noninvasive
      treatment that has the potential to be a useful long-term self-management strategy for pain.
      Acupressure can be easily taught and is safe enough to self-apply without supervision. The
      primary objective of this project is to determine whether self-administered acupressure is
      an effective and feasible self-management strategy for older adults with symptomatic KOA.
      Participants will be randomized to three treatment groups: pain-relief acupressure, sham
      acupressure, and usual care (UC). The intervention will last for 8 weeks during which
      participants in the pain-relief and sham acupressure  groups will be taught the assigned
      treatment by a trained research assistant who is blinded to the treatment arm, and provided
      with a digital video disc to aid their practice at home. The research assistant will make
      weekly phone calls to support the participants' adherence to treatment. The UC group will
      receive no intervention from the research team. Data will be collected at baseline,
      mid-point (4 weeks after baseline) and the end ( 8 weeks) of the intervention. These results
      will help us assess the efficacy of pain-relief acupressure on knee pain in older adults,
      and allow us to calculate  effect sizes to determine the appropriate sample size for a
      larger future study. Since no studies have involved older adults in self-administered
      acupressure, information about feasibility of and adherence to using this method in older
      adults would be invaluable.

    <description>Both objective and subjective assessments of physical function will be used. The 6 minute walk and the timed up and go (TUG) tests are the objective measures.  The 6 minute walk test has been demonstrated to yield reliable measurements of exercise capacity and is frequently used in OA trials.  The TUG is a test of functional ability and measures the time (in seconds) to get up from a chair, walk 20 feet and return to the chair.  For subjective assessment, we will use the physical function subscale (17 items) of WOMAC.</description>
