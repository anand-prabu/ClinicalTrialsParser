A third aim is to\n      study whether the participating subjects are adherent to the study protocol meaning 12\n      samples taken during a period of four weeks."

            "textblock": "Mycoplasma genitalium (Mg), detected in 1980, causes a urogenital infection through sexual\n      transmission. In contrast to Chlamydia trachomatis antibiotic resistance is common against\n      tetracyclines and is emerging against macrolides such as azithromycin. Both antibiotics are\n      recommended as the first line treatment of chlamydia infection. Recent published data,\n      however, indicate that 1g azithromycin stat may be only bacteriostatic when treating\n      chlamydia.\n\n      The consensus to date is that there should always be a test of cure in pregnant women having\n      been treated for chlamydia and in all individuals treated for Mg.\n\n      There are no studies published, to our knowledge, where the time to eradication after\n      antibiotic treatment commenced in Mg infection has been evaluated. The first line treatment\n      of a confirmed Mg infection is azithromycin 1.5 g given during a period of 5 days. If\n      macrolide resistance is plausible or confirmed moxifloxacin 400mg for 7 to 10 days is\n      recommended.\n\n      Individuals with symptomatic urethritis or cervicitis and/or being sexual partners to\n      individuals being treated for a suspect or confirmed Mg or CT infection were eligible. The\n      study subjects were patients attending either of the STD-clinics in Norrk\u00f6ping or V\u00e4stervik,\n      Sweden. All samples were sent to Statens Serum Institut(SSI), Mycoplasma department (Jorgen\n      Skov Jensen) for analysis.\n\n      Patients accepting enrolment with a confirmed or highly suspected Mg were receiving\n      azithromycin 500 mg the first day and 250mg the following four days.\n\n      Patients where macrolide resistant Mg-strain infection was highly suspected received\n      moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for seven days.\n\n      Those subjects intended to treatment but with a lower degree of suspicion of Mg infection\n      were randomized to either a treatment with doxycycline 200 mg the first day and 100 mg once\n      daily the following nine days (the custom and recommendation in Sweden for treatment of\n      chlamydia and non-specific urethritis or cervicitis) OR a treatment with azithromycin 1g as\n      a single dose.\n\n      All participants were given test kits for 12 samples, which were to be sampled three times\n      weekly (every second day) during four weeks starting the day after the first day of\n      treatment. They were instructed not to have any sexual intercourse during the first week and\n      with condom afterwards during the study period. The samples were to be sent once weekly\n      (three samples)to SSI.The date of sampling was to be noted on the label of the tube and the\n      attaching paper to SSI, where also any symptoms were to be noted. The results of the tests\n      were sent to the STD-clinic who informed the patient.\n\n      The study started in February 2010 and inclusion of patients will hopefully stop in December\n      2012.\n\n      To date 109 patients have been enrolled."
