Practice Guidelines delineating specific ways physicians manage\n      diabetes have been outlined. Missing are guidelines for health care providers to encourage\n      patients to take responsibility for their diabetes. Traditional patient education models\n      have been ineffective in managing diabetic persons because they have relied upon information\n      given alone and are disease centered rather than patient centered.  This study will explore\n      the role of self-efficacy in helping veterans move toward healthy behaviors.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The long-term objectives are to:  1) increase recognition of veteran\ufffds responsibility for\n      health; 2) develop more effective skills in managing chronic conditions; and 3) explore the\n      role of self-efficacy in facilitating improvements in health behaviors and health care\n      utilization.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      This is a prospective, randomized controlled clinical trial of 2,068 cognitively intact,\n      diabetic veterans. The outcome measures (health behaviors, self-efficacy, health status and\n      health care utilization) will be measured using self-rated scales developed and tested by\n      Lorig and colleagues from Stanford University. Glucose levels and BMI changes will be\n      evaluated using information documented in the medical record.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Enrollment (a total of 326 patients) is closed. All necessary data have been received and\n      are being analyzed."
