  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators hypothesized that sleeping in a 45 degrees elevated body position
      decreases the likelihood of upper airway vulnerability to collapse. Furthermore, the
      investigators want to elucidate the anatomical and physiological risk factors that
      contribute in the upper airway obstruction in post-partum patients.

    <description>We conduct polysomnography in supine and 45 degrees elevated body position, to show the effect of body position in context of sleep disordered breathing.We collect data of the apnea-hypopnea-index, central apneas, obstructive apneas and oxygen.</description>

    <description>We measure pulmonary function using spirometry, and have a look at MEF/MIF 50 Ratio, FIV 1, FVC and FEV 1. Furthermore we evaluate risk factors for upper airway dysfunction by using the STOP-Bang-Questionnaire, and Mallampati Scores, as well as anatomical landmarks (measuring inter-incisor gap, thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck circumference).</description>
