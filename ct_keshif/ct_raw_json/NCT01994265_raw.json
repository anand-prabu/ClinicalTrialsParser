Use of warfarin for the prevention of stroke in\n      AF patients, despite effective, remains beyond desired levels because of interactions with\n      food and fluctuations in blood levels. Because of a more stable anticoagulation state,\n      Dabigatran may offer better protection against thrombotic phenomenon and, consequently,\n      mitigate the process of cognitive and functional compromise."
