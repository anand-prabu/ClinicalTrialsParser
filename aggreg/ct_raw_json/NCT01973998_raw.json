            "textblock": "Background: COPD exacerbations add considerably to patients' burden because they: (1) cause\n      frequent hospital admissions and relapses or readmissions, (2) contribute directly to the\n      death of many patients, either during hospitalization or shortly thereafter, (3) cause\n      patients significant stress, prolonged physical discomfort, disability and dramatically\n      reduced quality of life, (4) consume the majority of the resources available to manage this\n      chronic condition, (5) frequently progress to a severe stage warranting hospitalization\n      before any abortive treatment is instituted, and (6) may hasten the progressive loss of lung\n      function, a steady decline that is a cardinal feature of COPD itself. Hence, investigations\n      of new therapies to treat COPD patients who are hospitalized with a severe exacerbation are\n      desperately needed.\n\n      Objective: To test the feasibility of roflumilast to decrease all cause readmission and\n      mortality 180 days after hospitalization for acute COPD exacerbation.\n\n      Methods: Parallel-group, prospective, randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial of\n      roflumilast 500 ug daily vs. placebo in approximately 100 hospitalized AECOPD patients.\n      Inclusion Criteria. Primary diagnosis of AECOPD; admission to the hospital <12 hours;\n      patient age >40, < 80 years old; cigarette smoking > 10 pack-years. Exclusion Criteria.\n      Prior diagnosis or high suspicion for asthma; pulmonary edema, pneumonia, interstitial lung\n      disease or significant bronchiectasis; intubated and mechanically ventilated at the time of\n      evaluation; active liver disease, or transaminase elevations (> 3xULN); history of heavy\n      ethanol use; history of suicidal behavior \u2264 2 years or suicidal ideation \u2264 6 months prior to\n      enrollment; pregnant or lactating females.
