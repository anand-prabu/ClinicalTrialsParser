A\n      retrospective chart / electronic medical record review of colorectal cancer patients treated\n      with infusional 5-FU regimens between May 1, 2009 and December 31, 2013, satisfying the\n      inclusion/exclusion criteria, will be performed.  In this multi-center study, patients who\n      underwent PK-testing during at least two different 5-FU administrations will be matched to\n      patients who received doses based on their BSA, treated at the same institution.  Matching\n      for selection of the BSA cohort at each site will be done using the following criteria\n      (based on factors that may influence 5-FU metabolism):  age, gender, disease stage, prior\n      chemotherapy treatment, and 5-FU containing treatment regimen being used.   Each patient\n      will be assigned a random five-digit Study ID number to protect patient confidentiality.\n      Minimal medical history/demographics data will be collected from the patient's medical\n      records / clinic chart using paper case report forms (CRFs).  The data to be collected from\n      each patient's records will include: patient demographics (i.e. gender, age, height, and\n      race), colorectal cancer diagnosis (i.e. date of primary diagnosis, tumor stage, grade,\n      histology and phenotype, and date of metastatic diagnosis and sites of metastases if\n      applicable), use of prior therapies for treatment of CRC, 5-FU containing regimen details\n      throughout the 5-FU treatment (i.e. weight, BSA, ECOG status, doses of each drug used in the\n      regimen, and 5-FU infusion start/stop dates and times), 5-FU PK testing results (if\n      applicable), concomitant procedures and medications, CBC and chemistry testing results,\n      adverse events experienced during 5-FU therapy regimen, and tumor response and follow-up\n      information.  Patients will not be contacted for the purposes of this study and a waiver of\n      HIPAA authorization will be requested from the appropriate IRB.  Once data has been\n      collected and monitored, all records tying the random Study ID number to a specific patient\n      at the sites will be destroyed, rendering all information de-identified."
