  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-patients with coronary heart disease will fill out a depression screening questionnaire
      while waiting in a cardiac clinic. Using a randomised-controlled study design half of the
      patients will receive a patient-targeted written screening feedback. This feedback contains
      information about depression in general, depression-severity adapted treatment guidelines
      and contact-information for treatment. Patients in the control group receive no direct
      screening-feedback but their cardiologist will be informed about the screening result. All
      patients with a positive screening-result will be contacted after one month and six months
      and asked for symptoms of depression, and their use of health care. The aim of this study is
      to evaluate the efficiency of this minimal intervention on the course of depressive symptom
      in patients with known coronary heart disease.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a minimal intervention on the course
      of depressive symptoms in patients with known coronary heart disease (CHD). By means of a
      depression screening and individual patient-targeted feedback the level of depression should
      decrease, the percentage of treated depressed patients should increase and health economic
      costs should be lowered. The main hypothesis is that screening plus targeted feedback
      results in a greater reduction of depression than screening only.
