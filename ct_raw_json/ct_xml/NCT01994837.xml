      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Histological or cytological confirmation of relapsed or refractory AML (by World
             Health Organization (WHO) classification) or untreated AML in patients who are unfit
             for intensive therapy.

          2. Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance score of 0 to 2.

          3. Subject must have adequate renal function as demonstrated by a calculated creatinine
             clearance â‰¥ 50 mL/min; determined via urine collection for 24-hour creatinine
             clearance or by the Cockcroft Gault formula using ideal body mass (IBM) instead of
             mass.

          4. Subject must have adequate liver function.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has received acute anti-cancer therapy including chemotherapy, immunotherapy,
             radiotherapy, hormonal or any investigational therapy within 14 days or 5 half-lives
             (whichever is shorter) prior to first dose of ABT-199.

          2. Subject has received a monoclonal antibody for anti-neoplastic intent within 8 weeks
             prior to the first dose of study drug.

          3. Subject has received Potent CYP3A inducers (such as rifampin, carbamazepine,
             phenytoin and St. John's wort and Warfarin or requires the use of warfarin (due to
             potential drug-drug interactions that may potentially increase the exposure of
             warfarin and complications of this effect) within 7 days prior to the first dose of
             study drug.

          4. Subject has received CYP3A inhibitors (such as fluconazole, ketoconazole, and
             clarithromycin) within 5 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

          5. Subject has a white blood cell count &gt; 25 x 10^9/L.

          6. Subject has acute promyelocytic leukemia (French-American-British Class M3 AML).

          7. Subjects with known active CNS disease.
