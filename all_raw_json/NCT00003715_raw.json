Compare the relapse-free and overall survival rates in patients with stage\n      III melanoma treated with autologous tumor vaccine versus interferon alfa-2b as postsurgical\n      adjuvant therapy. II. Compare the safety and tolerability of these regimens in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, open-label, multicenter study. Patients are stratified\n      according to number of metastatic lymph node sites (1 vs more than 1), number of positive\n      lymph nodes in a single site (none vs 1 or more), presence of intransit metastases (yes vs\n      no), and evidence of extranodal extension (yes vs no). Patients are randomized to one of two\n      treatment arms. Arm I: Patients receive autologous tumor cell vaccine intradermally once a\n      week for 7 weeks followed by a booster injection at 6 months. BCG is given concurrently with\n      vaccine as an immune-stimulator for doses 2-8. Patients also receive cyclophosphamide 6 days\n      after the first vaccine injection. Arm II: Patients receive interferon alfa-2b IV for 5\n      consecutive days a week for 4 weeks followed by maintenance doses given subcutaneously 3\n      times a week for 48 weeks. Patients are followed monthly for 1 year, every 2 months for 1\n      year, every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 386-425 patients will be accrued for this study."
