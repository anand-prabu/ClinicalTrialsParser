Two doses of HP\u03b2CD-diclofenac are tested and include moxifloxicin as a positive\n      control and normal saline as the placebo arm. On four separate occasions separated by at\n      least 72 hours, subjects are given single IV or oral (moxifloxicin) treatments. ECGs are\n      acquired from a continuous Holter monitor and selected timepoints will be evaluated. These\n      ECGs will be 15 seconds in duration and extracted in triplicate. Monitoring will continue\n      for 24 hours with each treatment. The primary ECG endpoint is the baseline-adjusted QTc\n      using the Fridericia correction (QTcF). Secondary endpoints include the baseline-adjusted\n      QTc using the Bazett correction formula (QTcB). In addition, a population-specific\n      regression model will be constructed with QT plotted against RR (the time elapsed between\n      two consecutive R-waves). Finally, QT parameters are explored graphically in relation to PK\n      variables Cmax, Tmax and AUC."
