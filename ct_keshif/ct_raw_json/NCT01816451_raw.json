The test began with three minutes of progressive warm-up. During the first minute, the subject maintains a light level; during the second and third minutes of the warm-up, the intensity was moderate. Starting from the fourth minute, the subject should be able to maintain a velocity for the next seven to ten minutes. This load can be adjusted as required, through verbal communication between the subject and the evaluator. The test finishes at the end of 10 minutes.The test velocity should be clearly constant at the end of the test. Heart rate were monitored and recorded at the end of each minute, e.g. 10 seconds before ending each measured minute, and the last measurement were at the end of the 10 minutes. The objective of this procedure was to identify the HR values for training intensities.",

This load can be adjusted as required, through verbal communication between the subject and the evaluator. The test finishes at the end of 10 minutes.

The test began with three minutes of progressive warm-up. During the first minute, the subject maintains a light level; during the second and third minutes of the warm-up, the intensity was moderate. Starting from the fourth minute, the subject should be able to maintain a velocity for the next seven to ten minutes. This load can be adjusted as required, through verbal communication between the subject and the evaluator. The test finishes at the end of 10 minutes. The test velocity should be clearly constant at the end of the test. Values of velocity were monitored and recorded at the end of each minute, e.g. 10 seconds before ending each measured minute, and the last measurement were at the end of the 10 minutes. The objective of this procedure was to identify the value of that speed has stabilized.",
