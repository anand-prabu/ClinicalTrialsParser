It has been known to occur in as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid\n      arthritis (RA).  The cause of the pulmonary fibrosis in patients with RA is unknown.\n\n      Researchers hope to improve their understanding of the disease process involved in PF and RA\n      by analyzing specimens collected by bronchoscopy, lung biopsy, lung transplantation, or\n      autopsy from patients with these conditions.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to collect specimens from rheumatoid arthritis patients with\n      and without pulmonary fibrosis as well as patients with pulmonary fibrosis without\n      associated diseases or cause (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis)."
