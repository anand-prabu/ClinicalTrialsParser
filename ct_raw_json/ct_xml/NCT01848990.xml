  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to compare the difference in A1C from baseline to
      month 4 using Hylenex recombinant preadministration in CSII versus standard CSII and to
      evaluate the safety of Hylenex recombinant preadministration, including local tolerability,
      immunogenicity, adverse events and hypo- and hyperglycemia rates.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      When a healthy individual begins a meal, there is a rapid insulin response.  Currently
      available subcutaneously injected or infused human insulin products (both recombinant human
      insulin and rapid acting insulin analogs) do not replicate the natural insulin response to a
      meal challenge.  Instead, subcutaneously injected or infused insulins enter the bloodstream
      relatively slowly, and, likewise, they tend to have a duration of action that is too long to
      optimally mimic normal physiology.  As a consequence, patients with diabetes have inadequate
      levels of insulin present at the initiation of a meal and very often have too much systemic
      insulin between meals.  This may lead to hyperglycemia in the early post-meal time period,
      followed by risk of hypoglycemia between meals.

      Building on Halozyme's experience with rHuPH20 (active component of Hylenex recombinant)
      co-injected with insulin products studied in both the clinical setting and in the take-home
      setting along with experience using rHuPH20 with CSII, this Phase 4 study is designed to
      demonstrate non-inferiority of pretreatment with Hylenex recombinant in the CSII setting to
      rapid acting analog insulin alone with respect to glycemic control as assessed by changes in
      A1C in patients with Type 1 diabetes mellitus

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Male or female of age 18 or older with a history of T1DM for at least 12 months.

          2. A1C 6.5 - 9.5% (inclusive) based on central laboratory results.

          3. Fasting C-peptide &lt; 0.6 ng/mL

          4. Current use of an insulin pump compatible with available tubing for Hylenex
             recombinant infusion and use of an infusion set compatible with the tubing available
             or willingness to switch to an infusion set compatible with tubing available for
             infusion of Hylenex recombinant.

          5. Current treatment at the time of screening with insulin &lt;300 U/day.

          6. Subjects who routinely use CGM (defined as average CGM use 5 or more days per week
             over the preceding 3 months) and those who do not routinely use CGM are both eligible
             for inclusion in the study.  Intermittent use of CGM is also acceptable but will not
             be a criterion use for stratified randomization.

          7. Subjects should be in good general health based on medical history and physical
             examination, without medical conditions that might prevent the completion of study
             drug infusions and assessments required in this protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Type 2 diabetes

          2. Known or suspected allergy to any component of any of the study drugs in this study.

          3. Severe proliferative retinopathy or maculopathy, and/or gastroparesis, and/or severe
             neuropathy, in particular autonomic neuropathy, of such severity as to impede the
             subject's ability to comply with protocol procedures, as judged by the Investigator.

          4. History of transmural myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure and
             uncontrolled hypertension (diastolic BP consistently &gt;100 mm Hg) are exclusionary

          5. As judged by the Investigator, clinically significant active disease of the
             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular (including history of stroke, a history of
             arrhythmia or conduction delays on ECG), hepatic, neurological, renal, genitourinary,
             pulmonary, or hematological systems of such severity as to impede the subject's
             ability to comply with protocol procedures.

          6. History of any illness or disease that in the opinion of the Investigator might
             confound the results of the study or pose additional risk in administering the study
             drugs to the subject.

          7. As judged by the Investigator, clinically significant findings in routine laboratory
             data at screening.

          8. Use of drugs that may interfere with the interpretation of study results or are known
             to cause clinically relevant interference with hyaluronidase action (see Section
             8.3), insulin action, glucose utilization, or recovery from hypoglycemia (including
             systemic pharmacologic corticosteroid).  Use of pramlintide or a GLP1 receptor
             agonist is NOT exclusionary but subjects using these agents will be subjected to
             stratified randomization.  Use of aspirin (ASA) up to 325 mg/day is NOT exclusionary
             but should be noted for analysis.

          9. Hypoglycemic unawareness of such severity as to impede the subject's ability to
             comply with protocol procedures, as judged by the Investigator.

         10. Current addiction to alcohol or substance abuse as determined by the Investigator.

         11. Pregnancy, breast-feeding, the intention of becoming pregnant, or not using adequate
             contraceptive measures (adequate contraceptive measures consist of sterilization,
             intra-uterine device [IUD], oral or injectable contraceptives, and/or barrier
             methods).  Abstinence alone is not considered an adequate contraceptive measure for
             the purposes of this study.

         12. Mental incapacity, unwillingness, or language barriers precluding adequate
             understanding or cooperation in this study.
