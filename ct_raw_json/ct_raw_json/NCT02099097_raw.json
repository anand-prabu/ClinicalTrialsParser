Cessation counseling will be provided by trained oncology nurses certified as tobacco treatment specialists (TTS) who follow evidence based behavioral and pharmacological best practices in treating tobacco dependence.5 After patients consent to the study, the initial counseling session focuses on motivation-building, choosing a quit date, if applicable, reviewing the self-help guide, and education about cessation pharmacotherapies. The second counseling session will focus on coping with smoking urges and preventing smoking relapse. Delivered within one month following hospitalization, the third and fourth counseling sessions focus on relapse prevention or recycling to a repeat quit attempt for those who have resumed smoking."
