    <textblock>
      Of cancer related deaths in American men, prostate cancer continues to be the second most
      common cause. The limitations of prostate imaging technology affect its contribution to
      clinical assessment and treatment management of prostate cancer. The high tumor cell
      proliferation rate and cellular density of prostate cancer leads to overall elevated mobile
      protein and peptide levels. The protein levels in the prostate can be non-invasively
      detected by a new molecular imaging technique called amide-proton-transfer magnetic
      resonance imaging (APT-MRI). APT-MRI will provide efficient measurement for improving our
      ability to better regionally localize prostate cancer and predict tumor stages. The overall
      goal of this trial is to evaluate the capability of the APT imaging technique for detection
      and characterization of prostate cancer. APT-MRI could be an important quantitative marker
      to better delineate and detect malignant regions of the prostate in the management of
      prostate cancer patients.

      The goal of this trial is to evaluate the capability of the amide-proton-transfer magnetic
      resonance imaging (APT-MRI) technique for detection and characterization of prostate cancer.
      Prostate cancer typically shows a high tumor cell proliferation rate and cellular density
      that leads to overall elevated mobile protein and peptide levels. An imaging method that can
      non-invasively measure these mobile protein levels may considerably improve our ability to
      better regionally localize prostate cancer and predict the degree of malignancies. APT-MRI
      has recently emerged as a new molecular MRI technique to measure endogenous cellular mobile
      protein and peptide levels non-invasively, which cannot otherwise be provided by current
      prostate imaging techniques [Zhou J, Tryggestad E, Wen Z, et al. Differentiation between
      glioma and radiation necrosis using molecular magnetic resonance imaging of endogenous
      proteins and peptides. Nat Med 2011; 17:130-134]. The preliminary data from 12 prostate
      cancer patients reveals that the increased APT-MRI signal of mobile proteins and peptides in
      cancerous regions of the prostate and in higher stage tumors [Jia G, Abaza R, Williams JD,
      et al. Amide proton transfer MR imaging of prostate cancer: a preliminary study. J Magn
      Reson Imaging 2011; 33:647-654], indicates that the APT-MRI signal is sensitive to the
      elevated mobile protein and peptide levels in such malignant regions. These initial
      observations are the basis for a rigorous validation trial.

      The trial is be implemented within a well-established ongoing collaboration at the James
      Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute (NCI-designated CCC) at the Ohio State
      University Medical Center. Patients with biopsy-proven prostate cancer will be referred and
      enrolled by urologists performing robotic prostatectomy. A comprehensive imaging scan
      including APT-MRI will be implemented by radiologists, MR physicists and technologists with
      a phased array surface coil in order to image the prostate in its natural shape. Our
      protocol will include micro-MRI of the prostate specimen prior to pathologic evaluation
      using an ultra-high-field MRI scanner. The prostate specimen will subsequently be cut in a
      way that allows direct correlation of the specimen to micro-MRI. A dedicated pathology team
      will delineate the extent of malignant infiltration in the prostate on pathologic slides,
      which will be co-registered with the clinical and APT-MRI images to allow a targeted
      assessment with a radiologic-pathologic correlation. The data analysis will be done by the
      study team and the statistics evaluated by an experienced biostatistician in the subject
      matter at hand.
