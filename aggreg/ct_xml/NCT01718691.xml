    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of SyB L-0501 (two-day
      consecutive 90 mg/m2/day IV drip infusions) in combination with rituximab (375 mg/m2 IV drip
      infusion) on untreated, low-grade B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma
      where hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is not indicated.

    <description>A dose of 375 mg/m2 of rituximab is administered on Day 1 (Day 0 in Cycle 1 only) as an IV drip infusion, followed by 26-day observation. This is 1 cycle (28 days), which will be repeated for a maximum of 6 times. From Cycle 2, rituximab will be coadministered with SyB L-0501 on Day 1. However, if the investigator or sub-investigator judges that the coadministration is difficult, rituximab may be administered on Day 0.</description>
