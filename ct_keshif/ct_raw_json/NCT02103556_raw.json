Each symptom is scored as: 0=never or rarely, 1=sometimes, 2=often, 3=most of the time and 4=always. In the present study, the frequency of the symptoms was considered as a continuous variable and, a final score ranging from 0 to 24 was calculated. Lowest scores were indicative of fewer symptoms of constipation.",
