Given resource constraints (routine medication reconciliation did not include corroborating medication histories with outpatient pharmacies, routine use of pill cards or pill boxes, or review of Medicaid formularies) Uninsured patients were financially responsible for most medications at discharge. 3) Discharge patient education was performed by inpatient nurses and treating physicians at the time of discharge. 4) Patients without a usual source of primary care were often given a list of the fourteen area safety-net clinics, which have limited capacity for uncompensated care."

The evaluation includes a baseline in-person survey and a 30 day post-discharge\n      phone follow-up survey. Prior to C-TraIn, the local healthcare delivery model lacked an\n      effective way to assure timely, safe, and effective follow-up care for uninsured and\n      underinsured hospitalized patients. Most uninsured patients have no source for primary care,\n      and many have limited social support, complex medical problems, and are prescribed many\n      medications. Patients are frequently discharged without any coordinated plan for follow up.\n      Based on a needs assessment performed in 2009 (OHSU eIRB 5514) investigators developed a\n      quality improvement program that will include three major components: 1) a care transitions\n      RN advocate who will see patients in the hospital and after discharge, 2) a pharmacy\n      consultation and 30 days of medications post-discharge, 3) linkages with primary care\n      medical homes, including payment for primary care for uninsured patients who lack a usual\n      source of care, and 4) monthly meetings that serve as a platform for continuous quality\n      improvement.  In order to measure the success of our program, investigators will track\n      patient utilization, sociodemographic factors, and patient factors including satisfaction,\n      activation, and self-reported health status.   To be included patients must be uninsured,\n      have Oregon Medicaid, or be low income (200% or less of federal poverty level) Medicare\n      recipients, and live within Multnomah, Washington and Clackamas Counties in Oregon."
