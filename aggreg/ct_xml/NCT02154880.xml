      Hypothesis;Aging modifies the risk of pulmonary dysfunction in HIV+ individuals.

      The study is a multicenter, prospective observational study of aging and pulmonary function
      in HIV.  We will determine the prevalence and risk factors for lung dysfunction as
      quantified by pulmonary function testing in both younger (&lt;50 years) and older (≥50 years)
      HIV+ and HIV-uninfected controls.  We will build on existing cohorts and enrich enrollment
      for individuals over the age of 50 while adjusting for important co-variates such as ART,
      smoking history, co-infections, and illicit drug use. Evaluations will be scheduled at
      baseline, 18 months, and 36 months.  Study visits will consist of blood draw,
      questionnaires, and pulmonary function testing.

    <description>We will attempt to proved the hypothesis that immune cell and lung cellular aging are increased in HIV COPD.We will examine telomere length and senescence markers in peripheral immune cells, lung immune cells and in lung epithelial cells and will test the hypothesis that HIV+ individuals with worse lung function and faster pulmonary decline manifest a greater degree of immune activation and cellular senescence.</description>

    <description>We will use this cohort to evaluate biomarkers of inflammation such as IL-6, IL-8, TNF-alpha, and hsCRP to determine if we can identify specific HIV COPD phenotypes using novel decision tree analyses.  We will examine relationship of the inflammatory signature associated with COPD to aging markers in Aim 2, as well as ART effects, co-infections, degree of immunosuppression, and other co-variates.</description>

    <description>we will test the hypothesis that HIV+ individuals with worse lung function and faster decline manifest a greater degree of pulmonary immune cell senescence and higher levels of senescence-associated cytokines.We will recruit a subset of 30 individuals and perform bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL).  We will examine telomere length in alveolar macrophages (the primary cell obtained at BAL) and perform flow cytometry for markers of immune activation and senescence as in Aim 2a.  We will also measure selected BAL cytokines (Table 2).  Bronchoscopies will be performed only at the University of Pittsburgh site due to the need for immediate analyses and cell cultures.</description>

    <measure>The number of lung epithelial cell senescence in HIV+ individuals.</measure>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Bronchial epithelial cells are the most easily accessible lung cells, and these cells are likely to be important in the development of HIV COPD.  The bronchial epithelium is an active part of the immune response and secretes chemoattractants and pro-inflammatory cytokines as well as matrix metalloproteases that could further perpetuate lung damage.  The inflammation, injury, and repair cycle may lead to repeated cell turnover resulting in cellular senescence, apoptosis, and COPD.  Lung epithelial cells in HIV- COPD patients display increased senescent markers including decreased telomere length18,19,26-28, but similar changes have not been investigated in HIV COPD.  As part of bronchoscopy, we will collect human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cells from endobronchial brushings.  Telomere length will be measured in HBE cells.  These cells will also be cultured in air-liquid interface (ALI) and we will examine population doubling times, SA-ß-gal, and supernatant cytokines.</description>
