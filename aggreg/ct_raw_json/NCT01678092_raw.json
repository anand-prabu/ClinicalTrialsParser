            "textblock": "A Phase I randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled study of Omalizumab in subjects\n      with severe atopic dermatitis and food allergy.  Subjects were to participate for 2 years.\n      The treatment period was a 24 week period during which subjects received Omalizumab either\n      every 2 or 4 weeks subcutaneously (as per product insert guidelines). Subjects randomized to\n      the placebo group received sterile water every 2 or 4 weeks subcutaneously. Previous\n      medications were standardized at equivalent doses one month prior to the first dose. The\n      monthly laboratory assessment for each subject included a complete blood count (CBC), serum\n      chemistries (Chem7/AST/ALT), and IgE levels.\n\n      Safety:  Adverse events and clinical status were actively monitored during study visits at\n      weeks 4, 8, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32,  and 36 (up to 3 months after last study dose) the  as well\n      as reviewed in daily diaries per NIH assessment guidelines. Assessments of platelet count\n      (CBC), liver function (LFTs), serum chemistry panel, and serum IgE were made on a monthly\n      basis during the treatment period (24 weeks). Serum pregnancy testing was performed at\n      screening only as part of the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n      Efficacy: Efficacy parameters included a standardized SCORAD classification system,\n      Physician's Global Assessment (PGA) score and subject/care giver global assessment for\n      subjects at 24 weeks compared to baseline.  An assessment for food allergy was made by skin\n      prick testing and RAST performed at baseline and during or after the last dose. Diaries were\n      also taken to assess use of concomitant medications and food allergy symptoms.  In addition,\n      one of the secondary endpoints was to assess the durability of effect of Xolair once the\n      treatment was discontinued. This was achieved through follow-up visits 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and\n      24 months after the last treatment dose. The investigators also assessed use of concomitant\n      medications and food allergies via daily diaries for each of these assessments.\n\n      Number of subjects planned: 20 (Omalizumab 10 and Placebo 10). Number of subjects analysed:\n      (Omalizumab 4 and Placebo 4).\n\n      Male or female aged 4-25 years. Diagnosis of severe atopic dermatitis (meeting SCORAD\n      criteria) with at least 6 months of documented symptoms. Also with concomitant food allergy\n      as determined by a positive skin prick testing.\n\n      Omalizumab was supplied as a sterile, white, preservative-free, lyophilized powder contained\n      in a single-use vial that is reconstituted with Sterile Water for Injection (SWFI), USP, and\n      administered as a subcutaneous (SC) injection. A Xolair vial contains 202.5 mg of\n      Omalizumab, 145.5 mg sucrose, 2.8 mg L-histidine hydrochloride mono hydrate, 1.8 mg\n      L-histidine and 0.5 mg polysorbate 20 and is designed to deliver 150 mg of Omalizumab, in\n      1.2 mL after reconstitution with 1.4 mL SWFI, USP. Treatment dose was determined as outlined\n      in the product insert.\n\n      2 year study duration (24 Weeks treatment). The reference was placebo (sterile water) given\n      subcutaneously.\n\n      The primary efficacy variables were improvement of SCORAD, Physician's Global Assessment,\n      and Subject/Caregiver Global Assessment scores for subjects at 24 weeks compared to\n      baseline."
