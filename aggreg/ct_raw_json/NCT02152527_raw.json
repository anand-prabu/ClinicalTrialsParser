Although it clinical benefits are clear,\n      mechanism by which this occurs is as yet undefined. In few animal studies authors try to\n      define what effects trimetazidine  has on both fatty acid and glucose metabolism in  heart.\n      Data collected from human cardiomyocytes are rare. Available data suggest that trimetazidine\n      may act  as a potent inhibitor of beta oxidation, with  no significant effect on glucose\n      oxidation.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      Primary objective: collection of mitochondrial respiration data using human heart\n      ventricular samples. Secondary objective: define possible differences in mitochondrial\n      respiration depending on preoperative trimetazidine usage.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Regularly scheduled patients for coronary artery bypass grafting surgery who accept to\n      participate in study will be enrolled in further protocol. Patients with inclusion criteria\n      and without exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. At the end of operation,\n      surgeon will take biopsy sample of left ventricle for mitochondrial function and metabolic\n      activity analysis."
