Two doses of Sr-hGH were administered, which are 0.5 and 0.7mg/kg/week. And the\n      other arm received daily hGH at 0.37 mg/kg/week.\n\n      Patients in Sr-hGH groups injected on a specific day of the every week for 26 weeks. And\n      patients randomized to daily hGH group injected for 6 days a week.\n\n      Patients visited study centers five times, firstly at screening (Visit 1), at randomization\n      (Visit 2), after 13th dosing (Visit 3), after 26th dosing (Visit 4), and finally for\n      follow-up (Visit5)."
