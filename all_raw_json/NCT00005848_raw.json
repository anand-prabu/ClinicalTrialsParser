Determine the safety and\n      pharmacokinetics of this regimen in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral R115777 every 12 hours on days 1-21. Courses repeat every 4\n      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are followed\n      every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-30 patients will be accrued for this study within 10-16\n      months."
