  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A treat and extend protocol starts with monthly injections until signs of activity have
      resolved with clinical and OCT confirmation. The interval between visits is then  lengthened
      by 1 to 2 weeks as long as there are no signs of recurrent activity. Treatment is done at
      every visit but the time between visits is individualized based on a patient's response to
      treatment. When recurrent disease is detected, the treatment interval is reduced. The goal
      is to maintain an exudation-free macula with the fewest number of office visits, tests and
      injections.
