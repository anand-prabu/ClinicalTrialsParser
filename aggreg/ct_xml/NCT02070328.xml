  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Proton therapy is a limited medical resource that is more expensive than conventional x-ray
      therapy.  To correctly measure the success of proton therapy in treating different
      conditions, it is important to check a patient's health status after their treatment is
      finished. Checking on the progress of patients over many years (called long-term follow-up)
      is needed because the long-term effects of proton therapy are not well known.

      The objective of this research protocol is the development of a national Proton Therapy
      Center Registry for the purpose of:

        1. Performing retrospective research studies on diseases treated with proton therapy
           throughout the United States.

        2. Maintaining regular, lifetime contact with subjects in order to obtain current
           identification , contact information, and self/parent-reported health status in order
           to obtain a better understanding of overall treatment strategies and patient benefits
           of treatment.

        3. Permitting review of medical record information contained within the Registry to
           identify subjects who may be eligible for participation in future research studies
           conducted at the Proton Therapy Institution where the participant was treated.
           Obtaining the permission of Research Registry participants to be contacted to ascertain
           their interest in participating in future research studies being conducted  at their
           participating Proton  Therapy Institution for which it appears (i.e., based on medical
           information contained within the Research Registry) they may be eligible.
