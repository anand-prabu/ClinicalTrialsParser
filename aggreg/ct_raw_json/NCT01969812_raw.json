Evie slow-release insemination device is a device that is FDA approved. This device has been used in Europe, it has not yet been used at Carolinas Medical Center, by the Women's Institute. The technique for using this device involves loading a pump syringe with the prepared sperm, placing a balloon-secured catheter and syringe in the patient's sounded uterus, and connecting the insemination syringe to the catheter. The slow-release insemination occurs for 4 hours after the insertion of the catheter. The removal procedure, which can be performed by the patient if desired, involves deflating the catheter balloon and removing the catheter."
