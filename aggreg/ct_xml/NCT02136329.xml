      The objectives of the study are the following:

        -  To evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile of Sildenafil in cardiac surgery patients at
           risk of acute kidney injury

        -  To determine the safety and tolerability of Sildenafil in cardiac surgery patients at
           risk of acute kidney injury

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult cardiac surgery patients (&gt;18 years) undergoing cardiac surgery with moderately
             hypothermic CPB (32-34°C) and blood cardioplegia

          2. Identified as representing a high risk group for acute kidney injury using a modified
             risk score based on the variables of Age, Sex, BMI, Smoking Status, NHYA class,
             Previous Operations, Peripheral Vascular Disease, Diabetes, Hypertension,
             Pre-operative Haemoglobin level, Pre-operative eGFR, Operative Priority, Operation
             Type, Ejection Fraction and Presence of Pre-Operative Critical Events.

          3. Female subjects of childbearing potential are not to be pregnant (to be confirmed by
             urine human chorionic gonadotropin pregnancy test prior to dosing). Women are
             considered not to be of childbearing potential if they have been surgically
             sterilised (eg, tubal ligation, oophorectomy or hysterectomy) or are postmenopausal
             (defined as serum follicle-stimulating hormone level of ≥30 IU/mL) in the absence of
             hormone replacement therapy and complete absence of menses for at least 24
             consecutive months.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Emergency or salvage procedure

          2. Ejection fraction &lt;30%

          3. CKD Stage 5, defined as eGFR&lt;15ml/min or renal replacement therapy.

          4. Administration of potent CYP 3A4 inhibitors within 1 month prior to study
             participation (e.g. HIV protease inhibitors, imidazole antifungals and erythromycin,
             please see Appendix 1 for a full list of prohibited medications).

          5. Administration of nitrate medicines (e.g. glyceryl trinitrate within 24 hours of
             surgery.

          6. Any ongoing malignancy, or prior malignancy that currently requires treatment.

          7. Patients allergic to any other PDE-5 Inhibitor

          8. Patients who are participating in another interventional clinical study
