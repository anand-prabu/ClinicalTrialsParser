Participation in this study consists of an initial, in-person\n      screening appointment, 4 brief daily appointments at the research office, an alcohol\n      drinking session at a local bar and a follow-up appointment 1-3 days after the alcohol\n      drinking session.\n\n      Participants who are found to be eligible in the screening phase will then complete a daily\n      appointment for 4 days out of a 5-day period (i.e., there will be 1 day out of the 5 on\n      which they will not attend an appointment). Each appointment will last 20 minutes, on\n      average and consist of a questionnaire and computer-based cognitive task. On the day of the\n      fourth appointment, participants will complete an alcohol drinking session. The alcohol\n      drinking session begins at 4pm and lasts until at least midnight.\n\n      Participants in this study will be young adults between the ages of 21-25, who regularly\n      drink alcohol and are not currently seeking treatment for alcohol use. Seventy-two\n      participants will complete this study."
