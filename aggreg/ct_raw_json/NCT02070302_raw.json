Measurements: Transverse images of the CT will measure the median nerve\n             cross sectional area (CSA) at the level of the pisiform bone. CSA measurements\n             greater than 11 mm2 (5, 27) are indicative of CTS. Borderline CSA measurements would\n             require wrist forearm ratio (WFR) measurements to be a WFR > 1.5 (5, 36). Patients\n             will need to have a CSA >11mm2, (or WFR >1.5) and show median nerve compression\n             during DST of at least 30% to be included.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Patients with prior carpal tunnel surgery, prior history of BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxin\n             A) injection\n\n          -  Steroid injection two months prior or three months after BOTOX\u00ae (onabotulinumtoxin A)\n             CTS injection, median nerve denervation on needle EMG\n\n          -  Major limb trauma or surgery, dysphagia\n\n          -  Neuromuscular junction disorder (ie: Myasthenia gravis or Lambert-Eaton syndrome)\n\n          -  Currently pregnant or breast feeding\n\n          -  Patients with severe CTS identified by Levine scale >4, electrodiagnostics, and/or\n             unable to meet the inclusion criteria as identified above would be excluded as\n             participants in this study."
