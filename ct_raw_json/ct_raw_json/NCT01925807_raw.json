The\n      goal of the present investigation is to test the efficacy of a brief group intervention for\n      adolescents with passive suicidal ideation and their caregivers that will focus on coping,\n      familial support, and emotional regulation. The investigators hypothesize that a brief group\n      intervention, delivered in the weeks following presentation at the emergency department,\n      will reduce suicidal ideation and improve coping and familial support more than treatment as\n      usual."
