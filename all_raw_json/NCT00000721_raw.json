Recombinant soluble CD4 protein\n      (rCD4) is a drug that has been produced by genetic engineering techniques. In laboratory\n      studies, rCD4 binds to HIV and reduces its ability to enter the cell, thus inhibiting its\n      reproduction.

In order to distinguish between these two products, a change in nomenclature has\n      been made. In this protocol, whenever the original sequence CD4 molecule is referred to, it\n      is called recombinant soluble T4 (rsT4).

Dose escalation is by\n      semilogarithmic steps. A shift from IM injection to continuous subcutaneous infusion (CSCI)\n      is necessitated by the volume of drug which is administered as part of the escalation dose.\n      Three groups of eight patients each are treated as follows. The first group of 8 patients\n      receives BG8962 daily and consists of two cohorts of four patients each. One cohort receives\n      BG8962 as an IM injection. The second cohort receives BG8962 as a continuous 24 hour\n      infusion. All patients in this group are treated for 12 weeks. The second dosing group of 8\n      patients receive daily BG8962 by CSCI for 12 weeks. The third group of 8 patients receive\n      BG8962 by CSCI for 6 weeks. Every two weeks during the study the following tests and\n      evaluations are done: Blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis with microscopic exam, and\n      T-cells and T-cell subsets."
