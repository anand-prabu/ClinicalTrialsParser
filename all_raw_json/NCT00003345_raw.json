Evaluate the antitumor effect of weekly cisplatin and irinotecan in patients\n      with suboptimally debulked ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer and persistently\n      elevated serum values of CA125 after 3 courses of standard therapy with paclitaxel and\n      either carboplatin or cisplatin. II. Evaluate the toxicity, both qualitative and\n      quantitative, of this regimen in this patient population. III. Evaluate the quality of life\n      of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive cisplatin IV over 30 minutes followed by irinotecan IV over 90\n      minutes. Treatment is administered weekly for 4 weeks (days 1, 8, 15, and 22) followed by 2\n      weeks of rest. Patients receive at least 3 courses (18 weeks) of therapy in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. If patients demonstrate complete response to\n      treatment, they are encouraged to undergo second-look laparoscopy or laparotomy. Quality of\n      life is assessed before treatment, after the first course, and then after every 2 courses of\n      therapy. Patients are followed 30 days after the last treatment and then for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 12-35 patients accrued into this study over 18-24 months."
