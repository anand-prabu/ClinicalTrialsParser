Drugs\n      used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel albumin-stabilized nanoparticle formulation, work\n      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing. Giving romidepsin and paclitaxel albumin-stabilized\n      nanoparticle formulation may be an effective treatment for inflammatory breast cancer."
