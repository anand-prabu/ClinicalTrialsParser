    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies the impact of radiation therapy on the immunogenicity of
      Sipuleucel-T. Patients with castration recurrent prostate cancer who are eligible for
      treatment with Sipuleucel-T and who have bone metastases are eligible.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess whether radiation therapy (RT) increases the immunogenic potential or
      sipuleucel-T in patients with castration recurrent prostate cancer.

      II. To assess systemic changes to the immune system and genetic changes to immune cells in
      patients treated by the combination of RT and sipuleucel-T.

      III. To assess the induction of antigen-specific immune responses to prostatic acid
      phosphatase (PAP), cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) and antigens that have proven to be
      released by radiation (such as, heat shock protein 90 [HSP-90], calreticulin, etc.).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess adverse event rates in patients receiving the high-dose radiation and
      sipuleucel-T therapy.

      II. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes will be assessed. III. Overall and cancer
      specific survival will be assessed.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo single-fraction radiation therapy to at least 1 bone lesion 2 days after
      the first sipuleucel-T dose.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months.
