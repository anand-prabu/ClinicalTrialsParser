    <textblock>
      The object of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic interactions, short term safety
      and efficacy of standard dose lopinavir/ritonavir 200mg/50 (two tablets twice daily) given
      with ritonavir 100 mg three tablets twice daily given in combination with rifampin in
      HIV-infected persons with tuberculosis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label non-randomized pharmacokinetic study of 10-12 HIV-infected
      patients co-infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis.

      Enrollment: Potential subjects with active tuberculosis  who have tolerated a rifampin
      containing regimen for at least 2 weeks. Potential subjects will be referred from the
      surrounding communities to Laboratorio de Pesquisa Clinica em Micobacterioses(LAPCLINTB)

      Visit 1: After enrollment the subject will have a baseline rifampin PK will be done. They
      will then be started on lopinavir/ritonavir containing HAART regimen with standard twice
      daily dosing. Ritonavir 100 mg capsules will be added to the regimen and  the dose escalated
      until the patient is taking 3 capsules twice daily. The time between enrollment and visit 1
      will be determined by the treating physician

      Visit 2: They will return about 1 week after dose escalation has been completed to sample
      lopinavir concentrations.

      Visit 3: Subject will return in 2 weeks to have repeat to review results of lopinavir
      concentrations and response to therapy. Ritonavir will be adjusted as needed.

      Visit 4: Subject will then return in 4 weeks for last visit for evaluation. Lopinavir and
      rifampin PK will be done.
