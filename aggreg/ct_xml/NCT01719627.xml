  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) is a method of preventing HIV infection through the use of
      antiretroviral (ARV) medications before exposure to HIV. This study will assess the
      potential of MVC as a &quot;on demand&quot; pre-exposure prophylaxis, within a strategy for the
      prevention of HIV infection in men who have sex with men (MSM).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several clinical trials are currently under way evaluating the safety and effectiveness of
      ARV-based PrEP for preventing HIV infection. The results of the first efficacy trials of
      ARV-based PrEP showed fewer HIV infections among study participants receiving the study
      drugs compared to those receiving placebo. Although the results are promising, concerns
      about adherence, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity still needs further exploration so new and
      more effective preventive pharmacological approaches should be evaluated. This trial will
      evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics and efficacy of ex vivo HIV infection of rectal mucosa
      by the CCR5 antagonist drug maraviroc (Selzentry) administered to healthy volunteers. This
      trial will last approximately one year. Twenty-one volunteers will receive MVC 300 mg orally
      in a single dose. Study visits will occur at enrollment and at days 0, 7, 9, 14 and 16. All
      study visits will include a physical examination, blood collection and storage and in the
      basal visit and a day 7 or 9 the participants will undergo a colonoscopy.  Ex vivo HIV
      infectivity in rectal mucosa biopsies and plasma/mucosa MVC levels will be evaluated.
