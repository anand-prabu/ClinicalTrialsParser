The study is divided into\n      three specific aims.\n\n        1. To determine the role of incretin hormones on insulin secretion in patients with\n           gastric bypass surgery using intravenous-oral hyperglycemic clamp.\n\n        2. To compare incretin effect and glucose tolerance among patient who suffer from\n           hypoglycemia after RYGB and asymptomatic surgical and non-surgical individuals.\n\n        3. To quantify the contribution of GLP-1 to incretin effect enhancement following surgery."
