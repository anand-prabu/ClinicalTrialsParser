Dose escalation in\n      phase 1 will proceed according to a standard 3 + 3 dose escalation design. There will be no\n      intracohort dose escalation. Three patients will be assigned to the starting dose level 1.\n      If no dose limiting toxicities (DLT) are observed after one cycle of treatment, and if the\n      start of cycle 2 treatment is not delayed greater than 7 days for any toxicity possibly\n      related to drug, trial accrual proceeds to the next dose level and another cohort of 3\n      patients is enrolled. If 1 patient in a cohort experiences a DLT, then the cohort is\n      expanded to 6, if 2 or more patients in this cohort experience a DLT then the dose level\n      decreases. If none of the additional patients experience a DLT (1 out of 6) then dose\n      escalation continues. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is defined as the highest dose level\n      at which <33% of the dose cohort (0 of 3 or 1 of 6) experience a DLT in the first cycle."
