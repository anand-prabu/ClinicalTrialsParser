  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a &quot;proof of concept&quot; study, to assess the feasibility of introducing a novel
      high-precision radiotherapy technique called &quot;stereotactic radiosurgery&quot; (SRS) or
      &quot;stereotactic body radiotherapy&quot; (SBRT) for the treatment of kidney cancers in Australia.
      This study aims to invite 20 patients with renal cell carcinoma and 10 patients with
      isolated adrenal metastases from non-small cell carcinoma who are either medically
      inoperable, high risk for surgery, or decline surgery to participate. In cohort of patients
      with renal cell carcinoma, both patients with primary disease only, and those patients who
      have limited metastases (≤5) will be eligible. Besides technical feasibility of delivering
      this treatment, this study will be to assess efficacy, toxicity and tumour response using a
      novel imaging biomarker called diffusion weighted-MRI.

    <description>Effective  SBRT is defined as a treatment which results in local control at 1 year after treatment. Local control is defined as lack of progression of the target lesion as measured by RECIST criteria. RECIST criteria are a CT evaluation of change in tumour size.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Age &gt; 18 years old

          -  All patients must have radiological diagnosis or biopsy confirmed diagnosis of
             either:

               1. Cohort 1: renal cell carcinoma with a single lesion within kidney, or    with
                  primary kidney tumour intact and no more than 5 documented metastases, or

               2. Cohort 2: single adrenal metastases with extra‐adrenal disease controlled

          -  ECOG performance of 0‐2 inclusive.

          -  Either medically inoperable, technically high risk for surgery or decline surgery.

          -  Informed consent.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Cytotoxic chemotherapy within 3 weeks of commencement of treatment, or concurrently
             with treatment. Delivery of targeted agents (such as sunitinib) are allowable only
             when at least 7 days separate the delivery of the proposed agent and the delivery of
             the stereotactic radiotherapy.

          -  Previous high‐dose radiotherapy to upper abdomen
