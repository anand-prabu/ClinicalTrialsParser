Specifically, to determine, in patients who have been taking\n      zidovudine (AZT) alone for a long time, whether it is beneficial to add lamivudine (3TC) to\n      AZT or to switch to d4T alone, and also to determine, in patients who have been taking\n      didanosine (ddI) alone for a long time, whether it is beneficial to add AZT or AZT/3TC to\n      ddI.\n\n      Characteristics of virus replication, pathogenicity, and resistance are thought to determine\n      the durability of virologic and clinical response to nucleoside reverse transcriptase\n      inhibitors. Previous results of ACTG 175 suggest that either a switch to ddI or addition of\n      ddI in patients receiving AZT results in better clinical, virologic, and CD4 cell response\n      compared to continuation of AZT alone."
