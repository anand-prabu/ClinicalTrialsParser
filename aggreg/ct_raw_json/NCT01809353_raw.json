The study will be conducted in 3 parts; a\n      screening phase (up to 28 days), a double-blind treatment phase (28 days), and a follow-up\n      phase (approximately 21 to 28 days). The study will be conducted in 2 groups (Group A\n      consists of 16 Japanese participants; Group B consists of 16 Caucasian participants) over 4\n      treatment periods. On Day 1 of Period 1, approximately 16 eligible Japanese participants and\n      the same number of eligible Caucasian participants will be randomly assigned to 1 of 4\n      treatment sequences and will receive the 4 intravenous treatments JNJ-54452840 20 mg,\n      JNJ-54452840 80 mg, JNJ-54452840 240 mg, and placebo across the treatment periods according\n      to the order specified by the randomization schedule.\n\n      Participants will come to the study center each time they receive study medication and will\n      be discharged from the study center 24 hours after dosing during each treatment period after\n      satisfactory review of all clinical safety measures. Blood samples will be drawn at time\n      points during the treatment and follow-up periods for participants in both Group A and Group\n      B of the study.  Participants will return to the study center for a follow-up visit within\n      approximately 7 to 10 days after the last study procedure in the last treatment period for\n      safety assessments, followed by another visit within approximately 21 to 28 days for\n      assessment of anti -beta-1-AR (adrenergic receptor) auto-antibodies in blood\n      (auto-antibodies targeting the human beta-1-AR antibody). If anti-beta-1-AR auto-antibodies\n      are detected at this second follow-up visit, additional testing will be performed every 3\n      months until autoantibody levels fall below the level of detection of the assay or for 1\n      year, whichever occurs earlier.  Participants in Group A and Group B will be involved in the\n      study for approximately 12 weeks and up to 1 year if they develop anti -beta-1-AR\n      auto-antibodies . Safety of the participants will be monitored throughout the study."
