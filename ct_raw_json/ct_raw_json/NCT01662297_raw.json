            "textblock": "This is a pilot comparative effectiveness study designed to determine whether trazodone is\n      as effective as quetiapine for treatment of insomnia in veterans with a history of addiction\n      and mental health issues. The study will have two concurrent phases (parts); first an\n      acceptability determination phase, to determine whether and why (or why not) veterans\n      already taking quetiapine are willing to try an alternative to quetiapine for sleep; and\n      second, a randomized trial phase which will test whether staying on quetiapine has any\n      advantage over switching to trazodone. The purpose of the first phase will be a) to document\n      the proportions of patients and physicians who are willing to agree to such a switch, b) to\n      characterize sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of potentially eligible subjects\n      associated with a willingness to switch from quetiapine to trazodone and c) to record the\n      reasons given why patients and their prescribers are (or are not) willing to accept a switch\n      from quetiapine to trazodone. It will also function to provide some educational background\n      to patients and a reminder to providers about the potential severe side-effects of\n      quetiapine, and will thus facilitate clinical informed consent for the clinical trial phase\n      of the study. Completion of the first part of the study will also serve as the screening\n      component for part II. Part II includes, first, obtaining written informed consent from\n      eligible subjects, and then randomly assigning them to continue quetiapine or to be switched\n      to trazodone in open-label \"real world\" fashion for the duration of 4 weeks, followed by\n      another four weeks of open, non-randomized follow- up. The purpose of the second part of the\n      study is to determine if trazodone is an adequate substitute for quetiapine, primarily in\n      terms of treating insomnia. The investigators hypothesize that trazodone will not be\n      inferior to quetiapine in maintaining good quality of sleep measured by sleep scales (i.e.,\n      scores will not significantly worsen once switched). This study is open to Veterans in the\n      VA system only. Eligible subjects must have a history of \"dual diagnosis\" (i.e., a history\n      of addiction and mental illness)."

Subjects will be\n      evaluated for symptoms of sleep quality and excessive daytime sleepiness. subjects will also\n      be assessed for changes in mood, and alcohol/drug use.
