Although\n      down-regulated in normal plasma cells, Btk is highly expressed in the malignant cells from\n      many myeloma patients and some cell lines. PCI-32765 is a potent and specific inhibitor of\n      Btk currently in Phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. The current study is designed and intended\n      to determine the safety and efficacy of PCI-32765 in combination with carfilzomib\n      (Kyprolis\u2122) with and without dexamethasone in subjects with MM."
