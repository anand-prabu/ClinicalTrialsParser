  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study will evaluate
      the safety and efficacy of vemurafenib alone and vemurafenib in combination with GDC-0973
      (cobimetinib), a MEK inhibitor, in previously untreated BRAF V600 mutation-positive patients
      with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic melanoma. Patients will be randomized to
      one of two treatment arms, Arm A: vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day (days 1-28 of each cycle)
      and placebo (days 1-21 of each cycle); Arm B: vemurafenib 960 mg twice a day (days 1-28 of
      each cycle) and GDC-0973 (cobimetinib) 60 mg once daily (days 1-21 of each cycle). Patients
      will receive treatment until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity or withdrawal of
      consent.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with histologically confirmed melanoma, either unresectable stage IIIc or
             stage IV metastatic melanoma, as defined by the American Joint Committee on Cancer
             7th edition.

          -  Unresectability of stage IIIc disease must have confirmation from a surgical
             oncologist.

          -  Patients must be naïve to treatment for locally advanced unresectable or metastatic
             disease (i.e., no prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for advanced disease; stage IIIc
             and IV). Prior adjuvant immunotherapy (including ipilimumab) is allowed.

          -  Documentation of BRAFV600 mutation-positive status in melanoma tumor tissue (archival
             or newly obtained tumor samples) using the cobas 4800 BRAF V600 mutation test.

          -  Measurable disease per RECIST v1.1.

          -  Eastern Clinical Oncology Group performance status of 0 or 1.

          -  Consent to provide archival for biomarker analyses.

          -  Consent to undergo tumor biopsies for biomarker analyses.

          -  Life expectancy &gt;/= 12 weeks.

          -  Adequate hematologic and end organ function

          -  Palliative radiotherapy within 14 days prior to the first dose of study treatment.

          -  Major surgery or traumatic injury within 14 days prior to first dose of study
             treatment.

          -  Active malignancy other than melanoma that could potentially interfere with the
             interpretation of efficacy measures. Patients with a previous malignancy within the
             past 3 years are excluded except for patients with resected basal cell carcinoma
             (BCC) or squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin, melanoma in-situ, carcinoma
             in-situ of the cervix, and carcinoma in-situ of the breast.

          -  History of or evidence of retinal pathology on ophthalmologic examination that is
             considered a risk factor for neurosensory retinal detachment, retinal vein occlusion
             (RVO), or neovascular macular degeneration.

          -  Uncontrolled glaucoma with intra-ocular pressures

          -  Serum cholesterol &gt;/= Grade 2

          -  Hypertriglyceridemia &gt;/= Grade 2

          -  Hyperglycemia (fasting) &gt;/= Grade 2

          -  History of clinically significant cardiac dysfunction

          -  Patients with active CNS lesions (including carcinomatous meningitis) are excluded.
             However, patients are eligible if:

               1. All known CNS lesions have been treated with stereotactic therapy or surgery,
                  AND

               2. There has been no evidence of clinical and radiographic disease progression in
                  the CNS for &gt;/= 3 weeks after radiotherapy or surgery

          -  Current severe, uncontrolled systemic disease.

          -  History of malabsorption or other condition that would interfere with absorption of
             study drugs.

          -  Pregnant, lactating, or breast feeding.
