  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a motor neuron disease characterized by  progressive
      degeneration of motor neurons, muscle atrophy and paralysis.  There is no reliable early
      diagnostic test for ALS, making identification of the disease difficult at its earliest
      stages.  Early detection is critical to the initiation of early neuroprotective therapy.  By
      the time a reliable diagnosis can be made, substantial damage to motor neurons and muscle
      has already occurred.  The purpose of the current project is to establish a bank of blood
      samples (serum and protein/RNA/DNA from blood cells) and CSF for use in the development of
      an early diagnostic test for ALS and for better understanding the progression of this
      disease. The main idea of the current study is to examine samples from patients that have a
      suspected diagnosis of motor neuron disease, including patients with ALS who have not
      progressed far enough to be definitively diagnosed as having ALS.  Normal and disease
      control samples will be collected for comparison.  The investigators will examine various
      biochemical and metabolic markers from these samples, in hopes of finding differences in
      their expression between control subjects and ALS patients and during disease progression.
      Ultimately, the investigators would like to have a panel of markers from the blood that
      would allow us to diagnose and follow the progression of ALS from the earliest possible
      moment.  The data collected from this project would give us a basis for a fairly
      non-invasive, quick and clinically relevant test for the early diagnosis of ALS.  This in
      turn would allow us to provide earlier intervention for these patients, possibly slowing the
      damage and improving prognosis.
