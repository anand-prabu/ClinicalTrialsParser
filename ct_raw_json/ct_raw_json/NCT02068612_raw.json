Studies have also shown that aerobic\n      exercise may protect against age-related cognitive decline in other domains. This research\n      is designed to test the hypothesis that aerobic exercise will enhance social, emotional and\n      economic functioning in older adults, and that these effects will occur via the effect of\n      exercise on neurocognitive structure and function assessed via magnetic resonance imaging\n      (MRI). Advancing our knowledge of the mechanisms that influence emotional, social and\n      economic functioning could inform the development of targeted treatments and prevention\n      programs for older adults."
