The hypothesis is that by using the intervention SGE-PsyScan the clinical\n      symptoms of patients can be assessed more uniformly and earlier as opposed to the GPs'\n      assessment in usual care. As a result, patients are supposed to start earlier with a\n      treatment that fits the type and severity of their symptoms better.\n\n      The patients will be randomly assigned to either receive the SGE-PsyScan or usual care."
