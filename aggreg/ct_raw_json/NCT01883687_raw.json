Setting: Chang Gung Craniofacial\n      Center and Department of Otolaryngology (ENT). Patients: A total of 80 Taiwanese patients\n      with unilateral cleft lip and palate and dentofacial deformity (age >16 for females, >18 for\n      males; 40 in experimental and 40 in control groups) Interventions: In the experimental\n      group, all patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy and septoplasty.  In the control group,\n      all patients will receive Le Fort I osteotomy only.\n\n      Measurements: All patients will undergo history taking, clinical examination,\n      radioallergosorbent (RAST) examination (before surgery), standard questionnaire and image\n      examination before surgery, one week, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 months after surgery.  To reduce\n      radiation exposure, cone-beam CT will only be performed before surgery and one week, 12 and\n      24 months after surgery.\n\n      Data Analysis: Independent t and chi-squared tests, correlation coefficients and repeated\n      measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will be used.  Statistical significance is assumed for\n      a p value of less than 0.05.\n\n      Key Words: cleft lip palate, nasal septum deviation, Le Fort I osteotomy, septoplasty,\n      effectiveness"
