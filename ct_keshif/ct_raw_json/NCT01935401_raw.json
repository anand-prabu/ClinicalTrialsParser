Findings from this study will potentially help to\n      elucidate the underlying neural mechanisms of bulimia nervosa, and thus inform treatment and\n      prevention efforts."

Thus far, although psychosocial and\n      behavioral risk factors and correlates of BN have been extensively researched, relatively\n      few studies have focused on brain-based determinants of BN. Identification of neural\n      mechanisms associated with self-regulatory control that may be integral in the development,\n      maintenance, and prevention of this debilitating condition would better inform treatment\n      development and eating disorder prevention efforts.\n\n      Participation in this study consists of a 3-3.5 hours study visit as well a a one year\n      follow up visit. The first portion of initial study visit is part of the screening process,\n      in which individuals will complete several questionnaires and be interviewed by the study\n      researcher in order to confirm eligibility. If a participant is eligible after the screening\n      portion, they move onto the rest of the initial visit. During the initial visit,\n      participants will complete a button pressing go/no-go task as well as a sipping go/no-go\n      task, all while wearing a functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIR) device.\n\n      At a one year follow up appointment, individuals will again complete a variety of\n      self-report questionnaires and be interviewed by the study researcher, thus completing the\n      same measures used as screening tools in the initial visit."
