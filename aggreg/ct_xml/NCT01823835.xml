      Safety and pharmacokinetics (PK) study of ARN-810 in postmenopausal women with locally
      advanced or metastatic ER+ (HER2-) breast cancer.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Open-label, dose-finding study of ARN-810 administered orally on a continuous daily dosing
      regimen with a PK lead-in period .  The incidence of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) will be
      evaluated from Day -7 through the first cycle (28 days) of treatment (35 days total).
      Depending on safety and tolerability, patients will be assigned sequentially to escalating
      doses of ARN 810 using standard 3+3 design. All patients will be treated until disease
      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or patient withdrawal of consent.
