  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Growth is poor in preterm infants, partly due to difficulty identifying when growth is slow.
      The investigators will examine the use of a computer program to try and identify periods of
      growth slowing in preterm babies, and compare those results to the usual assessments made on
      patient care rounds.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We wish to examine the use of a mathematical modeling system to see if it can detect poor
      growth better (and more quickly) than we can clinically. To do this, we need to know what
      the clinical team think about a baby's growth day-to-day. However, after rounds the fellow
      or NNP with fill in a sheet to say what the team thought about the baby's growth (was it
      okay, too slow, too fast etc.), and whether any changes were made to improve the baby's
      growth (e.g. increased feed volume, change in composition of feeds etc.). After the baby is
      discharged home, weight data from the EMR will be entered into the program to try and
      identify times where growth slowed (or where growth was faster than expected). We will
      compare the results of the computer program and the record of the clinical teams thoughts on
      the ward round, to see if the computer program identified growth slowing more quickly than
      the clinical team did.
