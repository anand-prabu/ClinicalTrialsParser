The subject is currently enrolled in an investigational drug or device trial, or has\n             received an investigational drug or been treated with an investigational device\n             within 30 days prior to entering this study.\n\n          7. The subject has used photosensitizing drugs (e.g., Declomycin, sulfa antibiotics,\n             phenothiazines, etc.) within a timeframe where photosensitization from these drugs\n             may still be present.\n\n          8. The subject has the need to be exposed to artificial tanning devices or excessive\n             sunlight during the trial.\n\n          9.
