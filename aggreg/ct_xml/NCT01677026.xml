      The primary objectives of the Registry are to:

        1. Monitor the transfer of the ATI Neurostimulation System and its safety/clinical
           performance to a larger number of centers in the post market phase and

        2. Collect additional evidence to support reimbursement and clinical acceptance and long
           term follow up (two years)

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject meets CE marked labeling for cluster headache.

          -  Subject's typical cluster headache bouts last a minimum of 16 weeks, in the opinion
             of the Investigator.

          -  Subject agrees to maintain current preventive headache medication regimens (no change
             in type, frequency or dose except to manage tolerability) from Study Enrollment
             through the completion of the Therapy Evaluation Period.

          -  Subject has the ability to read, comprehend and to reliably record information as
             required by the Protocol.

          -  Subject is able to provide written informed consent prior to participation in the
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject has had a change in type, dosage or frequency of taking preventive headache
             medications &lt; one (1) month prior to Study Enrollment.

          -  Per the CE marked labeling: In the opinion of the Investigator, subject has bony
             facial deformities, inappropriate surgical anatomy or has had facial surgery in the
             surgical area on the same side as the planned surgery that would prevent the proper
             placement of the ATI Neurostimulator.

          -  Subject has other significant pain problem that might confound the study assessments
             in the opinion of the Investigator.
