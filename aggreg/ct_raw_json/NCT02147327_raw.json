This hormone has effect on both calcium, phosphorus and bone\n      metabolism and also bone morrow, muscle, heart and immune system. For a long time, maternal\n      low vitamin D level is a well known problem for our country and the level was reported as\n      <10 ng/ml for 46-80% of mothers.The most prominent risk factor was determined as low\n      socioeconomic status. Therefore, the level of 25-hydroxy-vitamin D is supposed to be in\n      relation with several neonatal morbidities and maternal complications of pregnancy."
