The primary endpoint\n      was the frequency of acute exacerbations.\n\n      Expected results: Compared with the control group, the frequency of acute exacerbations of\n      the observer Group will decrease significantly.\n\n      Hypothesis: Long-term oral N-acetylcysteine can reduce the frequency of acute exacerbations\n      of patients with non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis and improve their quality of life."
