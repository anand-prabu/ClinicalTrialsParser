CXL is thought to augment the tectonic\n      strength of the cornea by using UVA light and the photo-mediator riboflavin. The purpose of\n      this non-randomized study is to compare the visual results of patients who are suspicious\n      for having an increased risk of ectasia with laser vision correction compared to a group of\n      patients that does not have these risk factors.  All excimer laser ophthalmic procedures\n      currently being performed to correct myopia, hyperopia or astigmatism with FDA approved\n      excimer lasers do so by removing corneal tissue and thereby potentially weakening the cornea\n      biomechanically. This can result in ectasia even in patients without pre-existing risk\n      factors."
