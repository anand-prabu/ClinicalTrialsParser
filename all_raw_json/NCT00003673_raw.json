Assess the safety of CMA-676 in this patient population.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, single arm, multicenter study. Patients receive 1 course of\n      CMA-676 IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by a 6 hour observation period. Patients may\n      receive 1 additional course of therapy 15 to 28 days later. There is a 28 day follow-up\n      period after the last dose of study medication. Patients are followed for an additional 6\n      months, then every 3 months for 18 months, and then every 6 months until relapse and/or\n      death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 23-55 patients will be accrued for this study within 12\n      months. Enrollment will then be extended for up to an additional 55 patients."
