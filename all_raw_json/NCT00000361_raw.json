This condition is called autoimmune inner ear disease (AIED), because it\n      is thought that the hearing loss is triggered by an autoimmune process. Treatment attempts\n      to suppress or control this process with powerful anti-inflammatory drugs. This is a Phase\n      III, outpatient study. All study participants will be assigned to one of four different\n      groups testing the experimental use of drugs. The study is scheduled to run for 18 months,\n      with a minimum of 11 visits per participant."
