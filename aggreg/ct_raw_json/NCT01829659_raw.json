But these studies have not looked at the way different racial backgrounds can\n      affect the way the blood forms clots. Minorities, such as African-Americans are\n      underrepresented.  Therefore, we are conducting this platelet reactivity study to better\n      understand if there are differences in how this drug affects African-Americans from how they\n      affect Caucasian patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention and receiving\n      ticagrelor.  These data will be compared to a historical control of Caucasian patients who\n      underwent similar platelet function testing."
