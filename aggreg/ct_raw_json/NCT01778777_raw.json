Adjustment can be done in very small steps to match anatomic and biomechanic\n      needs. The Arthrex Univers Revers Shoulder Prosthesis is the only device up to date that can\n      be configured in two different inclination angles without any limitation in component use.\n\n      This multicentre case-series has the goal to evaluate whether patients with rotator cuff\n      tear arthropathy benefit from the Univers\u00ae Revers shoulder prosthesis in terms of low\n      complication risk, as well as high function and quality of life."
