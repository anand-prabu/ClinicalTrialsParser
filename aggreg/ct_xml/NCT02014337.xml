      This is a study to assess the safety and preliminary efficacy of the combination of
      mifepristone and eribulin in patients with metastatic or locally advanced unresectable
      Triple Negative Breast Cancer.  The structure for the study is a single arm, non-randomized,
      open-label, multicenter trial with no control group.  The study will be conducted at up to 8
      sites, with up to 40 evaluable patients.

      There will be two parts to the study: Part 1, a dose escalation phase, in which the Maximum
      Tolerated Dose (MTD) and Recommended Phase II Dose (RP2D) will be determined in up to 20
      patients; and Part 2, a dose expansion phase in which a preliminary estimate of efficacy
      will be made in an expansion group of up to 20 patients at the RP2D.

      Treatment will be administered in 21-day cycles, with the exception of the first cycle,
      which will be of 28 days duration with a lead-in of 7 days dosing of mifepristone.

      Cycle 1 (28-day cycle): Mifepristone administered orally (PO) with food once daily for 28
      days. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on days 8 and 15.

      Cycle 2 and beyond (21-day cycle): Mifepristone administered orally (PO) with food once
      daily for 21 days. Eribulin will be administered intravenously (IV) over 2 to 5 minutes on
      days 1 and 8. Enrolment in Part 2 of the study (dose expansion) will occur once the RP2D has
      been determined. Patients in the dose expansion study must have disease that is
      glucocorticoid (GR) receptor positive (by immunohistochemistry [IHC]). Patients will be
      treated in repeated 21 day cycles until progression or another withdrawal criterion is met.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  â‰¥ 18 years old

          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of breast cancer

          -  For dose escalation: Locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer

          -  For dose expansion:  Triple-negative for ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2 (&lt; 1%
             cells positive for ER/progesterone receptor, and HER2 IHC score of 0-,or 1, or FISH
             HER2+ ratio of 1.8); patients with low ER IHC  (&gt; 1% but &lt; 10% cells positive), but
             negative by genomic assay are eligible.

          -  Inoperable metastatic or locally advanced unresectable disease

          -  For dose escalation, patients may have evaluable or measurable disease.

          -  For dose expansion, patients must have measurable disease as defined by Response
             Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1) in at least one lesion not
             previously irradiated unless there is documented evidence of progression.

          -  Part 1, dose escalation:  patients should have received a minimum of two, and up to
             four prior chemotherapy treatments for metastatic or locally advanced disease.

          -  In Part 2, dose expansion: TNBC tumor must be positive for the glucocorticoid
             receptor (as defined by at least 10% positive cells by IHC assay).  Patients should
             have received a minimum of two, and up to four, prior  chemotherapeutic regimens
