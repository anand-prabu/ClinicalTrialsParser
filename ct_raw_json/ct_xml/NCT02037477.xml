    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the acid-inhibitory effect of multiple oral
      doses of TAK-438 and the relative effect of TAK-438 versus two controls (esomeprazole and
      rabeprazole sodium) in healthy Japanese adult male participants with the CYP2C19 EM
      genotype.

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3 open-label crossover study to evaluate the acid-inhibitory effect
      following 7 days multiple doses of TAK-438 (20 mg per dose) and esomeprazole (20 mg per
      dose) (Cohort 1) or TAK-438 (20 mg per dose) and rabeprazole sodium (10 mg per dose) (Cohort
      2) in healthy Japanese adult male participants (CYP2C19 genotype: EM).  There will be a
      total of 20 subjects, 5 per group for both Cohorts 1 and 2. At least 2 subjects each with
      the homo EM (*1/*1) or hetero EM (*1/*2, *1/*3) CYP2C19 genotype will be enrolled among the
      5 subjects per group.

      The drug being tested in this study is called TAK-438. This study will look at the acid
      inhibitory effect following 7 days multiple doses of TAK-438  and esomeprazole (Cohort 1) or
      TAK-438 and rabeprazole sodium (Cohort 2) in healthy Japanese adult male participants witrh
      the CYP2C19 EM genotype.

      The study will enroll a total of 20 participants, 5 per group for both Cohorts. At least 2
      subjects each with the homo EM (*1/*1) or hetero EM (*1/*2, *1/*3) CYP2C19 genotype will be
      enrolled among the 5 subjects per group.

        -  Group A, Cohort 1: TAK-438 (20 mg per dose for 7 days) followed by esomeprazole (20 mg
           per dose for 7 days)

        -  Group B, Cohort 1: esomeprazole (20 mg per dose for 7 days) followed by TAK-438 (20 mg
           per dose for 7 days)

        -  Group C, Cohort 2: TAK-438 (20 mg per dose for 7 days) followed by rabeprazole sodium
           (10 mg per dose for 7 days)

        -  Group D, Cohort 2: rabeprazole sodium (10 mg per dose for 7 days) followed by TAK-438
           (20 mg per dose for 7 days).

      All participants will be asked to take Study Medication at the same time each day throughout
      the study.  This single center trial will be conducted in Japan.  The overall time to
      participate in this study is 31 days.
