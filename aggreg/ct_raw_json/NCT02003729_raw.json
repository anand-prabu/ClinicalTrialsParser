            "textblock": "In Ontario, approximately 130,000 sleep studies were conducted in 2008, which is twice the\n      number of sleep studies reported in 1999. In 2008, Ontario spent approximately $40 million\n      on polysomnography (PSG) testing alone, despite the fact that access to PSG remained\n      limited, with an average waiting time of approximately 3.5 months for an in-laboratory sleep\n      study and approximately 12 months from referral to appropriate treatment.  Portable monitors\n      (PM) have been developed in an effort to substitute for the more costly and labor intensive\n      clinic-based PSG. As of 2011, there are over 40 PM commercially available in the United\n      States with different configurations for cardiorespiratory and neurophysiologic signals.\n\n      At the request of the Ontario Health Technology Advisory Committee (OHTAC), a panel that\n      makes recommendations to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care about the uptake\n      and diffusion of health technologies, the Toronto Rehabilitation Institute convened an\n      expert panel in 2007 to explore alternative approaches to the diagnosis of obstructive sleep\n      apnea (OSA). Members of the expert panel suggested that despite the availability of a large\n      number of PMs, home assessments are problematic as technicians are required to ensure\n      continuous placement of electrodes for reliable testing. They also suggested that a good\n      screening tool was not available at that time. The Toronto Rehabilitation Institute\n      therefore undertook a research study that eventually led to the development of the ApneaDxTM\n      PM.\n\n      ApneaDx\u2122 is a new PM that uses a microphone to record breath sounds and an acoustical\n      analysis algorithm of breath sounds to determine the (Apnea Hypopnea Index) AHI. Results\n      from preliminary studies suggest that the AHI derived from ApneaDx\u2122 approximates that from\n      PSG. In preliminary studies, it appears that for the diagnosis of sleep apnea, home sleep\n      study with ApneaDx\u2122 is simple and reliable even when conducted by untrained users.\n\n      This study evaluates the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of management of OSA diagnosed\n      based on a home sleep study with ApneaDx\u2122. This study will be conducted by the Toronto\n      Health Economics and Technology Assessment (THETA) Collaborative. Data from this study will\n      be used to support practice recommendations regarding the use of a home sleep study with\n      ApneaDxTM as input for diagnosis of OSA by the OHTAC and reimbursement considerations by the\n      Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care."
