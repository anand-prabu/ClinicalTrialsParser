  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Static postures, repetitive work tasks, and work stress increase the risk for
      musculoskeletal disorders and sickness absence. Objective measurements of occupational
      loadings - EMG for muscular activity, EEG for cognitive activity, ECG for cardiovascular
      activity and heart rate variability, actigraphy for bodily movements - may provide useful
      early indicators of muscular, cognitive and cardiovascular overload.

      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of an individually tailored
      bio-psycho-social intervention strategy versus &quot;usual care&quot; ergonomics and standard physical
      exercises (reference group) on these risk factors in lab technicians with a history of
      work-related musculoskeletal pain.

    <description>Electromyography (EMG) is measured in the neck and shoulder muscles throughout a normal workday before and after the intervention. EMG gaps  is defined as periods with muscular inactivity. Actigraphs are used to measure bodily movements, and only period with sitting or standing work are included in the analysis (i.e. walking activities are excluded from the analyses)</description>
