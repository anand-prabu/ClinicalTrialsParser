Clinical assessments, behavioral\n      paradigms of learning and brain imaging will be carried out within at least 4 half- lives\n      after any psychotropic medication.\n\n      The investigators will implement and apply functional imaging paradigms assessing\n      Pavlovian-to-instrumental transfer and reversal learning tasks and associate model\n      parameters of learning with alcohol craving, intake and prospective relapse risk.\n\n      In this project, the impact of the dopamine x glutamate interaction on learning deficits and\n      consecutive relapse probability is targeted with [18F]fallypride PET and the measurement of\n      absolute concentrations of glutamate with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)."

This learning deficit is of clinical relevance particularly during therapy\n      and for the psychosocial outcome.\n\n      The reduced availability of central dopamine D2-receptors in detoxified alcohol dependent\n      patients observed in PET investigations and their hypothetical effects on reward-related\n      learning are in line with evidence for learning deficits in hypodopaminergic states,\n      particularly for avoidance learning in non-dependent samples. Growing evidence indicates\n      that the learning-related striatal dopamine signals are modulated by higher executive\n      functions involving, e.g., the prefrontal cortex.\n\n      Here, broad glutamatergic outputs of the prefrontal cortex are crucial for subcortical\n      learning mechanisms and match with recent models of interactive dopamine-glutamate\n      dysfunctions and models of neurotrophic signaling in alcohol dependence."
