Women with a singleton pregnancy who are\n      Latina, who intend to breastfeed for more than 2 months, who have or do not have a history\n      of depression, and who are willing to be followed for 8 weeks after delivery will be\n      enrolled in the study. Latinas who report maternal or infant disorder that may interfere\n      with breastfeeding; those who endorse substance use, and/or who have or have had a\n      psychiatric disorder (e.g., psychosis or serious personality disorders) other than\n      depression or anxiety will be excluded to minimize risk and confounds with the outcomes of\n      interest.\n\n      Methods: There will be four study-time points: prenatal visit, 4- and 12-weeks postpartum\n      phone interviews, and one laboratory visit at 8-weeks postpartum. Participants will be\n      compensating after each interview.\n\n      Prenatal Visit: We will collect demographic information; assess depression and anxiety\n      status, as well as breastfeeding intention. During the prenatal visit we will also inquire\n      about acculturation and everyday stressors. English and Spanish validated measures will be\n      used.\n\n      Postpartum Phone Interviews: We will inquire about breastfeeding practices and self-efficacy\n      using the Breastfeeding Self-Efficacy-Short Form as well as depression status using the\n      EPDS.\n\n      Laboratory Visit: At 8 weeks postpartum, biomarkers will be collected via blood draws during\n      breastfeeding and the cold pressor stress test.  Oxytocin will be collected during\n      breastfeeding and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol will be collected after a\n      recovery period and during the cold pressor stress test. Childhood and Border-Crossing\n      Trauma will be collected following the laboratory procedures.\n\n      What will be gained: This study will enable us to begin to understand Latinas (immigrant and\n      U.S.-born) neuroendocrine responses to high levels of stress, which will enable us to and\n      determine associations between stress and trauma the development of postpartum depression.\n      This study will also enable us to identify risk factors for postpartum depression among\n      immigrant and U.S.-born Latinas."
