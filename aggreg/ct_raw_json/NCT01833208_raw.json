To assess systemic changes to the immune system and genetic changes to immune cells in\n      patients treated by the combination of RT and sipuleucel-T.\n\n      III. To assess the induction of antigen-specific immune responses to prostatic acid\n      phosphatase (PAP), cancer/testis antigen 1B (NY-ESO-1) and antigens that have proven to be\n      released by radiation (such as, heat shock protein 90 [HSP-90], calreticulin, etc.).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To assess adverse event rates in patients receiving the high-dose radiation and\n      sipuleucel-T therapy.\n\n      II. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) changes will be assessed. III. Overall and cancer\n      specific survival will be assessed.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients undergo single-fraction radiation therapy to at least 1 bone lesion 2 days after\n      the first sipuleucel-T dose.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3 and 6 months."
