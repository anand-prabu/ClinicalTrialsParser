  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hemi spatial neglect, or the tendency to ignore stimuli originating in a portion of the
      environment contra lateral to a cerebral lesion, can be a major source of functional
      handicap after stroke. The currently available treatments for unilateral neglect are
      scanning training, visual cuing approaches, limb activation strategies, visual imagery,
      tactile stimulation, prisms and sustained attention training.Mirror therapy improves the
      hand function in sub-acute stroke.

      Hypothesis: Mirror therapy will be effective in the management of stroke patients with
      unilateral neglect as compared to limb activation technique.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      About 30 - 50% of stroke patients are left with considerable residual deficits. The post
      stroke disabilities are due to loss of locomotion and activities of daily living, cognition
      and communication skills.Hemispatial neglect has been reported in association with damage to
      several different cerebral structures in a large-scale distributed neurocognitive
      network.Mirror therapy improves the hand function in sub-acute stroke. It also helps in the
      recovery of neglect in stroke patients. But little consensus exists as to whether one
      treatment is more efficacious than others and many studies fail to document duration of
      treatment effects or generalization to daily activities. The aim of our study is to evaluate
      the effectiveness of limb activation with MT and limb activation strategy alone in the
      management of stroke patients with unilateral neglect and to make the patient functional in
      activities of daily living.

    <description>During the mirror practices, patients were seated close to a table on which a mirror (35Ã—35cm) was placed vertically. The practice consisted of non paretic-side wrist and finger flexion and extension movements while patients looked into the mirror, watching the image of their noninvolved hand, thus seeing the reflection of the hand movement projected over the involved hand. Patients could see only the noninvolved hand in the mirror; otherwise, the noninvolved hand was hidden from sight. During the session patients were asked to try to do the same movements with the paretic hand while they were moving the non paretic hand.</description>

    <description>The control group performed the same exercises for the same duration but used the nonreflecting side of the mirror in such a way that the paretic hand was hidden from sight. The same therapist delivered the control therapy to the patients. Both the treatment and the control group received limb activation.</description>
