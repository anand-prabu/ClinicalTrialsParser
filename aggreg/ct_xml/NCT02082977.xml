  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, 2-part study to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose
      (RP2D) for GSK2816126 given twice weekly by intravenous (IV) infusion. Part 1 will be
      conducted in adult subjects with relapsed/refractory diffuse large B cell and transformed
      follicular lymphoma malignancies to determine the safety and tolerability of GSK2816126.
      Expansion cohorts (Part 2) are planned to further explore clinical activity of GSK2816126 at
      the RP2D in relapsed/refractory Germinal Center B-cell-like Diffuse Large B-cell Lymphoma
      (GCB-DLBCL) subjects with Enhancer of Zeste 2 (EZH2) wild type and EZH2 mutant positive
      lymphoma malignancies.

             Subjects with tumors harboring EZH2 mutations other than the seven outlined above
             will be enrolled in the EZH2 wild type cohort.

          -  Subjects should have accessible tumor and willingness to undergo two biopsies.
             Subjects for whom biopsies are not feasible will be eligible for enrollment at the
             discretion of the GSK medical monitor. Contact GSK medical monitor for confirmation
             of enrollment and study entry if biopsies are not feasible.

             lymphopenia.
