Patient interview assessments and laboratory studies will be performed at each\n      interview time point.

Have serious or unstable cardiovascular, hepatic, renal, metabolic, respiratory, or\n             hematologic illness, symptomatic peripheral vascular disease, or other medical\n             condition or psychiatric conditions that, in the opinion of investigator and study\n             physician, would compromise participation or be likely to lead to hospitalization\n             during the course of the study.\n\n         15. Are non-ambulatory or require the use of crutches or a walker.\n\n         16.
