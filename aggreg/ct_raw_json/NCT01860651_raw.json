In this\n      E-health project the investigators seek to improve young patients (10-17 years)\n      responsibility for treatment, to empower them and thereby enhance the adherence in order to\n      achieve a more quiet disease course. Through the e-Health program and web-app the disease\n      activity will be presented to the young patient via a simple traffic light chart and the\n      patient will be guided to: continue the prescribed medication, call the physician or visit\n      the out-patient clinic. In future the concept is believed also to be applicable for young\n      patients with other chronic diseases."

            "textblock": "IBD's natural history is characterized by relapses (e.g. rectal bleeding, diarrhoea,\n      abdominal pain, faecal urgency, fistula and anal abscess) and remissions. In children and\n      adolescents the disease has a more aggressive course as compared with adults, causing a\n      deterioration in the quality of life. During puberty patients are in an especially\n      vulnerable period of their lives and there is a high risk for developing social disabilities\n      due to the disease. Furthermore, IBD can lead to many days of absence from school and\n      patients are at risk of not being able to maintain their education.\n\n      Patients are treated medically when the disease is active, but also in quiet phases too in\n      order to maintain remission. It is therefore crucial for success that patients receive\n      insight into the disease and understand the importance of following the recommended\n      maintenance treatment. Despite being aware of an increased risk of acute hospitalization and\n      surgery, it is difficult for both adult and pediatric patients to follow the continuous\n      medication (adherence). It is known that up to 50% of young patients fail to take their\n      medication as directed.\n\n      Previous studies have used E-health in the treatment of IBD patient. In M. Elkjaer et al.\n      2010 study on 300 patients with mild-to-moderate UC, E-health treatment resulted in shorter\n      periods of active disease (average 18 vs. 77 days in the control group), 88% were satisfied\n      with their treatment using E-health and the need for outpatient visits was reduced. In\n      another study, Pedersen et al. 2012, on 27 patients with CD and examining biological\n      treatment, E-Health was able to optimize the timing of infliximab treatment in CD patients.\n      The E-Health solution was safe to use and patients showed high adherence to the program\n      (86%). To the investigators knowledge no study has previously used E-health treatment in\n      children and adolescents with IBD. It is, however, the investigators belief that this\n      treatment concept would be readily taken up such patients, for whom web communication, at\n      least in Denmark, is already a well-integrated part of their daily lives.\n\n      The current study consists of two projects: Project A: Patients in treatment with medicine\n      administrated at home. Project B: Patients in treatment with biological infusions\n\n      Project A: Patients in treatment with medicine administrated at home are monitored,\n      according to current international guidelines, with outpatient visits every third month.\n      Patients participating in the current project will be randomly split into two groups and\n      followed for two years. E-health group: Web-monitoring with an annual visit to the IBD\n      center. Control group: Routine outpatient controls, four times a year.\n\n      Project B: According to current guidelines, patients receiving treatment with biologicals\n      visit the outpatient clinic approximately every eighth week and treatment is given\n      intravenously. During the E-health intervention, symptoms and fecal calprotectin are\n      monitored closely through the web-program, and treatment will be initiated by symptoms and\n      elevated FC. In this way the timing of treatment with biologicals can be optimized and\n      infusions delayed with a maximum treatment-free period of 12 weeks, or earlier than 8 weeks\n      if necessary."
