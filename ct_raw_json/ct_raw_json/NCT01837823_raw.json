            "textblock": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a leading cause of death in most countries. It is well\n      known that the reduction of cholesterol levels by statin therapy is associated with\n      significant decreases in plaque burden. REVERSAL, ASTEROID, and more recently the SATURN II\n      trial showed that in patients with CAD, lipid lowering with atorvastatin or rosuvastatin\n      respectively reduced progression of coronary atherosclerosis, even causing plaque regression\n      of some lesions. CAD clinical events are related to plaque instability due to lipid content\n      and activity within the atherosclerotic plaque. The investigators recently completed the\n      YELLOW I study, and identified that intensive statin therapy (rosuvastatin 40mg) was\n      associated with a reduction in the amount of lipid in obstructive coronary plaques, as\n      measured by near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The YELLOW II study is designed to expand and\n      build upon these results, and to provide mechanistic insights into the potential benefits of\n      intensive statin therapy on atherosclerotic plaques."

We propose to image non-culprit coronary lesions using these modalities\n      in patients with two or three diseased coronary vessels deemed to warrant intervention on\n      clinical grounds. Thus, at the time of enrolment patients will undergo Percutaneous Coronary\n      Intervention (PCI) of a non-study culprit lesion, and triple-modality imaging of the\n      potential non-culprit ('YELLOW') lesion. If there is high baseline lipid content in the\n      non-culprit YELLOW lesion (max 4mm LCBI > 150), patients will be formally entered into this\n      study. Following this, all enrolled subjects will receive high-dose lipid lowering therapy\n      (rosuvastatin 40mg daily). The non-culprit YELLOW lesion will undergo staged intervention\n      8-12 weeks following study enrolment and baseline imaging. At this time the YELLOW lesion\n      will be reimaged to determine whether high-dose statin therapy caused a reduction in lipid\n      content as assessed by NIRS, and other altered plaque morphology as assessed by OCT and\n      IVUS. In addition, both at baseline and at the time of final non-culprit YELLOW lesion PCI,\n      blood samples will be drawn for the assessment of haptoglobin genotype, LDL, HDL, macrophage\n      profiling in response to certain changes in these lipid moieties and other parameters that\n      may be related to changes in the YELLOW lesion as a result of intensive statin therapy."
