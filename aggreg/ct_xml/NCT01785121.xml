  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study objectives are to determine the effectiveness of structured access to a Wii game
      computer compared to motivational support only in heart failure patients on exercise
      capacity and daily activity. Secondly, to determine the effectiveness of structured access
      to a Wii game computer compared to motivational support only in heart failure patients on
      the combined endpoint of death, readmission and quality of life.

      The following research questions will be addressed:

        -  What is the effectiveness of structured introduction and access to a Wii game computer
           in patients with heart failure to improve their exercise capacity compared to patients
           with heart failure in a control group who only receive motivational support?

        -  What is the effectiveness of structured introduction and access to a Wii game computer
           in patients with heart failure compared to patients with heart failure in a control
           group who only receive motivational support to increase their daily physical activity,
           decrease health care use and improve quality of life?

        -  What are experiences of heart failure patients and how is their exercise motivation
           when they are introduced and instructed to play with a Wii game computer?
