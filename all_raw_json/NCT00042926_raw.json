Within 18 hours after radiolymphoscintigraphy,\n      patients undergo resection of the primary oral cavity tumor and radioguided sentinel\n      lymphadenectomy and regional cervical lymphadenectomy. Lymph nodes are examined by\n      hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. If negative by H&E, lymph nodes are further analyzed\n      by immunohistochemistry.\n\n      Patients are followed at 30 days.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 161 patients will be accrued for this study within 2.7 years."
