  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Deferiprone (DFP) is the most extensively studied oral iron chelator to date. It has been
      authorised in Europe in 1999 for the treatment of iron overload in patients with
      beta-thalassaemia major when DFO is contraindicated or inadequate. Despite a wide experience
      of DFP there are limited experimental data available on DFP in children and no
      pharmacokinetic data in children under 6 years of age. On the basis of the existing data in
      adults and adolescent, in the DEEP-1 trial a pharmacokinetic bridging model will be
      developed to support the dose selection in children aged less than 6 years. The study will
      consist of two phases, namely an experimental phase, during which patients will receive a
      single dose and a modeling phase, during which PK data obtained after single dose in
      patients &lt; 6 years of age will be analysed in conjunction with historical PK data in adults
      and older children and adolescents. The model-based analysis of the data obtained after
      single dose will enable the assessment of the dosing regimen required for the purpose of
      accurate pharmacokinetic bridging. The ratio between the predicted systemic exposure
      parameters (AUC and Cmax) in the target population and reference group will be used as basis
      for recommendation of the dose in the target population.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients in a chronic transfusional program who have received at least 150 ml/kg/year
             of packed red blood cells (corresponding approximately to 12 transfusions) and on
             current treatment with DFO, DFX, DFP; aged from 1 month to less than 6 years; or

          -  Patients na√Øve to any chelation treatment who have received not less than 150 ml/kg
             of packed red blood cells (corresponding to approximately 12 transfusions) and have
             ferritin levels &gt; 800 ng/mL, aged from 1 month to less than 6 years; or

          -  Patients who meet the transfusion criteria (150 ml/kg/year corresponding
             approximately to 12 transfusions) and have known intolerance or contraindication to
             DFO

        And if all of the following criteria apply:

          -  Patients affected by any hereditary haemoglobinopathies requiring chronic transfusion
             therapy including but not limited to thalassaemia and sickle cell disease

          -  Written informed consent obtained from their legal guardian on the patient's behalf
             in accordance with the national legislations. According to his/her capability,
             patient's informed assent will be collected

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with known intolerance or contraindication to the trial treatment

          -  Patient with Hb levels less than 8g/dl (entry may be delayed until values return to
             normal)

             (entry may be delayed until values return to normal)

          -  Patient with evidence of abnormal liver function (ALT level &gt;5 times the upper normal
             limit during six months preceding enrolment; entry may be delayed until values return
             to normal)
