Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Advisory Committee on Immunization\n           Practices (ACIP)-specified vaccination window of 6 weeks to 8 months old.\n\n        2. Rotarix vaccination according to compliance with the Rotarix prescribing information\n           (PI) window of 6 weeks to 6 months old.\n\n      All outcomes will be analysed for 1) vaccination coverage according to compliance with the\n      ACIP vaccination window, and 2) vaccination coverage according to compliance with PI\n      vaccination window; for both Rotarix vaccination coverage scenarios there will be four\n      cohorts.\n\n      An additional 'complete Rotarix vaccination off-ACIP/off-PI' cohort will be created if more\n      than 5 percent of total person-time in the four cohorts would be complete vaccination if\n      vaccine doses outside of the vaccination window were considered."
