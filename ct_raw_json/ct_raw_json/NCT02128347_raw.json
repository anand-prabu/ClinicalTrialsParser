            "textblock": "Home dialysis has many potential benefits compared to in-center hemodialysis including\n      improved quality of life, reduced hospital admission and reduced cost. However, some\n      patients perceive that home modalities are associated with increased isolation from the\n      healthcare system, substandard care or higher risk of catastrophic events. Providing better\n      support for home dialysis patients may enhance their ability to maintain at home, improve\n      their health outcomes, increase quality of life and improve satisfaction with care. In other\n      chronic disease populations a secure, online communication portal between physicians and\n      patients has proven useful in enhancing care for patients. Thus far, the utility of an\n      online portal communication system has not been tested in a cohort of home dialysis\n      patients. The investigators hypothesize that this novel form of communication will improve\n      care and outcomes for home dialysis patients. Therefore, in a cohort of home dialysis\n      patients, the purposes of this study are as follows: 1) Does an online patient-portal\n      improve quality of life? 2) Does an online patient-portal improve patient satisfaction with\n      home dialysis care?  3) Does an online patient-portal reduce hospitalization and health\n      service utilization? 4) Does an online portal improve patient self-efficacy?"

            "textblock": "Home dialysis (including peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis) has a number of\n      potential benefits over in-center hemodialysis (including lower healthcare costs and\n      improved quality of life for patients). However, overall quality of life remains low\n      compared to the general population. Furthermore, home dialysis patients (primarily those on\n      peritoneal dialysis) continue to experience a high rate of hospitalization. Finally, there\n      can be improvement in patient satisfaction with home dialysis, particularly in the areas of\n      shared decision making and handling of patient requests.\n\n      Regarding satisfaction with care, peritoneal dialysis patients have identified that\n      \"attentiveness to concerns\", and clarity of recommendations is important. Improved\n      satisfaction in turn, may be associated with improvements in quality of life. Therefore,\n      identifying novel communication systems for home dialysis patients is crucial. The use of\n      eHealth online portals that support online communication between patients and healthcare\n      workers is increasing. An interface that allows patients to discuss treatment plans and\n      address clinical problems while obviating the need for telephone communication has been\n      shown to be beneficial in some studies. Such a system may improve patient satisfaction,\n      reduce health service utilization, and potentially improve health outcomes.\n\n      Thus far, the feasibility and potential benefit of an eHealth online portal to facilitate\n      communication has not been evaluated in home dialysis. Therefore, in a cohort of home\n      dialysis patients, the purpose of this study is to identify the following: 1) Does an online\n      portal improve quality of life? 2) Does an online portal improve patient satisfaction with\n      home dialysis care? 3) Does an online portal reduce hospitalization and health service\n      utilization? 4) Does an online portal improve patient self-efficacy? Overall, we hope that\n      this pilot study will inform the need to pursue a larger, multicenter trial to more\n      rigorously evaluate the utility of this novel form of communication for home dialysis\n      patients.\n\n      We will conduct a prospective study of prevalent (receiving home dialysis for at least three\n      months) home dialysis patients (including both peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis) at\n      Capital Health. Consecutive patients that are evaluated in the home dialysis clinic over a\n      4-month period (September to December 2014) will be enrolled in the study if they provide\n      consent. We anticipate that this time frame will ensure that we can accrue our minimum\n      target sample of patients."
