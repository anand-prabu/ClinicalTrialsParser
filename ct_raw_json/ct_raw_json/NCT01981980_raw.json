Radiofrequency (RF) is a method that uses\n      electric current to generate heat into the layers of the skin and the subcutaneous tissue.\n      Both techniques are indicated to the treatment of skin laxity. The aim of this study was to\n      compare the effects of CA an RF on human skin. Methods: Eight patients who underwent\n      abdominoplasty surgery received a single procedure of both treatments. Untreated skin was\n      used as control. In an area of 49 cm2 (7 x 7 cm) in the infra-umbilical region CA was\n      performed on the right and RF on the left side. Sample collection period ranged from zero to\n      120 days. CA was administered at a velocity of 40 ml/min, and the total quantity of CO2\n      infused was approximately 20ml. RF was carried out in a temperature higher than 40\u00baC on the\n      epidermis for 5 minutes after reaching this temperature."
