Researchers want to gather tissue samples from people with\n      lung and thymic cancers to understand the disease better. This may lead to new ways to\n      diagnose and treat it.\n\n      Objective:\n\n      - To collect tissue samples for use in the study of lung cancers.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Adults over age 18 with non-small cell lung cancer, small cell lung cancer, extra\n      pulmonary small cell cancer, pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors, and thymic epithelial tumors.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical exam, and blood tests.\n           They will be asked about how they perform their daily tasks.\n\n        -  Participants may be asked to give urine and blood samples. They may give a saliva\n           sample if they cannot give blood. They will also give a sample of their tumor from a\n           biopsy they had. They may also be given the option to undergo a biopsy.\n\n        -  Participants may have MRI, CT, and/or PET scans of the body. They will lie in a machine\n           that takes pictures of the body.\n\n        -  After visits to the Clinical Center end, researchers will contact participants by phone\n           every year to check on their health."

Some of these alterations are seen in normal and preneoplastic cells as well,\n           suggesting a sequential development from normal epithelial cells to cancer, through a\n           multistep process, usually coincident with cigarette smoking.\n\n        -  This natural history protocol is an extension of our Molecular Profiling\n\n      protocol to enable tissue collection for more in-depth proteomic and genomic analyses to\n      understand tumor biology and treatment response.\n\n        -  A cohort of patients enrolled in this natural history study is likely to enroll in the\n           IRB approved protocol for end-of-life in-patient hospice and rapid autopsy following\n           death (13-C0131). Longitudinally collected tumor tissue from these patients, including\n           from several metastatic sites at autopsy will be a unique resource to understand tumor\n           evolution.\n\n        -  There will be opportunity to embark upon a wide array of studies in the future with the\n           longitudinally collected tissue samples tagged with clinical information from patients.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To allow sample acquisition for use in the study of non-small cell lung cancer\n\n      (NSCLC), Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), extrapulmonary small cell cancer (ESCC), pulmonary\n      neuroendocrine tumors (PNET), and thymic epithelial tumors (TETs).\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n        -  Patients with histologically or cytologically confirmed NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and\n           TET.\n\n        -  Age > 18 years.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  This is a bio-specimen collection protocol in which samples will be collected from\n           patients with NSCLC, SCLC, ESCC, PNET, and TET.\n\n        -  Eligible patients undergoing screening for or participating in NIH protocols or\n           eligible patients treated elsewhere and referred from other oncologists will be\n           referred for participation in this study.\n\n        -  Upon providing informed consent, patients will undergo sample acquisition procedure,\n           which may include a tumor biopsy, blood, urine, abnormal body fluid and a cheek swab\n           collection.\n\n        -  An accrual ceiling of 2000 subjects is planned over an accrual period of 10 years."
