    <textblock>
      The study purpose is to document the prescription and the use of Low Molecular Weight
      Heparin in usual medical practice in patients with cancer and established Venous
      Thromboembolism. This study also aims at gathering epidemiological data on the Low Molecular
      Weight Heparin therapy of Venous Thromboembolism in patients with cancer.
