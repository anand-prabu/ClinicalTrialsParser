The study comprises a Screening Visit at which initial assessment will be made\n      and then a Washout Period during which prospective subjects must discontinue ADHD medication\n      for 14 days (for psychotropic medications other than fluoxetine) or for 28 days (for\n      fluoxetine) before randomization into the study. The Washout Period is 14 days, but may be\n      extended to 28 days for a fluoxetine washout. Subjects requiring either a 14-day or a 28-day\n      Washout Period will have an Interim Visit (off drug) on or about Day -8 (Day -10 to Day -3)\n      for CAARS-Inv assessment after the Washout Period. The Baseline CAARS Inv assessment will be\n      conducted on Day 0. If there is a \u226525% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Interim\n      Visit (off drug) assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return\n      for the Baseline CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. For subjects not\n      needing washout, if there is a \u226525% change in the CAARS-Inv results between the Screening\n      Visit assessment and the Baseline assessment, or if the subject does not return for the\n      Baseline CAARS-Inv assessment, the subject will not be randomized. Following the Washout\n      Period for those requiring a washout, or following the Screening Visit for those subjects\n      who do not require a washout, eligible subjects will undergo baseline assessments and be\n      randomized on Day 0 to MG01CI 1400 mg or to matching placebo and begin the Double-blind\n      Treatment Period. The Double-blind Treatment Period will be 6 weeks in duration. There will\n      be a 2-week Follow-up Period after the last dose of study treatment or early termination."
