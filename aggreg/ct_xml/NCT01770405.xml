  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study focuses on four different lesions: pancreatic cysts, lymph nodes near the
      gastrointestinal tract, pancreatic masses and GIST tumors.

      On one hand, the results obtained during previous studies are more advanced for the
      assessment of the diagnostic performance of Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser
      Endomicroscopy (nCLE) system for Pancreatic cysts. Safety and technical feasibility have
      already been performed, and an interpretation criteria classification exists. On the other
      hand, results for pancreatic masses, Lymph nodes and GIST are less developed.

      the objectives of the study are to

        -  Assess the diagnostic performance of the Cellvizio needle-based Confocal Laser
           Endomicroscopy (nCLE) system in diagnosing masses and cystic tumors of the pancreas,
           lymph nodes, submucosal lesions of the GI tract

        -  Define/Validate descriptive criteria of nCLE sequences in masses and cystic tu-mors of
           the pancreas, lymph nodes, submucosal lesions of the GI tract

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The principle of needle-based Confocal Laser Endomicroscopy (nCLE) is to image organs within
      or adjacent to the GI or respiratory tracts by means of a miniprobe inserted through an
      endoscopic needle. The fundamental technology, as well as the principle of operation of
      nCLE, is substantially similar to pCLE.

      endoscopic fine needles are used during EUS-FNA procedures to puncture solid organs such as
      the pancreas, in order to get tissue or fluid for diagnostic purposes. There are different
      calibers of endoscopic nee-dles used. The most commonly used calibers for EUS-FNA procedures
      are 22G, 19G, and 25G needles. The nCLE Confocal Miniprobe is compatible with the 19G-type
      needle only. It is expected to help to differentiate the different types of lesions,
      especially for cysts, leading to better patient management. Microscopic tissue information
      in real-time in vivo during an EUS-FNA procedure may allow better differentiation between
      mucinous and non-mucinous cysts for instance.
