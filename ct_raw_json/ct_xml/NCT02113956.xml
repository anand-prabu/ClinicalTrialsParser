  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare two different versions of a text-messaging based
      healthy sexuality and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) prevention program to determine
      whether the Guy2Guy (G2G) intervention is effective at promoting HIV prevention behavior
      (e.g., frequency of unprotected anal sex acts) compared to the attention-matched control
      group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adolescent men who have sex with men (AMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV. They
      account for almost 70% of HIV diagnoses among all young people and are the only risk group
      with an increasing number of HIV/AIDS diagnoses. Despite this disproportionate burden,
      current HIV prevention programs focus primarily on adults and heterosexual youth. As such,
      there is an urgent need for evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM. Because
      issues affecting sexual health decisions among AMSM are unique, intervention programs cannot
      be translated from heterosexually focused interventions. Instead, they need to be designed
      from the ground up to ensure appropriately tailored content that resonates with the target
      population. Evidence-based HIV prevention programs targeting AMSM are urgently needed.

      The Guy2Guy (G2G) intervention is a text messaging-based HIV prevention program designed for
      the specific needs of adolescent males who self-identify as gay, bisexual, or queer (GBQ)
      and are between the ages of 14-18 years.  The intervention will be tested in a randomized
      controlled trial against an attention-matched control group which receives text messages
      about healthy lifestyle (e.g., exercise, nutrition). A total of 184 GBQ adolescent males
      will be into the study using an online recruitment strategy. The study is being conducted by
      researchers at the Center for Innovative Public Health Research and Northwestern University.

      The primary efficacy outcome measure is unprotected anal sex acts at 3-months follow-up. The
      investigators hypothesize that those in the G2G intervention will be significantly more
      likely to be engage in HIV preventive behavior (i.e., use condoms when having anal sex) at
      3-months follow-up compared to the attention-matched control group. Secondary efficacy
      outcomes include sexual abstinence, and an increase in HIV testing rates.

      If effective, G2G has promise to be quickly and cost-effectively implemented to scale to
      help to curb the spread of HIV infection among AMSM long into adulthood.

    <description>G2G is a 6-week HIV prevention program delivered daily via text messaging to 14-18 year old males who self-identify as gay, bisexual, and/or queer. In addition to program content, participants are paired with another participant (i.e., a Text Buddy) with whom they can text throughout the program to provide support; and an on-demand advice line, G2Genie, which shares information about condoms, sex, relationships, and the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender (LGBT) community.</description>

    <description>The attention-matched control arm message content consists of information publicly available online related to living a healthy lifestyle. Content discussed includes: STD information, nutrition and sleep hygiene, self-esteem and body image, bullying, and drugs and alcohol. The control arm is 6-weeks in length (Week 6 is a review booster) and is delivered via text messaging. Messages are didactic and not tailored to user sexual experience. Additionally, the Text Buddy and G2Genie intervention program components are not available.</description>

    <intervention_name>Guy2Guy (G2G)</intervention_name>
    <description>G2G is a text messaging-based healthy sexuality and HIV prevention program specifically for 14-18 year old GBQ adolescent males. Content is guided by the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills (IMB) model, and consists of 5 weeks of modules that focus on: HIV information, motivations to engage in HIV preventive behavior, communication skills, behavioral skills (e.g., using a condom; HIV testing); and healthy/unhealthy relationships. Behavioral skills content is reinforced using brief online videos. Week 6 of the program is a &quot;booster&quot; delivered 6-weeks post-intervention end. The booster reviews the topics covered in Weeks 1-5. G2G content is tailored based upon whether one is abstinent or sexually active. Participants are matched with another participant (i.e., a &quot;Text Buddy&quot;) with whom they can text for support throughout the program. Intervention participants will have access to &quot;G2Genie&quot;, an automated service which provides tips and information on topics on demand.</description>
