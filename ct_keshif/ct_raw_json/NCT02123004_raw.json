All patients should receive Acetylsalicylic Acid(ASA) 300 mg as a loading dose before\n      Percutaneous Coronary Intervention(PCI)  then 100 mg daily unless intolerant. Glycoprotein\n      \u2161b/\u2162a receptor antagonists and low-molecular-weight heparin and other additional medication\n      will be directed by the treating cardiologist. All interventions will be performed via the\n      radial approach with the standard technique within 12h after they are involved, and\n      drug-eluting stents will be placed according to stenosis of coronary artery.\n\n      The vascular endothelial function will be tested by Circulating Endothelial Cells (CECs) and\n      levels of inflammation will be tested by CD40 ligand (CD40L), C-reactive protein (CRP), and\n      P-selectin to identify that ticagrelor inhibits inflammation and improves vascular\n      endothelial cell function to a greater extent than clopidogrel."
