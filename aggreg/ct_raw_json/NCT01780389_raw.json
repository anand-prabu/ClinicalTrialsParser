Among marketed serotonin norepinephrine reuptake\n      inhibitors (SNRIs), milnacipran has a unique property in that it blocks serotonin and\n      norepinephrine reuptake equally. It is plausible that equipotent reuptake inhibition may\n      confer greater analgesic benefit compared to other agents, and in preclinical animal models\n      milnacipran has shown superior effects of ameliorating hyperalgesia and allodynia compared\n      to some other antidepressant drugs. Additionally, milnacipran does not have inhibitory\n      effects on cytochrome P (CYP) 450 enzymes, no binding affinity to neurotransmitter receptors\n      liable to cause adverse events, and simple pharmacokinetics."
