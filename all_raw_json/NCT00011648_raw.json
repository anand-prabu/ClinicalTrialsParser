Participants will undergo an evaluation at Howard University   s Comprehensive\n      Sickle Cell Center in Washington, D.C. or at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda,\n      Maryland.  It will include the following:\n\n        -  medical history\n\n        -  physical examination\n\n        -  blood collection (no more than 50 ml., or about 1/3 cup) to confirm the diagnosis of\n           sickle cell anemia, sickle cell trait or beta-thalassemia (Some blood will be stored\n           for future research testing on sickle cell anemia.)\n\n        -  echocardiogram (ultrasound test of the heart) to check the pumping action of the heart\n           and the rate at which blood travels through the tricuspid valve.\n\n      Following this evaluation, a study nurse will contact participants twice a month for 2\n      months and then once every 3 months for the next 3 years for a telephone interview.  The\n      interview will include questions about general health and recent health-related events, such\n      as hospitalizations or emergency room visits."

            "textblock": "Sickle cell anemia is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease\n      affecting African-Americans.  Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for\n      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait.  Acute pain crisis, acute chest syndrome\n      (ACS), and secondary pulmonary hypertension are common complications of sickle cell anemia.\n      Mortality rates of sickle cell patients with pulmonary hypertension are significantly\n      increased as compared to patients without pulmonary hypertension.  Recent studies report up\n      to 40% mortality at 22 months after detection of elevated pulmonary artery pressures in\n      sickle cell patients.  Furthermore, pulmonary hypertension is thought to occur in up to 30%\n      of clinic patients with sickle cell anemia.\n\n      This study is designed to determine the prevalence and prognosis of secondary pulmonary\n      hypertension in adult patients with sickle cell anemia, and to determine whether genetic\n      polymorphisms in candidate genes contribute to its development or response to treatment."
