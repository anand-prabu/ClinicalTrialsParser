      -Purpose: The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of recruiting one patient
      undergoing treatment with high-dose Interleukin-2 (IL-2) therapy for metastatic renal cell
      carcinoma (mRCC), their informal caregiver and their nurse(s), and to evaluate procedures
      around administering measures for cognitive alterations.

      -Aims: In this pilot, a case is comprised of the mRCC patient receiving IL-2, their informal
      caregiver, and their nurse(s). The informal caregiver for this study will be the family
      member or friend staying with the IL-2 patient throughout treatment. One case will be
      evaluated for feasibility. The aims of this study are to: Aim 1) Examine recruitment and
      enrollment procedures to enroll one case, comprised of the IL-2 patient, the informal
      caregiver and the nurse(s); Aim 2) Examine the feasibility of administering six scales
      [Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D), Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM-A), Attention Function Index
      (AFI), Mini Mental State Exam (MMSE), Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS), and
      Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA)] to the IL-2 patient at the start and end of a cycle of
      treatment; Aim 3) Evaluate the feasibility and process of having the informal caregiver
      record their thoughts, observations, and feelings concerning any changes in the patient's
      behavior or cognition during IL-2 treatment through written journal entries every eight
      hours; and Aim 4) Examine the feasibility of one short-response, open-ended question
      administered to the nurse(s) concerning any changes in behavior or cognition in the patient
      during their IL-2 treatment.

      -Background &amp; Significance: Alterations in neurological functioning are the most challenging
      IL-2 side effects impacting approximately 80% of high-dose IL-2 patients. Altered cognition
      includes a wide array of symptoms such as mood alterations, depression, anxiety, psychosis,
      confusion, inability to focus, aggression, hallucinations, sleep insufficiency, hypomanic
      states, suicide and coma. Severe altered cognition may result in ending treatment early,
      preventing the patient from receiving the full benefit of IL-2 therapy. In some patients,
      altered cognition continues throughout the remainder of their life. Although researchers
      have investigated chemotherapy-related altered cognition, indicating alterations such as
      decreased gray matter, slowed processing time, and decreased activation; studies
      investigating immunotherapy-related altered cognition do not exist to my knowledge. There is
      little research examining IL-2—induced altered cognition, thus the concept has never been
      fully defined; this step is essential in order to design future research studies to lessen
      the effects of IL-2—induced altered cognition. Without fully understanding what IL-2—induced
      altered cognition is, symptom science to alleviate these alterations is at a standstill.

      Metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) is a cancer treated with IL-2, where surgery,
      chemotherapy and radiation therapy are ineffective for patients with stage III and IV
      disease. For this pilot study, we will focus only on enrolling one IL-2 patient with mRCC
      patient and their informal caregiver; as many five may be recruited for consent. The
      American Cancer Society estimates 65,000 new cases of renal cancer and 13,000 deaths in
      2013. IL-2, a cytokine based immunotherapy, is given to patients with metastatic disease to
      increase the capacity of their immune systems to fight off cancerous cells, and is one of
      the few treatment options for patients diagnosed with mRCC. High-dose (HD) IL-2 is
      beneficial for clear cell renal cell carcinoma (RCC), where 94% of clear cell RCC patients
      have carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), a RCC carcinoma marker associated with better IL-2
      outcomes. In the HD, intravenous (IV) form, patients undergoing immunotherapy treatment
      experience severe and potentially life-threatening side effects. Despite severe side
      effects, IL-2 succeeds in achieving up to a 14% objective and 8% complete response rate in
      patients with RCC, where the term &quot;objective&quot; refers to the percentage of patients who have
      some response to IL-2, and the term &quot;complete&quot; refers to the percentage of patients who no
      longer have assessable metastases.

      -Procedures: This pilot study will occur during one cycle of HD IL-2 given over a period of
      five days. High-dose IL-2, defined as 600,000-720,000 International Units/kilogram (IU/kg),
      is administered IV over 15 minutes, every eight hours (q8hr) for a maximum of 14 consecutive
      doses; these 14 doses comprise one treatment cycle.  Quantitative data will be recorded
      through a chart review of the IL-2 patient's physiologic variables.  The HAM-D, HAM-A, MoCA,
      AFI, IDS and MMSE scales will also be administered to each IL-2 patient at the beginning and
      end of each IL-2 cycle. Qualitative data will be recorded through informal caregiver written
      journal entries after each dose of IL-2, and through a short-response open-ended question
      administered to the nurse(s).

      Patient physiologic data will be obtained as part of standard of care for IL-2
      administration by the nursing staff every four, eight or 24 hours during the IL-2 patient's
      5-day hospital stay beginning with the first IL-2 dose. These data will be recorded through
      a review of the patient's chart. The patient will be asked to complete six scales: the AFI,
      MMSE, MoCA, IDS, HAM-D and HAM-A in order to evaluate alterations in the patient's
      cognition. These scales will be administered to the IL-2 patient prior to hospital admission
      (on the day of consent in the Duke Clinic) before receiving their first dose of IL-2 in the
      cycle, and 16-hours after the last IL-2 dose for the cycle.

      The informal caregiver's perception and observations of the patient's altered cognition
      during the patient's IL-2 treatments will be written as a journal entry three times per day.
      The informal caregiver will be encouraged to write a journal entry prior to the first IL-2
      dose, and then after each dose.  Journal entries will be hand-written and will occur in the
      hospital setting every eight hours, at the time of IL-2 infusion.

      Finally, nurse(s) will have an open-ended, short response question, such as, &quot;Please write
      as much as you can about any changes in the patient's behavior, actions or communication
      that are different from what you had previously seen in the patient.  If there are other
      changes in the patient that you feel the team should know about, please feel free to write
      about these changes as well. Cognitive changes may appear in many different forms, such as
      pulling out IV lines, confusion, hallucinations, mood alterations (depression, anxiety),
      aggressiveness, misbehavior (urinating on the floor), psychosis, or an inability to focus.
      Please date and time your entries, and place these in the patient's chart.  If you do not
      witness any alterations, please write, 'I did not witness any cognitive or behavior changes
      in the IL-2 patient during my time with the patient.'&quot; A form containing the question for
      the nurse(s) will be in the patient's chart, and the nurse(s) will be encouraged to complete
      the form after each IL-2 infusion.

    <description>The IL-2 participant will be evaluated to determine if all six scales (HAM-D, HAM-A, AFI, MMSE, IDS, MoCA) were completed at the start and end of each IL-2 cycle. The time required to complete these six scales will be recorded to determine patient burden.
The informal caregiver will be evaluated based on how many of the written journal entries they were able to complete. Journal entries are written at the start of treatment, and every eight hours throughout treatment (maximum of 15 entries). The time required to complete these written entries will also be evaluated.
Finally, nurse(s) will be evaluated based on whether they were able to respond to the short-response, open-ended question during their work day.</description>
