Reinforcement of the\n      abdominal donor-site is performed, after randomization, with either a porcine derived\n      biological mesh or a synthetic mesh. The patient and the investigator is blinded.\n\n      The aim is to identify the most optimal method for reinforcement of the abdominal donor-site\n      and thereby contribute to fast and complete rehabilitation of women undergoing breast\n      reconstruction with the pedicled TRAM-flap after surgical removal of the breast tissue due\n      to breast cancer, precursors to breast cancer or an increased risk of developing breast\n      cancer and thereby following preventive removal of the breast tissue.\n\n      The patients visit the outpatient clinic 4, 12 and 24 months after operation and abdominal\n      wall function, the donor site morbidity, the frequency of postoperative complications, the\n      aesthetic appearance of the reconstructed breast and the abdominal wall and costs are\n      evaluated."
