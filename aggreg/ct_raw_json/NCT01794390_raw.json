Pulmojet is an inhaler developed by Zentiva (a subsidiary of\n      Sanofi Aventis)\u037e other inhalers are the major prescribed inhalers in the treatment of asthma\n      and COPD. This will allow critical errors in the use of the Pulmojet inhaler to be assessed\n      and evaluated against commonly prescribed inhalers.\n\n      376 patients recruited from 10 primary care practices will be invited to participate in this\n      single visit study. Upon entry to the study, all patients will be assessed as to their\n      current inhaler device technique before entering into a randomised cross-over to receive\n      device training according to their current device:\n\n      Current Diskus users (i.e. Turbuhaler naive): will be randomised to receive inhaler device\n      training for the Pulmojet device followed by the Turbuhaler, or vice versa.\n\n      Current Turbuhaler / pMDI users (i.e. Diskus naive): will be randomised to receive inhaler\n      device training for the Pulmojet device followed by the Diskus, or vice versa.\n\n      For all devices, critical errors in the use of inhalers will be assessed through nurse\n      observation and vitalograph pneumotrac spirometry ('technology recorded'). A two step device\n      training protocol will be used to establish the ease to which patients can be taught to use\n      the study devices (Pulmojet, Turbohaler (in current Diskus users) and Diskus (in current\n      Turbohlaer or pMDI users). In Step 1 patients will be given the product Patient Information\n      Leaflet (PIL) to read, and in Step 2 patients will be asked to watch a device instructional\n      video. After each step patients will be assessed on their device use. Patients will progress\n      from Step 1 to Step 2 unless device mastery is achieved at Step 1, in which case the patient\n      will progress onto the second device or the study will have been completed.\n\n      All inhalers provided to participants will be supplied completely empty, i.e. with no active\n      drug or placebo present, and participants will not receive any medication or interventional\n      procedure during the study conduct.\n\n      An independent virtual steering committee has been assembled to oversee the study protocol.\n      The steering committee members are international inhalation technology experts.\n\n      The primary objective will be to evaluate the critical errors and number of steps to achieve\n      device mastery (defined as absence of critical errors):\n\n        -  Diskus vs. Pulmojet\n\n        -  Turbuhaler vs. Pulmojet\n\n      The secondary objective will be to evaluate critical errors in device use between:\n\n      \u2022 Current device vs. Pulmojet (all patients)"
