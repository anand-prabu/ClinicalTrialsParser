      The goal of this study is to reduce infant and toddlers' secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in
      a high risk, medically underserved population of African American maternal smokers. The
      program is called &quot;Philadelphia FRESH (Family Rules for Establishing Smokefree Homes)&quot;.
      Participants are recruited from low-income urban neighborhoods in Philadelphia,
      Pennsylvania. After determining study eligibility via telephone screen, all participants
      complete an in-home pre-intervention interview that includes self-reported smoking history,
      current smoking and exposure patterns, and factors that relate to maternal smoking (such as
      depressive symptoms, weight concerns, nicotine dependence,) as well as collection of child
      urine cotinine (a biomarker used to detect SHSe).

      Participants are randomized after baseline to receive either (a) a 9-session (2 in-home
      sessions, 7 phone sessions) intensive Behavioral Counseling intervention (BC) delivered over
      a 16-week period by master's level counselors trained and supervised by PhD-level
      investigators, or (b) an enhanced Self-Help Control (SHC) that uses a detailed self-help
      manual for SHSe-reduction and smoking cessation. Post intervention, a 16-week, in-home end
      of treatment (EOT) assessment includes self-reports of intervention process, factors
      associated with intervention effects, and intervention outcomes that include child urine
      cotinine (to measure level of SHSe) and participant saliva cotinine (to verify self-reported
      smoking quit status). Interviewers and data management staff remain blind to the treatment
      assignment. All procedures are implemented after signed informed consent and were approved
      by Temple University's Institutional Review Board.

      This study represents a community-based behavioral counseling trial designed to reduce
      infant and toddlers' secondhand smoke exposure (SHSe) in a high risk, medically underserved
      population of African American maternal smokers. The program is called &quot;Philadelphia FRESH
      (Family Rules for Establishing Smokefree Homes)&quot;. Participants are recruited from low-income
      urban neighborhoods in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania via referral from pediatricians or
      community clinics run by N.O.R.T.H., Inc (managers of Philadelphia's WIC program). Eligible
      participants include mothers who smoked at least 5 cigarettes per day, have children under 4
      years of age, and report exposing their child to at least 2 of her cigarettes per day. Child
      exposure to a cigarette is defined as a child being in the same room (defined as 4-walls and
      a door that closes) or car when someone is actively smoking a cigarette. For participants
      with more than one child, the youngest child is chosen as the identified child to track
      changes in SHSe during the course of the study. Potential participants are excluded at
      initial telephone screen if they report diagnosis of a psychiatric disorder, are currently
      pregnant, or are not proficient in English.

      After determining study eligibility via telephone screen, all participants complete an
      in-home baseline interview that includes self-reported smoking history, current smoking and
      exposure patterns, and factors that relate to maternal smoking (such as depressive symptoms,
      weight concerns, nicotine dependence,) as well as collection of child urine cotinine (a
      biomarker used to detect SHSe).

      Participants are randomized, post-baseline interview, to receive either (a) a 9-session,
      intensive Behavioral Counseling intervention (BC) delivered over a 16-week period by
      master's level counselors trained and supervised by PhD-level investigators, or (b) an
      enhanced Self-Help Control (SHC) that uses a detailed self-help manual for SHSe-reduction
      and smoking cessation. Post intervention, a 16-week, in-home end of treatment (EOT)
      assessment includes self-reports of intervention process, factors associated with
      intervention effects, and intervention outcomes that include child urine cotinine (to
      measure level of SHSe) and participant saliva cotinine (to verify self-reported smoking quit
      status). Interviewers and data management staff remain blind to the treatment assignment.
      All procedures are implemented after signed informed consent and were approved by Temple
      University's Institutional Review Board.

      Behavioral Counseling (BC): Mothers randomized to receive BC complete two in-home, and seven
      telephone counseling sessions within a 16-week period. Mothers also receive four health
      education and self-help mailings sent in two week intervals during the first 8 weeks of
      their participation to supplement the counseling content. (These four mailings are identical
      to the self-help materials received by the control group.) The overarching goal of child
      SHSe reduction is intended to be achieved through specific BC objectives. These objectives
      include facilitation of health education regarding the dangers of SHSe and smoking, plus the
      benefits of SHSe-reduction and smoking cessation to maternal and child health. Additional
      objectives include (a) building family-level social support to facilitate home-level smoking
      behavior change (e.g. contracts and &quot;prescriptions&quot; setting smoke-free zones, no smoking
      signs, making car smoke-free); (b) fostering coping and problem-solving skills to help
      participants manage smoking urges as well as general life stressors; (c) providing and
      modeling abundant positive reinforcement following SHSe reduction efforts to facilitate
      confidence and motivation for more challenging smoking behavior change goals; and (d)
      offering coping skills, social support, and advice to help mothers develop strategies to
      manage negative affect and smoking-related weight concerns. Under supervision of the PI, a
      licensed social worker and co-facilitator (masters- or Ph.D.-level counselor trainee)
      conducted home sessions, while either staff completed scheduled telephone calls.

      Self-Help Control (SHC) group:  Participants in SHC group receives an intervention binder to
      be used as a self-help approach to SHSe reduction. The binder contains information identical
      to the BC group, however, all binder content is included in this single mailing. Within a
      week of mailing the binder, student workers call to confirm receipt of the binder (and
      re-mail or hand-deliver binders if not received). If receipt is confirmed, staff review the
      goals of the program, highlight chapter section content, and encourage using the binder
      materials as an ongoing resource to attain SHSe-reduction goals. During the 16-week
      intervention period, MIC participants receive three retention telephone calls reinforcing
      participants' participation in the program, along with 7 retention post cards. No counseling
      is to be provided during these contacts. Postcards include statements encouraging ongoing
      reading of materials (e.g., &quot;We are happy about your continued efforts in FRESH....  Keep up
      the good work with your binder!&quot;)

      Primary study outcomes include change in (a) maternal-reported child SHSe (reported as
      cigarettes exposed per day) obtained via validated timeline follow-back methods; and (b)
      baby urine cotinine- a biomarker of SHSe standard in tobacco exposure studies. Secondary
      outcomes include (a) change in maternal cigarettes smoked per day and (b) maternal reported
      7-day point prevalence abstinence, bioverified by saliva cotinine. Urine and saliva samples
      were assayed for cotinine using high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass
      spectrometry as an indicator of exposure to tobacco smoke.
