            "textblock": "The goal of this project is to test the efficacy of a computer-facilitated Screening and\n      Brief Intervention system adapted for Military use (cSBI-M) in reducing substance use among\n      18- to 25-yr-old U.S. Navy and U.S. Marine Corps personnel (USN/USMCs). The aims and\n      hypotheses of this project are to: 1)Test the effects of cSBI-M on any alcohol use.\n      Hypothesis: Among 18- to 25-yr-old USN/USMCs coming for routine health screenings, those\n      receiving cSBI-M will have lower rates of any alcohol use at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month\n      follow-ups than Treatment As Usual (TAU). 2) Test the effects of cSBI-M separately as a\n      preventive, early therapeutic, and risk-reduction intervention. Hypotheses: (a) Among 18- to\n      25-yr-old non-drinking USN/USMCs (negative history of past-12-months drinking at baseline),\n      those receiving cSBI-M will have lower rates of drinking initiation and heavy episodic\n      drinking (HED, a.k.a. \"binge\" drinking) at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups than TAU. (b)\n      Among 18- to 25-yr-old drinking USN/USMCs (positive history of past-12-months drinking at\n      baseline), those receiving cSBI-M will have higher rates of drinking cessation, reduced\n      intensity of drinking (e.g., past-3-months drinking days, HED, and driving after drinking or\n      riding with a drinking driver at 3-, 6-, 9- and 12-month follow-ups than TAU. (3) Test the\n      effects of cSBI-M on tobacco use; explore its effects on other drug use. (4) Assess\n      potential moderators (e.g., age, gender, race/ethnicity, substance use history +/-,\n      parent/sibling/peer substance use), mediators (e.g., Patient to Provider Connectedness,17\n      perceived harmfulness of alcohol and drug use), and explore cSBI-M's mechanism of action.\n      Hypotheses: among 12- to 18-yr-old patients coming for routine care, those receiving c-ASBI\n      will have 1) lower rates of any alcohol use, of drinking initiation and riding with a driver\n      who has been drinking, and 2) higher rates of drinking cessation, reduced intensity of\n      drinking, heavy episodic drinking and driving after drinking or riding with a driver who has\n      been drinking, at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-ups compared to Treatment As Usual (TAU)."
