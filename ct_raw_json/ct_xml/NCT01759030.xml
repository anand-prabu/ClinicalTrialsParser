    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to prove that efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of BCD-020 is
      equivalent to MabThera when used in combination with methotrexate for the treatment of
      patient with rheumatoid arthritis

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This international multi-center, randomized, controlled, double blind study will investigate
      the  efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of BCD-020 (NN: rituximab, CJSC Biocad) versus
      MabThera (INN: rituximab, F. Hoffmann La Roche, Ltd.) both administered in combination with
      methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who had an inadequate response or
      intolerance to other DMARDs including one or more TNF inhibitor therapies.

      Patients will be centrally randomized into one of the two study groups:

      Patients from the first group  will receive BCD-020 as 1000 mg single dose, intravenously,
      once in 2 weeks, with 2 infusions per course (on day 1 and day 15).

      Patients from the second group  will receive MabThera at the same regimen.
