            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      With the advent of quasi-likelihood, generalized estimating equations, and new ways to\n      handle missing data, has come a striking increase in applicable models, perhaps more than\n      after the 1972 introduction of the Cox model for survival data.  TI provided a way to\n      analyze the data.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      TIl provided graphics for data exploration and model validation.  TI ran under most current\n      version of Windows, used Civilized Software's MLAB as its programming language, offered\n      context-sensitive help, a dictionary of relevant terms, identification of file entries from\n      their screen position, and simple animation. TI permitted the user to analyze time-varying\n      data from the two perspectives of repeated measured using a variety of models and time\n      series where both time and frequency domain tools were provided."
