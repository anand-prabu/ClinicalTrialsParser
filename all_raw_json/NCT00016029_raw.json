New diagnostic procedures such as computed tomographic\n      colonography may provide a less invasive method of identifying patients who have colon\n      cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Diagnostic and screening trial to compare the effectiveness of barium enema,\n      computed tomographic colonography, and colonoscopy in detecting of colon cancer."

Patients then undergo an air contrast barium\n      enema (ACBE). At 7-10 days after ACBE, patients undergo a computed tomographic colonography\n      (virtual colonoscopy) followed by a colonoscopy on the same day.\n\n      A repeat ACBE may be performed if there is a discrepancy between the initial ACBE and\n      colonoscopy. If the repeat ACBE continues to show an abnormality, patients undergo a second\n      colonoscopy.\n\n      Within 24 hours of completion of each test, patients fill out a questionnaire about their\n      experience. At 5-7 days after completion of all tests, patients complete a final\n      questionnaire comparing all 3 tests.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,133 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
