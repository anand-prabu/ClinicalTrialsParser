  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre is Canada's largest trauma centre, treating 1,100 patients
      annually. A traumatic experience can lead to post-traumatic stress disorder, which
      increases hospital stays, emergency visits and disability. Despite developing leadership to
      manage a &quot;Code Orange&quot; mass trauma, Sunnybrook lacks guidelines in the psychological
      management of patients who have experienced trauma. The department of psychiatry currently
      holds a Traumatic Brain Injury clinic and PTSD services for youth but lacks both immediate
      intervention, prevention and adult services. This research  will enable us to gain best
      evidence expertise to develop guidelines as well as a sustainable PTSD treatment program,
      with clear outcomes to assess effectiveness, psychiatric morbidity, use of healthcare,
      disability and substance abuse.

      The five world-expert-consensus intervention resilience based principles will be
      operationalized in guidelines for the management of trauma patients, their caregivers and in
      routine nursing and trauma team care from the Emergency to the ward, and discharge, through
      to outpatient care. It is hypothesized that this will improve the psychological recovery of
      patients at risk of developing PTSD after a traumatic injury. In addition, early screening
      and intervention for increased risk of PTSD will be implemented one month after the trauma.
      It is hypothesized that such trauma informed psychological management, early screening and
      expert treatment using prolonged exposure will reduce hospital stays, functional disability,
      as well as longer-term psychiatric morbidity, including substance abuse.

      The study is a longitudinal interventional study, with a control group who have treatment
      for their trauma with no guidelines for psychological management, staff training, patient
      and family intervention/education. In the intervention group, who will have all of the
      above, participants will be stratified according to risk factors for PTSD and randomized 1:1
      in &quot;low risk&quot; and &quot;at risk&quot; groups-those who will have a prolonged exposure intervention and
      those who will not.

    <description>The aim of the study is to observe whether there's a presence and severity (if applicable) of Posttraumatic symptoms in patients who've received the intervention, compared to those who have not.
Presence and severity of PTSD symptoms will be measured by:
follow-up at 1 month, 3 months &amp; 6 months which involve specific PTSD self-report symptom measures: PTSD Symptom Scale (PSS) and the Posttraumatic Cognitions Inventory (PTCI)
Structured Clinical Interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual for Mental Disorder (SCID) Semi-structured interview performed at 6 months either over the phone or in person</description>

    <description>PTSD is highly correlated with substance use. By implementing a preventative intervention, one aim is to reduce overall substance use. This will be assessed using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) and the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST) at recruitment, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months.</description>
