The investigators in this study will investigate the\n      effect of switching to a single tablet regimen (Eviplera\u00ae) containing tenofovir,\n      emtricitabine and rilpivirine.  If patients are currently taking Atripla, rilpivirine will\n      be the only new component of the combination.\n\n      Rilpivirine is a drug for HIV treatment, licensed for first-line treatment.  In combination\n      with Truvada\u00ae, it showed fewer side effects when compared to efavirenz in 2 other clinical\n      studies, where patients were starting HIV treatment for the first time.\n\n      This study will also investigate the safety (in terms of other side effects and the routine\n      blood tests which we ordinarily use to monitor your treatment) and monitor effectiveness,\n      your viral load and CD4 counts, when you switch treatment to\n      tenofovir/emtricitabine/rilpivirine."
