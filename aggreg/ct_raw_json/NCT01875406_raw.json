The goal\n      is to test these 3 tests and compare their predictive value to the 6 tests commonly reported\n      in the literature in order to provide a clinician with clinically practical special tests to\n      aide in the diagnosis and treatment of SIJ mediated pain. Specifically, the investigators\n      seek to evaluate the prognostic capacity for a series of three clinical tests (Mekhail's\n      Test, thigh thrust and Patrick's Test) combined with a pain referral diagram to accurately\n      predict the response (change in VAS) of a single diagnostic Sacroiliac joint and\n      extra-capsular joint injection."
