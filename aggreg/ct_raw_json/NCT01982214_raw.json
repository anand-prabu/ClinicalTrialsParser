The group 1 received a physical intervention,\n      consisting of whole body vibration (WBV) over 12 months followed by training arrest during 6\n      months. The group 2 served as sedentary control. WBV training is performed 2 or 3 times per\n      week, with each session lasting 20 minutes. The training included light squats at 35-50Hz\n      and ended up by stretching and relaxation exercises at 50Hz. Bone, muscle and postural\n      evaluations will be performed at the beginning, 6, 12 and 18 months in each group with\n      evaluation of bone micro-architectural trabecular and cortical compartments, at the weight\n      bearing tibia and the non weight bearing radius.\n\n      The primary outcome of the project is the pre, mid, and post evaluations of bone. Bone\n      exploration included DXA and high resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography\n      (HR-pQCT, Xtreme CT, Scanco Medical). BMD will be evaluated by DXA at lumbar, femoral levels\n      and humeral, macro and micro-architectures of the cortical and trabecular compartments will\n      be evaluated in distal radius and tibia by HR-pQCT and bone markers will be analyzed\n      longitudinally. The secondary aim is to assess muscle performance and proprioception.\n      Finally will be assessed markers of cartilage degradation and synthesis, no study has been\n      published on this tissue."
