Although it remains\n      uncertain if DPS is efficacious for the ALS subject, given the preliminary studies performed\n      by the device manufacturer, it has received FDA humanitarian device exemption (HDE) approval\n      as a humanitarian use device (HUD).  This study will utilize a 2:1 randomization schedule\n      such that eligible ALS subjects will have a 2/3 chance of receiving DPS and 1/3 chance of\n      standard of care (control) treatment.\n\n      The NeuRx\u00ae Diaphragm Pacing System\u2122 (DPS) is a four channel, implanted percutaneous\n      diaphragm muscle stimulation system. Under general anesthesia, the intramuscular electrodes\n      are laparoscopically implanted in the diaphragm. The ends of the implanted electrodes are\n      tunneled subcutaneously to an exit site on the chest or abdominal wall and connected to an\n      external stimulator."
