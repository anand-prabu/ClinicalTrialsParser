            "textblock": "Rationale\n\n      It has been shown in several studies that alcohol increases subsequent food intake. However,\n      moderate alcohol consumption has no clear effects on hunger and satiety hormones. In the\n      Western world, where palatable food is highly available, food reward may play an important\n      role in food intake. Alcohol consumption is known to stimulate neurotransmitters important\n      for food reward and may therefore stimulate the reward response on a subsequent meal. This\n      may lead to higher food consumption than when no alcohol is consumed. It is hypothesized\n      that the reward response of food or beverages can already be generated when food or\n      beverages are sensed in the mouth, because oral nutrient sensing is known to induce a\n      satiety response (i.e. the cephalic phase response). Moreover, taste buds directly signal\n      brain areas closely connected to the reward areas in the brain.\n\n      Primary objective\n\n        -  To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption influences subsequent food reward, as\n           measured by questionnaires on food 'wanting' and food 'liking', and salivary and blood\n           parameters related to reward.\n\n      Secondary objectives\n\n        -  To determine whether food reward is different when food is consumed than when food is\n           sensed in the mouth, as measured by questionnaires on food 'wanting' and food 'liking',\n           and salivary and blood parameters related to food reward.\n\n        -  To determine whether moderate alcohol consumption influences subsequent food reward\n           differently when food is consumed than when food is sensed in the mouth, as measured by\n           questionnaires on food 'wanting' and food 'liking', and salivary and blood parameters\n           related to food reward."
