Patient eligibility based on ocular inclusion\n      criteria will be evaluated using measures of vision, fundus photography, OCT imaging, and\n      macular integrity (MAIA) performed during the qualifying period. Fundus images and MAIA\n      results will be sent to a coordinating centre where these will be reviewed to confirm\n      eligibility based on lesion attributes and the criteria specified in the protocol. Following\n      confirmation of eligibility by the coordinating centre, participants whom satisfy all the\n      inclusion and exclusion criteria can be randomized. Allocation to treatment group will be\n      stratified by smoking status. All participants will receive either active laser treatment or\n      sham laser procedure at the treatment visit and be assessed for retreatment on a semi-annual\n      basis. All participants will be contacted by telephone at 1 week and present for clinical\n      examination visits at 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30 and 36 months."
