The medical, psychological and social follow-up consists of\n      multidisciplinary consultation at time of ICU discharge (i.e. inclusion), at three, six and\n      12 months afterward. Patients of the \"non follow-up group\" will be seen only at one year.\n      Medical consultation will be focused on evaluation of pre-existing co-morbidities, detection\n      of new ones and of physical disorders related to critical illness (i.e. ICU-acquired\n      paresis, pain, functional disability, cognitive dysfunction\u2026). Psychological assessment will\n      be focused on detection of anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress syndrome. Social\n      follow-up will assess the social need of the patient in the professional and private\n      domains. Each assessment will be standardized by using validated or appropriate scores. At\n      the end of each multidisciplinary consultation, a report will be sent to the patient and his\n      general practitioner. When necessary, a consultation with a specialist will be organized. At\n      one year, an observer blinded from randomization will call all the patients to assess their\n      quality of life with help of EQ5D questionnaire. Economical cost of multidisciplinary\n      follow-up will be assessed.\n\n      To our knowledge, there is no follow-up studies that have combined a medical, psychological\n      and social cares. For instance, the PracTical study has not evidenced an improvement of\n      quality of life in patients who had beneficiated from nurse consultations at 3 and 9 months."
