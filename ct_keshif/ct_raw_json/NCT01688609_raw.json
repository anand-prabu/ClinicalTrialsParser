Lapatinib ditosylate\n      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.\n      Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, can block tumor growth in different ways. Some\n      block the ability of tumor to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help kill them or\n      carry cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel,\n      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by\n      stopping them from dividing."

To determine the pathological complete response (pCR) rate produced by lapatinib\n      (lapatinib ditosylate) + trastuzumab followed by concurrent preoperative lapatinib,\n      trastuzumab, and paclitaxel chemotherapy for operable human epidermal growth factor receptor\n      2-positive (HER2+) breast cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I.

To assess the safety and tolerability of study therapy in Japanese women.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Drug exposure: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate orally (PO) once daily (QD) and\n      trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes once weekly for 6 weeks in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Preoperative therapy: Patients receive lapatinib ditosylate PO QD, trastuzumab IV over 30\n      minutes once weekly, and paclitaxel IV over 90 minutes once weekly for 12 weeks in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
