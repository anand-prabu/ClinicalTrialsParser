A secondary\n      objective is to compare the efficacy of topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops compared with topical\n      methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops in patients with ocular GVHD. 40 patients\n      with ocular GVHD who meet the inclusion criteria of the study as determined by a screening\n      visit will be divided into two equal groups. In addition to their current medication, one\n      group will receive the topical tacrolimus 0.05% drops and the other group will receive the\n      topical methylprednisolone sodium succinate 0.5% drops. The participants will then have two\n      follow-up visits at the week 5 and week 10 markers after their screening visit.\n\n      To evaluate the purpose of the study as well as the patient's safety, the following\n      procedures will be performed at each visit: a comprehensive eye examination, tear break-up\n      time (TBUT), Schirmer's test, intraocular pressure (IOP), fundoscopy and grading scores of\n      lid margin and corneal fluorescein staining. The following questionnaires will be\n      administered at each visit: Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) and Symptom Assessment in\n      Dry Eye (SANDE). Impression cytology specimens will be taken only at the screening visit and\n      at the week 10 visit."
