    <textblock>
      In Russia the treatment nonhealing skin defects often limited to surgical interventions,
      despite having developed modern methods of treatment of non-healing ulcers and other skin
      imperfections. During the many years of research we have developed a skin equivalent
      comprising living cells.

      During pilot trial showed that the skin equivalent provides healing skin defect within 1-4
      weeks in 95% of patients.
