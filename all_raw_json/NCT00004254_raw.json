Determine the objective response rate and\n      duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Within 2 weeks of staging procedures, patients receive\n      raltitrexed IV over 15 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8\n      courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients are\n      followed every 6 weeks until disease progression and then every 8 weeks thereafter for\n      survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 24 patients will be accrued for this study."
