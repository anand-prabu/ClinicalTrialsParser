The first portion of the study is a dose escalation phase where\n      cohorts of patients will receive ascending oral doses of AG-221 to determine maximum\n      tolerated dose (MTD) and/or the recommended Phase II dose.  The second portion of the study\n      is a dose expansion phase where three cohorts of patients will receive AG-221 to further\n      evaluate the safety, tolerability, and clinical activity of the MTD.  Anticipated time on\n      study treatment is until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity occurs."
