Participants will be\n      randomized by sex and BMI  The primary aim is to compare the effect of daily vitamin D3\n      (cholecalciferol, 5000 IU) vs. placebo for 6 mo on insulin sensitivity (M-value by the gold\n      standard method, the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp). Secondary aims are to evaluate the\n      effects of vitamin D3 vs. placebo on other indices of glucose metabolism, the lipid profile,\n      blood pressure and anthropometric measurements. Questionnaires on physical activity and\n      sunlight exposure, and a food frequency questionnaire will be administered at 0 and 6 mo to\n      adjust for confounding factors. At 0 and 6 mo, biochemical markers associated with insulin\n      sensitivity will be measured : changes in serum 25(OH)D with changes in blood markers\n      associated with insulin sensitivity [hs-CRP, inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha),\n      adiponectin, leptin, total and undercarboxylated osteocalcin].\n\n      This research project intends to test 2 major hypotheses: (1) that vitamin D deficiency\n      plays a causal role in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance in humans; and (2) that\n      vitamin D increases insulin sensitivity."
