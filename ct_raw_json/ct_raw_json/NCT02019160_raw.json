Approximately 2,100 kindergarten children will be screened and at least\n           714 children with caries will be recruited. This sample size is sufficient for an\n           appropriate statistical analysis (power at 80% [\u03b2=0.20] with a 2-sided type-I error of\n           \u03b1=0.05), allowing for a 10% drop-out rate. The children will be randomly allocated into\n           2 groups to treat their caries over a 30-month period:   Group A - biannual application\n           of a 25% AgNO3 solution followed by a 5% NaF varnish, and Group B - biannual\n           application of a 38% SDF solution followed by a placebo varnish.Clinical examinations\n           will be conducted at 6-month intervals to assess whether the caries are arrested.\n           Information on confounding factors such as oral hygiene habits will be collected\n           through a parental questionnaire.\n\n        -  Possible results and implications: As the first of its kind, this study would help to\n           determine whether AgNO3 followed by NaF is at least as effective as SDF in arresting\n           childhood caries. If so, because 25% AgNO3 and 5% NaF contain less silver and fluoride,\n           respectively, than 38% SDF, their use would be more favourable than SDF in young\n           children."
