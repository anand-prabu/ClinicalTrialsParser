  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase IV prospective, observational study will evaluate patients, who have
      been diagnosed with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration and have previously
      received either a standard intravitreal injection of ranibizumab or aflibercept, in order to
      get and compare information regarding post-injection inflammatory (irritation in the eye)2-3
      days post-injection.

      Additionally, patients will be evaluated for visual acuity and pain 2-3 days post-injection.

      Patients, age 65 to 90, with Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration who present for
      treatment with intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept will be selected in this study.  300
      subjects from one site in the United States will be enrolled.

        -  Ability to provide written informed consent and comply with study

        -  Age 65-90 years

        -  Diagnosis of Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration who present for treatment
           with intravitreal ranibizumab or aflibercept

      Exclusion Criteria:

        -  Previous intraocular inflammation

        -  Treatment with systemic anti-inflammatory agents

        -  Known systemic autoimmune diseases

        -  Treatment with intraocular steroids in the past 3 months
