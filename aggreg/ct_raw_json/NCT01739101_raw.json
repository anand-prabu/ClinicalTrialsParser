The aim of our study was to investigate if\n      the usage of the Reproductive Life Plan in midwifery counselling increases women's knowledge\n      of reproduction and particularly knowledge of folic acid intake prior to pregnancy.\n      Secondary aims were to evaluate the influence on women's family planning and to further\n      explore how women experienced the Reproductive Life Plan-based counselling."
