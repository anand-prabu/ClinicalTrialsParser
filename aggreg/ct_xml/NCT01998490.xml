  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall research aim of this study is to investigate changes in measures related to the
      risk of falls among elderly with dementia participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted
      interventions. In addition the study will investigate how knowledge transfer occurs among
      involved health personnel, and how knowledge is refined and transformed as practical
      competence. The design will be a prospective and cluster randomized multicenter trial, but
      mixed-methods will be used to target different outcomes. The study population will be
      elderly (age above 65) at nursing homes diagnosed with dementia, or having a cognitive
      deficit. The intervention will consist of 30 minutes sessions with animal-assisted activity
      or robot-assisted activity two times a week for 12 weeks in groups of 4-6 participants.
      Control groups will receive treatment as usual. Research questions:

        1. Is there an effect in use of ordinary and optional medication among elderly persons
           with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted
           interventions compared to a control group?

        2. Is there an effect on agitation, restlessness and depression among elderly persons with
           dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or robot-assisted
           interventions compared to a control group?

        3. Is there an effect on social interaction, activeness and wellbeing among elderly
           persons with dementia at nursing homes participating in animal-assisted or
           robot-assisted interventions compared to a control group?
