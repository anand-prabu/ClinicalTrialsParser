  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, single-center, randomized trial, intended to compare three revascularization
      strategies in patients with multi-vessel coronary artery disease:

        1. Hybrid approach (Minimally invasive off-pump revascularization of the left anterior
           descending artery (LAD) with left internal mammary artery (LIMA) bypass followed by
           consecutive percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in the rest of the arteries with
           drug eluting stents (DES) (Hybrid group, n=50)

        2. Multi-vessel PCI with DES (MV-PCI group, n=50)

        3. Coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) treatment (CABG group, n=50)

      PCI in Hybrid and MV-PCI group will be performed with the same 2nd generation clinically
      proven DES (Xience V, Xience Prime).

      Study objective Compare three different revascularization strategies in patients with
      multi-vessel coronary disease

      The endpoints: The primary endpoints will be death, MI, stroke, or new myocardial ischemia
      and  will be TVR and non-TVR at 30 days, 12 months and 5-year follow-up.

      The secondary endpoints: Procedural success, Procedural and post-procedural blood loss and
      number of transfusions, Recovery time, Heart Failure (New York Heart Association (NYHA)),
      life quality assessed by one of the life quality questionnaires
