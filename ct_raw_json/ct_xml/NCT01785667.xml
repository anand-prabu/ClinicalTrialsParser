  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to clarify the current diabetic status, including development
      of complications, in a nationwide cohort of type 1 diabetics, who were last examined
      together in a large study in 1995. These youngsters were originally participating in a
      nationwide study of children with type 1 diabetes in Denmark back in 1986. The investigators
      will try to establish risk factors for developing diabetic retinopathy. The investigators
      will have emphasis on retinal vessel geometry and the possibilities for early detection of
      reversible retinal changes, and prediction of other vascular complications.

    <description>Using the ETDRS grading protocol the degree of retinopathy in 2011 will be assessed by grading 7-field fundus photographs taken at follow-up examination. This will be related to the degree of retinopathy found in the patients in 1995, where the last study of the cohort took place.</description>

        This study includes a cohort of type 1 diabetic patients, who originally were identified
        in 21 paediatric departments and studied in 1986. This group initially consisted of 1033
        children and was estimated to involve around 80 percent of all Danish type 1 diabetic
        patients below the age of 18. In 1995 further examinations were performed on the cohort;
        this time 339 chose to participate.

        In this study we will invite the participants from 1995 who also participated in the eye
        examinations, n=324, to participate in yet another follow-up examination.
