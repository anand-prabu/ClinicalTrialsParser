As such,\n      RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers are recommended as first line combination treatment\n      for hypertension. However, the mechanism for the superior efficacy of RAS inhibitors/calcium\n      channel blockers are not well defined. This study will compare the efficacy of RAS\n      inhibitors/calcium channel blockers vs RAS inhibitors/diuretics in terms of glucose\n      tolerance and insulin resistance in hypertensive patients with metabolic syndrome. The\n      primary endpoint will be that RAS inhibitors/calcium channel blockers will be more\n      efficacious in reducing 2hour post prandial glucose compared to RAS inhibitors/diuretics."
