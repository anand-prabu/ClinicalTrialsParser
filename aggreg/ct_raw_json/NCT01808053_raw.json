Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a growing\n      health epidemic and is associated with significant morbidity, mortality and cost. Mayo\n      Clinic and Preventice have developed a non-invasive, minimally obtrusive, interactive remote\n      monitoring platform.  It enables on-body monitoring and integration of ECG, heart rate,\n      breathing, and activity, with measures of weight and blood pressure.  It is designed as a\n      platform for physician directed patient self-management. This technology may be useful in\n      monitoring CHF patients. Our overall objective is to adapt, refine, test and validate this\n      technology in subjects in an independent living center, with wireless transmission of data\n      to a central data analysis hub."

It can wirelessly communicate with off-body sensors such as a BP cuff and scale to incorporate BP and weight data based on automated algorithms and can solicit symptoms from the user.  It can also be used as an event recorder inputting symptoms and recording simultaneous physiologic data.",
