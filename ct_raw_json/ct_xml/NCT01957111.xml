  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Individuals with insomnia have been shown to have higher overall metabolic rates compared to
      good sleepers, but it is not known which metabolic processes are involved.  The goal of this
      study is to compare a wide array of metabolic processes in 15 people with insomnia and 15
      good sleepers. We hypothesize that there will be distinct metabolic processes that are
      functioning differently in those with insomnia.

    <description>Metabolomics analysis of blood samples will be carried out using NMR Spectroscopy. This approach allows for rapid, unbiased and quantitative metabolic profiles ('fingerprints) to be acquired.  Metabolite profiles of individuals with insomnia will be compared to those of good sleepers.</description>
