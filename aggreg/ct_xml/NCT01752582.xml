      The objective of this study is a comparative evaluation of BuMA stent and of EXCEL stent in
      terms of the extent of neointima formation at 3 months after implantation using OCT.

      This is a prospective, single center, randomized, open-label, non-inferiority study, which
      will enroll a total of 70 patients in Fuwai Hospital.All patients will be randomly assigned
      undergoing implantation of BuMA stent or EXCEL stent (in a 1:1 ratio). If non-inferiority
      was met, superiority test will be planned.

    <textblock>
      About 70 patients with clinical evidence of ischemic heart disease and / or a positive
      functional study and documented stable angina pectoris (Canadian cardiovascular society
      classification (CCS)1, 2, 3 or 4), or documented silent ischemia in de-novo, native,
      previously unstented vessel in Fuwai Hospital,will be randomly assigned undergoing
      implantation of BuMA stent or EXCEL stent (in a 1:1 ratio).

      All of the patients will receive 6 months dual antiplatelet therapy and they will be
      followed (at the outpatient clinic) for up to 2 years. The follow-up visits will be
      conducted at 3 months (including angiographic/OCT investigation), 6 months, 1 and 2 years
      post percutaneous coronary intervention(PCI),in order to observe the Primary Endpoint and
      Secondary Endpoints.

             contraceptives

        OCT exclusion criteria

          -  Severe tortuous, calcified or angulated coronary anatomy of the study vessel that in
             the opinion of the investigator would result in suboptimal imaging or excessive risk
             of complication from placement of an OCT catheter

          -  Total occlusion or thrombolysis in myocardial infarction(TIMI) flow 0, prior to wire
             crossing.
