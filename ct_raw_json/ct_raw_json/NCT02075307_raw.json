These disturbances include one or more\n      symptoms of a condition called \"metabolic syndrome\" that often leads to diabetes. High\n      levels of damage to the DNA that makes up our chromosomes have also been observed in obese\n      people. It is possible that these two disturbances are connected. The goal of this project\n      is to test this whether consumption of blueberries will improve these abnormalities."

Insulin resistance and high levels of DNA damage\n      commonly accompany obesity. There also appears to be a relationship between oxidative\n      DNA-damage and biomarkers that characterize metabolic syndrome. The bioactivity of\n      blueberries is usually attributed to their high content of polyphenolics which can reduce\n      oxidative DNA damage. Since oxidative damage to mitochondrial DNA is a suggested causal\n      factor leading to increased insulin resistance, we will test if blueberry consumption can be\n      an ameliorative dietary factor for insulin resistance as well. If blueberry consumption both\n      shifts metabolism away from insulin resistance and reduces DNA damage, it may be a useful\n      tool to assist in understanding relationships between these two obesity-associated\n      conditions."
