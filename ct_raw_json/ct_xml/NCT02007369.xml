  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      According to the Census &amp; Statistics Department, there are still 659,300 daily smokers
      (11.1%) in Hong Kong. Smoking is addictive, and it is difficult for some motivated smokers
      to quit without assistance. About 33.2% daily smokers in Hong Kong had tried quitting but
      they could not maintain abstinence. Relapse prevention is aimed at providing interventions
      to prevent relapse after starting the abstinence status. This pilot single-blind randomized
      controlled trial (proof of concept study) will test the effectiveness of social networking
      services for relapse prevention.  The study will first recruit 6 quitters and 6 relapsers
      for a qualitative interview for the design of intervention. Then, the pilot-RCT trial will
      recruit 120 participants who have recently quitted smoking, and they will be randomly
      allocated to 2 intervention groups and one control group. The 2 intervention groups will be
      arranged to join a WhatsApp or Facebook group for receiving quitting advices from the group
      moderators and sharing quitting experience with other participants. All participants will
      receive a self-help booklet of relapse prevention, and will be followed up at 6 weeks, 3
      months and 6 months. The primary outcome is the self-report relapse rate (Relapse is
      tentatively defined as smoking 5 cigarettes in 3 consecutive days since joining the RCT
      among the 3 study arms.

    <description>Intervention arm with relapse prevention intervention in the social group via the social networking service WhatsApp. In order to sustain the abstinence among the participants in the social groups, the intervention content is about (1) Encourage to maintain abstinence; (2) Importance of remaining abstinence; (3) Prevent smoking triggers; (4) Withdrawal symptoms &amp; lapse; (5) Stress and mood management; (6) weight control. In addition to the information delivered by the moderators, the moderators will encourage other participants to support each other and discuss certain topics related to smoking and quitting. Also, moderators of the social groups will send messages of brief advice, give feedback to participants' enquiries and facilitate conversations in the platform.  We propose the moderator to spend about 1 to 2 hours a day in total for the social group conversation in a flexible time schedule, and the duration of the intervention will be 6 weeks.</description>
