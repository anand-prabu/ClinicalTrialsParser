  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal with this study is to document whether patients can maintain their normal
      bowel microbiota by staying at home compared to being in the hospital. In addition, the
      investigators would predict that the quality of life will be higher for those patients
      treated at the medical home compared to those that stay at the hospital. The investigators
      also predict that the costs associated with this approach will be significantly lower
      compared to hospitalized patients. Finally, the investigators propose that the treatment
      related morbidities and mortality will not be different between the two groups.

      Subjects enrolled in the medical home arm and those serving as concurrent controls will have
      the following studies:

        1. Stool collection for analysis at time 0 (prior to preparatory regimen) and then weekly
           for the first four weeks, at day 60 and 100.

        2. The PG-SGA, FACT-BMT and other patient-reported symptom instruments will be collected
           weekly for the first 4 weeks, at day 60, 100 and patients will be required to complete
           a daily food diary.

        3. Other assessments for toxicities or GVHD will proceed as per current standard of care,
           for a total blood draw amount of 100 mls from home care subjects and concurrent
           controls.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Scheduled to undergo a hematopoietic stem cell transplant for any cancer or
             non-cancer illness from any autologous, related or unrelated donor source including
             bone marrow, peripheral blood progenitor cell, or umbilical cord blood

          2. Age 18-80 years of age

          3. Karnofsky Performance Scale (KPS) &gt; 80

          4. A home that is deemed, upon inspection, in suitable condition to serve as a medical
             home, within a 90-minute driving distance of Duke (home care group only)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Lack of a caregiver

          2. Pregnant women (It is standard of care to assess for pregnancy for all females of
             child-bearing potential with a serum beta human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) test
             within 7 days of starting the preparative regimen prior to transplant.  No additional
             research pregnancy testing will occur.)

          3. Patients with a documented active infection prior to starting their preparative
             regimen.  This includes grade 3 or higher viral, bacterial, or fungal infection.
