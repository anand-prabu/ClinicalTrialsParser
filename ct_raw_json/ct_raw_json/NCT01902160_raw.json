Temsirolimus may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes\n      needed for cell growth. Biological therapies, such as brentuximab vedotin, may stimulate the\n      immune system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Giving temsirolimus with\n      brentuximab vedotin may be an effective treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma."

Determine the overall response rate (ORR) to the combination of brentuximab vedotin and\n      temsirolimus in relapsed and refractory Hodgkin lymphoma.\n\n      II. Evaluate the role of inflammatory markers, such as interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1, tumor\n      necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1), and IL-10, as early predictors of treatment response.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of temsirolimus.\n\n      Patients receive temsirolimus intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on days 1 and 8 or days\n      1, 8, and 15 and brentuximab vedotin IV over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21\n      days for up to 16 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks."
