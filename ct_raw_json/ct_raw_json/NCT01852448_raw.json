            "textblock": "CFRD is associated with worse nutritional status, greater pulmonary function decline, and\n      increased mortality, highlighting its relevance in CF and arises primarily from compromised\n      insulin secretion--traditionally considered a by-product of pancreatic exocrine tissue\n      damage and fibrosis.  Recent developments in the field of diabetes are propelling a\n      re-examination of this basic explanation.  Genome-wide association studies have associated\n      genetic variants in TCF7L2, a transcription factor implicated in enteroendocrine function,\n      with increased susceptibility to T2DM and CFRD.\n\n      The Objectives of this study are to perform targeted sequencing of TCF7L2 and other\n      GWAS-associated T2DM genes in the pediatric and adult CF populations and then to compare\n      insulin secretory capacity, \u03b2-cell sensitivity to glucose, and incretin secretion in\n      non-diabetic CF subjects with high and low-risk alleles.\n\n      Phase 1 will include 350 subjects (Children age>= 2 years, adolescents, and adults) for\n      TCF7L2 genotype and ten other GWAS-implicated T2DM genes.  The distribution of TCF7L2 and\n      other GWAS-implicated T2 DM genes across the spectrum of glucose abnormalities will be\n      described. Phase 1 requires a single blood sample and review of medical records.\n\n      Phase 2 will include a subset of 30 non-diabetic children (age >8) and adults who will have\n      insulin and incretin secretion studies performed to look at how the body secretes insulin\n      and other hormones in relation to having or not having these \"diabetes\" genes. These studies\n      include Glucose Potentiated Arginine Tests (GPA, which measures \u03b2-cell secretory capacity\n      and sensitivity to glucose) and Mixed Meal Tolerance Test (MMTT, which measures incretin and\n      insulin secretion)."
