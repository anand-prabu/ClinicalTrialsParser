    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to document the immunogenicity and safety of a booster dose of
      IMOJEV®  administered 12 months after the primary dose.

      Primary objective:

        -  To describe the immune response to Japanese Encephalitis (JE) before (Day 0) and 28
           days (Day 28) after a booster dose of IMOJEV® administered at least 1 year after
           primary vaccination with IMOJEV®.

      Exploratory objectives:

        -  To test the non-inferiority of IMOJEV® versus previous data obtained in the JEC15 study
           (NCT01190228) with the same product in terms of seroprotection rate 28 days after
           booster vaccination.

        -  To describe the safety profile of a booster dose of IMOJEV® .

      All participants who previously participated in Study JEC12 (NCT 01396512) and were primed
      with IMOJEV® vaccine will receive a single booster dose of IMOJEV® vaccine 12 months after
      the primary dose. They will be assessed for immune response before and on Day 28 after the
      booster dose and will be monitored for safety through Day 28.

      The duration of each participant's participation in the study will be approximately 6
      months.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Must have participated in study JEC12 and received 1 dose of IMOJEV® at least 12
             months before booster vaccination

          -  Age 2 to 4 years on the day of inclusion

          -  In good general health at the time of inclusion
