            "textblock": "Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in non-Hispanic\n      white Americans. Neovascular AMD is an advanced form of macular degeneration that\n      historically has accounted for the majority of vision loss related to AMD. The presence of\n      choroidal neovascular membrane (CNV) formation is the hallmark feature of neovascular AMD.\n      Choroidal neovascular membranes consist of buds of neovascular tissue and accompanying\n      fibroblasts from the choroid perforating Bruch's membrane with extension either above or\n      below the retinal pigment epithelium.  These neovascular complexes are associated with\n      hemorrhage, fluid exudation and fibrosis formation resulting in photoreceptor damage and\n      vision loss. Treatment of neovascular AMD consists of injecting inhibitors of vascular\n      endothelial growth factor (VEGF) into the vitreous cavity to interfere with proliferation of\n      choroidal neovascularization and to reduce vascular permeability.\n\n      OCT is an imaging technology that can perform non-contact cross-sectional imaging of retinal\n      and choroidal tissue structure in real time.  It is analogous to ultrasound B-mode imaging,\n      except that OCT measures the intensity of reflected light rather than acoustical waves.\n\n      This observational study will use OCT technology to study and compare the retinal and\n      choroidal anatomy and blood flow in two groups of patients with neovascular AMD:  treatment\n      na\u00efve group and active treatment group.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the utility of OCT angiography in the evaluation of\n      NVAMD."
