    <textblock>
      Tuberculosis (TB) remains an important infectious disease worldwide. Taiwan is still an
      edemic area. In 2008, there is an incidence of 62 persons having TB per 100,000 population.
      To control TB, we should prevent further TB transmission via early diagnosis and treatment
      of latent TB. In screening the risk population for TB, patients with renal failure acquiring
      long-term dialysis, in addition to close contacts, have higher incidence and mortality than
      general population. Moreover, the risk for active TB in dialysis patients is ten to 25 times
      larger. In Taiwan, the dialysis group is important because it has higher prevalence (2228
      per in per million people by 2009 annual report of United States Renal Data System) than
      other countries in the world. In particular, the dialysis patients usually has an
      extrapulmonary presentation for their TB, so diagnosis is always delay. Hence, we should
      detect latent TB in those dialysis patients for monitor them from active tuberculosis.

      Currently, interferon-gamma release assays (IGRAs) are used for finding out those with
      latent TB and have been proven useful for those being immunocompromised, and having BCG
      vaccination. For dialysis patients, IGRAs have been tested and been considered better than
      skin tuberculin test. However, previous studied rarely observed the patients receiving
      peritoneal dialysis and severe chronic kidney disease. Besides, those cross-sectional
      studies used the indirect evidence for diagnosis and lacked longitudinal follow-up. We thus
      conducted this study for observing the prevalence of latent TB in those receiving
      hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis by using IGRAs. We also kept  follow-up for the primary
      outcome of active TB occurrence.
