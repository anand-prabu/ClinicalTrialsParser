We have proved in former studies that DiaPep277\u00ae can slow down\n      beta cells destruction in the pancreas and therefore decelerate the progress of Diabetes.\n\n      The objective of the study is to assess the efficacy and safety of administrating DiaPep277\u00ae\n      in type 1 diabetes patients."
