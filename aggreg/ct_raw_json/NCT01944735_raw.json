For each dose level, blood samples will be collected\n      for exploratory PK and PD assay validation. In addition, sputum will be collected for\n      exploratory biomarker analysis. Following multiple dose administration, pulmonary function\n      and exploratory lung clearance index (LCI) measurements will be taken."

In the judgment of the Principal Investigator (PI), the patient is medically stable\n             with no change in symptoms, medication, or with clinical laboratory results that in\n             PI opinion are compatible with the diagnosis of either CF or a complication thereof\n             and are judged acceptable for inclusion.\n\n          4.

Has a history of lung transplantation.\n\n          4. History or presence of alcoholism or drug abuse within 2 years prior to the first\n             study drug administration.\n\n          5. Personal or family history of prolonged QT syndrome; or a QTc interval >430 msec\n             (males) or >450 msec (females) using Bazett's formula (QTcB) or deemed clinically\n             significant by the PI.\n\n          6. Sitting blood pressure is less than 90/40 mmHg or greater than 140/90 mmHg, unless\n             deemed clinically insignificant by the PI.\n\n          7.
