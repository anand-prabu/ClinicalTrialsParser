            "description": "There are times when a filter needs to be placed in the IVC(inferior vena cava) to help prevent blood clots from traveling from the lower part of the body to the lungs. Some reasons a filter may be necessary are; for patients who have had a pelvic fracture, or have blood clots in the leg or legs. Sometimes a filter placement is ordered when a patient is scheduled for major surgery that will require the patient to be on bed rest for a long period of time. There have been instances where a filter has migrated (moved) from where it was placed to another portion of the IVC(inferior vena cava). We believe that one of the reasons that they can move is because the diameter of the IVC(inferior vena cava) changes and becomes bigger when a patient changes positions."

The filter is\n      placed to prevent blood clots from traveling into the lungs. The filters are placed during a\n      interventional radiology procedure. During the procedure the diameter of the IVC(inferior\n      vena cava)is measured with the patient in a horizontal position (laying down). The blood\n      pressure in the IVC when a patient is in this position is relatively low in normal\n      circumstances, but may increase substantially when the patient is vertical with secondary\n      dilation of the IVC(inferior vena cava).\n\n      Migration of IVC(inferior vena cava)filters is not frequent; however it is a serious\n      complication, which may be caused by changes in the diameter of the IVC(inferior vena\n      cava)related to changes in the position of the body and/or increased pressure in the\n      abdomen.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to evaluate how much postural changes of the body affect the\n      diameter of the IVC(inferior vena cava).\n\n      For research purposes patients will have an intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) performed to\n      measure the IVC diameter before and after a Valsalva maneuver (having the subject hold their\n      breath and bear down as if they were having a bowel movement). The angiographic table will\n      be elevated and the measurements will be repeated."
