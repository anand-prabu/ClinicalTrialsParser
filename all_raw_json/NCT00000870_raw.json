The comparison is based on the following:\n      proportion of patients achieving at least 50-percent increase in CD4 counts above\n      prerandomization baseline values after 1 year of rhIL-2 and the rate of change in CD4\n      counts.  To compare the safety and tolerance of these regimens and their effect on quality\n      of life. To assess the effects of rhIL-2 when combined with HAART on changes in immune cell\n      phenotypes and function and on HIV viral load and the rate of antiviral drug resistance\n      development.\n\n      The poor responsiveness of late stage HIV-infected patients to rhIL-2 is thought to occur\n      because of low T cell regenerative capacity and high viral burden. If means were available\n      to effectively suppress virus replication, the indigenous immune restorative responses of\n      the host may be further stimulated and enhanced by rhIL-2. The use of protease inhibitors\n      with nucleoside-analogue combination regimens appears to be most effective in controlling\n      virus replication.

High-dose intermittent rhIL-2 administered either intravenously or\n      subcutaneously has been shown to be effective in inducing CD4 responses in a number of\n      studies.\n\n      All patients receive HAART consisting of two nucleoside analogues (at least one of which is\n      new to the patient) and the protease inhibitor indinavir for 12 weeks. At Week 10, an HIV\n      RNA is done. Patients with more than 5,000 copies/ml are taken off the study. Patients with\n      5,000 copies/ml or less continue on the study and are stratified by their antiretroviral\n      combination, and randomized to one of three treatment arms.

Patients on Arm III continue HAART plus subcutaneous rhIL-2 for an\n      additional 72 weeks (9 courses). [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/31/97: When protocol ACTG 928 is\n      activated, patients randomized on ACTG 328 are stratified based on whether or not they have\n      registered on ACTG 928.] [AS PER AMENDMENT 10/30/98: For the 4 weeks immediately prior to\n      randomization, patients must receive continuous HAART therapy. Exceptions may be made by the\n      protocol chair for short (i.e., less than 48 hours) interruptions of antiretroviral therapy\n      during this period. Also per this amendment, two substudies have been added: A5033s and\n      A5046s.
