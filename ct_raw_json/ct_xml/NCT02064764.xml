  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical study is to evaluate the feasibility of performing both renal
      nerve denervation and pulmonary vein isolation on the same patient with the intent of
      characterizing both safety and effectiveness in a paroxysmal atrial fibrillation population
      with hypertension.  To assess safety, the study will measure the occurrence of a composite
      safety endpoint and, to assess effectiveness, the study will measure freedom of chronic
      treatment failure through a minimum of six months of follow-up.

    <description>The objective characterizes the rate of safety composite events, adjudicated as a serious adverse event, within each of the two study arms and also characterizes the difference in the rates between study arms.  Each event in the composite has its own time frame, either one month or six months post procedure.</description>

    <description>Chronic treatment success is freedom from chronic treatment failure.  Chronic treatment failure is defined as the occurrence of either a documented episode of AF lasting 30 seconds or longer or an intervention for AF.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Drug refractory recurrent symptomatic paroxysmal atrial fibrillation.  Drug
             refractory is defined as:  failed (drug is ineffective or patient is intolerant) at
             least one Class I or III anti-arrhythmic drug.

          -  Office-based systolic blood pressure of ≥150 mm Hg based on average of three blood
             pressure readings despite treatment with 2 or more antihypertensive medications of
             different classes (one of these must be a diuretic) at highest labeled dose according
             to the medication's labeling, highest usual dose per clinical guidelines (i.e., JNC-7
             Guidelines), highest tolerated dose or highest appropriate dose for the subject per
             the Principal Investigator's best clinical judgment.

          -  Ambulatory Blood Pressure Monitoring 24 hour average systolic blood pressure ≥135
             mmHg.

          -  Age 18 years to 80 years old.

          -  Willing to give informed consent and agree to all study procedures, and is competent
             and willing to provide written, informed consent to participate in this clinical
             study.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Active systemic infection

          -  Condition where manipulation of the catheter within the heart would be unsafe (e.g.
             intracardiac mural thrombus).

          -  Cryoglobulinemia

          -  One or more pulmonary vein stents

          -  Renal artery anatomy that is ineligible for treatment including: a) Lacks at least
             one renal artery for each kidney with ≥4 mm diameter and with ≥20 mm treatable length
             prior to a significant arterial branch (NOTE: All renal arteries with ≥4 mm diameter
             and with ≥20 mm treatable length should be treated, including dual renal arteries
             meeting these morphologic criteria.).  b) Renal artery stenosis (&gt;50%) or renal
             artery aneurysm in either renal artery.  c) A history of prior renal artery
             intervention including balloon angioplasty or stenting. d) Renal arteries which
