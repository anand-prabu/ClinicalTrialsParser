Early lung recruitment with SI superimposed upon standard PEEP/CPAP in the DR will\n           reduce the need for mechanical ventilation in the first seven days of life, and reduce\n           need for surfactant use; and\n\n        2. A policy of DR SI on standard PEEP/CPAP recruitment will confer better outcomes at 36\n           weeks post-menstrual age (PMA) than standard PEEP/CPAP"

            "textblock": "The SAIL trial aims to provide evidence for changing policy or standard of care. The context\n      of this trial is an unacceptable rate of poor long-term outcomes of preterm infants born as\n      Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborns (ELGAN) <1000 g birthweight (BW), but especially for\n      those born between 23-26 weeks' gestational age (GA). Such infants are the most vulnerable\n      and immature in all organ systems, including the lungs and the brain. These infants are at\n      high risk of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) during their initial\n      hospitalization, neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) and pulmonary problems in infancy and\n      childhood.\n\n      The SAIL trial focuses on facilitating the difficult transition of these most vulnerable\n      infants from a liquid filled in-utero lung to an ex-utero air-filled lung. Sustained\n      Inflation (SI) is a promising delivery room (DR) intervention, with evidence of short-term\n      efficacy with minimal risk of additional harm beyond current standard accepted Newborn\n      Resuscitation Program (NRP) Guidelines. This protocol proposes a fully informed consenting\n      procedure. We propose to evaluate the impact of a SI in the DR on the need for mechanical\n      ventilation in the first week of life which would also impact mortality rates and the\n      incidence and severity of BPD."
