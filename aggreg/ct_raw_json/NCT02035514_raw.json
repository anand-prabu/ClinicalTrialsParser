            "textblock": "Immunomodulatory therapies to treat the relapsing-remitting phase of multiple sclerosis (MS)\n      are designed to ameliorate the inflammatory processes that mediate the damage to the central\n      nervous system (CNS) and to delay progression of the disease. To date, there is no effective\n      means to stop the progression of disease and induce remyelination. Adult stem cells therapy\n      show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative therapeutic strategy. We propose\n      the use of bone marrow-derived autologous Mesenchymal (BM-MSC) Stem Cells transplantation to\n      treat patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), despite immunomodulatory therapy. Taking\n      advantage of the potential that MSC possess strong immunomodulatory properties thought to\n      play a role in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance and in the control of autoimmunity\n      and that may stimulate repair and regeneration of lesions, we plan a trial of a single\n      injection of autologous BM-MSC into eight patients. First, we aim to assess the feasibility,\n      safety and tolerability of autologous MSC therapy in RRMS. Second, we plan to evaluate the\n      effects of BM-MSC transplantation on MS disease activity by clinical, neurophysiological,\n      immunological and imaging assessments. Autologous MSC will be obtained from bone marrow\n      aspirates, purified by culture and characterized by surface antigen expression. A single\n      dose of autologous BM-MSC will be injected intravenously. Clinical, neurological and\n      immunological assessments will be scheduled at baseline (before BM-MSC transplantation) at\n      1, 3, and 6 months after transplant. The imaging will be performed at 3 and 6 months after\n      transplant. Proposed trial will enable us to ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC\n      transplantation is a feasible and safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC can establish an\n      environment of immune tolerance  and through the local production of neurotrophic/growth\n      factors, might induce neuroprotection and improvement in CNS function."

            "textblock": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, demyelinating disease of the CNS. Onset typically\n      occurs in early adulthood. Patients present with intermittent symptoms that are partially\n      reversible; this form is termed relapsing-remitting (RRMS). Over time, most patients develop\n      secondary-progressive MS (SPMS) which manifests as irreversible and gradual neurological\n      impairments that often progress without acute relapses. Beta-interferons or glatiramer\n      acetate represents the first line therapeutic option for RRMS. Clinical trials confirm that\n      show partial efficacy, though they do not prevent the onset of secondary progression. SPMS,\n      is the consequence of axonal loss and neurodegeneration and no current therapy has been\n      effective. Stem cell therapy show great promise and is rapidly developing as alternative\n      therapeutic strategy. Clinical indications for adult stem cells, which can be safely\n      harvested and normally behave well without formation of tumours, are rapidly increasing. The\n      majority of human stem cell trials have focused on clinical applications for haematopoietic\n      stem cells (HSC), mesenchymal stem cells (MSC), or both, which can be easily obtained in\n      clinically sufficient numbers from peripheral blood, bone marrow, adipose tissue, or\n      umbilical cord blood and placenta. MSC can readily be isolated from a small sample of bone\n      marrow and rapidly expanded so as to generate large numbers of cells for autologous\n      therapies. When administered intravenously have an immune suppressive effect that can\n      ameliorate animal autoimmune diseases. MSC transplantation significantly improves clinical\n      outcome in experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), the animal model of MS. When\n      intravenously injected, MSC may migrate to inflammatory brain lesions and promote survival\n      of brain-resident cells. Several disease models demonstrate axonal neuroprotection following\n      MSC therapy, with some evidence that this is potentially mediated through the production of\n      neurotrophic/growth factors, and/or immunomodulatory effects of MSC. For that reasons, MSC\n      have become the focus of research as a potential cell therapy for inducing neuroprotection\n      in human neurodegenerative diseases such as MS.\n\n      A growing body of literature confirms the therapeutic MSC biological properties, and provide\n      a plausible mechanism of action to guide clinical trial design with a number of phase I/II\n      trials in MS patients now underway. Experimental clinical trials in MS are being considered\n      or have recently been initiated by several research groups, which are testing the\n      therapeutic potential of different sources of MSC. Learning from previous clinical studies,\n      and taking advantage of the potential that adult BM-MSC may stimulate repair and\n      remyelination, to plan a clinical trial in patients with inflammatory MS seems reasonable.\n      We propose a safety trial of a single intravenous injection of autologous bone\n      marrow-derived MSC into 8 subjects with RRMS. The trial proposed here will enable us to\n      ascertain whether autologous BM-MSC transplantation is a safe procedure, and whether BM-MSC\n      therapy during the relapsing-remitting phase of MS can establish a immunomodulatory and\n      regenerative microenvironment and reverse neurological disability in RRMS patients."
