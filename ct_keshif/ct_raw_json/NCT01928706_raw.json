Three possible answers and scores were\n      proposed for each question: never (0), sometimes (1) and almost always (2).  Results were\n      analyzed by means of the generalized linear model (p\u22640.05) considering two factors: time (T0\n      and T90) and group (hard and soft denture liners)."
