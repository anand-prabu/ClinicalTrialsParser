            "textblock": "The comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) is a multidimensional, interdisciplinary\n      diagnostic process to determine the medical, psychological, and functional capabilities of\n      an elderly person, in order to develop a coordinated and integrated plan for treatment. It\n      represents the first stage of the most appropriate care for elderly people who are frail or\n      who cannot perform at least three daily tasks unaided.\n\n      It has been shown that the integration of CGA in the decision-making and care management at\n      hospital improves inpatient's health and functional status, and reduces mortality rate and\n      healthcare expenditures. The effects of CGA in daily practice of general practitioners\n      remain unknown.\n\n      Implementation of a systematic CGA for every older old community-dwellers performed by a\n      general practitioner remains yet difficult because of number of issues. First, although the\n      number of older old community-dwellers keeps increasing, the number of health care\n      professional with geriatric skills does not. Second, CGA is a complex and time-consuming\n      process. Third, CGA requires a multidisciplinary geriatric team that cannot support alone\n      the care of all frail older old community-dwellers due to their limited number. An\n      implication of non-geriatricians in CGA is therefore required.\n\n      Recently, it was confirmed that CGA cannot be applied to all older adults, and that the best\n      compromise could be the use of a two-step approach. The first step is the identification by\n      non-geriatricians of elderly inpatients at high risk of adverse outcomes using a screening\n      tool, and the second step is a CGA by geriatricians with a diagnosis purpose.\n\n      None of existing tools used for screening is adapted to the population of elderly people who\n      visit general practitioners.Thus, healthcare professionals working in ED need a simple,\n      standardized and brief geriatric assessment (BGA) to identify as soon as possible frail\n      older old community-dwellers requiring specialized geriatric care.\n\n      The investigators hypothesized that a BGA older old community-dwellers carried out by a\n      general practitioner could predict the adverse health events (i.e. hospitalization,\n      institutionalisation, medical consultations and death) occurring during a 6-months follow-up\n      period before the evaluation."
