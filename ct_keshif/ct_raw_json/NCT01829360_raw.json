Children with SLI have difficulty learning language without any obvious\n      cause for this difficulty. Two treatment studies will be conducted to determine (1) the\n      number of times children with SLI need to hear new words during book reading to learn the\n      new words; (2) the best way to provide the target number of exposures to new words during\n      book reading. For example, is it better to hear the new words many times within the book and\n      to read the book few times, or is it better to hear the new words a few times within the\n      book and to read the book many times. The investigators hypothesize that children with SLI\n      will need to hear new words 2 to 3 times as often as children with normal language to learn\n      the words and that reading the books many times will be more effective than repeating the\n      words many times within a book."

            "textblock": "Specific Language Impairment (SLI) affects approximately 7.4% of Kindergarten children.\n      Children with SLI are known to have difficulty learning new words, which places them at\n      greater risk for future reading impairments and academic failure. Surprisingly, there are\n      few interventions for word learning by children with SLI that have undergone rigorous\n      efficacy and/or effectiveness testing. The goal of this research is to optimize an\n      interactive book reading intervention that has proven to be successful in teaching\n      vocabulary to other groups of Kindergarten children.\n\n      This preliminary clinical trial consists of two studies. The first study attempts to\n      identify an adequate intensity of the interactive book reading treatment for children with\n      SLI. Here, words are randomized to a treatment or no treatment (i.e., test only) condition\n      and children are randomized to different intensities of the treatment. Specifically,\n      children will hear the treated words either 12, 24, 36, or 48 times during treatment. The\n      second study further tests the adequate intensity by comparing the interactive book reading\n      treatment to a less intensive standard book reading control condition. Children will be\n      randomized to the interactive book reading or standard book reading condition. This study\n      will examine how much children with different language skills benefit from the adequate\n      intensity. In addition, this study will examine how best to achieve the adequate intensity.\n      Specifically, is it better to hear the word more often in the book or to read the book more\n      times?  In the treatment condition, words are randomized to more repetitions in the book or\n      to more repetitions of reading the same book.\n\n      At the conclusion of this research, an adequate intensity and manner of achieving this\n      intensity of interactive book reading will have been identified for children with SLI.\n      Moreover, a better understanding of the types of outcomes that can be attained through\n      changing intensity and changing the manner of achieving intensity will be gained for this\n      treatment and this group of children. This will inform future research on this treatment by\n      determining whether a larger study can be initiated or whether the treatment needs further\n      refinement to be effective for children with SLI."
