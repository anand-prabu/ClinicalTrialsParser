            "textblock": "Every month the VA becomes aware of approximately 1,100 veterans in VA care who attempt\n      suicide. While the VA has implemented a comprehensive, multifaceted suicide prevention\n      approach, it has yet to implement nationally any evidence-based psychotherapies targeting\n      suicide, a gap due largely to the dearth of evidence-based therapies for suicide. Primary\n      aims of this proposal are to conduct a randomized controlled trial testing an adaptation of\n      a cognitive-behavioral intervention, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT), for\n      veterans on the VA's High Risk for Suicide List. Our adapted version of MBCT for suicide\n      (MBCT-S) integrates mindfulness meditation techniques with standard cognitive therapy into a\n      low-intensity group therapy format and builds on the VA Safety Plan to enhance patients'\n      awareness of suicide triggers and appropriate coping strategies. This study has the\n      potential to increase the range of cost effective treatment alternatives for the large\n      number of suicidal veterans for whom evidence-based therapies are severely limited."
