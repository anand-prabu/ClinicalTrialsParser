    <textblock>
      Compared to chronic dialysis, kidney transplantation provides recipients with longer
      survival and better quality of life at a lower cost. In order to meet increasing demands for
      kidney allografts, kidneys from older and sicker donors are being procured. This has led to
      greater discard rates of donated kidneys as well as more complications for recipients,
      including shorter allograft survival. Available clinical models to predict kidney allograft
      quality have poor prognostic ability and do not asses the degree of kidney allograft injury.
      However, allograft injury near the time of procurement can lead to major consequences for
      the transplant recipient: greater risks of delayed graft function, poor allograft function
      and premature loss of the transplant. Our proposal is based on the hypotheses that novel
      kidney injury biomarkers measured in donor urine and transport media at the time of
      procurement can assess acute and chronic kidney injury and that distinct biomarker patterns
      will predict allograft survival. In collaboration with four organ procurement organizations,
      we will collect urine samples from consecutive deceased donors and samples of transport
      solution for every pumped kidney. We will measure five acute injury markers and three
      chronic injury markers. We will determine mortality and allograft survival in all patients
      by linkage to th United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database. Additionally, we will
      perform a detailed chart review of a subset of recipients and will also examine associations
      between biomarkers and longitudinal graft function over two years after transplant. Early,
      non-invasive and rapid assessment of donor kidney injury could drive better allocation
      decisions and potentially reduce the rates of post-transplant complications. Further, these
      new tools could provide a platform for clinical trials of therapies for allografts and
      kidney transplant recipients aimed at ameliorating allograft injury.

      Our study has several key processes that we have developed and tested to address our
      scientific aims:

        1. Enrollment

           We will collect urine samples from approximately 1600 deceased donors and approximately
           600 perfusate samples from machine-pumped kidneys from participating organ procurement
           organizations (OPOs). We estimate that our final donor group will be comprised of 55%
           standard criteria donors, 25% expanded-criteria donors and 10% donors after cardiac
           death. Approximately, 20% of the kidneys will be discarded.

        2. Donor Data

           Donor variables come from two sources: the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS)
           database and detailed data abstraction from each OPO. The UNOS database provides data
           on all donors with demographics and other important clinical characteristics. The
           additional data collected by the OPO staff captures granular information on events
           surrounding donor death, which are not included in the UNOS database. These data will
           be available on all enrolled donors and include variables such as serial serum
           creatinine, nadir blood pressures, medication and vasopressor use, and machine pump
           parameters.

        3. Overall Recipient Cohort

           Over 2000 recipients will have received kidneys from the deceased donors in our study.
           The Overall  Cohort will comprise all of these recipients General demographic and
           clinical characteristics about recipients in the Overall Cohort will come from the UNOS
           database. For the Overall Recipient Cohort, we will ascertain delayed graft function
           (DGF) through center reports to UNOS. We will ascertain allograft failure through
           center reports to UNOS and new episodes of wait-listing and re-transplant collected by
           UNOS, Recipient mortality will be ascertained through the center reports to UNOS/SRTR
           and through the Social Security Death Master File.

        4. Detailed Recipient Cohort

           A subset of over 500 recipients of the Overall Cohort who had transplantation at any of
           our collaborating transplant centers will comprise this cohort. For the Detailed
           Subcohort, on-site coordinators will perform manual chart review and abstract more
           extensive data about each recipient including dialysis indications post-transplant,
           comorbidities, and specific doses of immunosuppression. For the Detailed Subcohort, we
           will also collect data on clinical events for up to two years after transplantation,
           including acute rejection and estimated glomerular filtration rate at the time of
           transplantation and at months 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 after transplant.

        5. Acute and chronic kidney injury biomarkers will be measured in urine and perfusate

        The population from which our Deceased-Donor Cohort will be selected is all potential
        deceased organ donors located in the regions serviced by our participating organ
        procurement organizations (OPOs).

        The recipient cohorts will be defined by the deceased donors enrolled in the study, and
        thus, the study population for this group is all recipients of kidneys from deceased organ
        donors procured in the regions serviced by our participating OPOs.
