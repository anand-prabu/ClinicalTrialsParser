In preclinical models, it has been demonstrated that MGMT methylation\n      (which is silencing the DNA repair process) is achievable by folic acid. About half of the\n      patients with operated GBM have an un-methylated MGMT gene status and therefore a poorer\n      prognosis. A phase-1 dose escalation study is proposed with pharmacologic doses of folinic\n      acid in combination with temozolomide and radiotherapy of operated GBM."

In pre-clinical models, it has been\n      demonstrated that Folic acid could re-methylate the MGMT gene and therefore the repair\n      process to radiation and temozolomide could be limited, allowing a better prognosis.
