  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently many studies reported that intraoperative dexmedetomidine administration undergoing
      spinal anesthesia give a satisfactory sedation in elderly patients and cause less
      respiratory depressions compared other sedatives(e.g. benzodiazepine) But the optimal dose
      of dexmedetomidine for sedative effect in elderly patients undergoing spinal anesthesia was
      not got general consensus.

      The investigators hypothesized that the dose requirements would be lower than in elderly
      patients than young patients. Furthermore, intrathecal small dose opioids enhance the
      analgesia provided by bupivacaine due to synergistic effects and it would reduce the dose of
      dexmedetomidine.

      The purpose of this study was to determine the dose of dexmedetomidine to provide
      satisfactory sedation undergoing spinal anesthesia with or without additive small dose
      intrathecal opioids.

      Elderly patients(65~85 years old) undergoing TURP or TURB were enrolled in this
      single-blinded study. Forty patients were randomly assigned to receive intrathecal
      hyperbaric bupivacaine 6mg coadministered with 20mcg fentanyl or placebo normal saline
      0.4cc. After the induction (bilateral T10 sensory level to pinprick within 5 mins of
      intrathecal drug administration), continuous intravenous dexmedetomidine was started in dose
      of 0.8, 0.6, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, or 0.2mcg. Successful sedation was defined  as OASS score 3 or 4
      within 20 minutes of dexmedetomidine infusion.  The dose of dexmedetomidine was selected for
      each patient according to an up and down method. Intraoperative arterial pressure, heart
      rate, and bispectral index was compared. Postoperative pain score, the time for the
      regression of sensory and motor was recorded for further analysis.
