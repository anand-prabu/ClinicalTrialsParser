Approximately 196 subjects with fever defined as body temperature >= 38\u02daC, with at\n      least one respiratory symptom and one other constitutional symptom will be invited into this\n      study to target 156 evaluable subjects. A nasopharyngeal/throat swabs rapid test for\n      influenza A and B will be conducted and only subjects with positive results could be\n      recruited. All eligible subjects will be randomized to one of the following treatment group\n      in a 1:1 ratio.\n\n      Study Group: Apomivir\u00ae 1 capsule (120 mg/cap) twice daily for 5 days Control Group: Placebo\n      1 capsule twice daily for 5 days A pack of acetaminophen (500 mg) will be provided at\n      enrollment. All flu symptom relief agents could be used only for rescue use of persistent\n      fever or flu symptoms (>= 24 hours). A digital thermometer and diary card will be dispensed\n      at baseline (Day 1). Subjects will be instructed to complete the body temperature record,\n      and daily record regarding the severity of their influenza symptoms and the level of\n      interference on daily activity. The monitoring frequency will be twice daily (after drug\n      administration) from Day 1 to Day 5, and cut down to once daily until Day 29 or completed\n      cure (defined as remission of all flu symptoms and interferences). Treatment failure is\n      defined as secondary illnesses, antibiotic use and hospitalization due to disease\n      progression.\n\n      For safety and efficacy assessments, all subjects should return on Day 3, 6 and 15. For\n      subjects who are not completely cured before Day 15 (Visit 4), further therapy will be\n      conducted and they should return on Day 29; for those who are completely cured, only a\n      telephone follow-up will be conducted on Day 29.\n\n      The severity of fever will be scored using a 4-point scale:\n\n      0 = < 37.2\u00b0C\n\n        1. = >= 37.2 to < 38.0\u00b0C\n\n        2. = >= 38.0 to < 39.0\u00b0C\n\n        3. = >= 39.0 \u00b0C\n\n      Other influenza symptoms (such as cough, nasal obstruction, sore throat, fatigue, headache\n      and myalgias) will also be assessed using a 4-point scale:\n\n      0 = none,\n\n        1. = mild,\n\n        2. = moderate,\n\n        3. = severe\n\n      The level of interference on daily activities (including running, lifting heavy objects,\n      participating in strenuous sports, moderate activities), such as moving a table, pushing a\n      vacuum cleaner, bowling, or playing golf, lifting or carrying groceries, climbing several\n      flights of stairs, climbing one flight of stairs, bending, kneeling, or stooping, walking\n      more than a mile, walking several blocks, walking one blocks, and bathing or dressing\n      yourself, will be assessed according to a 3-point scale\n\n      0 = no, no limited\n\n        1. = yes, limited a little\n\n        2. = yes, limited a lot\n\n      Confirmatory tests for infective virus strain, real-time RT-PCR and viral culture will be\n      conducted at baseline. In the following study visits, real-time RT-PCR will be performed to\n      measure the influenza viral load/titer in nasopharyngeal/throat  swabs specimen. For those\n      who have been completely cured prior to Day 15, the real-time RT-PCR assessment could be\n      omitted on Day 29.
