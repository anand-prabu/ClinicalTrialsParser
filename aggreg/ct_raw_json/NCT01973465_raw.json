            "textblock": "This study was developed in response to the July, 2013 FDA draft guidance regarding FMT for\n      CDI.  The weight of the evidence in the literature suggests that FMT is the most effective\n      treatment for ambulatory outpatients affected by recurrent CDI who fail conventional\n      therapy.\n\n      The anticipated benefits to research patients enrolled in this study include resolution of\n      chronic diarrhea, return of bowel habits and nutritional status to normal, and resolution of\n      chronic recurrent CDI.\n\n      FMT involves the endoscopic instillation of freshly obtained stool with millions of live\n      bacteria into the recipient's colon by endoscopic lavage.  With any endoscopic procedure,\n      there is a risk of perforated viscous.  This is very rare, but the risk is increased with\n      severe CDI.  The risk of acquisition of communicable enteric or blood borne pathogen appears\n      to be negligible."
