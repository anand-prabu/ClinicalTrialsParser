The glottic view will be scored in this position using the Cormack and Lehane classification system. If correct laryngoscope positioning cannot be achieved with a size 3 blade, a size 4 blade will be used. Hereafter, the patient's trachea will be intubated once the optimal view of the larynx had been obtained.

However, during an audit of videolaryngoscopic\n      practice we noticed that, in obtaining the best view, clinicians frequently and\n      inadvertently advanced the blade into the vallecula to get a better view, such that the\n      epiglottis was downfolded and elevated directly from the vocal cords. However, a better view\n      does not necessarily lead to higher intubation success.\n\n      In this randomized, controlled trial, we want to determine the efficacy of\n      videolaryngoscope-guided tracheal intubation using an alternative position for the blade in\n      patients with normal airways."
