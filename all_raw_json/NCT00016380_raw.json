It is not yet known if ondansetron is more effective with or without\n      dexamethasone in preventing vomiting caused by radiation therapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is comparing how well ondansetron works with or\n      without dexamethasone in preventing vomiting in patients with cancer who are receiving\n      radiation therapy to the upper abdomen."

Patients\n      are stratified according to radiotherapy field description (whole abdomen and pelvis vs\n      partial abdomen and pelvis vs partial abdomen only). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2\n      treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral ondansetron twice daily and oral dexamethasone daily for\n           5-7 days concurrently with the first 5 fractions of radiotherapy.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral ondansetron twice daily and oral placebo daily for 5-7\n           days concurrently with the first 5 fractions of radiotherapy.\n\n      Treatment continues in both arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, prior to starting radiotherapy if more than 5 days\n      since randomization, prior to the 5th and 15th fractions of radiotherapy, and 1 month after\n      completion of radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 100-200 patients (50-100 per arm) will be accrued for this\n      study."
