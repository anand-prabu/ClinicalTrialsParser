While\n      many retrospective and prospective reviews of septic shock patients have been undertaken\n      worldwide, many key questions remain unanswered.  These questions include the true\n      incidence, associated morbidity and mortality of septic shock in North America, key factors\n      associated with successful management and markers suggesting a high probability of a\n      complicated clinical course.  Part of the reason for the persistence of these questions, is\n      the fact that previous and ongoing reviews of septic shock and severe sepsis have been\n      either limited in number (typically <150) or biased by the need to be eligible for specific\n      clinical trials (typically, non-eligible patients have not been followed and had data\n      collected.\n\n      We propose to examine specific questions within a temporally comprehensive cohort of septic\n      shock patients by review of individual charts using a defined data-extraction template."

Research\n      nurses and student will be trained by the principal investigator.  A minimum of 10% of the\n      charts will be randomly audited by the principal investigator to ensure appropriate data\n      extraction.  This will allow the PI to review and correct any discrepant coding issues and\n      judge specific questions (e.g. appropriateness of antibiotics/presence of effective\n      antibiotics or not).\n\n      Data Collection Tool:  Attached.
