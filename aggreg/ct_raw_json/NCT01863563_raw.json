The tonsil rolls are sequentially removed, followed by control of residual hemostasis with suction electrocautery.  A second set of tonsil rolls are placed.  After adenoid pack is removed from nasopharynx and bleeding controlled, tonsil rolls are removed, followed by suction electrocautery for any residual hemostasis is performed.",
