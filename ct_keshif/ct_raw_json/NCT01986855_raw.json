The duration of\n      this trial will be up to 67 weeks.  This will consist of a 1-week Screening Period, a\n      10-week wash-off period from metformin, if needed, and a 2-week placebo run-in period, a\n      52-week double-blind treatment period, and a 14-day post-treatment follow-up period. The\n      primary objective of this trial is to assess the A1C-lowering efficacy of the addition of\n      ertugliflozin compared to the addition of placebo with an underlying hypothesis that\n      addition of treatment with ertugliflozin provides greater reduction in A1C compared to the\n      addition of placebo; the primary objective will be tested for both 5-mg and 15-mg doses of\n      ertugliflozin."
