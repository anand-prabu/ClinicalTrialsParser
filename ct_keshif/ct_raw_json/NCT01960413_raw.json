The study was designed with 25 in each group in order to explore all three aims and potential confounders. However, if the investigators are not able to accrue 25 subjects in each arm, the investigators would still be able to detect a 30% difference in sVCAM with 17 subjects in each group. The 95% confidence interval for detecting a 30% difference is between 204 ng/ml and 290 ng/ml (or an 18-42% reduction in sVCAM). Importantly, the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval (18%) is still a clinically relevant reduction in sVCAM. Thus, if the investigators detect a 30% or larger difference in sVCAM in this study, the investigators will be assured that, based on the 95% confidence interval, these data are clinically important.",
