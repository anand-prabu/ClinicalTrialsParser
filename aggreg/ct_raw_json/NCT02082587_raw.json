            "textblock": "As treatments improve and patients live longer with cancer, even after it has spread to the\n      brain, efforts to improve quality of life are growing.  Neurocognitive function (thinking\n      ability and memory) is an area of particular concern for patients with brain metastases\n      (cancer that can spread to the brain). Although there are established tests to measure\n      neurocognitive function, these require a face-to-face assessment and can take a long time to\n      complete.  As a result, efforts to use these tests to measure changes in neurocognitive\n      function in patients following treatment for brain metastases have resulted in a large\n      proportion of patients who do not return for follow-up.  This has limited the ability to\n      evaluate the impact of current treatments on neurocognitive function.  This study aims to\n      evaluate a shorter, telephone-based neurocognitive assessment tool, which would make it\n      easier for patients to complete these tests in follow-up. If this new tool is found to\n      reliably measure neurocognitive function, it could be used for future studies evaluating new\n      interventions that prevent or treat neurocognitive deterioration following treatment of\n      brain metastases. This is the first prospective study to evaluate the feasibility and\n      reliability of a novel telephone-based brief neurocognitive assessment battery (Toronto BNB)\n      compared with the same battery delivered face-to-face in this population. The investigators\n      hypothesize that telephone administration of this brief neurocognitive battery will reliably\n      evaluate neurocognitive function and improve patient ability to complete follow-up\n      assessments."
