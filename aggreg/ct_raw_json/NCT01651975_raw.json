            "textblock": "Swallowing problems (dysphagia) are encountered frequently in primary practice and in the\n      hospital setting.  The list of possible causes is large, ranging from strokes and\n      neurological disease to complications of cancer treatment, acid reflux, and surgery.  Many\n      patients have a reduced ability to feel food and fluid (reduced sensation) within the throat\n      (pharynx) and this leads to an inability to manipulate food and fluids in the correct\n      manner.  This can produce a variety of swallowing problems such as choking on foods and\n      fluids, regurgitation, aspiration, weight loss, malnutrition and poor quality of life.\n\n      Treatment of dysphagia is largely directed at rehabilitation of muscle power and education\n      about safe swallowing techniques or positioning that limits food and fluid from entering the\n      airway. One of the most widely accepted treatments of dysphagia is to alter the texture of\n      food. Most patients with dysphagia will have more difficulty swallowing thin liquids. By\n      adding a thickener to the liquid, a food bolus becomes more cohesive, and is less likely to\n      become aspirated. Various types of thickening products are available over-the-counter\n      without a prescription. These thickening products are bland and currently have no flavor.\n      The investigators hypothesize that alterations in food taste (sweet, salty, etc\u2026), viscosity\n      will improve swallowing efficiency. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the\n      effects of food taste, texture on swallowing efficiency. The goal is to develop safer,\n      better tasting food products and improve the quality of life in patients with disabling\n      swallowing disorders."
