There will\n      be approximately 66 subjects participating in this study. After surgery subjects will\n      receive numbing medication every 6 hours for 48 hours. Subjects will also receive a morphine\n      PCA (patient  controlled analgesia) after surgery and pain medication by mouth every 4 hours\n      around the clock with the option to receive more pain medication if needed. Subjects will\n      participate in the study up to 3 days."
