Its\n      highest incidence occurs from the second decade of life, affecting significantly the\n      economically active population. Chronic Venous Insufficiency treatment aims to relieve\n      symptoms, treat and prevent complications, prevent recurrences and provide cosmetic\n      satisfaction with minimal side effects. It's current treatment includes some classic\n      postural measures (leg elevation), elastic stockings and bandages compression therapy and\n      possible medication (phlebotonics). The results in the medium and long term are unfavorable,\n      since a large number of patients do not get better or evolves with recurrence of symptoms.\n      Nowadays many, no prospective , not randomized , international studies have shown favorable\n      results with endovascular treatment of obstruction in the iliac vein territory in patients\n      with advanced Chronic Venous Insufficiency . The purpose of this prospective, double-blinded\n      randomized study is to evaluate the results obtained with endovascular treatment, through\n      the use of angioplasty and stenting in this group of patients when compared with clinical\n      treatment ."
