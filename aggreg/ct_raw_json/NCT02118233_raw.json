There have been many studies on this subject, some finding\n      that certain patients gain improvement in their brain function and others might get worse.\n      The goal of this study is to discover which patients are more likely to have improved\n      cognitive functioning.  Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) and percutaneous carotid angioplasty\n      and stenting (CAS) are not investigational and are an accepted treatment for your condition.\n       In addition, subjects that choose not to undergo surgery will also be included in this\n      study."

Guidelines supporting the use of carotid\n      endarterectomy for asymptomatic stenosis are based largely on the Asymptomatic Carotid\n      Atherosclerosis Study (ACAS) which reported a 47% relative risk reduction for ipsilateral\n      stroke or death in patients randomized to surgery compared to best medical management over 5\n      years.  These data were further substantiated by the recent publication of the Medical\n      Research Council Asymptomatic Carotid Surgery (ACST) trial results (1); however, both trials\n      estimated that at least 40 operative procedures were required to prevent a single disabling\n      stroke or death in one patient after 5 years (2). These data underscore the importance of\n      understanding the cognitive risks of carotid revascularization and developing strategies to\n      limit factors that contribute to this risk especially in asymptomatic patients.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to better understand the effect of carotid revascularization\n      (using either carotid endarterectomy (CEA) or percutaneous carotid angioplasty and stenting\n      (CAS)) on cognitive outcome by prospectively collecting cerebral blood flow data and\n      cognitive testing data prior to and after carotid revascularization procedures."
