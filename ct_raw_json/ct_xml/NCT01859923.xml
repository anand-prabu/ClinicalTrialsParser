  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and
      efficacy of long-term (6-month) treatment with delamanid plus an optimized background
      regimen of of other anti-tuberculosis drugs in pediatric patients who completed Trial
      242-12-232.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, open-label, multiple-dose, multicenter trial to assess the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of delamanid plus an optimized background
      regimen in pediatric patients with MDR-TB over a 6 month treatment period. This long-term
      trial, an extension of Trial 242-12-232, will be conducted in patients who have completed
      Trial 232. Trial 242-12-233  will initially be conducted sequentially in two groups of
      pediatric patients by age group: Group 1 (ages 12 to 17 years) and Group 2 (ages 6 to 11
      years).

      Younger age groups (Group 3, [3 to 5 years] and Group 4, [0 to 2 years]) will be enrolled
      when the pediatric formulation becomes available. Details describing Groups 3 and 4 will be
      included in an amendment to the protocol.
