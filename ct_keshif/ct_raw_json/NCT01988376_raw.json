All enrolled cases will ask to\n      receive randomly the SurePath\u00ae or the conventional smear.\n\n      Expected Results: The investigators will get the incidence of unsatisfactory smear and the\n      accuracy of detecting cervicovaginal lesions between the SurePath\u00ae and the conventional\n      smear in patients who underwent radiotherapy."
