  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently available smoking cessation treatments help only about 15% of smokers to quit
      long-term. These treatments do not typically address the behaviours and sensations
      associated with the act of smoking (e.g. handling a cigarette, inhaling, taste and feel of
      smoke on the throat). There is evidence that these elements influence smoking behaviour and
      cessation. Electronic cigarettes (EC) are a new product with a strong potential to be a
      realistic behavioural replacement for smoking.

      Whilst EC deliver nicotine, their use does not involve tobacco combustion, which is the
      primary source of the many thousands of dangerous chemicals to which smokers of conventional
      cigarettes are exposed. Studies on EC products and users indicate there is little doubt that
      they are substantially safer than conventional cigarettes.

      The investigators plan to conduct a study one of the very first studies to test the effects
      of adding EC to standard care on long-term validated outcomes. Before launching such a large
      and demanding trial however, data are needed on what proportion of smokers would be
      interested in using EC and what compliance with EC use can be expected, and no data exist to
      inform how large a sample is needed. This pilot study would provide such data.

      A total of 220 smokers would be recruited at smoking cessation clinics in London (n=20),
      Madrid (n=100), and Prague (n=100). Within each site, half the smokers would be randomised
      to receive standard smoking cessation behavioural support and medication (standard care;
      SC), and half to receive SC plus EC. The EC group would receive a four week supply of EC.
      The outcome measures for the study would be smoking status at 4 and 24 weeks after the
      target quit date, EC use, acceptability, and adverse events.
