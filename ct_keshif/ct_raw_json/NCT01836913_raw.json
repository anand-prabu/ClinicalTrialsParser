CT-based and PET/CT-based target volumes will be compared after\n      treatment has been completed.

This planning-PET/CT will not be used for actual treatment planning.\n\n      In case of neoadjuvant chemoradiation the response on this therapy will be analysed at\n      pathologic evaluation of the esophageal specimen.\n\n      Routine follow up will be carried out every 6 months, using CT. In case of no locoregional\n      recurrence and/or metastases, patients will be followed up to 18 months for study\n      evaluation.\n\n      In case of distant metastases, patients will be censored if locoregional recurrence is\n      excluded. When indicated, palliative treatment will be given.\n\n      In case of (suspicion of) locoregional recurrence, PET/CT-based recurrence analysis should\n      be carried out with comparison and co-registration of CT-based and PET/CT-based target\n      volumes."
