      This will be a randomized double blind study which will be conducted on patients admitted to
      Department of Hepatology from June 2013 to may 2014 at ILBS, New Delhi. The study will be
      divided into two groups- Group A will comprise of patients with compensated cirrhosis and
      Group B comprising of patients with decompensated cirrhosis. Patients not having any
      exclusion criteria will undergo bone marrow examination and liver biopsy at the baseline.

      50 patients each of compensated and decompensated cryptogenic cirrhosis will be randomised
      into two limbs- limb A (25 patients) will receive G-CSF and erythropoietin while those on
      limb B (25 patients) will receive G-CSF alone. The drugs will be given for 2 months and
      patient will be followed for 1 year. G-CSF will be given at a dose of 5 Âµg/kg s/c at days 1,
      2, 3, 4, 5 and then every 3rd day till day 60 (total 22 doses). Erythropoietin will be given
      s/c at dose of 500 IU/Kg twice a week for 2 months.

      Follow up will be done on days 0,3,7,14,28, day 42 (6 weeks), day 60 (2 months), day 90 (3
      months), day 180 (6 months), day 270 (9 months); and day 360 (1 year).
