  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited heart condition that causes
      breathlessness, chest pain and fatigue. There are few treatments available. The
      investigators have recently shown that a drug called perhexiline reduced symptoms and
      improved exercise capacity in patients with HCM. This change appears to be driven by
      alterations in myocardial energy metabolism. The aim of this trial is to test a similar
      drug, trimetazidine, in a group of symptomatic patients with non-obstructive HCM.

      HYPOTHESIS: trimetazidine will improve symptoms, peak oxygen consumption, cardiac function
      and arrhythmia burden in medically refractory symptomatic patients with non-obstructive HCM.

      BACKGROUND:

      Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a common inherited disorder of heart muscle affecting 1
      in 500 individuals worldwide. It is associated with arrhythmias, heart failure and sudden
      death in young people. In the majority of patients, HCM is caused by mutations in genes
      encoding cardiac contractile proteins. It has been hypothesised that excessive sarcomeric
      energy consumption is an important and early factor in the pathophysiology of HCM. Therefore
      modulation of myocardial metabolism presents a novel target for improving myocardial
      performance and symptoms in patients with HCM. Trimetazidine is an anti-anginal agent which
      like perhexiline reduces fatty acid oxidation and increases glucose oxidation, thus
      increasing the efficiency of energy production. Trimetazidine has been shown to
      significantly improve exercise performance in patients with stable angina, ischaemic and non
      ischaemic cardiomyopathy, either as monotherapy or in combination with beta-blockers or
      calcium channel blockers,

      DESIGN: A single centre prospective randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, trial of
      trimetazidine therapy.

      DOSING: 20 mg Trimetazidine or Placebo three times daily for three months

      METHODS: The following assessments will be made at baseline and after 3 months treatment:
      history and physical examination, Minnesota heart failure questionnaire, fasting blood
      tests, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, cardiopulmonary exercise test, six minute walk
      test, 24 hour ECG Holter monitor.
