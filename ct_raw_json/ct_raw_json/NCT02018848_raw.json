One training session takes approximately 10 minutes in which 160 stimulus pairs are shown.\nIn the experimental group the probe always appears at the location of the neutral picture so as to train attention away from OCD-relevant stimuli.\nParticipants are asked to complete at least 2 training sessions per week over a period of 5 weeks. The first and last session are bias assessment sessions (see outcome measures), but participants stay blind to this."

After a\n      minimum of 4 weeks of attention training we expect to find differences between participants\n      of the experimental and the control group in terms of attention bias, OCD symptoms, anxiety\n      and depression."
