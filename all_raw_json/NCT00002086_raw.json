To\n      determine the antiviral effect of the combination therapies as evidenced by measures of\n      quantitative viral load performed at select study centers only.\n\n      Secondary: To determine the effectiveness of Retrovir/HIVID and Retrovir/HIVID/Wellferon in\n      maintaining or increasing CD4 counts and preventing disease progression as evidenced by the\n      development of an AIDS-defining indicator disease. To determine the effect of these regimens\n      on secondary measures of clinical status (e.g., performance score, weight change, and\n      secondary infections) and on measures of virologic activity such as serum p24 antigen. To\n      assess the safety and tolerance of these regimens."
