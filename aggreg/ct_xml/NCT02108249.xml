      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the clinical, radiological, and surgical outcomes
      of the Annex™ Adjacent Level System for the treatment of adjacent level disease of the
      lumbar spine.  The Annex™ Adjacent Level System is a spinal fixation system intended to be
      used with commercially available pedicle screw fixation systems in order to extend existing
      pedicle screw constructs.  Subjects will be evaluated over a 2 year period and compared to
      historical control.

        The subject population for both the treatment and control groups will include adult
        (skeletally mature) men and women who were previously implanted with rigid posterior
        fixation (pedicle screw/rod constructs) in the thoracolumbar spine and who later developed
        adjacent level disease (ALD) at a lumbar level.
