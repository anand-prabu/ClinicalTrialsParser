Tools for improving physician-patient communication are\n      available but have not yet been tested in the Hospital setting. The purpose of this project\n      is to determine if training in AIDET (Acknowledge, Introduce, Duration, Explanation, Thank)\n      communication method improves physician-patient communication. Patient satisfaction data\n      will be compared to historical controls using modified HCAHPS (Hospital Consumer Assessment\n      of Health Plans Survey) as the primary outcome measure. In addition, a validation of\n      delivery of AIDET communication will be accomplished through administration of\n      questionnaires to patients."

Both before and after the training intervention,\n      Hospitalists' use of the AIDET method will be validated by having patients complete\n      anonymous questionnaires during their hospital stay.\n\n      All HCAHPS surveys will be conducted by an external patient satisfaction survey vendor, and\n      information will be de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist.\n      Validation questionnaires will be distributed by administrative staff, and will also be\n      de-identified both in terms of patient and specific Hospitalist."
