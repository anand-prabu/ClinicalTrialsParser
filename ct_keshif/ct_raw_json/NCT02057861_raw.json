All patients were premedicated. After arrival in the operating room, all patients\n      were monitorised with  Datex Ohmeda S/5 Anesthesia Machine and electrocardiography  (DII\n      derivation), hemodynamic variables, respiratory rate,  and inspiratory sevoflurane\n      concentrations were recorded. Neuromuscular monitoring system was used. Anesthesia was\n      induced with propofol 2 mg/kg and fentanyl 1 mcg/kg. After the loss of eyelid reflex the\n      neuromuscular monitoring system automatically identified supramaximal stimulating currents\n      and after that rocuronium 0,6 mg/kg was given. Train of four (TOF) stimulation with the\n      supramaximal current were applied and by recording of second TOF value (TOF2) the patient\n      was intubated. Anesthesia was maintained with 50% O2 + 50% air and sevoflurane of 1-2 %\n      concentration. TOF stimulation was applied and recorded every 20 seconds. Intraoperatively\n      by return T2 rocuronium 0,15 mg/kg was given. T2i  time was recorded as intubation time and\n      T2d time was recorded as clinical effect time. At the end of the operation sugammadex 2\n      mg/kg was given. When TOF rate reached 0,9 patients were extubated and the time was\n      recorded."
