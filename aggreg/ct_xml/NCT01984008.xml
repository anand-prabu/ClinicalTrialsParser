    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to demonstrate that investigation medication
      (Bowklean) is not less effective than the active comparator (Klean-Prep with Dulcolax), with
      regards to the overall quality of bowel preparation in subjects undergoing colonoscopy.  An
      additional objective of this study is to collect subject's response to the acceptability and
      tolerability about bowel preparation and safety information.

      After bowel preparation, independent evaluator who is blinded to subject's treatment will
      evaluate the overall colon cleansing based on Aronchick and Ottawa scale. A total of 600
      eligible subjects scheduled to a colonoscopy will be randomly assigned with equal allocation
      to 1 of 2 treatment groups: &quot;Bowklean&quot; or &quot;Klean-Prep&quot; with Dulcolax. Each subject's
      participation is expected to be maximally 4 weeks in study duration (up to 3-week screening
      period followed by one week post colonoscopy).
