Furthermore, how an acute fluid challenge changes hemodynamic parameters.\n\n      Secondary: To thoroughly examine this population with regard to cardiac performance and\n      function, anthropometrics, metabolic status, exercise capability, constitution, pulmonary\n      status, and humoral markers of organ functions. This population will serve as a healthy\n      control group, to which different populations can be compared, hence the need for a\n      comprehensive characterization.\n\n      Hypotheses:\n\n      Diastolic function and parameters associated with diastolic function gradually deteriorate\n      with increasing age. The gradual deterioration is unmasked at an earlier age during exercise\n      and fluid challenge, compared to measurements made at rest."
