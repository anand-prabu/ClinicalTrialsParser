  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) associated with the treatment of diabetes
      increases with age. Hypoglycemia is a common reason for admission to hospital for older
      patients with diabetes. Older patients are often unaware that their blood sugar is low and
      asymptomatic hypoglycemia, as assessed by continuous blood sugar monitoring, is frequent in
      the elderly. There is also evidence that older people with diabetes are more likely to
      develop cardiovascular events such a heart attack and more likely to die suddenly when
      compared to older people without diabetes. It is possible that low blood sugar levels
      contribute to the increased frequency of these events, but this possibility has never been
      studied. The purpose of this study is to assess how frequently low blood sugar occurs in
      older patients with diabetes and to see if low blood sugars adversely affect heart function
      in these patients.

    <textblock>
      Investigators propose a pilot study in 20 patients over age 70 who have type 2 diabetes and
      are being treated with insulin. These patients will be enrolled from the elderly diabetes
      clinic at Vancouver General Hospital. Patients will be asked to come to the Gerontology
      research laboratory in the Research Pavilion at Vancouver General Hospital. A trained
      research nurse will instrument each patient with an ipro 2 glucose sensor (Medtronic
      Canada). These sensors reliably and continuously measure blood glucose for periods of up to
      7 days. Briefly, the skin will be swabbed with a disinfectant and a small catheter will be
      inserted subcutaneously. This needle will be attached to a glucose sensor. Patients will
      wear this sensor for 6 days. Patients will measure their glucose using a glucometer 4 times
      each day during this period and will also be given a log book to keep track of glucose
      values. Patients will also be asked to record any symptoms of hypoglycemia. At the end of 6
      days the sensor will be removed.

      At the same time the glucose sensor is started, a trained research nurse will connect the
      patient to a continuous ambulatory 12-lead ECG cardiac monitor (48 hour Holter monitor). The
      archived 12-lead ECG waveforms will be downloaded for QT and T-wave alternans analysis. The
      heart rate and QT interval will be measured at baseline and the end of each interval from
      the digitized 12-lead ECG.

      Patients and relevant family will be provided with in person education regarding the
      function and use of the monitor, implications for bathing and sleep, and contact information
      for troubleshooting. Patients will have to return to the laboratory every 2 days to have the
      Holter monitor and the ECG leads replaced. Patients will be asked to keep a log book of any
      cardiac symptoms during the 6 days of the study, as well as their activities. The glucose
      and Holter monitor will undergo time synchronization to ensure ability to do correlative
      analysis.

      This is a feasibility pilot to establish preliminary data for analysis. The Holter monitor
      will allow assessment of cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial ischemia and cardiovascular
      autonomic function. The results from the glucose sensor and the Holter monitor will be
      correlated and compared to each other to determine if hypoglycemia has an adverse effect on
      heart function. Hypoglycemia is likely to induce autonomic responses captured on the Holter
      and concordant ischemic S-T segment changes if coronary disease is present. It may also
      detect any resultant arrhythmias, although ischemic arrhythmias are uncommon in 6 days of
      monitoring. If investigators determine that hypoglycemia has negative effects on cardiac
      function, investigators may able to design treatments that would prevent these effects from
      happening in the future.
