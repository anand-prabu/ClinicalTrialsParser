      This is a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label study designed to evaluate fou r treatment
      regimens in patients with advanced cancer for whom there is no avail able, beneficial
      treatment. Patients with HER2 overexpression, amplification, or

        -  activating mutation will be treated with Herceptin/Perjeta; those with epiderm al
           growth factor receptor (EGFR), with Tarceva; those with BRAF-activating mutat ion, with
           Zelboraf; and those with Hedehog pathway potentially clinically releva nt mutation,
           with Erivedge. Treatment will continue until disease progression or unacceptable
           toxicity occurs. Study is expected to last up to 5 years.
