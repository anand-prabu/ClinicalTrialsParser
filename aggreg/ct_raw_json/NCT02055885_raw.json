            "textblock": "In the literature, the effects of acute oxygen administration on exercise tolerance and\n      related symptoms have often appeared to be contradictory. Some investigations have reported\n      benefits from acute oxygen supply during exertion, including increased exercise performance,\n      reduced dyspnea, and better cardiorespiratory adaptations, whereas other studies have\n      reported no improvement. Recently, we advanced then the hypothesis that some patients would\n      be non-responders and even worsen under oxygen treatment. The preliminary results confirmed\n      our hypothesis since we demonstrated that while 56% of the patients were improved with\n      supplemental oxygen, 16% were non-responders and 28% were negative-responders (decreased\n      performance and increased dyspnea during endurance exercise with supplemental oxygen).\n      However, this was a pilot study offering preliminary insights and tentative conclusions that\n      must be confirmed in a larger case series.\n\n      The aims of this retrospective study was :\n\n        1. To confirm on cohorte and with clinical test (the 6-minute walking test - 6WT) the\n           deleterious responses to acute oxygen supplementation in LTOT (long terme\n           oxygenotherapy treatment) and non-LTOT patients who exhibit exercise desaturation.\n\n        2. To identify the predictive factors among the clinical data (i.e., anthropometric,\n           spirometric and gazometric data) and/or functional data recorded during rehabilitation\n           program"
