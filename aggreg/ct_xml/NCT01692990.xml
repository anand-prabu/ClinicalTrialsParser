    <textblock>
      20 normal-weight healthy subjects (10 males, 10 females) were in two periods given 10 of
      0.5-mL capsules/day of fish oil and soybean oil for 3 weeks. In the end of each period they
      were given a standard breakfast and asked to report their appetite on visual analogue scales
      (VAS) immediately before and after the meal. The results were analyzed in accordance with
      the paired design under consideration of both supplement sequence and gender.

      each period they were given a standard breakfast and asked to report their appetite on
      visual analogue scales (VAS) immediately before and after the meal. The results were

    <description>Appetite and satiation were measured by visual analogue scales (VAS), which assessed satiation, hunger, fullness and desire to eat. Each scale was 100 mm in length with words anchored at each end, expressing the most positive and negative rating of each category.</description>
