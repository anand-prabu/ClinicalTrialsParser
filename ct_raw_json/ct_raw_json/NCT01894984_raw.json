All the eligible participants (after\n      risperidone intolerance test during screening) will be receiving risperidone as\n      intramuscular injection (injection of a substance into a muscle) at a dose of, either 25\n      milligram (mg), 37.5 mg or 50 mg every two weeks. Efficacy of the participants will be\n      primarily evaluated through Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Participants' safety will\n      be monitored throughout the study."
