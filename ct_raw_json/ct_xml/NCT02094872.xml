  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well molecularly targeted therapy works in
      treating patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body or cannot be
      removed by surgery. Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other
      substances to identify and attack specific types of cancer cells with less harm to normal
      cells. Molecularly targeted therapy works by treating patients with substances that kill
      cancer cells by targeting key molecules involved in cancer cell growth.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine the difference in best overall response rate (BORR) between patients treated
      with personalized targeted treatment vs. those treated with physician's choice of standard
      therapy.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the safety of performing individualized drug therapy (including novel agents
      and commercially-available agents) in the context of a personalized medicine clinical trial.

      II. To continually assess the process of enrolling and treating patients to a personalized
      medicine clinical trial by acquiring blood and tissue, genetically characterizing v-raf
      murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B (BRAF) wild type (wt) metastatic melanoma tumors,
      identifying a list of potential driver mutations, and treating each patient within a 5-week
      time frame.

      III. To determine the difference in progression free survival (PFS) between patients treated
      with personalized targeted treatment vs. those treated with physician's choice therapy.

      IV. To determine the BORR in specific target-drug matchings (those more frequent).

      V. To iteratively refine and standardize a set of statistical and informatics methodologies
      for matching treatments to the patient's tumor, based on their molecular profile.

      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.

      ARM I: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA) analysis via sequencing. Based on the results of the DNA
      and RNA analysis, patients receive molecularly targeted therapy. Treatment continues in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      ARM II: Patients undergo collection of tissue and blood samples for DNA and RNA analysis via
      sequencing. Patients receive physician's choice standard of care therapy. Treatment
      continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 1 year.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Pts. with metastatic or locally advanced and unresectable BRAF wild-type melanoma who
             have either progressed following previous Rx (Rx) with ipilimumab and/or
             interleukin-2, or are not eligible for interleukin-2 or ipilimumab; ineligibility for
             interleukin-2 would include pts. with underlying cardiac disease (DZ), abnormal

             formulation; pts. are not eligible for ipilimumab if they have known autoimmune DZ;
             for others, an open discussion between the physician and pt. must have occurred, and
             a mutual decision must have been reached that the pt. would not receive either of
             these agents; pts. are defined as &quot;BRAF wild-type&quot; if they test negative for V600
             mutations based on a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certified

             and suitable for biopsy (BX) with 5-6 passes of a 16 or 18 gauge needle for core BX
             (defined as at least 1 cm^3 tumor/50 mg accessible for BX), and must agree to undergo
             up to two surgical resections/biopsies to collect tumor for research purposes; the
             first of these biopsies will occur at the beginning of the study, prior to genetic
             analysis and Rx; the second BX will be performed at the time of DZ progression/end of
             study should funding be available

          -  Pts. must have measurable DZ (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
             [RECIST] version 1.1 [v1.1] criteria), defined as at least one lesion that can be
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as &gt;= 20 mm with conventional
             techniques or as &gt;= 10 mm with spiral computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic
