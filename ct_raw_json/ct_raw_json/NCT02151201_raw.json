Patients were\n      randomized to view the intervention video or a control video of similar length about hand\n      washing. Pre visit and post visit questionnaires were given about vaccination health\n      beliefs. We also asked if the shot had been recommended by the physician. One month after\n      the visit, we used a structured phone interview to gather additional information regarding\n      why participants who had not been vaccinated made that choice."
