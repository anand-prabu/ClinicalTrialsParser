    <textblock>
      The primary research question is to determine whether patients who undergo a stabilization
      of the shoulder using a novel decision-making algorithm (ISIS Score) have improved
      disease-specific quality of life at 1 year post-operatively, as measured by the Western
      Ontario Instability Index (WOSI) compared with patients who undergo stabilization using a
      conventional decision-making algorithm. Secondary outcomes include the American Shoulder and
      Elbow Surgeon's (ASES) score, and difference in recurrence rates of dislocation between the
      two decision-making algorithms.

    <description>After the diagnostic arthroscopy is completed, any other pathology is documented.   At least 3 anchors will be used for the bankart repair for repair of the labrum with an inferior to superior capsular shift.  The suture anchors used will be at the discretion of the surgeon but will be of the screw-in variety.   The sutures are passed through the labrum, and the labrum is tied to the glenoid rim after the bone is prepared in the standard fashion.  The surgical times will be recorded on standardized forms.</description>

    <description>A deltopectoral approach is used. The coracoacromial ligament (CAL) is exposed and incised 1 cm from its coracoid attachment. Harvesting of a 2.5- to 3-cm coracoid graft allows use of 2 screws for fixation to the glenoid neck through a subscapularis-splitting approach. The stump of the CAL is repaired to the capsule with the arm positioned in neutral.  The graft is placed in a extra-articular fashion with capsular closure to the native glenoid rim.</description>

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Recurrent anterior instability (dislocation or subluxation) with or without
             hyperlaxity, including a clinical history of traumatic anterior instability of the
             shoulder, with positive apprehension or relocation tests.

          2. Provide consent

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Patients with a concomitant rotator cuff lesion or humeral avulsion of the
             anteroinferior glenohumeral ligament (HAGL)

          2. An acute first-time dislocation

          3. Previous shoulder surgery

          4. Surgery for a painful, unstable shoulder without true dislocation or subluxation

          5. Patients with active worker's compensation claims (due to the expectation of lower
             rates of success in this patient population)

          6. Active joint or systemic infection

          7. Patients with convulsive disorders, collagen diseases, previous shoulder surgeries,
             and any other conditions that might affect the mobility of the joint

          8. Major medical illness (life expectancy less than 2 years or unacceptably high
             operative risk)

          9. Unable to speak or read English/French

         10. Inability to provide informed consent and comply with requirements of participation

         11. Unwilling to be followed for 2 years
