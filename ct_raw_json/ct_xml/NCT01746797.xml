      This study assesses risk factors for depressive relapse in women undergoing fertility
      treatment with histories of major depressive disorder (MDD)   The study is focused on the
      acute risk factors of depressive relapse.

      the investigators hypothesize that risk for depressive relapse will be greater among women
      who stop antidepressants compared to those who continue treatment with these agents.

      This study hopes to address the following aims:

      Specific Aim #1: To delineate the relative risk of relapse in women across treatment with
      IVF who discontinue antidepressant therapy for depression, compared to those who maintain
      treatment with these agents.

      Hypothesis: Risk for depressive relapse will be greater among women who stop antidepressants
      compared to those who continue treatment with these agents.

      Specific Aim #2: To identify predictors of depressive relapse among women receiving IVF.

      Hypothesis: Relapse rates will be greater among those who have: 1) histories of more
      recurrent depressive illness, 2) longer duration of attempt to conceive, and 3) a lower
      degree of perceived support from respective partners.

      Specific Aim #3 (exploratory): To describe the trajectory of depressive symptoms in women
      with histories of depression across the course of IVF treatment.

      Hypothesis: Specific phases of the IVF cycle will have differential effects on the burden of
      depressive symptoms. Specifically, these phases include: 1) the phase prior to egg
      retrieval, 2) the phase after embryo transfer while a woman waits for the pregnancy test or
      her menstrual period, and 3) the phase after the experience of a negative pregnancy test
      (when applicable) following an IVF cycle. We seek to characterize factors associated both
      with vulnerability to more depressive symptoms and to resilience in the context of the
      different phases of IVF treatment.

      Specific Aim #4 (exploratory): To identify biological markers of stress, including HPA axis
      dysregulation and inflammation associated with depressive relapse, during IVF treatment.

      Hypothesis: Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, evidenced by increases
      in diurnal salivary cortisol patterns and markers of inflammation, will be associated with
      higher
