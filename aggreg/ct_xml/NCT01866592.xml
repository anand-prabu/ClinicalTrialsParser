      VIP-E is a one-arm, open-label, 40-52 week extension study to continue or cross over
      subjects of the VIP study (# 814278) to active drug (adalimumab) to determine if there is
      sustained improvement in vascular inflammation, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory markers.
      VIP-E extends VIP study procedures for 40-52 weeks including questionnaires, physical exams,
      blood and urine samples, lab tests, one additional FDG-PET/CT scan, and adalimumab
      injections following FDA-approved psoriasis treatment regimen.

          6. Subject is judged to be in good general health as determined by the Principal

             physical examination.

          7. Able and willing to give written informed consent and to comply with requirements of
             this study protocol.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Previous adverse event following exposure to a TNF-alpha antagonist that led to
             discontinuation of the TNF inihibitor and contraindicates future treatment.

          2. Previous lack of response to a TNF-alpha antagonist led to discontinuation.

          3. Diagnosis of erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized pustular psoriasis, or
             medication-induced or medication-exacerbated psoriasis.

          4. Diagnosis of other active skin diseases or skin infections (bacterial, fungal, or
