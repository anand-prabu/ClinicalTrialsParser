            "textblock": "The main aims of this clinical study are to find out the maximum dose that can be given\n      safely to patients, the potential side effects of the drug and how they can be managed and\n      what happens to AZD3965 inside the body.\n\n      AZD3965 is a type of drug called a monocarboxylate transporter 1 inhibitor which is being\n      used to stop the growth of cancer cells and kill cancer cells by blocking the action of one\n      of the proteins involved in moving chemical compounds in and out of the cells of the body.\n      This will be the first time that this type of drug has been given to patients.\n\n      The drug is a capsule and is taken daily. The study is in two parts. In Part 1, small groups\n      of patients will be treated at increasing doses to find the highest safe dose and best dose\n      to give to patients in Part 2 of the study. Approximately 18 patients with advanced solid\n      tumours or lymphomas will be treated in this part.\n\n      In Part 2, the dose found to be safe in Part 1 will be given to three groups of patients\n      with either prostate cancer, gastric cancer or diffuse large B cell lymphoma. 15 patients\n      will be treated in each group.\n\n      Patients will need to visit the hospital weekly for two months and then every fortnight.\n      Patients will have regular blood and urine tests, scans, heart traces and eye tests amongst\n      other clinical tests. Research blood samples will also be taken to look at what happens to\n      the drug inside the body. Treatment will continue until a patient's cancer starts growing\n      but can continue for up to a maximum of 12 months if the cancer is responding to the drug.\n      It is important to explain that this is the first study of this drug and patients will have\n      advanced cancer so it is unlikely that patients will benefit directly from taking part but\n      the study may help improve future treatment of cancer."

The final number will depend on the number of dose escalations required to reach MTD or\n      the tolerated dose at which MCT1 is inhibited.
