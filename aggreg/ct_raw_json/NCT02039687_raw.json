Brief interaction of\n      ARA 290 with the innate repair receptor results in anti-apoptotic and anti-inflammatory\n      activities in myriad of cells, tissues and organs throughout the body to activate repair\n      mechanisms and accelerate healing, including the nerve damage that can be associated with\n      sarcoidosis.  In this study, subjects with sarcoidosis and symptoms of small fiber\n      neuropathy will administered ARA 290 or placebo by subcutaneous injection daily for 28 days.\n      In addition to monitoring the safety of the treatment, the symptoms of the subjects will be\n      assessed with several questionnaires, function tests, and measurement of nerve fibers in\n      their cornea and skin (via a non-invasive test and a biopsy, respectively).  The total\n      participation time for each patient will be 16 weeks."
