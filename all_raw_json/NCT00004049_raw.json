            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the maximum tolerated dose of SR-45023A in patients with locally\n      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. II. Determine the quantitative and qualitative toxic\n      effects of SR-45023A in these patients. III. Assess the plasma and urine pharmacokinetics of\n      SR-45023A and relate these to drug effects, if possible, in these patients. IV. Determine\n      any preliminary antitumor activity of SR-45023A in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study. Patients receive oral SR-45023A weekly. Treatment\n      continues every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of SR-45023A until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose limiting toxicity. Patients are followed for up to 1 month.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 36 patients will be accrued for this study."
