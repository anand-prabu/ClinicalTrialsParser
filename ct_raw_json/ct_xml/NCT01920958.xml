  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe effectiveness and reliability of TachoSil®  in
      lymph sealing after lymphadenectomy.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this non-interventional study (NIS) is to collect further knowledge on the
      routine use of TachoSil ® in lymph node surgery where its sealing property helps to reduce
      the rate of postoperative complications, especially of seroma formation. Some data are
      already available from gynecology, urology and thoracic surgery.
