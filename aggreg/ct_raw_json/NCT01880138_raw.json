Younger patients, particularly in\n      the age range from 1.5 to 5 yr of age, are at increased risk of EA. Preoperative anxiety, as\n      measured by the modified Yale Preoperative Anxiety Scale, has been shown to increase the\n      risk of EA for each increment of 10 points in the child's state anxiety score. So,\n      Alleviates preoperative anxiety in Children maybe decrease the incidence and severity of EA.\n      Preschool children  enjoy watching animated cartoons, and they can be immersed to animated\n      cartoon so they become oblivious of their surroundings. Therefore, viewing an animated\n      cartoon maybe reduce preoperative anxiety in children. This study was performed to determine\n      effect of animated cartoon for prevention of emergence agitation in children aged 1.5 - 5 yr\n      after general anesthesia"
