      Current steroid therapy in dry eye disease (DED) is comprised of a 2 week duration of pulse
      therapy, administered twice daily (to avoid adverse effects associated with long-term
      steroid use).  This timeframe is often too short to meaningfully resolve the inflammation
      associated with DED.  Thus, corneal specialists, including here at MEEI, have begun using
      steroid treatment of at least 6 weeks with tapered dosing.

      In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a novel imaging technology that allows the
      visualization and quantification of certain corneal features associated with DED, such as
      hyperfluorescent superficial epithelial cells, immune dendritic cells, and sub-basal nerves.
      Recent cross-sectional studies have begun to shed light on the correlation of these features
      with traditional outcome measures typically assessed in DED, such as corneal and
      conjunctival staining, Schirmer's testing, tear break-up time (TBUT), and symptom
      questionnaires.  However, longitudinal studies using IVCM to demonstrate how steroid
      treatment affects the corneal epithelial cells, dendritic cells and nerves are largely
      lacking. Furthermore, studies on the safety and efficacy of a 6 week tapered dosing steroid
      regimen are also lacking.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies have shown that inflammation plays an important role in the pathogenesis of
      Dry Eye Disease (DED).  Ocular surface inflammation often exacerbates the subject's signs
      and symptoms, and results in an increase in the immune cells and other inflammatory
      mediators located in the ocular surface. Dry eye disease is one of the most commonly
      encountered ophthalmic disorders. It is a multifactorial disease of the ocular surface and
      tear film, characterized by symptoms of eye irritation, tear instability and vision
      impairment. Despite being very common, standardized therapy is not available.

      Due to the underlying inflammation associated with DED, anti-inflammatory steroid
      medications are used for the treatment of DED. &quot;Soft steroids&quot; are often preferred because
      their chance of increasing intraocular pressure (IOP) is lower than other steroids. One of
      the &quot;soft steroids&quot; that is commonly used for the treatment of inflammation associated with
      ocular surface disease is loteprednol etabonate 0.5% ophthalmic suspension (Lotemax, Bausch
      &amp; Lomb, Inc).

      Current steroid therapy in DED is comprised of pulse therapy (to avoid adverse events
      associated with long-term steroid use) of usually 2 weeks duration, administered BID.  This
      timeframe is often too short to meaningfully resolve the inflammation associated with DED.
      More recently steroid treatment of at least 6 weeks with tapered dosing has been advocated.

      Lotemax, an FDA-approved medication for ocular inflammatory disease, is commonly used to
      treat inflammation associated with DED with a regimen of twice daily for 2 weeks. However,
      because DED is a chronic disease, this short duration of steroid therapy may not be enough
      to meaningfully resolve the inflammation associated with DED. Thus, corneal specialists,
      including here at MEEI, have begun using Lotemax for at least 6 weeks with tapered dosing.
      This study has been designed to evaluate the effects of this tapering regimen on
      inflammation associated with DED.

      Clinical signs and symptoms are used to evaluate the efficacy of a treatment for DED,
      including Schirmer's test, tear break-up test, corneal fluorescein staining, and
      conjunctival lissamine green staining. However, none of these tests evaluate the underlying
      inflammatory and immune response changes in DED. Therefore, to determine the efficacy of any
      treatment for DED, it is ideal to evaluate these underlying changes in addition to the
      clinical parameters.

      In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a novel imaging technology that allows the
      visualization and quantification of corneal structures at the cellular level. IVCM has
      recently been used to evaluate the corneal changes in DED, such as hyperfluorescent
      superficial epithelial cells, immune dendritic cells, and sub-basal nerves.

      Therefore, in this randomized clinical trial, IVCM images will be used to determine the
      changes in corneal immune cells and nerves during a 6-week taper regimen of Lotemax versus
      Soothe Tired Eyes Lubricant Eye Drop (Glycerin 1.0%, Bausch &amp; Lomb Inc.) (an artificial
      tear) for treatment of inflammation associated with DED.

    <description>Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate) 0.5% is a prescription-only, preserved ophthalmic suspension supplied by Bausch &amp; Lomb, Inc. Lotemax (loteprednol etabonate) 0.5% has been approved by the FDA for treatment of ocular inflammation with a maximum dosing frequency of 24 drops per eye per day. It is a C-20 ester-based corticosteroid, with a potent anti-inflammatory efficacy, but decreased impact on intraocular pressure (IOP) compared to other corticosteroids, which may increase IOP.  The medication will be applied topically to both eyes for 6 weeks with the following regimen: four times a day for 2 weeks, twice daily for 2 weeks, and once daily for 2 weeks.</description>
