Rest and stress scans were acquired on a Siemens Accel\u2122\n      PET scanner in 2D (septa extended) and 3D (septa retracted) modes. Rb-82 doses were rest\n      53+/-5 mCi and stress 53+/-6 mCi. Imaging times were 2D emission scan for 3 mins (90 sec\n      delay post Rb-82 infusion), followed by a 3 minute, 3D gated emission scan (180 sec delay).\n      Decay and shorter acquisition times led to a 62% reduction in the effective dosage 2D vs 3D\n      datasets. 3D images were first pre-processed using a Monte-Carlo scatter and prompt gamma\n      correction algorithm (Imagen3D\u2122) then reconstructed using ImagenProTM (CVIT, Kansas City,\n      MO).  Reconstructed images were evaluated using relative, 17 segment raw scores (Cedars\n      QPET). Studies were read by consensus of 2-blinded readers for: image quality (1-4,\n      poor-excellent), interpretive certainty (1-3, low-high) and rest perfusion using a 17\n      segment model (0=normal; 1-3 = mild, moderate, or severe perfusion defects). Stress\n      segmental scores were not evaluated due to differences in imaging start time post\n      dipyridamole infusion."
