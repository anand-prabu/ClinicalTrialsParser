II. Evaluate the\n      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 1 hour followed by gemcitabine IV over 30\n      minutes on days 1, 8, and 15 of each 4 week course. Treatment is repeated for a maximum of\n      six courses in the absence of unacceptable toxicity or disease progression. Patients are\n      followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 3 years, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 44 patients will be accrued over 19 months for this study."
