  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and its related disorders (e.g., trichotillomania) are
      characterized by the marked difficulty in inhibiting unwanted or inappropriate responses.
      There is compelling evidence that poor response inhibition is a core cognitive feature of
      OCD and its related disorders, but no effective intervention exists that directly attempts
      to address this problematic cognitive deficiency. This study will examine the feasibility
      and clinical utility of a computerized cognitive training program designed to improve
      response inhibition among individuals diagnosed with OCD or trichotillomania.This training
      program offers systematic practice of response inhibition in the form of a 40-level computer
      game. Individuals with these conditions will be randomized to either 8 sessions of (a)
      computerized response inhibition training (RIT) or (b) placebo computer training (PLT). We
      hypothesize that RIT will outperform PLT in improving response inhibition capabilities and
      reducing relevant clinical symptoms. In sum, this project is expected to generate important
      knowledge to guide the development of effective computer-based treatment approaches that may
      help reduce critical problems of existing treatments such as suboptimal patient retention
      and treatment under-utilization, thereby improving overall treatment response rates among
      individuals suffering from OCD and related conditions.
