            "textblock": "BACKGROUND:\n\n      The VA HDL Intervention trial (VA-HIT) was a multicenter, placebo controlled, randomized\n      trial that showed that gemfibrozil significantly reduced major cardiovascular events in 2531\n      men with coronary heart disease, low levels of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and\n      low levels of high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. In addition to its unique lipid\n      profile, the VA-HIT population also had a high prevalence of diabetes, impaired fasting\n      glucose, or high fasting plasma insulin; central obesity; and hypertension, which are all\n      components (together with high triglycerides and low HDL-cholesterol) of a constellation of\n      risk factors known as the metabolic syndrome. Since prior clinical trials have not enrolled\n      this type of population, the VA- HIT database is a unique resource.\n\n      DESIGN NARRATIVE:\n\n      The study used the VA-HIT database to study additional risk markers that  were measured in\n      the study population of 2,531 men with coronary heart disease.  Specific analyses were:  1)\n      the association between levels of glucose tolerance, insulin resistance and other features\n      of the metabolic syndrome, occurrence of major cardiovascular outcomes, and gemfibrozil\n      efficacy; 2)  the effect of gemfibrozil on progression of carotid atherosclerosis, as\n      measured by B-mode ultrasound; 3) the association between LDL particle size distribution and\n      lipoprotein subclass distribution; homocysteine; lipoprotein(a); C-reactive protein, tissue\n      plasminogen activator; fibrinogen; and factor VII; major cardiovascular outcomes and\n      gemfibrozil efficacy."
