  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to confirm that enalapril maleate and folic acid tablets is
      more effective in preventing renal function decline among the patients with primary
      hypertension when compared to enalapril maleate.

    <textblock>
      Elevated blood concentration of homocysteine (Hcy) has been suggested as a modifiable,
      independent risk factor for coronary artery disease, stroke, and deep vein thrombosis.
      Prevalence of hyperhomocysteinemia and folic acid deficiency in China are significantly
      higher than those in Europe and USA. The investigators' preliminary research demonstrated
      that blood concentration of Hcy was negatively correlated to estimated glomerular filtration
      rate (eGFR), a key index of kidney function. However, the question as to whether
      Hcy-lowering therapy with folic acid can reduce the risk of chronic kidney disease(CKD)
      remains to be answered.

      This study, exploiting the hypertensive population of CSPPT trial (ClinicalTrials.gov
      register number: NCT00794885), is intended to compare the effects of  enalapril maleate and
      folic acid tablets versus  enalapril maleate in preventing renal function decline among the
      patients with primary hypertension.  The results from this trial may have the potential to
      transform current clinical and public health findings into practice in the prevention of
      chronic kidney disease(CKD) in China.

(1) A certain drop in eGFR, was defined as a drop in GFR category (≥90[G1], 60-89[G2], 45-59[G3a], 30-44[G3b], 15-29[G4], &lt;15[G5] ml/min/1.73m2) accompanied by a 25% or greater drop in eGFR from baseline; (2) Rapid progression, was defined as a sustained decline in eGFR of more than 5 ml/min/1.73m2/yr.</description>
