The ability of AZT\n      to suppress HIV, to improve body defenses, and to prevent the occurrence or development of\n      AIDS or advanced ARC is being evaluated.\n\n      In one human study, patients with AIDS or advanced ARC who received AZT had fewer\n      life-threatening infections, improved in weight and performance, and lived longer than\n      patients who received a placebo (inactive medication). Further studies are needed because\n      toxic effects associated with the use of AZT were noted and the long-term effectiveness and\n      toxicity of AZT are still unknown. It is also unknown if AZT will benefit patients with less\n      severe HIV infections such as early ARC or PGL."

It is also unknown if AZT will benefit patients with less\n      severe HIV infections such as early ARC or PGL.\n\n      Patients accepted into the study are randomly assigned to receive either AZT or placebo.\n      Treatment continues for a minimum of 104 weeks beyond the time the last patient enters the\n      study. If the study medication causes toxic effects, the dose is decreased or temporarily\n      stopped, and if the toxic effects are severe, then the medication will be stopped\n      permanently. Participants visit the clinic every 2 weeks during the first 16 weeks and once\n      a month thereafter. Throughout the study frequent blood samples are taken to monitor the\n      effectiveness and safety of the treatment. AMENDED: The placebo arm has been discontinued as\n      of August 3, 1989 and the AZT dose has been reduced."
