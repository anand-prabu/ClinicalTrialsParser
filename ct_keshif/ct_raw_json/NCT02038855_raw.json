We will first test a screening of\n      comorbid problems with patients identified in mental health as well as primary health care.\n      Building on that work, we will test the feasibility, acceptability and efficacy of the\n      \"Integrated Intervention for Dual Problems and Early Action\" (IIDEA) intervention addressing\n      mental health, substance use, and prevention of HIV, as well as a smoking cessation\n      supplement. The project is being conducted in Massachusetts as well as at two sites in\n      Spain. As such, the proposed ILRP multi-site international project is a critical step\n      towards developing models of integrated care for the large and diverse Latino migrant\n      population and more broadly towards understanding how best to integrate evidence-based\n      assessment and treatments for co-occurring substance and mental health problems and HIV\n      risks."

We intend to test the referral process for screened participants in need of\n      treatment to identify barriers and streamline the process. We will analyze data to optimize\n      the screening battery and protocol to use in Phase 2, the IIDEA intervention.\n\n      In Phase 2, we intend to enroll, randomize and collect data on 360 total patients across the\n      3 sites - 180 in the intervention condition and 180 in the control condition (120 in each\n      site, 60 in the intervention condition and 60 in the control condition). 8-10 session IIDEA\n      intervention will be offered to Latino patients by trained clinicians with at least a\n      Masters level of training. The intervention is designed to help patients to address and\n      prevent mental health and substance use problems and will be culturally adapted to Latino\n      populations in Boston, Madrid and Barcelona. Usual care - the control group - receives\n      treatment as usual, for patients in primary care identified with a mental health or\n      substance use problem. 4 Research interviews will be conducted to assess outcomes, for\n      patients in both the intervention and usual care arms."
