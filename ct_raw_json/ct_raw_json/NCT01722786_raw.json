Characterisation of therapeutic strategies in stopping acute life-threatening bleeding\n           including following agents and methods:\n\n             1. blood transfusion,\n\n             2. platelet concentrates\n\n             3. reversal agents [e.g. vitamin K, prothrombin complex concentrate (PCC), activated\n                PCC (aPCC), activated factor VII (aVII), fibrinogen concentrate, fresh frozen\n                plasma (FFP)]\n\n             4. haemodialysis\n\n             5. desmopressin\n\n             6. tranexamic acid\n\n             7. no specific treatment in respect to the above mentioned treatments (e.g. stop of\n                medication and waiting until anticoagulant effect of DOA is decreased)."
