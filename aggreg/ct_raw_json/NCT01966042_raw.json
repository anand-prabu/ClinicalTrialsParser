Thus stem cell therapy has become a promising procedure for the\n      large number of patients with refractory angina due to coronary disease, despite of the use\n      of multiple anti-angina medications, remain severely symptomatic with disabling angina.\n\n      Stem cell therapy using autologous cells from the patient's bone marrow, has been shown to\n      be safe and associated with improved myocardial perfusion, reducing the symptoms of advanced\n      coronary artery disease and increasing the functional capacity of patients whose therapeutic\n      armamentarium available today has been exhausted.\n\n      The study hypothesis was that the infusion of autologous mononuclear cells derived from the\n      patient's bone marrow and delivered via intramyocardial injection in patients with\n      refractory angina and normal or slightly depressed ventricular function, promote improvement\n      in the anginal symptoms and myocardial perfusion by the inducing neoangiogenesis."

It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.\nIt consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.\nOne patient was lost before answering the questionnaire post procedure.",

Each domain of the questionnaire was evaluated as a quantitative variable and the medians were retrieved before and after the procedure.\nThe SF-36 is a multi-purpose, short-form health survey with only 36 questions. It yields an 8-scale profile of functional health and well-being scores as well as psychometrically-based physical and mental health summary measures and a preference-based health utility index.\nIt consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e. a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.\nOne patient was lost before answering the questionnaire post procedure.",

The study\n      was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) and all patients gave informed consent\n      prior to participation.\n\n      Refractory angina patients were defined as those with functional class IV (angina at rest)\n      according to the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification (CCSAC) despite\n      maximum medical therapy, not suitable for conventional myocardial revascularization and\n      viable myocardium confirmed by nuclear imaging.\n\n      Patients were evaluated according to different parameters, for a total period of 12 months,\n      and the primary objectives were:\n\n        1. Improvement in functional class and angina symptoms (CCSAC) of the patients with\n           refractory angina pectoris after the infusion of autologous bone marrow mononuclear\n           cells after the intervention;\n\n        2. Improvement in myocardial perfusion before and after cell delivery;\n\n        3. Evaluate the safety of the delivery of autologous bone marrow mononuclear cells route\n           in individuals with refractory angina.\n\n      In the screening evaluation, individuals with the presumptive diagnosis of class IV\n      refractory angina and who met all study criteria were approached about the possibility of\n      participating in the study by the principal investigator. Then, the patients were submitted\n      to a baseline evaluation with a serious of blood and image tests.\n\n      The interventions were the Bone Marrow Aspiration - For each patient, a total of 100 cc of\n      bone marrow was aspirated from the iliac crest at the time of anesthesia for their cardiac\n      surgery - and the Infusion - After processing the cells, the surgeon delivered it by a\n      series of epicardial injections into the left ventricular myocardium.\n\n      The processing of bone marrow autologous cells aimed to enrich the content of the bone\n      marrow aspirate, separating the mononuclear fraction from the cells which were already\n      differentiated.\n\n      The postoperative stage was conducted in an identical way to that of patients who undergo to\n      a myocardial revascularization surgery. It is important to mention that both the ICU and the\n      ward time varied according to the patient's individual evolution.\n\n      Finally, the first follow up visit took place at 1 month after the surgery. The subsequent\n      visits were held at 3, 6 and 12 months after the procedure."
