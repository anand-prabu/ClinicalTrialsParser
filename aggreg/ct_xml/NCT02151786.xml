  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this survey is to evaluate the safety (i.e., frequency of adverse events) and
      efficacy (i.e., hemostatic effect, rate of rebleeding after confirmation of hemostasis) of
      administration of lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg (Takepron Intravenous 30 mg) to a large
      number of patients in daily medical practice.

    <textblock>
      This survey was designed to evaluate the safety (i.e., frequency of adverse events) and
      efficacy (i.e., hemostatic effect, rate of rebleeding after confirmation of hemostasis) of
      administration of lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg (Takepron Intravenous 30 mg) to a large
      number of patients in daily medical practice.

      For adults, 30 mg of lansoprazole is typically mixed in physiological saline (JP) or 5%
      glucose solution for injection (JP) and administered twice daily by drip infusion or
      dissolved in 20 mL of physiological saline (JP) or 5% glucose solution for injection (JP)
      and administered twice daily by direct slow intravenous injection.

    <description>The frequencies of all adverse events observed during the observation period will be tabulated by type and seriousness. Adverse events are defined as any unfavorable and unintended signs, symptoms or diseases temporally associated with administration of lansoprazole whether or not it was considered related to treatment. Among these, events that are considered as having a causal relationship with lansoprazole are defined as adverse drug reactions.</description>

    <description>In patients for whom hemostasis is confirmed by endoscopy, the frequencies of hemostatic effects of lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg are tabulated by the degree of improvement (i.e., &quot;markedly improved,&quot; &quot;moderately improved,&quot; &quot;slightly improved,&quot; and &quot;poor&quot;).</description>

    <description>In patients for whom hemostasis is confirmed by endoscopy performed after the start of treatment with lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg, the rebleeding rates during the period starting from baseline until the completion of treatment with lansoprazole intravenous 30 mg are tabulated.</description>
