    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects diagnosed with T2DM and treated with metformin equal to or above 1000 mg/day
             and SU (gliclazide, glipizide or glyburide/glibenclamide at maximum tolerated dose
             (at least half maximum approved dose) or glimepiride at maximum tolerated dose (at
             least 2 mg/day)), both at a stable dose for at least 90 days prior to screening.
             Stable is defined as unchanged medication and dose

          -  HbA1c 7.0-10.0% (53- 86 mmol/mol) (both inclusive)

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) equal to or above 20 kg/m^2

          -  Subjects who have expressed their intention to fast (daytime, i.e. between sunrise
             and sunset) during Ramadan after receiving medical counselling regarding the risk of
             fasting

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Any contraindication for successful and sustained fasting from a medical perspective
             at the discretion of the investigator (such as acute illness, severe hypoglycaemia
             within 90 days prior to screening, a history of recurrent hypoglycaemia,
             hypoglycaemia unawareness, ketoacidosis within 90 days prior to screening,
             hyperosmolar hyperglycaemic coma within 90 days prior to screening, subjects
             performing intense physical labour)

          -  Any chronic disorder or severe disease which, in the opinion of the investigator
             might jeopardise subject's safety or compliance with the protocol

          -  History of chronic pancreatitis or idiopathic acute pancreatitis

          -  Screening calcitonin value equal to or above 50 ng/L

          -  Personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) or multiple endocrine
             neoplasia syndrome type 2 (MEN 2)

          -  Impaired liver function, defined as alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) equal to or above
             2.5 times upper normal limit (UNL)

          -  Impaired renal function defined as estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below
             60 mL/min/1.73 m^2 per Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) formula)

          -  Any episode of unstable angina, acute coronary event, cerebral stroke/transient
             ischemic attack (TIA) or other significant cardiovascular event as judged by the
             investigator within 90 days prior to screening

          -  Diagnosis of malignant neoplasm in the previous 5 years (except basal cell skin
             cancer or squamous cell skin cancer)
