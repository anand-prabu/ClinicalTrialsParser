The loss of antimicrobial, buffering, cleansing and remineralizing\n      effects of saliva markedly increases the risk for dental caries.  Extractions of diseased\n      teeth located in irradiated bone and dental infection involving the bone can trigger\n      osteoradionecrosis (ORN), another serious complication of high dose radiation of the jaws.\n      Therefore, current dental treatment guidelines recommend the extraction of diseased teeth\n      and any teeth that might require extraction in the future, before radiation therapy. (NCI,\n      1990; Rankin et al, 2003; NIDCR, 2005) As a result, patients with head and neck cancer often\n      have many or all teeth extracted, especially those patients who are judged unlikely to\n      comply with lifelong, daily topical fluoride, oral hygiene practices and frequent\n      professional dental care.

Saliva production will be stimulated by dabbing a mild citric acid solution that tastes like lemon onto the tongue using a Q-Tip. After this test, subjects will also be asked to chew wax to simulate saliva, and the saliva that accumulates in their mouth will be collected by spitting into a test tube.",
