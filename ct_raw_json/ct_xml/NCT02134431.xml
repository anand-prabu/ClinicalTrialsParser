  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microbicides are topical medicines that can prevent infection by Human Immunodeficiency
      Virus (HIV).  Microbicide medicine has yet to be studied in adolescents, a key group that is
      becoming infected with HIV all over the world.  From past research, we know that at
      different ages people experience age-related changes in their bodies that can cause
      differences in how they process medications. In this study, gut tissue samples (or gut
      biopsies) from  12 HIV-negative volunteers will be collected.  These pieces of tissue will
      be infected with HIV in the laboratory to develop a model that can be used to test certain
      drugs against the HIV infection.  We can use this tissue to test a drug called tenofovir
      against HIV infection.  We will determine whether this drug can decrease HIV infection in
      the gut biopsies.   In this study, we will also measure HIV levels and the levels of
      tenofovir in gut and blood samples in 12 people who are already taking this drug.  This
      information can determine whether levels of drug found in the gut can protect it from HIV.
      The results can be compared to other age groups of adolescents and adults.  Subjects will
      undergo a common procedure called a lower endoscopy (this can be a colonoscopy or a flexible
      sigmoidoscopy) to obtain gut biopsy samples.

      The central hypothesis is that tissue drug profiles of tenofovir (TFV) and its active
      component, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), and tissue infectibility vary between
      younger (10-14 years old) versus older adolescents (18-21 years old), and that both differ
      from adults (&gt;21 years). Specifically, younger HIV positive adolescents will have lower
      levels of tissue tenofovir compared to older HIV positive adolescents and adults in an
      age-dependent manner. Additionally, biopsies from younger HIV negative adolescents will
      have: 1) higher rates of infection compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents
      infected with a lower dose of virus; and 2) lower percent suppression of tissue infectivity
      compared to biopsies from older HIV negative adolescents using low dose tenofovir.
