      Clarification regarding injection volumes for the different study groups:

      Subjects will be randomized to Group A or Group B (1:1).

        -  Group A: 0,63ml NaCl will be used to reconstitute toxin in the vial. 0,05mL will be
           injected (equal to a dose of 10s.U.)

        -  Group B: 1,25ml NaCl will be used to reconstitute toxin in the vial. 0,1 mL will be
           injected (equal to a dose of 10s.U.).

      The two different reconstitution volumes (each containing a dose of 10s.U. botulinum toxin
      A) will be compared as described under objectives.

        Key Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Women, 18 to 64 years of age

          -  Subjects seeking treatment for moderate to severe glabellar lines when the severity
             of these lines has an important psychological impact on the subject, as determined by
             the investigator.

        Key Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subjects previously treated with any botulinum toxin product.

          -  Pregnant or breast feeding women or women intending to get pregnant in the next 12
             months.

          -  Subjects with signs and symptoms of eyelid or brow ptosis or signs of compensatory
             frontalis muscle activity, as judged by the investigator.

          -  Subjects with clinical or subclinical neuromuscular junctional disorders (e.g.
             myasthenia gravis, Lambert Eaton syndrome or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis) or a
             history of dysphagia or aspiration.

          -  Subjects with previous or current diagnosis of Bell's paresis.

          -  Subjects with known bleeding disorders or subjects who are taking thrombolytics or
             anticoagulants.

          -  Subjects who are taking anticholinergics or aminoglycoside antibiotics.

          -  Any prior surgery in the facial area that, in the opinion of the investigator, may
             interfere with the results.

          -  Subjects treated with fillers, HA filler or permanent filler, in the upper face one
             year or less from screening.
