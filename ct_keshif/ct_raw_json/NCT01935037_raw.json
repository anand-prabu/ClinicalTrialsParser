It prevents the tumor cells from multiplying by\n      damaging their DNA, which in turn stops the tumor from growing. However, a protein, called\n      Wee1, may play a role in helping to repair damaged tumor cells, so that the tumor continues\n      to grow.\n\n      MK-1775 is a new drug which may block Wee1 protein activity. When given in combination with\n      chemotherapy drug cisplatin, MK-1775 may help prevent the Wee1 protein from repairing\n      damaged tumor cells without causing harm to normal cells. This is believed to increase the\n      effectiveness of cisplatin."
