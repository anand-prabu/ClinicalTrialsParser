            "textblock": "Treatment with DiaPep277\u00ae is expected to be long-term; stopping treatment may result in the\n      eventual loss of the preserved beta-cell function. Indeed, extension of phase 2 studies has\n      shown that patients who were initially treated with DiaPep277\u00ae and maintained their initial\n      beta-cell function, required continuation of treatment, losing beta-cell function if\n      switched to Placebo. These extension studies were too small for the outcome to be\n      statistically significant, but they suggested that continuation of treatment is needed for\n      long-term maintenance of efficacy.\n\n      Therefore, in this extension study, patients who complete the 1001 phase 3 study and\n      maintain clinically significant beta-cell function are offered a 2-year continuation of\n      active treatment, since they are likely to benefit from use of the medication. The\n      participation in the extension study will be offered to all eligible subjects who complete\n      the 1001 study, regardless of the treatment arm allocation in the initial study.\n\n      By achieving long-term preservation of beta-cell function, patients are expected to maintain\n      good management of the disease, manifesting as better glycemic control and fewer\n      hypoglycemic events."
