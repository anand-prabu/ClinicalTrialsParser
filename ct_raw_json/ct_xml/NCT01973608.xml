    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, open-label, parallel group, partly randomized dose escalation trial to
      assess the safety and efficacy of a low dose, an intermediate dose, and high dose MSB0010445
      given by intravenous infusion to subjects with advanced (unresectable or metastatic)
      melanoma in combination with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT).
