As the bioavailability of Flumazenil is expected to be lower\n      than the IV administration, 1.1 mg and 2.2 mg will be tested in sublingual delivery. The\n      suggested doses in this study are very safe according to the following data: first,\n      sublingual and buccal administration of Flumazenil have been detailed previously with\n      similar and higher doses with no side effects, secondly, IV dose may reach 3 mg and thirdly,\n      oral administration has been reported as up to 600 mg/dose.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to determine the single dose PK profile of SL CRLS035.  This\n      study is designed to collect short-term safety data and to monitor the PK profile of\n      CRLS035.\n\n      Primary Objective The primary objective is to determine the single dose safety and PK\n      profile of SL CRLS035 using the marketed IV flumazenil formulation as the comparator.\n\n      Secondary Objectives The secondary objectives are to (1) characterize the concentration time\n      course of two dose levels of SL CRLS035 to support dose selection for Phase 2 and 3 studies\n      and to evaluate the safety and tolerability of flumazenil formulations; (2)To evaluate the\n      effect of high fat diet and water consumption on the PK profile."
