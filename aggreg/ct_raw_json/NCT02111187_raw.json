A condom is also required to\n                  be used by vasectomized men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in\n                  order to prevent delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid. Sexually\n                  active males must be willing to use a condom during intercourse while taking the\n                  study drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and agree\n                  not to father a child during this period.\n\n         13.
