Insulin resistance with resulting hyperinsulinemia is also common among women\n      with PCOS, along with increased risk for dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes and related\n      cardiovascular consequences. Resveratrol is a natural polyphenol with anti-carcinogenic,\n      anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic properties, that has been shown to decrease\n      proliferation and steroidogenesis in theca cells, emerging as a potential therapeutic agent\n      in PCOS patients. However, little is known about its potential beneficial effect on oocyte\n      quality as well as other reproductive outcomes, such as implantation an pregnancy rates. The\n      present study evaluates effects of resveratrol on selected biochemical parameters and\n      reproductive outcome among patients with PCOS who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF)."
