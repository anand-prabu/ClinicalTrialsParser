Participants will have a cannula fitted and the first of the half-hourly blood samples will be taken (time point: -1hr). Participants will then be asked to sit quietly for 60 minutes to achieve a steady state. Following this, participants will have another blood sample taken and then be provided with a standardised mixed meal breakfast (09:00am) (time point: 0h). Blood sampling will continue at 30 minutes intervals for 3 hours following breakfast. A second, lunch meal (12:00pm), will be then be consumed over 15 minutes. Blood sampling will then continue at 30 minute intervals for 3 hours following lunch."

            "textblock": "The number of people diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is increasing rapidly and about\n      2.9 million people in the UK currently have diabetes. There is increasing evidence\n      suggesting that prolonged sedentary time may actually increase the risk of diabetes and\n      other chronic diseases. Importantly, adults can meet public health guidelines on physical\n      activity (150 minutes of moderate activity per week), but if they still sit for prolonged\n      periods, their metabolic health is compromised. Going from sitting to standing and carrying\n      out light-intensity activities (such as casual walking) may reduce diabetes risk.  However,\n      no one has investigated the effect of standing and walking on markers of cardio-metabolic\n      markers in individuals with a high risk of T2DM. Therefore, the aim is to find out whether\n      reducing the amount of time people spend sitting and replacing it with standing and light\n      intensity activity (walking) reduces glucose, insulin and triglyceride levels, therefore\n      reducing the risk of diabetes."
