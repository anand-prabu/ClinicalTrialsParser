      This is a clinical study to determine the efficacy and safety of the Glide, hair removal
      photo-depilation device, for removing facial hairs. During the first stage, the subjects
      will perform up to 6 face treatments, two weeks apart.  The treatment's safety and
      efficiency will be evaluated at 4 weeks of after last treatment and at 12 weeks after last
      treatment.
