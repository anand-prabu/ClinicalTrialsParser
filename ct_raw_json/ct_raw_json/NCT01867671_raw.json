Eligible participants with peanut allergy will be\n      randomly assigned to receive either peanut OIT or placebo for 134 weeks followed by peanut\n      avoidance for 26 weeks.\n\n      An initial oral food challenge (OFC) to 1 g of peanut flour (500 mg peanut protein) will be\n      conducted. Participants must have a clinical reaction during this OFC to initiate study\n      dosing. After the initial OFC, the study design includes four phases:\n\n        -  Initial dose escalation (1 day): Peanut or placebo dosing will be given incrementally\n           and increase every 20 minutes until a dose of 12 mg peanut flour (6 mg peanut protein)\n           or placebo flour is given.\n\n        -  Build-up (30 weeks): Initial observed dose administration of highest tolerated dose,\n           followed by daily OIT at home with return visit every 2 weeks for dose escalation.\n\n        -  Maintenance (104 weeks):The participant will continue on daily OIT with return visits\n           every 13 weeks. At the end of this phase the participant will undergo a blinded OFC to\n           10 g peanut flour (5 g peanut protein).\n\n        -  Avoidance (26 weeks): In this final phase participants will be seen every 13 weeks. At\n           the completion of this phase participants will have a final blinded OFC to 10g peanut\n           flour (5 g peanut protein)."
