Moderate physical activity during 25 min in children decreases the  cortisol levels in\n           response to the Trier Social Stress Test TSST-C (for children).\n\n        2. Moderate physical activity during 25 min in children decreases the  snacking (calorie\n           consumption when corrected for expenditure and switch in quality of food intake) in\n           response to the Trier Social Stress Test TSST-C (for children).\n\n        3. A secure attachment will be a moderating factor for the general increase in cortisol\n           and the snacking in response to the psychosocial stress test (Trier Social Stress Test\n           TSST-C).\n\n      Secondary objectives:\n\n        1. To test if the impact of physical activity on stress responses and snacking differs\n           between obese and non-obese children\n\n        2. To test the impact of physical activity on the cardiovascular stress reactivity (blood\n           pressure, heart rate) and the perceived stress (scale) in response to the Trier Social\n           Stress Test TSST-C?\n\n        3. To test if the stress reactivity and its modulation by physical activity is different\n           in anxious and in impulsives/labile children\n\n        4. To test if serious life events and parental worries and parental educational style\n           influence the stress reactivity"
