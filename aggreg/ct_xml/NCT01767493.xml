    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility of [18F]Florbetapir positron
      emission tomography (PET) for assessment of demyelination in the patients with relapsing
      remitting multiple sclerosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The underlying goal of this study is to assess the feasibility of [18F]Florbetapir as an
      imaging tool to detect demyelination in the brain of MS research participants and compare to
      similarly aged healthy subjects.

             the informed consent

          -  Subjects of childbearing potential must practice effective contraception during the

             completed

          -  For females, must be of non-childbearing potential or have a negative urine and blood
             pregnancy test on the day of [18F]Florbetapir PET injection

        Inclusion Criteria (Healthy Volunteers):

          -  No history of or signs of acute or chronic neurological or psychiatric illness based
             on evaluation by a research physician.

        Inclusion Criteria (MS Subjects):

          -  Have a diagnosis of relapsing remitting MS according to the 2010 MacDonald Criteria

          -  Have at least 10 demyelinating lesion on brain MRI with the following
             characteristics:

          -  Hypointense on T2 weighted images with FLAIR

        Exclusion Criteria (for all subjects):

          -  The subject has clinically significant abnormal laboratory value and/or clinically
             significant unstable medical or psychiatric illness

          -  The subject has evidence of clinically significant gastrointestinal, cardiovascular,
             hepatic, renal, hematological, neoplastic, endocrine, alternative neurological (other
             than RRMS), immunodeficiency, pulmonary, or other disorder or disease.

          -  Women who are pregnant or actively breastfeeding

          -  The subject has any disorder that may interfere with drug absorption, distribution,
             metabolism, or excretion (including gastrointestinal surgery)

          -  The subject has participated in another clinical study within the previous 30 days

          -  Renal impairment with a creatine clearance &lt;80mL/minute at screening (creatine
             clearance estimated by Cockcroft-Gault equation)
