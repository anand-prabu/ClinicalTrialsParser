The investigators are studying whether subjects who undergo Endoscopic\n      Esophageal Myotomy will have similar functional outcome, and at the same time less pain,\n      scar formation and wound infection than with laparoscopic or open surgery."

            "textblock": "The purpose of this research study is to find out more about a less invasive way of doing\n      the surgical procedure (esophageal myotomy) to treat Achalasia.\n\n      Achalasia is a disease of the esophagus, where the lower esophageal sphincter fails to\n      relax, causing difficulty in swallowing.\n\n      Esophageal myotomy (Heller myotomy) is surgically cutting the muscle fibers of the\n      esophageal sphincter to allow passage of food into the stomach.\n\n      Esophageal myotomy is routinely done either by laparoscopic or open surgery. Laparoscopic\n      surgery requires several (about 4 to 5) small incisions in the abdomen to allow the camera\n      and surgical instruments to be introduced into the abdominal cavity to perform the myotomy.\n      In open surgery, a 6- to 8-inch abdominal incision is made to gain access to the abdominal\n      cavity to perform the myotomy.\n\n      Endoscopic Esophageal Myotomy (POEM), the research procedure, splits the lower esophageal\n      sphincter muscle fibers from the inside of the esophagus, avoiding several abdominal\n      incisions.\n\n      The researchers are investigating how safe Endoscopic Esophageal Myotomy is and how well it\n      works. Additionally, the researchers will assess the level of pain and the amount of\n      scarring subjects has after this surgery."
