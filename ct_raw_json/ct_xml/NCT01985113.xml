    <textblock>
      In pre-clinical study the investigators found that the thioredoxin reductase activity of
      serum harbours huge difference between cancer patients and non-cancer patients, the enzyme
      activity elevated remarkably among cancer patients, so the investigators hypothesis that
      this is due to tumor cells loading of the patients, the enzyme activity may harbours huge
      difference between carcinoma tissues and para-carcinoma tissues in early staged non-small
      cell lung cancers, and after surgery, the enzyme activity may fall down to a normal level
      because of removing of tumor.

      This is a cooperative research project in Thoracic Surgery Department and Medical Oncology
      Department of Affiliated Cancer Hospital of xiangya School of Medicine Central South
      University, and the State Key Laboratory for Natural Medicine and Biomimetic Drugs Perking
      University. The primary objective is to measure the thioredoxin reductase activity using
      blood and lung cancer tissue and measure thioredoxin reductase messenger ribonucleic acid
      (mRNA) and protein expression using lung cancer and pericarcinomatous tissue in early
      staged(Ⅰ~ⅢA) non-small lung cancers, to study the correlations of thioredoxin reductase
      between blood and tissue. The secondary objectives are to measure the thioredoxin reductase
      activity between non small lung cancers and lung benign lesion patients to identify the
      difference between tumor and lung benign mass.
