The patient has severe senile degenerative aortic valve stenosis determined by\n             resting or dobutamine stress echocardiogram and Doppler, or simultaneous pressure\n             recordings at cardiac catheterization defined as: mean gradient >40 mmHg or peak jet\n             velocity >4.0 m/s and an aortic valve area \u22640.8 cm2 or aortic valve area index \u22640.5\n             cm2/m2.\n\n          2. The patient has moderate to severe symptoms from aortic valve stenosis (NYHA\n             Functional Class \u2265III).\n\n          3. The patient must have a predicted risk of operative mortality or serious irreversible\n             morbidity of >50% at 30 days, or be deemed not suitable for surgery for other\n             reasons. This conclusion shall be based on consensus of one cardiologist and two\n             cardiac surgeons at the investigational site after careful consideration of the\n             patient's STS risk score and co-morbidities, and after at least one of the surgeons\n             participating in the decision has personally examined the patient.\n\n          4. The patient been informed of the nature of the study, agrees to its provisions, is\n             willing to comply with protocol-specified follow-up evaluations and has provided\n             written informed consent, approved by the appropriate IRB.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1.

Any percutaneous coronary or peripheral interventional procedure performed within 30\n             days prior to the study procedure\n\n          4.

Patients with a platelet count of <50,000 cells/mm\u00b3 or a WBC < 1000 cells/mm\u00b3 within\n             7 days prior to index procedure.\n\n          6. Patients with a history of bleeding diathesis or coagulopathy or patients in whom\n             anti-platelet and/or anticoagulant therapy is contraindicated, or who will refuse\n             transfusion.\n\n          7. Patients who have received any organ transplant or are on a waiting list for any\n             organ transplant.\n\n          8. Patients with known other medical illness (e.g. carcinomas, chronic liver disease,\n             chronic renal disease or chronic end stage pulmonary disease) or known history of\n             substance abuse that may cause non-compliance with the protocol, confound the data\n             interpretation or is associated with a life expectancy of less than one year, or\n             expectation that patient will not improve despite treatment of aortic stenosis.\n\n          9. Patients with known hypersensitivity or contraindication to aspirin, heparin,\n             clopidogrel/ticlopidine, and/or contrast sensitivity that cannot be adequately\n             pre-medicated.\n\n         10. Patients with a history of a stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) within the\n             prior 6 months.\n\n         11. Patients with an active gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding within the prior 6 months.\n\n         12. Patients presenting with hemodynamic instability or cardiogenic shock defined by low\n             cardiac output, vasopressor dependence, or mechanical hemodynamic support.\n\n         13. Patients who have a planned treatment with any other investigational device or\n             procedure during the study period, or who are currently participating in an\n             investigational drug or another device trial\n\n         14. Any planned surgical, percutaneous coronary or peripheral procedure to be performed\n             prior to the 30 day follow-up from the TAVR procedure.\n\n         15. Untreated clinically significant coronary artery disease requiring revascularization\n\n         16. Trans-esophageal echocardiography (TEE) is contraindicated\n\n         17. Active endocarditis or sepsis within 6 months prior to the study procedure\n\n         18. Dementia (resulting in either inability to provide informed consent for the\n             trial/procedure, prevents independent lifestyle outside of a chronic care facility,\n             or will fundamentally complicate rehabilitation from the procedure or compliance with\n             follow-up visits)\n\n         19. Congenital bicuspid or unicuspid valve determined by echocardiography\n\n         20. Prior aortic or mitral valve surgery or pre-existing prosthetic heart valve in any\n             position\n\n         21. Native valve annulus diameter is <19mm or >26mm determined by the screening CT scan\n\n         22. Extreme asymmetrical calcification of the native aortic valve determined by the\n             screening CT scan\n\n         23. Echocardiographic evidence of intra-cardiac mass, thrombus, vegetation, or\n             spontaneous echo contrast in the left atrium\n\n         24. >3+ aortic regurgitation, mitral regurgitation or tricuspid regurgitation\n\n         25.
