  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to validate the association of the GPS and accelerometer tools in
      order to assess the humain locomotion during exercises.

      The hypotheses are:

        1. GPS and accelerometer together can assess the human locomotion

        2. GPS and accelerometer together can assess the energy expenditure during exercises

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The assessment of the physical activity (PA) and the energy expenditure (EE) is very
      important to estimate the morbi-mortality. However, each of these tools has its advantages
      and disadvantages but none of them provides a measure of all components dimensions that
      characterize the associated PA and EE. The current scientific prospects for measurement of
      PA tend to associate several measuring devices. To date, these perspectives are facilitated
      by technological developments and miniaturization of various devices. Thus, the purpose of
      the study is to evaluate wether GPS associated with accelerometer are able to assess the
      humain locomotion and energy expenditure during exercises.
