Purpose\n\n           - The investigators aim to evaluate the feasibility of iPhone based remote control\n           system as a real-time remote CT reading tool for suspected appendicitis under 3G\n           network and the suboptimal illumination.\n\n        2. Methods\n\n             -  A total of 120 abdominal CT examinations; sixty had no findings of appendicitis,\n                while the other sixty showed signs of acute appendicitis, were selected. The 16\n                raters reviewed these images using an LCD monitor of the PACS workstation and also\n                an iPhone which was connected to the PACS workstation via remote control system,\n                grading the probability of presence of acute appendicitis on each examination by a\n                five Likert scale.\n\n             -  The investigators will compare the diagnostic performance between two devices."
