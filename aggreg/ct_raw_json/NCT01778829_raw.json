Parental written informed consent is required previous\n      extubation. The failure rate is defined as the need for re-intubation and mechanical\n      ventilation).\n\n      Exclusion criteria are: major congenital anomalies; presence of cardiovascular\n      instability;intubation less than 2 hours; mechanical ventilation more than 14 days, using\n      muscle relaxant, airway anomalies, consent not provided or refused.\n\n      Outcome measures:\n\n      The primary outcome was to assess the need for re-intubation within the first 72 hours after\n      extubation in the 2 groups.\n\n      The criteria for failure were met by at least 1 of the following:\n\n      pH < 7.25 and PaCO2 > 65 mmHg; recurrent apnea more than 2 episodes per hour associated with\n      bradycardia; during 4 hour continuous; 2 episodes of apnea that required bagand-mask\n      ventilation in any time during the study; or a PaO2 < 50 mm Hg with a fraction of inspired\n      oxygen > 0.6. The secondary outcomes concerning respiratory support were total duration on\n      ETT ventilation, total duration on NCPAP, total duration on supplemental oxygen, incidence\n      of pneumothorax,BPD and dead. Other outcomes included incidence of patent ductus arteriosus\n      (PDA), necrotizing enterocolitis, intraventricular hemorrhage grades 3 and 4, retinopathy of\n      prematurity stage 3, time to full feeds, and length of hospital stay.\n\n      Sample size calculations for the primary outcome: We estimated that there would be a more\n      than 80% chance of detecting 43% difference between the groups (alpha 0.05) when samplesize\n      (n) is 110 patients for each mode of treatment."
