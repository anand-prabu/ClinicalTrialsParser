Blood samples will be drawn to\n      fill all study syringe types in a randomized order.  Each syringe type will be drawn per\n      subject to analyze each of the available blood parameters in duplicate using three different\n      multi-parameter analyzers.  The analytes tested will vary per analyzer capabilities.  All\n      blood draws and analyte testing will be performed at an independent laboratory. The study is\n      to confirm that all of the syringes tested provide consistent readings when analyzed using\n      the most common multi-parameter analyzers used in hospital laboratories."
