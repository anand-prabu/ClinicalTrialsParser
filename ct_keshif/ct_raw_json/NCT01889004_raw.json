            "textblock": "The explanation of consciousness poses one of the greatest challenges to science and\n      philosophy in the 21st century. It remains unclear what consciousness is and how it emerges\n      from brain activity. By studying anesthesia and sleep, the investigators aim to reveal what\n      happens in the brain when consciousness is lost and when it returns. During the study, a\n      series of Positron Emission Tomography (PET), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and\n      electroencephalography (EEG) studies will be carried out on healthy male subjects to reveal\n      the neural correlates of consciousness. Consciousness of the subjects will be manipulated\n      with normal sleep and anesthetic agents dexmedetomidine and propofol.\n\n      First, various neurophysiological tools to separate consciousness, connectedness and\n      responsiveness during normal sleep will be tested. The most suitable methods and subjects\n      will be selected and then tested during anesthetic-induced sedation and loss of\n      responsiveness (LOR). The anesthetics (dexmedetomidine or propofol) will be administered as\n      target-controlled infusions (TCI) with step-wise concentration-increments until LOR is\n      detected. Then, TCIs are repeated in the same subjects but adjusted according to the\n      individual drug target concentrations sufficient for LOR, and a series of PET perfusion\n      imaging measurements will be performed to obtain the brain activity information in various\n      states of consciousness. The same subjects will then be imaged with PET for brain activity\n      after sleep deprivation (awake), during various sleep stages and immediately after\n      awakening. Finally, ten dexmedetomidine subjects will be given the drug once more, and\n      functional MRI (fMRI) data will be collected at various states of consciousness before and\n      during verbal and nonverbal vocalizations. EEG will be continuously collected in all\n      sessions. The depth of anesthesia will be measured using quantitative EEG and bispectral\n      index (BIS) monitoring.\n\n      The results may lead to the discovery of new and better objective indicators of the depth of\n      anesthesia and consciousness, and new insights into the understanding of neural mechanisms\n      behind drug-induced loss of consciousness and ultimately the mechanisms of action of\n      (general) anesthetics as well as consciousness itself."
