The first arm includes all histologically\n      benign meningiomas. The second arm includes all other pathologies.\n\n      All patients receive INF alpha as a subcutaneous injection Monday through Friday for 8\n      weeks. Treatment continues without interruption as long as there is no tumor recurrence or\n      progression and toxicity is acceptable.\n\n      Treatment continues without dose adjustment for the first 8 weeks as long as there are no\n      toxic effects of grade III or greater. Dosage for subsequent courses is one dose level below\n      the dose that produced toxicity of grade III or greater.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 20 patients will be entered per year into each arm."
