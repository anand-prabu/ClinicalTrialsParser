  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 1 million people in the UK suffer from untreatable visual impairment, many of them
      elderly. The major complaint of visually impaired people is their inability to carry out
      simple tasks, especially those involving reading.  It is known that this activity limitation
      is a major cause of depression in an older population, and it is reflected in reduced
      quality of life. Low vision clinics, mostly based within hospital ophthalmology departments,
      dispense optical magnifiers to allow patients to carry out these tasks again, but these
      devices do have limitations (unusual posture, short working distance, monocular viewing).
      Although electronic magnifiers have been around since the 1960s, they were initially very
      large and expensive. Recent advances in technology have brought about an explosion in the
      number and range of portable and moderately-priced aids, which can be used binocularly, in a
      natural working position:  these are currently not available through the NHS. Evidence is
      needed as to whether these portable hand-held electronic magnifiers could offer a
      significant benefit to the majority of patients, and therefore whether they should be
      routinely dispensed in low vision clinics.

      The proposed study is a two-arm randomised crossover trial with existing users of optical
      magnifiers being assigned to use a hand-held electronic magnifier in addition to their
      existing devices for 2 months. Reading and task performance will be measured with the aid,
      and compared to the performance with optical aids, and the patient will be asked to report
      on the comparisons between the aids.
