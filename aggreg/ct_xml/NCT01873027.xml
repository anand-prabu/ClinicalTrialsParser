      The aim of this randomized study is to evaluate the impact of Optical frequency domain
      imaging (OFDI) guidance for Percutaneous Coronay Intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent
      (DES) as compared with Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) guidance.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Optical frequency domain imaging (OFDI) is a novel, high resolution intravascular imaging
      modality. Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a widely used conventional imaging modality for
      achieving optimal stent deployment.

      The aim of this randomized study is to evaluate the impact of OFDI guidance for Percutaneous
      Coronay Intervention (PCI) with drug-eluting stent (DES) as compared with IVUS guidance.

      We will enroll 800 patients with a de novo lesion who will undergo PCI with DES as is
      routine practice. Patients will be rondomely assigned to either OFDI-guided PCI arm or
      IVUS-guided PCI arm.

      Patients will then have a follow-up contact at the time of hospital discharge, 8 month and
      12 month after PCI.
