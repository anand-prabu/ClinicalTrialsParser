    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well dovitinib works in treating patients with recurrent or
      progressive glioblastoma. Dovitinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of
      the enzymes needed for cell growth

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      Arm 1: To determine 6 month progression-free survival (PFS6) in anti-angiogenic therapy
      (including anti-VEGF therapy or bevacizumab) naive patients with recurrent glioblastoma
      (GBM) in patients treated with dovitinib

      Arm 2: To estimate time to progression in patients with recurrent or progressive
      Glioblastoma who have progressed on anti-angiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy).

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

        1. To evaluate the side effect profile of dovitinib in both patient populations.

        2. To evaluate the efficacy of dovitinib as measured by objective response rate (ORR) in
           both patient populations.

        3. To estimate time to percentage of patients free from progression at 6 months (PFS-6)in
           patients with recurrent or progressive Glioblastoma who have progressed on
           antiangiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy).

        4. To estimate time to progression in anti-angiogenic therapy (including anti-VEGF therapy
           or bevacizumab) naiVe patients with recurrent glioblastoma (GBM) in patients treated
           with dovitinib,

        5. To evaluate the overall survival (OS) in both patient populations.

      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:

      To explore association between clinical outcome and potential biomarkers that may include
      microparticles, PlGF, PDGF-AA, PDGF-AB, PDGF-BB, SDF-1a, thrombospondin-1, Ang1, and Il-6,
      IL-8 and FGF.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive dovitinib orally (PO) 5 days a week. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.
