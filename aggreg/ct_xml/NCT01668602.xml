  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is the number one cause of disability. Difficulty with walking affects most stroke
      survivors. The focus of this project is to understand the effects of different methods (such
      as treadmill walking and electrical stimulation) that can be used to improve walking in
      people with stroke. In this study, patients with stroke and healthy people who have not had
      a stroke will be tested. Study participants will take part in 12 sessions of walking
      training. Walking patterns will be measured using automatic cameras and standard clinical
      tests. Also, magnetic brain stimulation maybe used to measure brain-muscle connections
      during the training. This research will provide information on how different factors that
      affect walking in stroke change with walking training. The investigators hypothesize that
      improvements in brain excitability of the muscles targeted by walking training will occur
      after training, and these changes in brain excitability will be related to improvements in
      walking patterns. By improving our understanding of walking rehabilitation, this study can
      help improve walking function and disability in people with stroke.
