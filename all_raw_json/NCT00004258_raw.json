Correlate various surrogate markers of antiangiogenic activity\n      with EMD 121974 therapy including magnetic resonance imaging and PET scans, serum assays for\n      various angiogenic and antiangiogenic factors, serum and urine markers of calcium\n      metabolism, and tumor biopsies.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study. Patients receive EMD 121974 IV over 1 hour twice\n      weekly for 4 weeks. Treatment continues for an additional course in the absence of\n      unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable or responding disease may continue therapy\n      indefinitely past the 2 courses until disease progression. Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive\n      escalating doses of EMD 121974 until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD\n      is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose\n      limiting toxicities. Patients are followed every 3 months for the first year, and then every\n      4 months thereafter until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
