Compare the survival and response rates of patients with colorectal liver\n      metastases treated with intravenous vs. intrahepatic arterial infusion of\n      fluorouracil/leucovorin. II. Assess the effect of these 2 treatments on symptoms and quality\n      of life of these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients randomized to Arm II should have a preoperative hepatic\n      angiography; at laparotomy, an intrahepatic arterial catheter is fused into the\n      gastroduodenal artery to establish an infusion of both lobes of the liver. Arm I:\n      Single-Agent Chemotherapy with Drug Modulation. Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; with\n      Leucovorin calcium, CF, NSC-3590. Intravenous infusion. Arm II: Single-Agent Chemotherapy\n      with Drug Modulation. 5-FU; with CF. Intrahepatic arterial infusion.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 312 patients are expected to be randomized within 3-4 years."
