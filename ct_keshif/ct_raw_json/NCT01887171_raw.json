Clear inflammatory pathways in response to IRI have been\n      reported to be associated with early allograft liver dysfunction (2,3).  It was shown that\n      ex vivo intraportal tacrolimus perfusion suppressed inflammation and immune response in the\n      transplanted liver on a genome-wide basis (4).\n\n      We hypothesize that Tacrolimus added to HTK solution given through intraportal and\n      intraarterial back-table infusion is capable of reducing the degree of early allograft liver\n      dysfunction, as assessed by incidence of postreperfusion  hyperfibrinolysis, postoperative\n      levels of AST,ALT, during 1-7 postoperative days as well as serum and histochemical markers\n      of liver injury and inflammation compared to no intraportal and intraarterial back-table\n      infusion."
