Having recognized that acute emotional stress can\n      induce cardiovascular events, many clinical tests of mental stress have been carried out to\n      observe the correlation between emotional stress and cardiac damage, which ultimately lead\n      to the formalization of the concept of Mental Stress Induced Myocardial Ischemia(MSIMI). In\n      the past 3 decades, it has been evidenced that mental stress is internally related to\n      myocardial ischemia. According to current studies, over 70% patients with stable coronary\n      heart disease have MSIMI and are exposed to three or four times higher risk of\n      cardiovascular events. However, few articles are about the therapeutic effect of MSIMI\n      treatment. This study aims to discuss whether the combined treatment of traditional Chinese\n      medicine (TCM) and western medicine for MSIMI does effect, namely the conventional therapy\n      for CHD combining with TCM - Xinkeshu tablets."
