Both procedures\n      are types of robotic radical prostatectomy, or the robot-assisted removal of the prostate\n      though a small incision in the belly. In the standard approach, 4-5 small (1-2 cm) incisions\n      are made in the lower abdomen to allow the insertion of robotic instruments. In the R-LESS\n      technique, all instruments are inserted through a single incision. R-LESS RP is less\n      invasive than RALP and may leave a smaller scar and cause less pain."

Perioperative parameters, including: operative time (defined as time elapsed from skin\n      incision to placement of the final skin suture); estimated blood loss; additional ports;\n      conversion to standard RALP (in R-LESS RP patients), or laparoscopic, or open surgery;\n      length of stay.\n\n      V.

Health related quality of life, measured as patients' perception of functioning,\n      disability, and well-being related to the following eight concepts: physical functioning,\n      role limitations caused by physical health problems, bodily pain, general health, vitality,\n      social functioning, role limitation caused by emotional problems, and mental health.\n\n      X.
