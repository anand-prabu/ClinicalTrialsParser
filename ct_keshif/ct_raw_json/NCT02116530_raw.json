Antiemetic drugs, such as palonosetron\n      hydrochloride, ondansetron, and granisetron hydrochloride, may help lessen or prevent nausea\n      and vomiting in patients treated with chemotherapy. Olanzapine may help prevent\n      chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting by blocking brain receptors that appear to be\n      involved in nausea and vomiting. Giving antiemetic therapy with olanzapine may help to\n      reduce or prevent nausea and vomiting in patients treated with highly emetogenic\n      chemotherapy."

The\n      purpose of this study is to determine if the use of olanzapine can significantly reduce\n      nausea and vomiting in a large number of patients receiving chemotherapy.

The primary objective is to compare the number of patients with\n      no nausea for the acute (0-24 hours post-chemotherapy), delayed (24-120 hours\n      post-chemotherapy) and overall periods (0-120 hours post-chemotherapy) for patients\n      receiving HEC. The secondary objectives are:\n\n        1. To compare the complete response (CR) (no emetic episodes and no use of rescue\n           medication in the acute, delayed and overall periods\n\n        2. To compare the incidences of potential toxicities ascribed to olanzapine\n\n      Protocol treatment is to begin \u2264 14 days of registration. Patients will receive treatment on\n      Days 1-4. Patients will be permitted to take rescue therapy of the treating investigator's\n      choice based on the clinical circumstances. After completing treatment, patients will be\n      monitored for side effects."
