Medication management practices for schizophrenia often are not\n      guideline-concordant and place patients at risk for adverse outcomes.  This project tests a\n      new strategy to standard implementation for VHA Schizophrenia Guidelines.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      Research objectives are:  (1) to compare the effectiveness of a conceptually-based, enhanced\n      intervention to that of a basic educational strategy with regard to improving guideline\n      adherence and patient compliance; (2) to compare the effectiveness of the two strategies\n      with regard to improving symptom and side effect outcomes; (3) to determine the effect of\n      the enhanced intervention on service utilization for acute exacerbations of schizophrenia;\n      (4) to determine the extent to which guideline-concordant medication management improves\n      patient outcomes; and (5) to examine providers' knowledge of and attitudes toward\n      guidelines.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Thirteen VA sites were considered for the study, and VistA data were extracted to assess\n      baseline guideline performance.  Seven sites were selected and received basic education\n      about schizophrenia guidelines.  Three of these sites were randomly selected to receive the\n      enhanced intervention, employing a nurse coordinator to promote providers' guideline\n      adherence and patients' treatment adherence. Subjects with an acute exacerbation of\n      schizophrenia were enrolled and were interviewed at baseline and six months using the\n      Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, the Schizophrenia Outcomes Module, and the Barnes\n      Akathisia Scale.  Data on guideline adherence were collected from medical records and VistA\n      files. When data collection is completed, analyses will be conducted to determine the\n      effectiveness of the enhanced intervention with regard to improving guideline adherence and\n      patient outcomes.\n\n      Status:\n\n      The project is ongoing. To date, 401 subjects have been enrolled in the intervention study.\n      The rate of completed follow-up assessments to date is 86 percent."
