    <textblock>
      This study is being done to analyze the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of treatment for
      advanced melanoma (MEL) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) using combination regimens of
      pembrolizumab (MK-3475) + pegylated interferon alfa-2b (PegIFN-2b) and pembrolizumab +
      ipilimumab (IPI). The primary hypothesis is that these combinations will be sufficiently
      well-tolerated to permit continued clinical investigation.

    <textblock>
      The trial is being done in two parts: Part 1 is dose-finding part to define the maximum
      tolerated dose (MTD) for the drug combinations. In Part 1, different dose levels and
      schedules will be used to find the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for each combination.
      Part 2 is a randomized portion of the trial and will evaluate preliminary efficacy of the
      drug combinations given in 6-week cycles for advanced MEL participants. Doses used in Part 2
      will be decided by assessment of dose escalation cohorts in this study and external
      information.
