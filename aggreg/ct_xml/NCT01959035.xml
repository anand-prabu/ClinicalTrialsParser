        Patients will be recruited among those who complete treatment with aripiprazole in Study
        14724A / NCT01795547.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient is judged to potentially benefit from 24-week treatment with aripiprazole
             once-monthly according to the clinical opinion of the investigator.

          -  The patient agrees to protocol-defined use of effective contraception.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  The patient has been diagnosed with a primary psychiatric disorder other than
             schizophrenia during Study 14724A / NCT01795547.

          -  The patient has a clinically significant unstable illness diagnosed during Study
             14724A / NCT01795547.

          -  The patient is at significant risk of harming himself/herself or others according to
             the investigator's judgement or according to Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale
             (C-SSRS).

          -  The patient has a disease or takes medication that could, in the investigator's
             opinion, interfere with the assessments of safety, tolerability or efficacy, or
             interfere with the conduct or interpretation of the study.

          -  The patient has one or more clinical laboratory test values outside the reference
             range, based on the blood or urine samples taken during the conduct of Study 14724A /
             NCT01795547 that are, in the investigator's opinion, of potential risk to the
             patient's safety.

          -  The patient is, in the investigator's opinion, unlikely to comply with the protocol
             or is unsuitable for any reason.

        Other inclusion and exclusion criteria may apply.
