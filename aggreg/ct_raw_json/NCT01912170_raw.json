Corn oil(n=25),\n      rich in omega-6 fatty acids, will be selected as a controlled oil. The intervention will\n      start from the third trimester of these pregnant women and finish at the 4wk after the birth\n      of their children. The investigators hypothesize that omega-3 fatty acids could improve\n      insulin sensitivity and glucose metabolism in these patients."
