    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, open-label, extension trial designed to evaluate the long-term safety
      over 12 months of TNX-102 SL tablets taken daily at bedtime for the treatment of FM.
      Patients recruited into this trial are those who have successfully completed the
      double-blind study, TNX-CY-F202 (F202).  Patients will not be made aware of the therapy they
      received during the double-blind study.

      The study will consist of 7 clinic visits, including Screening/Baseline Visit 1 (Day 0,
      which is anticipated to be the same date as Visit 6 in F202), visits after 1, 3, 6, 9, and
      12 months of treatment (Visits 2-6), and a Follow-up Visit (Visit 7) scheduled within one
      month after stopping study drug treatment.

      Primary:

      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the long-term safety of TNX-102 SL tablets
      taken daily at bedtime over 12 months in patients with FM who have completed Study
      TNX-CY-F202

      Secondary:

      The secondary objective is to evaluate the long-term efficacy of TNX-102 SL tablets taken
      daily at bedtime to control symptoms of FM

    <description>Adverse events will be coded using the latest version of the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) and will be summarized overall and by preferred term and system organ class. Adverse events will also be summarized by severity and relationship to study drug. Serious AEs and AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug will also be summarized.  Actual values and changes from extension Baseline for clinical laboratory test results and vital sign measurements will be summarized at endpoint using descriptive statistics (n, mean, SD, median, minimum, and maximum).</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. The patient met all prior inclusion and exclusion requirements for Study F202
             originally, and has had no intervening medical conditions, increased suicidal

             TNX-102 SL or enrollment in the extension study.

          2. The patient completed expected dosing in F202 defined as taking study medication up
             to Week 12, with at least 70% compliance with medication usage (based on responses
             from daily IVRS calls recorded during the F202 study) and no major protocol
             violations.

          3. The patient has provided written informed consent to participate in this extension
