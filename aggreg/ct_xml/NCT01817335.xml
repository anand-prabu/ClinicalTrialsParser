      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Providing a psycho-educational group to young adults while examining the feasibility of
      such a group with patients on treatment.

      II. Examining effectiveness of the program through evaluating pre-post changes in
      participant distress, evaluating increases in participant' knowledge regarding disease
      issues and coping, and evaluating participant satisfaction.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients undergo psycho-educational program comprising medical/symptom management and
      communication with a medical team, coping skills, self image, and relationships and
      communication for 1.5 hours once weekly for 6 weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.

    <description>A questionnaire was developed to measure participant satisfaction with the format and material of the psycho-educational program.  Satisfaction measures will be provided for completion at the end of sessions 2 through 5 and 30 days post intervention. Changes in the mean of the Questionnaire responses will be analyzed using a paired t-test and calculations of simple frequency and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data and program evaluations.</description>

    <description>A questionnaire was developed based on the psycho-educational material to assess increases in knowledge and retention.  The questionnaire will be administered pre-intervention and 30 days post-intervention.  Additionally, relevant items from the questionnaire will be administered at the end of the relevant educational session.  For instance, self image questions from the questionnaire will be administered at the end of the self-image session in addition to the pre and post administration of the entire questionnaire. Changes in the mean of the Questionnaire responses will be analyzed using a paired t-test and calculations of simple frequency and descriptive statistics will be used to summarize the data and program evaluations.</description>
