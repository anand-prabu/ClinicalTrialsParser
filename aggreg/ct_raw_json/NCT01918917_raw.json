Exclusion criteria were psychiatric illness, younger than 18 yo, who has analgesic\n      treatment before the surgery and known hypersensitivity to relevant drugs. All patients\n      received a standard anaesthetic protocol; ECG, heart rate, non-invasive blood pressure,\n      oxygen saturation and temperature were monitored. After preoxygenation, general anaesthesia\n      was induced with sodium pentothal 4 to 7 mg/kg, 1 mcg/kg fentanyl and neuromuscular block\n      was achieved with rocuronium 0.5 mg/kg and trachea was intubated. Anesthesia was maintained\n      with desflurane 6% and 50% oxygen in the medical air.\n\n      Randomised patients were achieved dexmedetomidine and levobupivacaine or levobupivacaine\n      intra-articularly 10 minutes before medical tourniquet deaerated.\n\n      Postoperative analgesia was maintained with morphine in patient-controlled analgesia.\n      Patients postoperative VAS values and analgesic consumptions were recorded in postoperative\n      24 hours."
