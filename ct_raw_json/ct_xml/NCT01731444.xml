  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The standard of care for treatment of  burn injury is to inject a solution of epinephrine
      under the skin of the injured site in order to reduce blood loss during skin grafting. This
      solution of epinephrine has been shown to have effects on the body outside the donor site.
      Some people have increases in heart rate and blood pressure. We will study the effect of a
      phenylephrine solution in place of an epinephrine  solution to control blood loss. We think
      that phenylephrine will help decrease blood loss and not change blood pressure or heart
      rate.

      The injured area will be injected under the skin and a skin graft will be taken in the same
      way as we usually do. The only change will be the use of phenylephrine in the solution
      instead of epinephrine.

      Our goal is to find whether or not phenylephrine or epinephrine solution results in a
      reduction of blood loss without affecting the rest of the body.
