  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) is one of the most prevalent psychiatric disorders
      with high morbidity and mortality. It affects the lives of millions worldwide and is often
      highly incapacitating, leading to significant psychosocial dysfunction. Moreover, nearly all
      patients have experienced suicidal ideation and about 10% actually commit suicide, a rate
      almost 50 times higher than in the general population. Mostly young women are at greater
      risk for the disorder and are three times more likely to be diagnosed with BPD than men.

      BPD aetiology is complex and could be explained by both biological and environmental
      factors. Among the environmental factors, sexual or physical abuse, parental divorce, loss
      or illnesses are identified as the most common ones. These factors can induce dysfunctional
      behaviours, which might cause emotional dysregulation, high impulsivity and frequent self-
      injurious behaviour.

      However, there are no pharmacologic interventions that are known to be specifically
      effective to treat BPD. Therapeutic options for this devastating disorder is still far from
      adequate for treating acute illness episodes, relapses, and recurrences and in restoring
      premorbid functioning. In addition, some patients are unable to tolerate existing therapies
      for BPD, which leads to either frequent changes in medications or to non-adherence.
      Therefore there is an urgent need for the development of more rapidly effective treatments
      for BPD.

      A growing body of evidence suggests that glutamatergic neurotransmission, in particular
      N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype may play a role in the pathophysiology of multiple
      psychiatric disorders. This has led to various clinical trials with glutamate modulating
      drugs. The trial drug is an uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist approved for Alzheimer's
      disease is increasingly being studied in a variety of non-dementia psychiatric disorders.
      Results from these studies have proved that the trial drug was safe and well tolerated and
      has the potential for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.

      To date, there are no published data on the use of trial drug in the treatment for BPD.
      Therefore, the investigators intend to study the efficacy of this novel cognitive enhancing
      drug as an addition to ongoing therapy with atypical antipsychotics in patients with
      Borderline Personality Disorder. This study will recruit 30 BPD patients who are currently
      stable on Quetiapine (25-150mg) medication for three weeks. The patients will be randomly
      allocated to receive either the study medication (20mg/ day) or placebo via oral
      administration for eight weeks. To observe the efficacy of the trial treatment, all
      participants will be assessed at various time intervals for different scales including
      psychotic, negative and cognitive symptoms.

    <description>The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS) is a 10 item semi-structured clinician-rated interview of depression where each item is rated on a 7 point scale ranging from 0 to 6. The MADRS will be used to monitor the participant's experience of depressive symptoms and severity across the trial.</description>

    <description>Cogstate tests have been designed, developed and validated to both identify and measure cognitive impairment, and to track or monitor cognitive change. The tasks use novel visual and verbal stimuli to ensure assessment is culture-neutral and not limited by a participant's level of education.</description>
