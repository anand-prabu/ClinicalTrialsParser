Silymarin showed\n      its efficacy to decreased serum alanine transaminase enzyme in animal models from recent\n      study. No confirmed this efficacy was performed in human.\n\n      A prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was carried out according to Good\n      Clinical Practice Guideline. This study is to define the efficacy of silymarin to prevent\n      hepatotoxicity from anti-tuberculosis drugs. Informed consent is obtained prior to the\n      study. New patients diagnosed with tuberculosis are enrolled. Patients with liver diseases,\n      current alcohol drinking more than 20 g/day, regular use of herbal or other potential\n      hepatotoxic drugs are excluded. Patients are treated with a standard regimen of four\n      anti-tuberculosis therapy. They will randomize to receive either placebo or silymarin (140\n      mg) thrice daily. Liver function test (LFT) and clinical changes are assessed at 2- and\n      4-week after initiation of the treatment. DILI from anti-tuberculosis drugs ('atb-DILI') is\n      defined as:  i) a rise of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) to 2 times above normal upper\n      limit, or ii) an elevation of total bilirubin more than 2 mg/dl with or without ALT\n      elevation. The study endpoints are the level of ALT by week 4 and the number of patients who\n      developed atb-DILI.\n\n      Statistical analysis is used to compare the differences in ALT and number of atb-DILI"
