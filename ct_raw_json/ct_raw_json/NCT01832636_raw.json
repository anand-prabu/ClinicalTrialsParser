            "textblock": "Several host factors underlie the pathogenesis of the reciprocal cycle of childhood diarrhea\n      and undernutrition in developing countries. These include intestinal inflammation, mucosal\n      damage, and alterations in intestinal barrier function that lead to malabsorption, growth\n      failure, and heightened susceptibility to recurrent and prolonged episodes of diarrhea.\n      Recent studies from Northeast Brazil demonstrate the benefits of a novel\n      alanyl-glutamine-based oral rehydration and nutrition therapy (Ala-Gln ORNT) in speeding the\n      recovery of damaged intestinal barrier function in cell culture, animal models, patients\n      with AIDS, and underweight children.\n\n      Oral supplementation with Alanyl-Glutamine (Ala-Gln; 24g a day for 10 days) improves\n      short-term gut integrity and weight velocity 4 months after therapy in a group of\n      undernourished children from Northeast Brazil. Intervention and Mechanisms of\n      Alanyl-Glutamine for Inflammation, Nutrition, and Enteropathy (IMAGINE) is a study designed\n      to answer the following questions: 1) What is the lowest dose of Ala-Gln that improves\n      intestinal barrier function, intestinal inflammation, and nutritional status in children at\n      risk of underweight, wasting, or stunting? 2) What are the mechanisms by which Ala-Gln\n      exerts these benefits?"
