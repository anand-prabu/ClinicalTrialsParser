The intervention is antiretroviral therapy (ART), independent of CD4 cell count,\n      delivered in a streamlined approach for all HIV infected adults and children.  Components of\n      streamlined care include ongoing HIV combination prevention strategies including male\n      circumcision. Control communities will receive annual testing campaigns and ART will follow\n      country guidelines for ART.\n\n      HIV incidence will be measured using an efficient community cohort design (ECCO) comprised\n      of three key elements: A) baseline household community level census, B) annual community\n      health campaigns (CHC) incorporating HIV testing that use unique identifiers to link\n      individuals between successive waves of the intervention, and C) tracking and evaluation of\n      individuals who do not participate in annual CHCs."
