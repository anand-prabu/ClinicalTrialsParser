            "textblock": "Fluid-weight management is critical for dialysis patients 1, 2. Previous clinical trials\n      have not comprehensively addressed the application of a strategy combining both sodium\n      restriction and a progressive, but gradual challenge of post dialysis target weight for BP\n      and fluid-weight management in hemodialysis (HD). The investigators postulate that a\n      protocolized, stepwise and gradual challenge of post-hemodialysis target weight when\n      combined with diligent dietary sodium restriction <2000mg sodium/day, will lead to better\n      hydration/volume status and BP control in HD patients. A randomized, two parallel arm trial\n      (n=40) among HD patients is proposed, that compares this comprehensive strategy in one group\n      versus 'usual' HD volume/hydration and BP management in the control group. The two primary\n      outcomes are change in volume/hydration status (assessed by bioelectrical impedance\n      analysis-BIA) and change in BP (pre-dialysis in-center readings, home self-monitored\n      readings as well as 44-hour interdialytic BP). Secondary outcomes include change in target\n      post-dialysis weight, slope of on-line relative plasma volume monitoring (using Crit-line\n      monitors), utilization and change, if any, in antihypertensive regimen, change in\n      interdialytic weight gain, objectively assessed salt-appetite, thirst score, frequency of\n      intradiaytic hypotension, cramps and duration of post-dialysis fatigue and recovery, time to\n      achievement of dry weight and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, albumin, brain natriuretic\n      peptide-BNP, aldosterone and hsCRP). The trial will be 14-weeks in duration and will involve\n      comprehensive assessment of study parameters at baseline, middle and end of the trial. It is\n      anticipated that the trial will lead to the the development of a simple and practical\n      approach for volume and BP control in HD patients that will subsequently need to be studied\n      on a larger scale, i.e., a larger, multicenter study with hard endpoints of death and\n      hospitalization."
