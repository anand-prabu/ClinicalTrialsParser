             Screening, confirmed by a single repeat, if necessary:

               -  Total bilirubin &gt; 1.5x ULN

               -  AST/SGOT or ALT/SGPT ≥ 2.5x ULN.

               -  Creatinine &gt; 2.5x ULN.

         15. History of regular alcohol consumption as defined by alcohol intake in a quantity
             exceeding 7 drinks per week for females or 14 drinks per week for males, where 1

             of hard liquor.

         16. Participation in other studies involving administration of an investigational drug or
             device within 30 days or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer, before screening for the
             current study and during participation in the current study.

         17. Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 8 weeks prior to Screening.

         18. Other severe acute or chronic medical or psychiatric condition or laboratory
             abnormality that may increase the risk associated with study participation or
             investigational product administration or may interfere with the interpretation of
             study results and, in the judgment of the investigator, would make the subject
             inappropriate for entry into this study.
