The transdermal patches are changed daily.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive a fixed daily dose of testosterone with escalating duration\n      of exposure until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the\n      dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicities.\n\n      Patients are followed at day 1 and at weeks 2 and 4.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 3-18 patients will be accrued for this study."
