Once the seal is broken in the\n      presence of the patient, the patient is randomized. The EMS study drug kit will contain a\n      vial of either 1 gram TXA, 2 grams TXA, or placebo. EMS will mix the study drug in a 250 mL\n      bag of 0.9% sodium chloride and administer the bolus infusion as soon as life-saving\n      interventions are performed. After randomization, EMS will provide the study drug kit ID# to\n      the receiving pharmacy. The hospital pharmacist will obtain the randomization assignment\n      from the coordinating center and prepare the appropriate drug to be administered in the\n      hospital.\n\n      Sample size: The total sample size is 1002 (334 per group), which will allow for 80% power\n      to detect an 8.1% absolute difference in favorable long-term neurological outcome as\n      determined by the GOS-E 6 months after injury for each of the true TXA-placebo comparisons,\n      using a one-sided, level 0.1 test.\n\n      Statistical analysis of primary hypothesis: Modified intention-to-treat analysis using\n      logistic regression to test for association and estimate the strength of the association of\n      treatment group with a favorable 6-month outcome (defined as a GOS-E > 4), after adjustment\n      for study site.\n\n      Human subjects protection: This study qualifies for the exception from informed consent\n      (EFIC) required for emergency research outlined in FDA regulation 21CFR50.24. EFIC applies\n      because of life-threatening situation, intervention must be administered before consent is\n      feasible, no reasonable way to identify prospectively individuals at risk, patients have the\n      prospect of benefit from the treatment, and the research could not practically be carried\n      out without the waiver of consent."

            "textblock": "1. Overview This multi-center, Phase II trial is designed to determine if Tranexamic Acid\n           (TXA) initiated in the prehospital setting improves long-term neurologic outcome\n           compared to placebo in patients with moderate to severe TBI who are not in shock.  This\n           study protocol will be conducted as part of the Resuscitation Outcomes Consortium (ROC)\n           at trauma centers in the United States and Canada. ROC is funded by the National Heart\n           Lung and Blood Institute (NHLBI) in partnership with the US Army Medical Research and\n           Materiel Command (USAMRMC), Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Heart & Stroke\n           Foundation of Canada, the American Heart Association (AHA), and the Defense Research\n           and Development Canada. ROC is a clinical trials network focusing on research primarily\n           in the area of prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest and severe traumatic injury. The\n           mission of ROC is to provide infrastructure and project support for clinical trials and\n           other outcome-oriented research in the areas of cardiopulmonary arrest and severe\n           traumatic injury that lead to evidence-based change in clinical practice.\n\n        2. Specific Aims/Hypothesis Statement 2.1 Clinical Hypotheses and Aims\n\n      Specific aim 1: To compare 6-month neurologic outcome between subjects in the\n      bolus/maintenance arm, subjects in the bolus only arm, and subjects in the placebo arm by\n      evaluating the Glasgow Outcome Scale Extended score (GOS-E) at 6 months post-injury.\n\n      Primary Hypotheses: We will perform a one-sided test of the following null hypotheses:\n\n        -  Prehospital administration of a 1 gram intravenous (IV) TXA bolus followed by a 1 gram\n           IV TXA maintenance infusion over 8 hours (bolus/maintenance arm) does not increase the\n           proportion of subjects with a favorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E  > 4) compared to\n           placebo, versus the alternative that this treatment increases the proportion of\n           subjects with a favorable outcome.\n\n        -  Prehospital administration of a single 2 gram IV TXA bolus (bolus only arm) does not\n           increase the proportion of subjects with a favorable neurologic outcome (GOS-E  > 4)\n           compared to placebo, versus the alternative that this treatment increases the\n           proportion of subjects with a favorable outcome.\n\n      Specific aim 2: To assess differences in morbidity and mortality measured from randomization\n      through 28 days or initial hospital discharge between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm,\n      bolus only arm, and placebo arm.\n\n      Secondary Hypotheses:  The null hypotheses are that there will be no difference between\n      subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm in the following:\n      both absolute and relative volume of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) progression, proportion\n      of subjects with ICH progression, frequency of neurosurgical interventions, GOS-E measured\n      at discharge, Disability Rating Scale score (DRS) measured at discharge and 6 months, 28-day\n      survival, and ventilator-free, intensive care unit (ICU)-free, and hospital-free days.\n\n      Specific aim 3: To assess differences in adverse events measured from randomization to\n      initial hospital discharge between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm,\n      and placebo arm.\n\n      Tertiary Hypotheses: The null hypotheses are that there will be no difference between\n      subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo arm in the following:\n      proportion of subjects experiencing seizures, cerebral ischemic events, myocardial\n      infarction (MI), deep venous thrombosis (DVT), or pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) post\n      randomization through 28 days or discharge, whichever occurs first.\n\n      2.2 Laboratory Hypotheses and Aims\n\n      Specific aim 1: To compare coagulation profiles over time using kaolin activated\n      thrombelastography (TEG) results between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only\n      arm, and placebo arm.\n\n      Primary hypothesis:  The null hypothesis is that there will be no difference in the degree\n      of fibrinolysis as assessed by percentage of clot lysis determined 30 minutes after the\n      maximum amplitude is reached (LY30) between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus\n      only arm, and placebo arm.\n\n      Specific aim 2: To explore the underlying mechanism of TXA by comparing fibrinolytic pathway\n      mediator activity between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo\n      arm.\n\n      Secondary hypothesis:  The null hypothesis is that there will be no change in fibrinolytic\n      pathway mediator activity as measured by the TEG lysis time 30 minutes after maximum\n      amplitude (LY 30) between subjects in the bolus/maintenance arm, bolus only arm, and placebo\n      arm.\n\n      Specific aim 3: To estimate the association between the degree of fibrinolysis based on\n      kaolin activated TEG results and fibrinolytic pathway mediators on primary and secondary\n      clinical outcomes.\n\n      Tertiary hypothesis:  The null hypothesis is that no association will exist between the\n      degree of fibrinolysis and fibrinolytic pathway mediators and primary and secondary clinical\n      outcomes."
