    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, three-part Phase 1/2 study to investigate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of trametinib (GSK1120212) and
      dabrafenib (GSK2118436) when administered in combination with the anti-EGFR antibody
      panitumumab in subjects with BRAF-mutation V600E or V600K positive colorectal cancer (CRC).
      Part 1 of the study will consist of dose-escalation cohorts Part 2 of the study will consist
      of expansion cohorts to investigate safety and clinical activity, and Part 3 of the study
      will be a randomized Phase II study comparing both the dabrafenib/panitumumab and
      dabrafenib/trametinib/panitumumab combinations to a chemotherapy comparator with respect to
      safety and clinical activity.

      This is an open-label, three-part Phase 1/2 study to investigate the safety,
      pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and clinical activity of trametinib (GSK1120212) and
      dabrafenib (GSK2118436) when administered in combination with the anti-EGFR antibody
      panitumumab in subjects with BRAF-mutation V600E or V600K positive colorectal cancer (CRC).
      Part 1 of the study will consist of dose-escalation cohorts, following a 3 + 3 enrollment
      scheme. The maximum tolerated dose (MTD)/Recommended Phase 2 Regimen (RP2R) of dabrafenib
      plus panitumumab will be defined first in Part 1. Upon definition of a tolerable dose of
      dabrafenib plus panitumumab, trametinib will be added to the combination and subsequent
      cohorts will dose with all three drugs in combination. Part 2 of the study will consist of
      expansion cohorts to enroll subjects with BRAF-mutation V600E or V600K positive CRC, and
      investigate safety and clinical activity of dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and
      trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab. For each combination
      (dabrafenib/panitumumab and dabrafenib/trametinib/panitumumab), the optimal safe and
      tolerable dose combinations defined in Part 1 will be brought forward into Part 2. Based on
      the safety and tolerability of these combinations, these doses may be modified during Part 2
      of the study. Part 3 of the study will be a randomized Phase II study comparing dosing with
      dabrafenib in combination with panitumumab and trametinib plus dabrafenib in combination
      with panitumumab as compared to a chemotherapy comparator. Subjects will be assigned to one
      of three treatment groups in a randomized fashion to compare safety and clinical activity:
      1) dabrafenib plus panitumumab, 2) dabrafenib plus trametinib plus panitumumab, or 3)
      chemotherapy comparator. Dose levels for dabrafenib, trametinib, and panitumumab in Part 3
      will be chosen based on emerging PK, PD, and tolerability data from Part 1 and Part 2. In
      the event that the benefit/risk ratio for either of the two experimental combinations is not
      sufficiently positive (either due to excessive toxicity or clearly inferior efficacy), one
      of the arms may be excluded from Part 3 of the study.
