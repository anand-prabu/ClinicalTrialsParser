      Phase I, Open-Label Study of the Safety, Tolerability, and Immunogenicity of a Three Dose
      Regimen of Escalating Doses of PEK Fusion Protein Vaccine in Women with LSIL or HSIL.

      PEK fusion protein vaccine (PEK + GPI-0100) is safe and well tolerated in patients with
      low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions (LSIL) or high grade squamous intraepithelial
      lesions (HSIL) of the cervix and induces a measurable immune response.
