Subjects will receive either a single dose of intravenous\n      (IV) RoActemra/Actemra at a dose of 8 mg/kg over one hour on study Day 0 or placebo.\n      Neutrophil kinetics data will be collected for all subjects up to Day 10 of the study.\n      Following the last study visit on Day 10, all subjects will attend two further safety\n      follow-up visits on Day 28 and Day 56."
