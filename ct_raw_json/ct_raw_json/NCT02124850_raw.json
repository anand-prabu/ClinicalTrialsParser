Cetuximab and VTX-2337 will be administered for a\n      3-4 week period before surgery. The primary objective of the study is to determine the\n      extent to which the administration of neoadjuvant VTX-2337 plus cetuximab modulates immune\n      biomarkers (NK, mDC and T cell activation as well as tumor infiltration and serum cytokines)\n      in peripheral blood and head and neck cancer tumors. An exploratory objective of the study\n      is to assess whether modulation of biomarkers as described above can predict anti-tumor\n      response."
