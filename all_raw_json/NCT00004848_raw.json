There is high probability that the exclusion of donors at\n      high risk for AIDS transmission will also exclude donors at high risk for hepatitis\n      transmission.\n\n      Incidence data obtained in the study will be enhanced by the simultaneous follow-up of a\n      control population undergoing identical surgical procedures, but receiving no blood or only\n      autologous blood.  This control population, made possible by the recent dramatic increase in\n      the amount of autologous blood utilized, will allow for a clear distinction between\n      transfusion-associated hepatitis and that due to nosocomial transmission or other background\n      causes of hepatocellular inflammation in cardiac surgery patients."
