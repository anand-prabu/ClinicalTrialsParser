    <textblock>
      This project aims, through pharmaceutical care in patients with Bipolar I Disorder, improve
      compliance and adherence rate, associated with greater effectiveness and safety of drug
      therapy to help achieve therapeutic goals, and finally to improving the quality of life of
      patients.

      The objective of the present study was to assess the effectiveness of the Dader Method for
      pharmaceutical care  in the reduction of the use of health care services and the increase in
      the effectiveness and safety of treatment in patients with Bipolar I Disorder who are
      discharged or referred for outpatient clinic St John of God-La Ceja. Primary objective: To
      assess the effectiveness of the Dader method for pharmaceutical care on achieving in
      reducing the number of hospital readmissions, in the increase of the effectiveness and
      safety of treatment in patients discharged from the Clinic of Saint John of God -La Ceja -
      Antioquia with bipolar disorder.

      A randomized controlled trial. 200 patients will be randomized to group of control or
      intervention.  Post-randomisation, patients will be required to attend the clinic routinely
      every 3 months during one year. Every 3 months will be evaluated on the criteria of
      effectiveness and safety of the treatment.  Intervention's group will be following through
      pharmaceutical care. In the development of the study will be a record of the use of health
      care services (rehospitalizations, care emergency and outpatient, additional to those
      scheduled).

    <description>Necessity problems of pharmacotherapy are related to the following two questions: 1) The patient has a health problem associated with not receiving a medication you need? 2) The patient has a health problem associated with getting a medicine that does not need. The safety of the pharmacotherapy will be measured by the safety profile of drugs and serum concentrations of drugs. The effectiveness of the pharmacotherapy will be measured by Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression, Clinical Global Impressions (CGI), Young Mania Rating Scale.</description>
