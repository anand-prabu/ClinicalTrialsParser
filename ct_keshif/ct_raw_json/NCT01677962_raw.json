The study team would like to know\n      about any side effects a patient may have when given the study drug. Another goal of the\n      study is to determine if combining dendritic cells and the study drug can be possibly used\n      as a vaccine for this disease. Dendritic cells are cells that are present in the body's\n      immune system that help your body fight disease."

Patients with evidence of metastatic\n             disease at the time of screening or prior to the administration of DC vaccination\n             will be considered a screen failure and excluded from study.\n\n          -  Prior surgery is allowed provided at least 14 days has elapsed between surgery and\n             registration. Prior radiation/chemo is allowed provided that at least 28 days have\n             elapsed since the last treatment.\n\n          -  Patients must not have any serious uncontrolled acute or chronic medical condition\n             that would interfere with this treatment.

However, brain-imaging studies\n             are not required for eligibility if the patient has no neurologic signs or symptoms.\n             If brainimaging studies are performed, they must be negative for disease. Patients\n             must have no plans to receive concurrent chemotherapy, hormonal therapy,\n             radiotherapy, immunotherapy or any other type of therapy for treatment of cancer\n             while on this protocol treatment.\n\n          -  Due to the undetermined effect of this treatment regimen in patients with HIV-1\n             infection and the potential for serious interaction with anti-HIV medications,\n             patients known to be infected with HIV are not eligible for this study.\n\n          -  Due to the possibility of harm to a fetus or nursing infant from this treatment\n             regimen, patients must not be pregnant or nursing. Women of child bearing potential\n             must have a negative pregnancy test completed during study screening.
