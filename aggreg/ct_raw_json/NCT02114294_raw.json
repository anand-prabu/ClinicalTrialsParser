            "textblock": "This is a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) regarding conservative treatment of\n      Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS).  Patellofemoral Pain Syndrome (PFPS) is a very common\n      cause of knee pain in young active adults with a high rate of recurrent and/or chronic\n      occurrence.  PFPS is notoriously difficult to treat and has been referred to as \"one of the\n      most vexatious clinical challenges in rehabilitative medicine\".  Its etiology is unclear but\n      is commonly thought to be related to pathomechanics in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ).\n      There are many factors that can influence PFJ mechanics.  Among these, quadriceps strength\n      and timing has been shown to be important.  As such, treatment of PFPS has traditionally\n      been based on correction of pathomechanics through influencing quadriceps strength and\n      timing.  However, a growing body of evidence is revealing the importance of strength and\n      control of hip abduction and external rotation in PFPS.  Hip strength in ab/adduction and\n      rotation is thought to influence femoral positioning in the patellofemoral joint, thereby\n      affecting PFJ mechanics.  Several cohort and smaller RCT studies within the last 7 years\n      have shown that additional exercises for hip strength and control give an improved effect in\n      pain and function compared with quadriceps based training alone.  A smaller RCT from 2012\n      compared isolated hip strengthening exercises to a control group and found surprisingly good\n      results on pain in function in the hip strengthening group.  The investigators plan a RCT in\n      which isolated hip strengthening will be compared to traditional quadriceps training and a\n      control group which will receive no structured training.  Primary outcomes will be pain and\n      function.  This high-quality study will include 40-50 patients in each group, making it one\n      of the largest of its kind on conservative treatment for PFPS.  In contrast to the vast\n      majority of studies of this type, this study will also include men, which will potentially\n      help to fill a significant gap in the literature on this subject.  The investigators study\n      will therefore be an important contribution to elucidating the etiology of PFPS and\n      improving treatment options for both men and women in the future.  As well, the role of\n      psychometric parameters will be examined and a standardized clinical test for hip abduction\n      endurance will be developed."
