Arm 2 will be provided the same weekly feedback and the information of whether\n      his or her adherence is above or below the average adherence in their arm, along with a\n      message of encouragement tailored to their place in the arm distribution. Subjects with\n      perfect adherence will receive: \"You took your pill every day for the last 7 days. Great\n      job! Keep it up\" with their weekly adherence report. Subjects with less than perfect\n      adherence and adherence rate in the top 50% of the arm will receive: \"You took your pill for\n      ** days out of the last 7 days.

Your medication adherence was in the bottom half of the people in this study. If you\n      took your pill more often, you could be in the top half of people in the study\" with their\n      weekly adherence report.
