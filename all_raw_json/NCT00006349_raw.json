Patients are\n      stratified according to cognitive function (normal vs mild to moderate dysfunction vs severe\n      dysfunction) and age (60 and under vs over 60).\n\n      Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive oral donepezil daily and vitamin E twice daily.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive oral placebos according to the same schedule as the study\n           drugs in arm I.\n\n      All patients begin treatment within 2 weeks after completion of prophylactic cranial\n      irradiation. Treatment continues for a minimum of 1 month in the absence of disease\n      progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a 3.0 point drop on the Mini Mental State Examination\n      (MMSE) and/or a 5 point drop on the Blessed Dementia Scale.\n\n      Cognition is assessed using the Blessed Dementia Scale and the MMSE at baseline and then\n      every 3 months during study.\n\n      Quality of life and depression are assessed at baseline and then every 3 months during\n      study.\n\n      Patients are followed every 6 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 104 patients (52 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3 years."
