The main aim is overall improvement in levels of patient pain and mobility. Such\n      surgery involves implantation of both an acetabular and femoral component. With the patient\n      in the lateral decubitus position, the Orthopaedic Surgeon assumes that the pelvis is in a\n      neutral position with respect to all three body planes at the time of acetabular component\n      implantation.\n\n      With regard to THA, the current orthopaedic literature demonstrates a clear relationship\n      between acetabular component positioning, polyethylene wear and risk of dislocation.\n      Problems with edge loading, stripe wear and squeaking are also associated with higher\n      acetabular inclination angles, particularly in hard-on-hard bearing implants.\n\n      The important parameters of acetabular component positioning are depth, height, version and\n      inclination.\n\n      Control of acetabular component inclination, particularly in the lateral decubitus position,\n      is difficult and remains a challenge for the Orthopaedic Surgeon.\n\n      Accurate implantation of the acetabular component within the 'safe zone' of radiological\n      inclination is dependent on:\n\n        -  Operative version\n\n        -  Operative inclination\n\n        -  Pelvic position (Primarily, but not exclusively, abduction / adduction.)\n\n      This study aims to investigate the effect of patient pelvic positioning and method of\n      acetabular component insertion on acetabular component inclination during Total Hip\n      Arthroplasty (THA)."
