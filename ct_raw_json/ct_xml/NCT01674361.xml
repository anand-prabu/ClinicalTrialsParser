    <textblock>
      This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled study will
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of bitopertin (RO4917838) in combination with selective
      serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder.
      Patients will be randomized to receive either bitopertin 30 mg or bitopertin 10 mg or
      placebo orally daily in addition to their background therapy with an SSRI. Anticipated time
      on study treatment is 16 weeks.
