Determine the toxic effects associated with ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with\n      ALVAC-hIL-12 in patients with surgically incurable melanoma.\n\n      II. Characterize the inflammatory and lymphokine response to this regimen in these patients.\n\n      III. Examine the extent of nodule regression, humoral immune response, and cytolytic T cell\n      activity with this regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of ALVAC-hB7.1\n\n      Patients receive ALVAC-hB7.1 alone or combined with ALVAC-hIL-12 intratumorally on days 1,\n      4, 8, and 11. Treatment continues in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6 patients are treated at each dose level of ALVAC-hB7.1. The maximum\n      tolerated dose is defined as the dose of ALVAC-hB7.1 at which no more than 1 of 5 patients\n      experiences dose limiting toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 2, 4, 8, 11, 15, 22, and 43 days after the first vaccination."
