            "textblock": "Critical Limb Ischemia (CLI) is defined as limb pain that occurs at rest, or impending limb\n      loss that is caused by severe compromise of blood flow to the affected extremity.  CLI is a\n      major cause of death and disability (secondary to myocardial infarction, stroke and\n      amputation). The mortality in patients with CLI approaches 13-25% and 50% at one and five\n      years respectively. High on-treatment platelet reactivity (HPR) in patients treated with\n      aspirin and clopidogrel is associated with increased risk of recurrent cardiovascular events\n      after percutaneous coronary interventions and coronary syndromes. Preliminary studies\n      suggest that the prevalence of HPR in patients with critical limb ischemia treated with\n      aspirin and clopidogrel is as high a 78.5%. In patients with coronary artery disease\n      ticagrelor overcomes non-responsiveness to clopidogrel.  However, the antiplatelet effect of\n      ticagrelor in patients with critical limb ischemia is unknown."

For exploratory analysis,\n      patients will be divided in two groups based on the P2Y12 reaction units (PRU): Group 1.\n      High on treatment platelet reactivity on clopidogrel (HPR), defined as P2Y12 reaction units\n      (PRU) \u2265235 and Group 2.
