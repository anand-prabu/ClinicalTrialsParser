      The purpose of this study is to characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of LY03004 following
      an escalating single intramuscular injection at 12.5, 25, 37.5, or 50 mg; and to evaluate
      the safety and tolerability  and preliminary efficacy of LY03004 following intramuscular
      injection.
