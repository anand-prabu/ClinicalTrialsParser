The primary study\n      hypotheses are that individuals with hypersomnolence will have reduced slow wave activity\n      (SWA) during sleep and increased waking theta/alpha activity during wake in specific brain\n      regions.  A secondary hypothesis is that acoustical slow wave induction in hypersomnolent\n      patients will increase SWA during sleep, reduce theta/alpha activity during wake, and\n      improve subjective sleepiness."

Blocks of active acoustic slow wave induction will be followed by blocks of equal duration without induction, in order to make comparisons between stimulation periods (ON) and no stimulation periods (OFF).  Tone intensity will be manually adjusted so as to be above an individual participant's auditory threshold during waking, but still quiet enough as not to awaken the subject from sleep.  Sham slow wave induction will consist of auditory tones played prior to sleep, and during sleep of insufficient timing and intensity to alter slow wave activity.",
