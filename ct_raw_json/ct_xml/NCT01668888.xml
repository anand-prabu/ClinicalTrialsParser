  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inflammation has been known to be a pivotal pathogenic mechanism of obesity-related
      disorders such as type 2 diabetes, metabolic syndrome and atherosclerosis. Adipose tissue
      functions as a major endocrine organ by adipokine mediated modulation of a number of
      signaling cascades in target tissues, that has pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory
      activities. Progranulin and CTRP3 are recently discovered novel adipokines. Therefore, the
      investigators tried to clarify the clinical meaning of these two adipokines in the subjects
      with or without metabolic syndrome
