This can lead to kidney failure over time. Patients whose graft fails to\n      function properly in the first week after transplant do not do as well after 5 years as\n      compared to patients without early problems. This study will see if Thymoglobulin, a drug\n      that suppresses the immune system, will improve early graft function."

            "textblock": "While graft survival of post renal transplant has improved over the last decades, acute\n      rejection remains a problem that clinical research has sought to minimize through improved\n      strategies. Graft survival prognosis is significantly worsened in patients whose allografts\n      exhibit delayed function and patients may require early dialysis. Data shows that cadaveric\n      organ recipients requiring dialysis use in the first transplant week have a 5-year\n      post-graft survival rate of 51 percent compared to 70 percent for those free of this\n      complication. A recent evaluation of Thymoglobulin (a rabbit-derived polyclonal antibody; an\n      immunosuppressant) suggests it is an effective agent worthy of further evaluation as\n      induction therapy. This trial evaluates whether a decreased DGF is seen with an improved Day\n      90 graft function.\n\n      Recipients of a first or second cadaver kidney transplant are randomized pre-transplant to 1\n      of 2 treatment groups. One group receives antibody therapy (Thymoglobulin) at the time of\n      transplant and delayed cyclosporine therapy. The other group starts cyclosporine therapy at\n      the time of transplant without Thymoglobulin. DGF is diagnosed by a less than 20 percent\n      decrease in the serum creatinine levels in the first 24 hours post-transplant and/or the\n      need for dialysis. Patients on the antibody arm receive additional antibody if they\n      experience DGF. Biopsies are performed in all cases of suspected rejection and any patient\n      with biopsy-confirmed acute cellular rejection receives treatment. Patients have regular\n      examinations including blood tests and are evaluated for kidney function and incidence of\n      complications for 24 months after the transplant. The trial endpoint of graft function\n      encompasses graft survival and graft function as calculated by creatinine clearance."
