  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to determine for previously healthy children who present to a
      Canadian Emergency Department (ED) with acute gastroenteritis (infection or irritation of
      the digestive tract); if compared with placebo, the administration of a probiotic agent
      (Lacidofil) will result in a significantly lower proportion of children developing moderate
      to severe disease over the subsequent 2 weeks and will not be associated with a
      significantly greater occurrence of side effects.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The burden of acute gastroenteritis (AGE) on children and their families continues to be
      enormous. It accounts for 1.7 million pediatric emergency department (ED) visits annually in
      the United States and nearly 240,000 in Canada. Children often suffer from prolonged and
      severe illness; amongst hospitalized Canadian children, 19% have clinical sepsis, 7%
      seizures and 4% require intensive care unit admission.3 In a study that we conducted at 11
      Canadian EDs, 51% of children experienced moderate to severe disease. Parents rate such
      episodes as being equivalent to a 10 day admission (moderate) and persistent moderate
      hearing loss (severe). The burden is augmented by the 50% household transmission rate2, 6
      and 42% prolonged work absenteeism rate. Apart from supportive care, health-care providers
      have little to offer to relieve suffering.

      Probiotics, which are defined as viable microbial preparations that have a beneficial effect
      on the health of the host, represent a rapidly expanding field. While they are available as
      over-the-counter products, according to the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug
      Administration has not yet approved a single agent for any health claims. Further, a 2012
      meta-analysis concluded that there is limited data to support their indications and no
      published pediatric gastroenteritis trials reported on side effects. Thus, understanding the
      benefits and side effects of probiotics is crucial before widespread use can be endorsed.
      Although probiotic clinical trials have been performed, only one (still unpublished) has
      been ED based. Most studies to date have been significantly flawed and guidelines do NOT
      endorse their use stating that well-controlled human trials are needed. Consequently, we and
      others have found that they are rarely used in clinical practice. Reasons cited include (1)
      questionable clinical meaning to the outcomes evaluated thus far; (2) absence of studies in
      the appropriate patient population, and (3) a lack of confidence in the quality of probiotic
      agents studied.

      This study will address (1) the needs of the medical community, which is aware of the
      widening gap between the number of important pediatric and adult trials and (2) the interest
      of caregivers in &quot;probiotics&quot; - 71% are aware of the term; 31% believe they may be
      beneficial in children with diarrhea, and &gt; 90% would administer a probiotic if it could
      make their child better. Furthermore, our pilot study has provided promising preliminary
      data and has proven the feasibility of our methods. Thus we are poised to conduct a
      randomized controlled trial (RCT)that will definitively determine if meaningful benefits are
      derived from probiotic use and will provide critical information regarding their mechanism
      of action. This information will impact on practice, the burden of disease, and ensure that
      children receive the best care possible. The results of our proposed RCT will enable
      guidelines to either clearly endorse or recommend against the routine use of a probiotic
      agent in children with Acute Gastroenteritis.
