      The accelerated rehabilitation and early return does not seem to be harmful, but still needs
      further research to define the rehabilitation time is what shows Kruse and collaborators
      (2012) in their study of systematic review. The surgical treatment of anterior cruciate
      ligament injury is the gold standard in the treatment of these injuries in young and active,
      the postoperative rehabilitation is extensive and full return to sport occurs only after 6
      months postoperatively. Based on this gap, the investigators seek to draw properly through
      our study methods and more complex techniques, that comparing two rehabilitation programs
      can achieve high precision early rehabilitation. This will include 32 athletes who had
      complete ACL rupture confirmed by MRI and underwent ACL reconstruction using patellar
      tendon.All subjects will be followed from the pre-surgery, the fourth and sixth month after
      surgery with: KT1000 measures the ligamentous laxity, knee function by applying the
      International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000); Isokinetic Muscle Strength (Cybex).
      Through a random draw of sealed envelopes, patients will be allocated in their
      rehabilitation groups: Accelerated (4 months) or Conventional (6 months). Preoperatively,
      fourth and sixth month after surgery will be an assessment of laxity by (KT1000), Muscular
      Strength (CYBEX) and knee function affected by IKDC (2000) and Hop Test. The assessor and
      the patients were blinded to treatment group. This study will have the locus Institute of
      Orthopaedics and Traumatology, School of Medicine, São Paulo. The comparative results of the
      two groups are analyzed using specific statistical tests to prove an improved significative
      without damaging the integrity of the graft.

      All subjects will be followed for a period of six months. During this period will undergo
      three stages of evaluation.

        1. º Preoperative assessment will consist KT1000 measures the ligamentous laxity, knee
           function by applying the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000); Hop
           Test (jumps with one leg); Isokinetic Muscle Strength (Cybex).

        2. º 4º months pós-surgery KT1000, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000);
           Hop Test; Isokinetic Muscle Strength (Cybex)

        3. º 6º months postoperatively KT1000, International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) +
           Hop Test; Isokinetic Muscle Strength (Cybex)
