Colony-stimulating factors such as sargramostim may increase\n      the number of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person's\n      immune system recover from the side effects of chemotherapy.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining phenylbutyrate,\n      dexamethasone, and sargramostim in treating patients who have refractory or relapsed acute\n      myeloid leukemia."

Patients also receive oral dexamethasone on days 1-4 and 15-18.\n      Treatment continues every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity until complete hematologic remission is induced. Patients with stable disease at\n      the end of 1 course receive at least 2 additional courses.\n\n      Patients are followed twice a week for 3 months, monthly for 1 year, every three months for\n      the next 4 years, and then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 9-24 patients will be accrued for this study in at least 2\n      years."
