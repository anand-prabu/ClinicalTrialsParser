[18F]-SKI-249380 is a drug that\n      will be used with PET scanners to 'see' where [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body, after its\n      injected. The researchers believe that scans with [18F]-SKI-249380 might be able to find\n      tumors in patients.\n\n      This study is being done to see how long [18F]-SKI-249380 stays in the blood, when it is\n      given to people in tiny amounts by an injection into a vein in their arm, and to see where\n      [18F]-SKI-249380 goes in the body. If the results of this trial are good, then the study\n      doctors plan to use [18F]-SKI-249380 in another trial to see if scans with [18F]-SKI-249380\n      are better for finding tumors compared to the standard types of scans that doctors use."

Notably, as\n             dasatinib metabolism is CYP3A4-dependent, the metabolism of [18F]-SKI-249380 may be\n             altered by inhibitors and inducers of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme CYP3A4. The\n             acceptability of medications and other substances used by the patient will be\n             determined by the study investigators.\n\n          -  Dasatinib may alter the biodistribution of [18F]-SKI-249380. A patient who is being\n             or will be treated with dasatinib or has previously-received dasatinib therapy will\n             be eligible for this study, if (in addition to meeting all other study criteria) the\n             following two conditions are acceptable:\n\n               1. The patient will not ingest dasatinib for 60 hours prior to the scheduled\n                  [18F]-SKI-249380 tracer-injection. This allows for systemic 'wash-out' of\n                  dasatinib, if applicable (60 hours \u2248 10 clearance half-times past the average\n                  human plasma Tmax of dasatinib and its metabolites).\n\n               2. The patient will not ingest dasatinib for 3.5 hours after receiving the\n                  [18F]-SKI-249380 tracer-injection. 3.5 hours is the time-period needed for\n                  completion of all study-related [18F]-SKI-249380 PET scans and blooddraws.\n                  Dasatinib therapy can be administered immediately-thereafter, if applicable.\n                  Note: Patients are not required to be taking dasatinib therapy to participate in\n                  this [18F]-SKI-249380 PET study.\n\n          -  Inability or refusal to have at least one peripheral intravenous line for intravenous\n             access (as applicable to the day of [18F]-SKI-249380 injection and blood draws.)\n\n          -  Refusal or inability to tolerate the scanning procedure (e.g., due to claustrophobia)\n\n          -  Hepatic: from assays obtained <2 weeks prior to study enrollment\n\n          -  Bilirubin > 1.5 x institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)\n\n          -  AST/ALT >2.5 x ULN\n\n          -  Albumin < 2 g/dl\n\n          -  GGT > 2.5 x ULN IF Alkaline phosphatase > 2.5 x ULN.\n\n          -  Renal: Creatinine >1.5 x ULN or creatinine clearance < 60 mL/min, from assays\n             obtained <2 weeks prior to study enrollment\n\n          -  Acute major illness (e.g., unstable cardiovascular condition, etc.)"
