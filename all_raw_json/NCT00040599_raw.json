No prior\n             external beam irradiation to a field that includes more than 30% of the red marrow.\n             No prior radiation to maximal tolerable levels for any critical organ (e.g., 3,000\n             cGy for the liver, and 2,000 cGy for the lungs and kidneys).  Patients who have had\n             standard pelvic field radiation as adjuvant therapy for rectal carcinoma will be\n             eligible only after the MTD is established.\n\n          -  Other: Any experimental therapy (i.e., drugs, biologicals, procedures) for the\n             primary malignancy, either during or within four weeks prior to study entry.\n\n        Patient Characteristics/Inclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  Age Range:   Male or Female at least 18 years of age\n\n          -  Performance Status: Patients with a Karnofsky performance status > 70% (or\n             equivalent, ECOG 0-1) and expected survival of at least 3 months.\n\n          -  Hematopoietic: Hemoglobin > 10 g/dL; WBC > 3000 per mm3; Granulocyte count > 1,500\n             per mm3; Platelet count > 100,000 per mm3\n\n          -  Hepatic: Total bilirubin < 1.5 times the institutional upper limit of normal\n             (IULN)AST or ALT < 2 x  IULN\n\n          -  Renal: Creatinine < IULN\n\n          -  Cardiovascular: Patients with LVEF >/= 50% by required MUGA/2D-ECHO study.\n\n          -  Pulmonary: Patients with DFCO and FEV1 >/= 60% by required Pulmonary Function Tests.\n\n          -  Other: Patients who have had a prior imaging study with a murine monoclonal antibody\n             may be included.  Patients agreeing to use a medically effective method of\n             contraception during and for a period of three months after the treatment period.  A\n             pregnancy test will be performed on each premenopausal female of childbearing\n             potential immediately prior to entry into the study.
