  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety and side effects of multiple doses of
      LY2541546 in postmenopausal women when given subcutaneously (injection just under the skin)
      and intravenously (directly into a vein). The study will also test how long it takes the
      study drug to get into the body, how long it takes the body to get rid of it, the overall
      effect of the study drug on the body, and whether antibodies to the study drug are formed.
