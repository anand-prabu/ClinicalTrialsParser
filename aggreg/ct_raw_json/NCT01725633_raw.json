Previous research among persons with breast cancer has shown that\n      breast cancer therapy is associated with side-effects that affect fitness and quality of\n      life. Therefore, the investigators want to determine if aerobic training is appropriate for\n      this population. To date, no study has tested this question and this is the reason for the\n      study."

Safety will be evaluated by the type and\n      prevalence of adverse events during study-related assessments and aerobic training sessions.\n      Tracking and monitoring of exercise-related adverse events will be assessed using the\n      following methods: (1) stringent monitoring and recording (in the patient case report form;\n      case report form, this will include a detailed past medical history, complete blood count\n      panel history from first line chemotherapy, and detailed medication information) of\n      physiologic outcomes and vital signs (e.g., heart rate, blood pressure, etc.) prior to,\n      during, and following every intervention session, and (2) at the beginning of each week, the\n      exercise physiologist will spend the first 10 minutes of every session discussing any\n      potential negative side-effects of the intervention assignment and any injuries that may\n      have occurred. Discussions will include topics such as sleep, depression, diet, exercise,\n      and any other related topics that should come up.  All events will be recorded in the\n      patient CRF, (3) every two weeks all patients will complete the Common Terminology Criteria\n      for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4.0 questionnaire.

Normal cardiac function (left ventricular ejection fraction \u226550%), and\n\n          8.
