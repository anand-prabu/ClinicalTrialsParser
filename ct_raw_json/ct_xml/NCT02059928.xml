  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In emergency situations, access to the venous system is essential in order to administer
      fluids and medication and to monitor patients.  When peripheral veins are difficult to
      access or the patient's condition requires certain medications, or monitoring, central
      venous catheters (CVC) are inserted.  CVC placement introduces a much higher level of risk
      compared to peripheral catheters.  The technique of intraosseous (IO) infusion has been used
      by healthcare professionals for several decades, but recently has gained wide popularity in
      the emergency care settings.  This technique allows providers to secure a needle in the bony
      matrix at the ends of long bones (tibia and humerus) and infuse fluids and medications into
      the intramedullary space.  The ability to monitor a patient's blood pressure through an
      intraosseous needle is unknown.  The primary objective of this study is to  describe the
      relationship (ratio) of intraosseous pressure (IOP) values to standard pressure values,
      including systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial
      pressure (MAP), and central venous pressure (CVP).
