Cancer progression after treatment with the following: surgery, radiation therapy and\n             temozolomide as first line treatment with no other therapy prior to tumor recurrence.\n\n               1. Radiographic progression by RANO Working Group Criteria will be confirmed by\n                  Imaging Endpoints, a central imaging vendor.\n\n               2. By tumor biopsy if conducted within 4 weeks of randomization.\n\n          4. An interval of at least 12 weeks after last dose of radiation and temozolomide is\n             required, unless cancer progression is proven by diagnostic tumor biopsy.  If\n             temozolomide is being used in a maintenance phase, there must be a 28-day washout\n             period prior to Randomization.\n\n          5.
