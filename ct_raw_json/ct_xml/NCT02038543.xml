  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Primary hyperoxaluria is an inborn error of metabolism that results in marked overproduction
      of oxalate by the liver.  The excess oxalate causes kidney failure and can cause severe
      systemic disease due to oxalate deposition in multiple body tissues.

      Metabolic pathways that lead to oxalate are poorly understood, but recent evidence suggests
      that hydroxyproline may play a role.  Sources of hydroxyproline include the diet and bone
      turnover.  If  hydroxyproline can be confirmed as a signficant factor in primary
      hyperoxaluria, diet modification might be of value in reducing the severity of disease.

      This protocol, in which hydroxyproline labelled with a cold isotope is infused intravenously
      in patients with primary hyperoxaluria, will allow us to measure the amount of oxalate
      produced from hydroxyproline.  The contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to the amount
      of oxalate excreted in urine in will be able to be determined for patients with each of the
      known types of primary hyperoxaluria.

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to
      urinary oxalate and glycolate excretion in patients with primary hyperoxaluria.

      Oxalic acid (COOH)2 is an end product of metabolism that is synthesized mainly in the liver.
      We have estimated that 10 - 20 mg is synthesized in the body of healthy adults each day (1).
      The main precursor of oxalate is glyoxylate (CHO•COOH). The bulk of the glyoxylate formed is
      normally transaminated to glycine (NH2•CH2•COOH) by alanine: lyoxylate aminotransferase
      (AGT) or reduced to glycolate (CHOH•COOH) by glyoxylate reductase (GR). Less than 10% of the
      glyoxylate is oxidized to oxalate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). In individuals with the
      disease, primary hyperoxaluria, AGT, GR, or HOGA enzyme is deficient and the amount of
      oxalate synthesized by the liver increases to 80 - 300 mg per day. The increased oxalate
      excreted in urine can cause damage to kidney tissue.  Calcium oxalate stones may form in the
      kidney or calcium oxalate crystals may deposit in renal tubules and the renal parenchyma
      (nephrocalcinosis).  An increased rate of oxalate synthesis could also contribute to
      idiopathic calcium oxalate stone disease. Understanding the pathways of endogenous oxalate
      synthesis and identifying strategies that decrease oxalate production could be beneficial
      for individuals with these diseases.

      Hydroxyproline is the primary source of glyoxylate identified in the body (2). Daily
      collagen turnover of bone results in the formation of 300 - 450 mg of hydroxyproline, which
      cannot be re-utilized by the body and is broken down. This metabolism yields 180 - 250 mg of
      glyoxylate. Further hydroxyproline is obtained from the diet, primarily from meat and
      gelatin-containing products. The bulk of the glyoxylate formed is converted to glycine by
      the liver enzyme AGT, some to glycolate and a small amount to oxalate. The proportion of
      these metabolites is not known with any certainty. In this study, a quantitative estimate of
      the metabolites formed will provide estimates of the contribution of hydroxyproline turnover
      to daily oxalate production. These experiments will provide valuable information for the
      future assessment of the contribution of hydroxyproline metabolism to oxalate production in
      individuals with primary hyperoxaluria.

    <description>Subjects will be infused with 13C5-hydroxyproline and 2H3-leucine for 6 hrs in the CRU. The metabolic flux of 2H3-leucine has been well characterized, and is used as a control when studying the metabolism of trace infusions of labeled amino acids 3. Blood samples will be obtained every 30 min to determine the enrichment of plasma with 13C5-hydroxyproline and 2H3-leucine. Urine collections will be obtained hourly. The fluxes of whole body hydroxyproline and leucine will be calculated</description>
