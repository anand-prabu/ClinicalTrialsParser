Trapeziectomy is performed piecemeal using sharp and blunt dissection.  The base of the first metacarpal is then decorticated with a sagittal saw.  A 4x7 cm sheet of thin FlexHD (HADM) is fashioned by a 4-0 monocryl suture imbrication into the size and shape of the subject's trapezium, keeping the dermal side exposed as much as possible. The allograft is secured with multiple interrupted 3-0 Ticron sutures and the bundle is placed into the post-trapeziectomy space.  Additional suture fixation is performed between the FlexHD and the volar capsule of the trapezium, and base of the thumb metacarpal using 4-0 Mersilene sutures.   The control treatment group will have the same trapeziectomy but without the placement of the FlexHD acellular dermal matrix.",
