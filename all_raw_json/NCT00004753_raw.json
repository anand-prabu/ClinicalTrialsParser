Evaluate the efficacy of cerebral glucose metabolism in observing the pathophysiologic\n      development of HD, monitoring responses to experimental therapy, and predicting HD genotype.\n\n      III.  Identify, define, and describe the natural history of pathophysiologic lesions in HD.\n\n      IV.  Characterize the genotypic and phenotypic expression of the HD gene."
