  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, the incidence of obesity and obesity-related disorders is reaching epidemic
      proportions, which entails an increasing burden for health care systems. The association of
      obesity with other risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease,
      such as insulin resistance and hypertension, is often referred to as the metabolic syndrome.
      During recent years, salt-sensitivity of blood pressure has emerged as an additional
      cardiovascular risk factor that is related to obesity and other key components of the
      metabolic syndrome. The underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of these interrelationships
      are complex and incompletely elucidated. Microvascular dysfunction has been proposed as a
      link between insulin resistance and hypertension in obese individuals. In addition,
      impairment of microvascular function was found to be associated with salt-sensitivity of
      blood pressure. Increased aldosterone levels, as observed in obese individuals, might be a
      cause of microvascular dysfunction-induced salt-sensitivity and insulin resistance.
      Aldosterone not only gives rise to sodium-retention in the distal tubule of the kidney, but
      was also found to impair endothelial function and thus lower NO-availability, which is
      characteristic of microvascular dysfunction. In addition, elevated aldosterone levels are
      associated with both hypertension and insulin resistance, which is illustrated in patients
      with primary aldosteronism, but also in the general population.

      The investigators hypothesize that increased aldosterone levels in obese individuals lead to
      impairment of microvascular function through reduction of NO-availability. This
      microvascular dysfunction is suggested to play a central role in the pathogenesis of
      salt-sensitive hypertension and insulin resistance.
