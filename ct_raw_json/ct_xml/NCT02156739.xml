  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if using 2 different kinds of contrast
      agents (Eovist [gadoxetate] and Magnevist [gadopentetate dimeglumine]) given at the same
      time is better than using 1 contrast agent alone in learning which liver lesions may be
      cancerous.

      Contrast agents are used by doctors in order to see MRI images more clearly.

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will have your routine follow-up MRI as
      scheduled.  On that day, you will receive gadoxetate by vein over about 1 minute, which is
      routine.

      Then, at the 20 minute mark during your MRI, you will receive gadopentetate dimeglumine by
      vein over about 1 minute, which is considered research.  Your MRI scan will then be
      completed as is routine.  Researchers will then compare the images.

      Adding the injection of gadopentetate dimeglumine will add about 5 minutes to the routine
      MRI.  The MRI scan will take 30-45 minutes total.

      Information from your medical records will also be collected as part of this study.

      Length of Study:

      Your active study participation will be over when the MRI is complete.

      This is an investigational study.  The MRI scan in this study is performed using an
      FDA-approved and commercially available method.  Adding gadopentetate dimeglumine as a
      second contrast agent to try to learn which liver lesions may be cancerous is
      investigational.

      Up to 100 participants will be enrolled in this study.  All will take part at MD Anderson.

    <description>Primary objective of this study is to assess the specificity of combining Eovist and  Magnevist in diagnosing tumor lesions radiologically using MRI.   Comparison between the two methods made following method by Obuchowski.
