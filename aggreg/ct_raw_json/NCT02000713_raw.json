A brief neurological examination will be given to determine reflexes.  Subjects will also have magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)scans of the cervical spine(neck).  Women of child-bearing potential will need to have a urine pregnancy test immediately prior to the MRI scan.  Mri scan will take approximately 60 minutes to complete.  The clinical examinations will take approximately 30 minutes to complete.  Subject participation in this study will be complete following the MRI and clinical examinations."
