To estimate the 1-year disease stabilization rate associated with the use of PegIntron\n      (peginterferon alfa-2b) in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent\n      craniopharyngiomas following surgery alone who have not received radiation therapy.\n\n      II. To estimate the sustained objective response rate (partial response [PR] + complete\n      response [CR]) to PegIntron in patients with craniopharyngiomas which progress or recur\n      following radiation therapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To estimate the response rate in patients with progressive unresectable or recurrent\n      craniopharyngioma treated with PegIntron by study stratum.\n\n      II. To estimate the progression-free survival distribution for patients with unresectable or\n      recurrent craniopharyngiomas treated with PegIntron by study stratum.\n\n      III. To evaluate the toxicity profile of PegIntron in children with unresectable or\n      recurrent craniopharyngiomas.\n\n      IV. To compare the protocol specific disease assessment criteria to MacDonald criteria\n      during the first year of treatment in stratum I and at the time of objective response and\n      progressive disease in both strata.\n\n      V. To characterize evidence of wingless-related integration site (WNT) pathway activation in\n      resected tumor tissue in patients with craniopharyngiomas by immunohistochemistry and\n      correlate these results with outcome and response data.\n\n      OUTLINE:\n\n      Patients receive peginterferon alfa-2b subcutaneously (SC) weekly for 6 weeks. Treatment may\n      repeat every 6 weeks for up to 18 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days."
