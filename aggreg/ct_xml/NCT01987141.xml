  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Less than one third of pregnant women actually achieve the Institute of Medicine's (IOM)
      recommended weight gain. To date, there are no randomized controlled trials studying the use
      of the electronic medical record to alert providers to initiate the counseling of patients
      on the IOM gestational weight gain recommendations.

      In the investigator's planned study intervention, using the EPIC EMR system, an electronic
      alert (Best Practice Advisory) will appear for providers at each prenatal care visit.  This
      alert will remind providers to counsel patients on the recommendations for gestational
      weight gain. The control group will receive standard prenatal care, without electronic
      alerts generated regarding BMI and gestational weight gain.

      The investigators hypothesize that a higher percentage of patients who receive the
      intervention will meet the IOM guidelines for weight gain.
