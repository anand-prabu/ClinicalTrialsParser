Oxytocin is a hormone that naturally\n      occurs in the body and the brain and has been shown to be relevant for many behaviors,\n      particularly in social situations. Research on the effects of oxytocin in aging is very\n      scarce; therefore, the purpose of this research project is to determine the effects of\n      oxytocin on socioemotional aging."

            "textblock": "In order to demonstrate oxytocin as a causal mechanism in socioemotional aging, the\n      investigators propose to temporarily elevate oxytocin levels and then measure activity in\n      the brain while participants engage in socially relevant tasks. Participants in this study\n      will be randomly assigned (much like flipping a coin) to receive either a single\n      administration of oxytocin or a placebo (a substance that looks like the oxytocin but does\n      not have any active drug). Neither participants nor the investigator will know to which\n      condition each participant is assigned. Prior to being enrolled into the study a screening\n      to determine eligibility will be conducted. Once the screening visit is completed and it has\n      been determined that subjects can be randomized into the study,  an appointment will be\n      scheduled for the full study visit.\n\n      The purpose of the screening is to determine whether the individual is eligible for\n      participation in the study and will consist of a series of questions about demographics and\n      health history, two saliva samples, two short tasks, blood test, and brief meeting with a\n      licensed clinician to ensure that it is safe for the individual to take part in the magnetic\n      resonance imaging (MRI) and drug administration.\n\n      The study visit will comprise two collections of saliva for laboratory tests prior to and\n      following the oxytocin administration in order to measure levels of the hormone in the body\n      at baseline and after the spray. Saliva samples will also allow for an examination of how\n      oxytocin-related genes may impact cognition and behavior during study tasks. Participants\n      will work on various social tasks while in the MRI scanner, and response accuracy, response\n      time, and brain activity will be recorded. After the scan, participants will complete a\n      series of brief questionnaires on paper and on the computer."
