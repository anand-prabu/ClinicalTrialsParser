The present study\n      will establish a database of prospectively identified patients with Legg-Calv\u00e9-Perthes (LCP)\n      Disease and collect information regarding their presentation, treatment, and outcomes in the\n      course of receiving currently available treatments.\n\n      This study seeks to compare the outcomes of current treatments in the management of three\n      age groups (ages 6\u20148, 8\u201411, >11) of patients with Perthes disease at two- and five-year\n      followup.  For each age group, two to three common treatment regimens currently used by\n      practicing pediatric orthopaedic surgeons will be compared. The intervention a patient\n      receives is determined through physician preference. Physicians pick an intervention for\n      each age group and treat each patient with the same intervention."

TSRH will be the lead center.  Those who agree to participate\n      will seek IRB approval from their own institutions.  Data will be collected prospectively\n      and entered into REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture), a browser-based research\n      database. PROMIS questionnaires will be completed via an online testing system, the NIH\n      funded Assessment Center.\n\n      For the 6\u20148 age patient group, the surgeons who treat their patients with one of the\n      following three treatment regimens currently used in practice will be asked to participate\n      in the study.\n\n        1. Nonoperative management (i.e., without osteotomy);\n\n        2. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)\n           rendered in the early stage of the disease process (stage I); or,\n\n        3. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)\n           rendered in the later stage of the disease process (stage II).\n\n      For the 8\u201411 patient age group, the same treatment regimens will be studied:\n\n        1. Nonoperative management (i.e., without osteotomy);\n\n        2. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)\n           with 6 weeks post-operative non-weight bearing; and,\n\n        3. Operative containment treatment (femoral or pelvic osteotomy or Shelf acetabuloplasty)\n           with 6 months post-operative non-weight bearing.\n\n      For the >11 patient age group, it is known the patients generally have poor prognosis and\n      that the above treatments do not work well.  Thus, we will collect prospective data from\n      surgeons who are currently treating their patients with one of the following alternative\n      treatment regimens 5,6:\n\n        1. Core decompression or multiple epiphyseal drilling of the necrotic femoral head; or,\n\n        2. Hip arthrodiastasis (application of hinged hip distractor) and core\n           decompression/multiple epiphyseal drilling.\n\n        3. Non-operative management of symptoms with non-weight bearing\n\n      Physicians participating in the study determine their preferred treatment arms for each age\n      group and then enroll patients into arms according to the physicians declared treatment\n      preference for the age group. Patient families have the option to elect nonoperative\n      management even if it is the non-preferred treatment option of the physician.\n\n      Information regarding patient characteristics at presentation, physical exam findings,\n      responses to Perthes patient and/or outcomes questionnaires, and results of radiographic and\n      MR imaging studies will be collected.  Participants will be assigned a unique study number.\n      A secure web application, REDCap, will be used to capture and store research information\n      including de-identified radiographic and MR images, clinical information, and Perthes\n      patient and/or outcomes questionnaire responses.\n\n      All patients willing to complete the PROMIS questionnaires will do so regardless of group,\n      treatment, or stage of the disease. The administration of the instrument is facilitated by\n      the use of an online testing platform, the NIH-funded Assessment Center. Data will be\n      transmitted and stored on a secure and dedicated server for the purpose of this study."
