Instead of increasing anti-diabetic\n      medication a highly motivational system with low inhibition threshold is needed. Therefore,\n      the investigators analyzed if regular use of the interactive videogame Wii Fit Plus over 12\n      weeks is able to improve HbA1c and weight in patients with type 2 diabetes."
