Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may be able to replace immune cells that were destroyed\n      by chemotherapy or radiation therapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of bone marrow transplantation using\n      unrelated bone marrow donors in treating patients who have hematologic cancer."

            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine whether the use of donors with a one non crossreactive group (CREG)\n      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients less than 36 years of age is associated with more\n      frequent graft versus host disease (GVHD) of grades III-IV than previously observed with\n      donors with one CREG mismatch. II. Determine whether the use of donors with a one CREG\n      mismatch for HLA-A or B in patients 36-50 years of age is associated with more frequent GVHD\n      of grades III-IV than previously observed with matched donors. III. Determine the relevance\n      of HLA-A allele mismatching in bone marrow transplants from donors matched for HLA-A, B, and\n      DR phenotypes.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a parallel, open label study. Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment\n      arms. Arm I: Patients receive cyclophosphamide IV on days -7 and -6 and total body\n      irradiation (TBI) 3 times a day on days -4 through -1. Allogeneic bone marrow (ABM) is\n      infused on day 0. Arm II: Patients receive therapy as in arm I, except TBI is administered\n      twice a day on day -1 only. ABM is infused on day 0. Arm III: Patients receive\n      cyclophosphamide IV on days -6 and -5 and TBI twice a day on days -3 through -1. ABM is\n      infused on day 0. Males with ALL receive an additional radiation boost to the testes during\n      TBI. Patients are followed at least every 6 months for 2 years, then annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 50 patients under 36 years old and 50 patients 36-50 years old\n      will be accrued for this study within 5 years. Additional patients will be accrued for the\n      standard therapy arm of this study."
