Treatment repeats weekly for 8 courses in\n      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving stable or\n      regressive disease may receive additional treatment.\n\n      Patients are followed for at least 4 weeks after treatment, then every 3 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-25 patients will be accrued for this study."
