  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether or not giving a lower dose of antibiotics
      (Vancomycin) in the area where it is needed (the knee joint) is more effective at preventing
      infection than the current standard dose which is given intravenously (IV) through a wrist
      vein.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be assigned to one of two groups by chance (like a coin toss):

        -  GROUP 1 - Will receive 500mg of vancomycin into the tibia (shin) bone of the leg being
           operated on.

        -  GROUP 2 - Will receive 1g of vancomycin, which is the amount normally given to
           patients.  This will be into the wrist vein (IV).

      The patient nor the Principal Investigator can choose the study group. Patients will have an
      equal chance of being assigned to either group.

      GROUP 1:   Vancomycin will be injected into blood vessels that are inside the bone of the
      leg being operated on. This is a common technique used in intensive care units and emergency
      departments. This method allows a lower dose of vancomycin to be used.

      GROUP 2:  Vancomycin will be given as standard of care into an arm vein (IV), where it
      travels around the entire body through the bloodstream.

      For both groups, the revision knee replacement will then be carried out as normal.

      OTHER ANTIBIOTICS

      All patients will receive cefazolin IV (an antibiotic used to prevent infection) prior to
      the beginning of surgery to ensure effective preventive antibiotics.  The patient will also
      receive 3 postoperative doses of cefazolin over a 24-hour period (4 doses in total). This is
      standard of care for all total knee replacement surgeries.

      TISSUE SAMPLES

        -  Nine tissue samples will be taken during the surgery, consisting of both bone and fat
           beneath the skin. Each sample is very small, around the size of a pinhead.  Where
           possible the samples will be taken from tissue that is normally discarded during a
           normal knee replacement procedure.  Otherwise the samples will be taken from areas that
           will not compromise the structure or function of the knee and are already exposed for
           normal surgical procedures.

        -  In addition, a drain sample will be taken from the knee joint drain fluid to measure
           vancomycin concentration the morning following surgery.

        -  These samples are frozen and sent to a lab for analysis.  Patients will not be notified
           of the results, as they are for research purposes only and will not affect clinical
           care.
