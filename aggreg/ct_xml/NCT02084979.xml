      This two-year randomized controlled trial of clinical outcomes seeks to evaluate the
      superiority of the asynchronous telepsychiatry (ATP) consultation model on access, quality,
      cost and outcomes of care over the usual care for adults referred from primary care clinics
      for psychiatric evaluation and treatment.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This project addresses a critical public mental health problem: the need to improve access
      to high quality, mental health services for diverse populations through improving the flow
      of clinical work across care settings (primary care and specialty care) by implementing an
      efficient, provider compatible, administratively simple health IT solution: Asynchronous
      Telepsychiatry. To assess the impact of this novel approach, this two-year randomized
      controlled trial of clinical outcomes seeks to evaluate the superiority of the asynchronous
      telepsychiatry (ATP) consultation model on access, quality, cost and outcomes of care over
      the usual care for adults referred from primary care clinics for psychiatric evaluation and
      treatment.

      Aim 1: To assess whether the ATP delivery model improves clinical OUTCOMES in adult patients
      referred for psychiatric treatment by their PCPs; Hypotheses: Compared to the participants
      in the 'usual care&quot; arm, participants in the ATP arm will show:

      H1: Higher scores over the course of treatment (better clinical trajectory) on the
      Short-Form-12 Health Survey (SF12- the primary outcome measure), the Clinical Global
      Impressions scale (CGI), the Who Disability Schedule (WHODAS) and the Global Assessment of
      Functioning (GAF) score.

      H2 (Exploratory): Improved clinical trajectories on specific disorder scales, such as the
      PSQ9, the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAMA), the GAD7 and the AUDIT substance abuse scale over
      the those in the &quot;usual care&quot; arm.

      Aim 2: To assess whether ATP improves the QUALITY of care for adult patients referred for
      psychiatric treatment by their PCPs and for PCP providers; Hypotheses: Compared to the
      participants in the 'usual care&quot; arm, participants in the ATP arm will show:

      H1: higher levels of satisfaction (as measured by the patient rated Patient Telemedicine
      Satisfaction Survey which includes a general care satisfaction measure to be used across TAU
      and ATP groups and by the provider rated Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction Questionnaire)
      H2 (Exploratory- Spanish only speaking participants): will report more positive ratings of
      their provider on the Interpersonal Processes of Care Survey short form. Hypothesis: PCP's
      will be highly satisfied with the quality of ATP H3: PCPs with patients referred to the ATP
      arm will report high satisfaction ratings on the Telemedicine Provider Satisfaction
      Questionnaire. Aim 3: To assess whether ATP improves EFFICIENCY and REACH through reducing
      COSTS and increasing ACCESS for adult patients referred for psychiatric treatment by their
      PCPs; Hypotheses: Compared to care in the 'usual care&quot; arm, care in the ATP arm will: H1: be
      more cost effective than &quot;usual care&quot; arm as measured by comprehensive economic data that
      will be collected from patient, provider, and payor perspectives.

      H2: produce shorter wait-times for appointment and consultation feedback as measured by
      comprehensive efficiency data that will be collected from patient, provider, and payor
      perspectives.

    <description>The PHQ-9 is the nine item depression scale of the Patient Health Questionnaire to assist clinicians with diagnosing depression and monitoring treatment response. The nine items of the PHQ-9 are based directly on the nine diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder in the DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Fourth Edition). This can help track a patients overall depression severity as well as the specific symptoms that are improving or not with treatment. The PHQ-9 was developed by Robert L. Spitzer, MD, Janet B.W. Williams, DSW, and Kurt Kroenke, MD, and colleagues at Columbia University</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Participants will be adults, fully able to consent, aged 18 or older referred by
             PCPs. We will not include children or prisoners in the study as this is a study of
             adult primary care patients. We will not exclude pregnant women. We will ask
             participating PCPs to refer patients who they feel may have a non-urgent psychiatric
             issue, particularly those they feel may need treatment for:  mood disorder, anxiety
             disorder, or substance/alcohol abuse disorder(s). Many patients will have comorbid
             conditions and multiple diagnoses, on both axes I and II of DSM-IV. These diagnoses
             will be noted as would happen under routine clinical circumstances, and patients with
             multiple diagnoses will not be excluded. We will accept patients with a primary
             diagnosis of a psychotic disorder, but predict that they will be few, as occurred in
             our preliminary studies, as these patients tend to be managed in County mental health
             systems

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  We will exclude any patients less than 18 years, patients with imminent suicidal
             ideation and/or plans, who have immediate violent intentions or plans, who have
             significant cognitive deficits and any patient who's PCP recommends not
             participating. Patients who meet the exclusion requirements due to safety concerns
             will be identified and referred through appropriate channels for emergency care.
             Patients who are referred but do not meet the study criteria will be referred to
             local agencies and back to their PCP who can assist them in finding the appropriate
             psychiatric care in accordance with usual care. Subjects must be 18 or older and
             present with non-urgent psychiatric issues (urgent is defined as exhibiting imminent
             suicidal ideation and/or plans, who have immediate violent intentions or plans, or
             who have significant cognitive deficits). These criteria will be determined based on
             the clinical judgment of the physicians who will be evaluating the patients prior to
             referral, through study screening material during recruitment, and will be
             re-evaluated at baseline and as required in both arms of the study. Both patients and
             their referring providers will be subjects in the study and will provide informed
             consent.
