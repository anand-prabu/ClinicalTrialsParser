The basic hypothesis of this study is that preoperative thoracic multilevel\n           paravertebral nerve blockade and multilevel intercostal nerve blockade performed at the\n           end of surgery will provide superior postoperative analgesia and lower opioid\n           consumption compared to PCA alone during the first 24 hours following surgery.\n\n        2. Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade will reduce the incidence\n           of chronic pain at 6 months following surgery.\n\n        3. Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade and multilevel\n           intercostal nerve blockade performed at the end of surgery will shorten the length of\n           stay in the intermediate intensive care unit and shorten the hospital stay.\n\n        4. Preoperative thoracic multilevel paravertebral nerve blockade and multilevel\n           intercostal nerve blockade performed at the end of surgery will reduce postoperative\n           pulmonary complications."

            "textblock": "Video-assisted thoracoscopy is increasing in popularity.  Although it is considered a less\n      invasive treatment than thoracotomy, patients have reported moderate to severe pain of\n      variable duration.  Benefits of adequate analgesia no longer need to be demonstrated.\n      Optimal analgesia leads to faster recovery, reduces the risk of postoperative complications,\n      enhances patient's satisfaction and quality of life following surgery.  Furthermore,\n      adequate postoperative analgesia may reduce the occurrence of chronic pain.  The incidence\n      of chronic pain following thoracoscopic procedures ranges from 20-47%.\n\n      The ideal postoperative analgesia regimen for the pain related to thoracoscopy has not been\n      elucidated.\n\n      Systemic opioids given through patient-controlled devices (PCA) may be used after\n      thoracoscopic procedures but the analgesic effect can be limited and undesirable\n      side-effects may occur.\n\n      Thoracic epidural has emerged as the preferred pain control technique following\n      thoracotomy.  However, the role of epidural analgesia after thoracoscopy remains debatable.\n      Side-effects may outweigh the benefits of the technique in the context of  minimally\n      invasive surgeries.\n\n      Paravertebral blockade is an alternative to epidural analgesia.  The duration of pain relief\n      associated with this technique may vary from 4 to 48 hours.  Its effectiveness has been\n      shown to be equal or superior to that of epidural analgesia for post-thoracotomy pain.  Its\n      popularity  for pain management following thoracotomy has promoted its use after\n      thoracoscopic procedures.  Preoperative paravertebral blockade could also result in a\n      reduction of chronic pain following surgery.\n\n      Intercostal nerve blockade is widely used to alleviate pain following thoracoscopy.  This\n      technique is known to provide adequate short-term pain relief.\n\n      Both paravertebral and intercostal blocks could be interesting adjuncts to\n      patient-controlled devices for pain management following thoracoscopic procedures.\n\n      This study will compare the efficacy of preoperative paravertebral nerve blockade to\n      intercostal nerve blockade performed before skin closure to PCA alone to reduce the\n      intensity of pain following thoracoscopic procedures. All patients will have a PCA device as\n      their primary analgesic modality."
