    <description>Determine the safety and tolerability of LGG in patients receiving abdominal or pelvic chemoradiation with a fluoropyrimidine
The DSMC will review the data as part of an interim analysis when the last patient has had 30 days of follow-up.  The DSMC will ensure that at least 18 patients have had follow-up at 30 days (with expected 10% drop-out).  Accrual to the randomized portion of the trial will occur only if there are no episodes of lactobacillus associated septicemia.  Additionally, if two or more serious adverse events of a similar nature occur and a causal relationship to the investigational product cannot be excluded, accrual to the randomized portion will not occur.</description>

    <description>The average AUC of the FACIT-D diarrhea subscale scores will be compared between the two treatment groups using a two-sample t-test.
The FACIT-D will be completed at baseline, weekly during radiation treatment, for the two weeks following completion of radiation treatment, 12 months following the end of radiation treatment, and years 2-5 following the completion of radiation treatment.</description>
