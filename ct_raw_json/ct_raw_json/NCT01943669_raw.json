ReWalk\u2122 users control\n      their ambulation through subtle changes in centre of gravity and upper-body movements.\n      Before, during and after training sessions the volunteers will perform standardised\n      assessments and complete questionnaires to assess the functional and psychological effects\n      of the exoskeleton. Functional outcomes primarily focus on ambulation outcomes and\n      psychological outcomes primarily focus on predisposition and perceptions of disability.
