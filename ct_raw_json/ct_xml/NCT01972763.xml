    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of Ranibizumab 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg
      in subjects who were previously treated with Bevacizumab and subsequently switched to
      Aflibercept.  These subjects have demonstrated a sub-optimal therapeutic response to the
      previous therapies; therefore, the study aims to see if Ranibizumab may have a greater
      treatment effect.
