Clinical research has evolved into an\n      increasingly narrow focus on specific diseases and disease presentations in select subgroups\n      of patients. It is desirable and consistent with Clinical Center policy, for clinical\n      investigators to maintain exposure to a more broad spectrum of disease and disease\n      presentations than mandated by the clinical research protocols in order to preserve clinical\n      skills of physician and nursing staff, ensure adequate training of clinical research\n      fellows, and stimulate ideas for future clinical research.  This protocol permits evaluation\n      and treatment of patients with cardiovascular diseases who do not fulfill eligibility\n      criteria for participation in existing clinical research protocols, but who are of medical\n      interest for the purpose of training professional staff."
