  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the patient experience when using gabapentin with
      other pain control medications after posterior spinal fusion surgery for scoliosis in
      adolescents. These results will be compared to patients who underwent the same procedure
      during the study period and received the same standardized pain control regimen excluding
      gabapentin. Effects on pain level, opioid use, satisfaction and narcotic use after discharge
      from the hospital will be measured. Opioid side effects including nausea, sedation and
      urinary retention (inability to empty one's bladder) will also be recorded.The null
      hypotheses are as follows:

        1. There is no significant difference in pain control when adding gabapentin to a
           multimodal pain management protocol in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion
           patients.

        2. There is no significant difference in the amount of opiate medication required for pain
           control in pediatric post-operative posterior spinal fusion patients.
