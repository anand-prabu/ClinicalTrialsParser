However, its use is hampered by a specific neurotoxicity, which is characterized by\n      acute thermal hypersensitivity, notably to cold temperatures, and by chronic neuropathy\n      appearing with the repetition of chemotherapy cycles.\n\n      To this date there is no effective therapy able to prevent and/or to treat these adverse\n      drug reactions. So oncologists are sometimes strained to decrease anticancer doses or to\n      stop chemotherapy; Previously, a polyamine deficient diet has been able to prevent acute\n      oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity in animals.\n\n      So we hypothesizes that a specific nutritional therapy, a polyamine deprived diet, may\n      prevent acute oxaliplatin-induced hypersensitivity in patients."
