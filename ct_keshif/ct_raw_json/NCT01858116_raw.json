[68Ga]ABY-025 PET with low dose (100 \u03bcg) of\n           ABY-025 peptide is performed, followed by a repeated PET within three weeks using high\n           dose (500 \u03bcg) ABY-025 peptide (radioactivity maximum 500 MBq). A third [68Ga]ABY-025\n           PET will be performed in the HER2-positive subgroup only, when signs of progressive\n           disease are found at routine clinical evaluation or else latest after 12 months\n           regardless of disease status, then using the ABY-025 peptide dose previously determined\n           to be preferable.\n\n        2.
