      acids for pregnant women with depressive symptoms.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Maternal depression can have a significant harmful influence on both mothers and children.
      Considering the possibility of adverse effects of antidepressants and previous meta-analyses
      showing the positive effects of omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) supplementation
      in reducing depressive symptoms, omega-3 PUFAs may provide a safe strategy. The
      investigators evaluate efficacy and safety of omega-3 PUFAs for pregnant women with
      depressive symptoms.
