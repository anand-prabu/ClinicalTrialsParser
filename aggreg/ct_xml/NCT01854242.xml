  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to understand the relationship between inflammatory
      bowel disease (IBD) and Glycogen storage disease (GSD)type Ia.  GSD type Ib has been
      established to have an association with IBD with clinical and histologic features that
      mirror those of Crohn disease.  Development of the disease seems to be related to the defect
      of neutrophil function in individuals with GSD type Ib and subsequent colonic inflammation.
      In the last decade, it has become a standard for patients with GSD type Ib and
      gastrointestinal symptoms to be evaluated for IBD.  Patients with GSD type Ia were not
      recognized to have similar gastrointestinal symptoms until recently.  The prevalence of IBD
      is greater in patients with GSD type Ia versus the general population.

      The purpose of this research study is to understand the relationship between IBD and GSD
      type Ia. The Investigators will be attempting to develop a blood test which will be aimed at
      the participants diagnosis of IBD.

      As a participant in this research study, a blood sample will be collected during your
      admission to the University of Florida.   This will not affect the length of stay of your
      scheduled visit.  There will be no scheduled clinic follow-up.

        Glycogen storage disease (GSD) type I is an autosomal recessive disorder of glycogen
        metabolism that affects approximately 1 in 100,000 live births (1).  Mutations of the
        genes that encode glucose 6-phosphatase [type Ia] (2) and glucose 6-phosphate translocase
        [type Ib] (3) have been isolated.  Diagnosis is usually suspected in infants with fasting
        hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, hyperlipidemia, and hepatomegaly.  Other features include
        stomatitis, growth retardation, osteopenia and hyperuricemia.
