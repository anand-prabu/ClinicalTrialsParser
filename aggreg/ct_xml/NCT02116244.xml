  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) or Dry Eye Syndrome is a disease of the surface of the eye,
      tear film, and related ocular tissues.  Millions of people suffer from one form of the
      disease or another and its prevalence increases with age.  Dry Eye Syndrome sufferers
      experience a broad range of symptoms including discomfort, irritation, burning, itching,
      redness, pain, gritty feeling, foreign body sensation, blurred vision and ocular fatigue.
      Civamide is a TRPV-1 receptor modulator that causes the initial stimulation of neuropeptide
      release and subsequent desensitization to further stimulation of the trigeminovascular
      system.  This provides a pharmacological rational for intranasal route of administration for
      disorders mediated by the trigeminal nerve or involving the cranial nerve.  In nine clinical
      studies of Civamide Nasal Solution, over 50% of the nearly 300 patients who received
      Civamide via intranasal administration experienced lacrimation (tearing).  This led to the
      hypothesis that Civamide Nasal Solution might be an appropriate treatment for Dry Eye
      Syndrome.
