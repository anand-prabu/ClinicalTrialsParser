  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' objective is to describe the variability of rifampicin absorption,
      markers of inflammation and gut damage, intestinal absorptive capacity, and intestinal
      permeability among HIV-infected volunteers. Rifampicin is the least well absorbed of the
      first-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. Rifampicin malabsorption is frequently observed in
      HIV-infected patients with active tuberculosis, but cannot be predicted by patient factors
      such as CD4+ T cell count, viral load, or the presence of diarrhea. The mechanisms for
      rifampicin malabsorption in HIV-infected patients are unknown. An understanding of
      mechanisms for rifampicin malabsorption could eventually lead to new therapeutic targets,
      with the ultimate goal of improving HIV/tuberculosis treatment outcomes.

          -  T cell count greater than 350 cells/mm3

          -  Body Mass Index (BMI) greater or equal to 19 and less than or equal to 33.

          -  Weight greater than 60 kilograms.

          -  Ability and willingness to provide informed consent.

          -  Ability to swallow oral medications

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Breastfeeding.

          -  Allergy or sensitivity to rifampicin.

          -  Prior history of documented active tuberculosis infection.

          -  Receipt of any investigational therapy, chemotherapy, or immune modulatory agents
             within 42 days prior to study entry.

          -  The following laboratory values obtained within 42 days prior to study entry:

        Hemoglobin &lt; 12.0 g/dL; Females: Hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g/dL Platelet count &lt; 100,000/mm3 AST,
        ALT, and bilirubin &gt; 5x ULN An estimated creatinine clearance &lt; 80 mL/min based on the
        Cockroft-Gault equation

          -  Positive blood test for latent tuberculosis infection (T-SPOT)

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential must have a negative serum or urine
             pregnancy test performed with 28 days prior to study entry.

        &quot;Female participants of reproductive potential&quot; is defined as women who have reached
        menarche or who have not been post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e. who
        have had menses within the preceding 24 months) or who have not undergone surgical
        sterilization (e.g. hysterectomy, or bilateral oophorectomy or salpingectomy).

          -  Female participants of reproductive potential that are using oral contraceptive pills
             (OCPs) must be willing to use barrier precautions for contraception for at least 7
             days following each study visit.

          -  Use of any of the following prescription medications within 30 days prior to study
             entry, which may have drug-drug interactions with rifampicin, including (but not
             limited to):

               -  Anti-coagulants (warfarin)

               -  Cardiac drugs (digoxin, quinidine, verapamil, nifedipine, metoprolol, atenolol,
                  carvedilol)

               -  Hypoglycemics (rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, glipizide, repaglinide)

               -  Proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, esomeprazole,

               -  Immune modulators (tacrolimus, cyclosporine)

               -  Corticosteroids (dexamethasone, prednisone, hydrocortisone)

               -  H2 blockers (ranitidine, cimetidine)

               -  HMG CoA reductase inhibitors (atorvastatin, pravastatin, simvastatin)

               -  Benzodiazepines (alprazolam, diazepam, midazolam, triazolam)

               -  CNS-acting drugs (amitriptyline, buproprion, clozapine, phenytoin)

          -  Evidence of current ongoing tobacco use, illicit drug use, or average alcohol use of
             greater than 2 drinks per day.

          -  Any illness that, in the opinion of the study investigator, might confound the
             results of the study, or pose an additional risk to the subject by his or her
             participation in the study.
