Four separate cohorts of\n      unique elderly subjects (55 to 80 years) will be utilized, with each cohort randomized to\n      receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in a 3:1 ratio as a single dose. A disposition\n      evaluation will be performed 7 days later. Part 2 is a multiple ascending dose (MAD) design\n      to assess the local ocular and systemic safety and tolerability of LHA510 administered at\n      various concentrations and dosing frequencies. Six separate cohorts of unique AMD subjects\n      will be utilized, with each cohort randomized to receive either topical LHA510 or vehicle in\n      a 3:1 ratio for 7 days. A disposition evaluation will be performed 14 days after the first\n      dose of study drug. A review of all available safety data will be conducted by the Sponsor\n      and the PI(s) prior to dose escalation (cohort progression)."
