It is shown various complications: portal\n      hypertension, hepatocellular carcinoma, hepato-renal syndrome, etc.\n\n      Thus, it is important to have this information to manage disease and determine specific\n      therapy. However, register-based studies in have not been reported in Korea.\n\n      The goal of this study is to describe the natural history of a large number of patients with\n      liver cirrhosis prospectively followed, and to identify predictors of the occurrence of\n      Hepatocellular carcinoma."

Biological tests, endoscopy,liver ultrasonography\n      (including ARFI) and HVPG measurements will be performed if not done within 90 days prior to\n      inclusion. During this visit, 20 ml of blood will be collected for freezing and storage of\n      serum and plasma, and constitution of a DNA library.\n\n      Monitoring: Patients will have regular surveillance with blood test, liver ultrasonography\n      and medical consultation at least every 6 months, periodic assessment of esophageal, gastric\n      varices and portal hypertensive gastropathy (every 1 year) and prevention of their rupture\n      if any. An additional blood sampling of 20 ml will be taken at baseline and every year in\n      order to perform whole blood, serum, plasma, PBMC and DNA libraries; Data will be\n      standardized and centralized in a single database.\n\n      And alcoholic LC patients will undergo liver biopsy for PCR, wetern blot,\n      immunohistochemistry and RNA analysis.\n\n      After measurement of HVPG and Liver stiffness at baseline a Non-selective beta-blocker\n      (NSBB,carvedilol) was initiated and increased stepwise (weekly) until the systolic blood\n      pressure remained at>100 mmHg and the heart rate was not <60. The maximum target dose for\n      carvedilol 25 mg/day. The HVPG response to NSBB was again assessed 6 weeks after the intake\n      of carvedilol. A hemodynamic response to NSBB treatment was defined as a reduction in HVPG\n      >=20% compared to baseline or to an absolute value <=12 mmHg. Compliance with therapy was\n      monitored by monitoring of HR and blood pressure during clinical visits."
