            "textblock": "Cough is one of the most common reasons for consultation. Even if cough is a non-specific\n      symptom, it can be the first sign of a chronic pathology. Several studies have demonstrated\n      that chronic cough causes quality-of-life (QoL) impairment. Physicians' incapability to\n      evaluate cough impact and patients' QoL has been documented. Therefore, a parent-proxy QoL\n      chronic cough specific questionnaire (PC-QOL) has been developed and validated by Chang A.\n      B.\n\n      Objective : The aim of the study is to validate the French version of the PC-QoL, a\n      parent-proxy QoL chronic cough specific questionnaire.\n\n      Methods : Linguistic validation will be performed using backward/forward translation\n      guidelines, and cognitive debriefing by 10 parents. Psychometric validation will be tested\n      in 150 patients. Inclusion criteria are: patients with a diagnosis of chronic cough (> 4\n      weeks); 18 years of age or younger; all etiologies excepting cystic fibrosis. Informed\n      consent from parents will be obtained. At enrollement, each parent will fulfill the PC-QOL\n      questionnaire and two cough-related measures (visual analogue score, verbal category\n      descriptive). Clinical data (medical history, physical examination) will be collected.\n      Children QoL will be assessed using VSPA, Kidscreen and Qualin questionnaires. For assessing\n      reproductibility and sensitivity to change, parents will be retested 7 and 21 days later.\n      Content validity, construct's validity, external validity and instrument's reliability will\n      be explored."
