      This study is designed to compare two different styles of intramuscular injection (Bunch
      versus Z-Track)during flu vaccination with the following outcome measures as basis for
      comparison: perceive pain, redness, medication leakage, other complications within 72 hours
      in healthy adult volunteer subjects.
