            "textblock": "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends a staged approach to the management of\n      pediatric overweight and obesity, starting with Stage 1, Prevention Plus, which encourages\n      families to improve lifestyle choices related to eating and activity in order to improve BMI\n      status. Most pediatric practices, however, have difficulty implementing these guidelines due\n      to limited time and access to weight loss experts to whom they can refer their patients and\n      families, and burden to families in accessing in-person weight loss services. In response,\n      The investigators team developed the FITLINE pediatric practice-based referral program that\n      provides practices an easily accessible resource to help families make AAP-recommended Stage\n      1 lifestyle changes.  The program includes two components.  The first, a pediatric\n      practice-based component, consists of systems to identify overweight and obese children ages\n      8-12, a brief pediatric provider-delivered intervention, referral to the FITLINE counseling\n      program, and feedback from the FITLINE nutritionist.  The second, a parent support\n      component, consists of eight weekly FITLINE counseling telephone calls delivered by\n      centrally located nutritionists who provide tailored, personalized coaching, along with a\n      parent booklet to guide parents in setting goals and working with their child to make Stage\n      1 lifestyle changes.  Providers receive a summary from the nutritionist of the progress made\n      by families so they may support maintenance of an improved lifestyle, or refer for\n      additional intervention. The proposed five-year cluster randomized controlled pediatric\n      practice-based trial will compare the effectiveness of two practice-based interventions on\n      improving diet and physical activity and reducing BMI among  overweight and obese 8-12 year\n      olds seen in pediatric practice.  The first consists of the pediatric practice-based\n      component plus FITLINE counseling and booklet (PP-FITLINE); the second consists of the same\n      practice-based component, but only the parent materials mailed over 8 weeks, with no\n      referral to FITLINE counseling (PP-Mailings).  Sixteen pediatric primary care practices will\n      be randomized to either the PP-FITLINE (N=8) or the PP-Mailings condition (N=8).  Five\n      hundred and twelve parents of children ages 8-12 with a body mass index (BMI) of > 85th\n      percentile (overweight or obese) will be recruited from the practices (32/practice) to\n      achieve N=400 at 12 month follow-up (25/practice).  Assessments will be completed at\n      baseline and 6- and 12-months post-baseline.  The specific aims of this study are to\n      determine the effectiveness of the PP-FITLINE program in reducing BMI in overweight and\n      obese children and improving the child's diet and physical activity (PA) behaviors; explore\n      possible mechanisms of the effect of the PP-FITLINE program on BMI, diet and PA; and conduct\n      a cost-effectiveness analysis.  If found to be effective and cost-effective, the PP-FITLINE\n      program will provide a model for widespread implementation of Stage 1, Prevention Plus of\n      the AAP expert committee recommendations through pediatric practices nationwide,\n      contributing significantly to the development of new standards for weight management care in\n      pediatric practice."
