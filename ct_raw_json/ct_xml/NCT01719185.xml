  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study designed to test the hypothesis that the combination of phentermine
      and B12 will result in significantly greater weight loss among obese patients compared to
      phentermine alone.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study is a double blind, randomized controlled trial designed to determine the
      significance of the combination therapy of phentermine and B12 injections among the obese
      population.  The study population will be recruited from the ECU Physicians Internal
      Medicine clinic. Physicians will select patients meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria
      from their clinic to be approached for recruitment.  Approximately 30 patients will be
      recruited and blindly randomized to either the treatment group (phentermine and B12 in
      combination) or the control group (phentermine alone).  Patients will be randomized by means
      of block randomization in a 1:1 ratio.  Neither patients nor study team members will be
      aware of group assignments through the entire duration of the study.  Once randomized, both
      groups will begin taking 37.5 mg/day orally of phentermine as well as receive weekly
      intramuscular injections of either 1000 mg B12 or Saline depending on their group
      assignment.  The study will consist of approximately 15 visits over the course of 3 months.
