      The purpose of this study is to determine whether baricitinib 4 milligram (mg) once daily
      (QD) is superior to placebo in the treatment of participants with moderately to severely
      active Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) who have had inadequate response to or are intolerant to at
      least 1 conventional disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (cDMARD)(cDMARD-IR [inadequate
      response] participants) and who have not received a biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic
      drug (DMARD).
