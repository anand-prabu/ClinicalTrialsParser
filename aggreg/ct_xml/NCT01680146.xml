  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: The progressive loss of skeletal muscle mass with aging, or sarcopenia, has a
      major impact on our healthcare system due to increased morbidity and greater need for
      hospitalization and/or institutionalization. One way to prevent skeletal muscle loss is to
      improve dietary intake of the elderly. It has already been shown that ingestion of dietary
      protein stimulates muscle protein synthesis and inhibits muscle protein breakdown, resulting
      in an overall positive net protein balance. However, the impact of fat (as part of the meal)
      on dietary protein-induced muscle protein synthesis remains largely unknown. Based on
      previous studies by other research groups, we hypothesize that fat further stimulates the
      muscle anabolic response to protein ingestion.

      Objective: The primary objective of this study is to investigate the effect of a single
      meal-like amount of protein with or without fat on postprandial muscle protein synthesis
      rates in healthy elderly men. Furthermore, as a secondary objective, we will assess
      digestion and absorption kinetics.

      Study design: double-blind randomized intervention study Study population: 24 healthy
      elderly men (55-85 y) Intervention: one group (n=12) will consume a test beverage of 350 mL
      containing 20 g of intrinsically labeled casein, and the other group (n=12) will consume a
      beverage of the same volume containing 20 g of casein plus 20 g of fat.

      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary endpoint: muscle protein synthesis rates. Secondary
      endpoint: digestion and absorption kinetics.

    <description>The main study endpoint is muscle protein synthesis (MPS) rates. In order to determine the MPS, the following parameters will be measured:
Muscle protein-bound L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine, L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine, and L-[1-13C]-leucine enrichment (expressed as MPE)
Plasma L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]-KIC enrichment (expressed as MPE)

    <description>Secondary endpoints include protein digestion and absorption kinetics. Therefore, the following parameters will be measured:
Plasma phenylalanine, tyrosine, and leucine concentration (expressed as Î¼mol/L)

L-[1-13C]-phenylalanine
L-[1-13C]-tyrosine
L-[1-13C]-leucine
L-[ring-2H5]-phenylalanine
L-[ring-2H4]-tyrosine
