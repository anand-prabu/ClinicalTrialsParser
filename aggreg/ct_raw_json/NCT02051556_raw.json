The symptoms of PD generally show an asymmetric\n      onset and progression.\n\n      In particular, impairments in rhythmicity, symmetry, and bilateral coordination  have been\n      reported to be associated with FOG episodes. As the maintenance of gait depends on the\n      precise alternating movements of both legs, irregularities in rhythm, symmetry, and\n      bilateral coordination may impair gait sequence, potentially causing freezing.\n\n      Results of recent studies strongly suggest that bilateral uncoordinated gait and marked gait\n      asymmetry are associated with FOG. Moreover, it has recently been hypothesized that this may\n      lead to a degree of asymmetric motor function, and that FOG in parkinsonian patients is\n      triggered by a breakdown in the bilateral co-ordination underlying the normal timing of\n      gait. Aim of the study was to evaluate how the modulation of asymmetry through physical\n      therapy might improve gait and FOG."
