      Validation of [18F]-FES for imaging of estrogen receptors in the brain

      The primary objective of the study is to determine if [18F]-FES Positron Emission Tomography
      (PET) can be used to quantify the estrogen receptor expression in the human brain.

    <textblock>
      Estrogens are the primary female sex hormones that play a major role in the development and
      maintenance of secondary sexual functions. In addition, estrogens play an important role in
      cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, immunological, bone development and central nervous system
      processes. Actions of estrogens are mediated by a group of specialized receptors, known as
      estrogen receptors. Estrogens were found to be neuroprotective and may thus protect against
      development of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and
      multiple sclerosis. In addition, estrogens may also play an important role in psychiatric
      disorders, like depression. To improve our understanding of the action of estrogens in the
      brain, it is important to study the expression of estrogen receptors in the brain. Positron
      emission tomography (PET) is the most suitable technique for non-invasive imaging of brain
      receptors. [18F]FES is a PET tracer that is regularly used in the UMCG to image the estrogen
      receptor expression in breast cancer patients, but has never been used for quantitative
      imaging of brain estrogen receptors. Quantification of the expression of brain receptors by
      PET usually requires arterial blood sampling to obtain the plasma input function of the
      tracer. Arterial blood sampling causes discomfort to the patient and therefore can be an
      obstacle especially in longitudinal studies. The aim of this study is therefore to
      investigate whether [18F]FES PET imaging for quantification of estrogen receptors in the
      human brain is feasible without arterial blood sampling, using a reference tissue model
      (SRTM) or an image derived input function (IDIF), so the discomfort associated with arterial
      blood sampling can be avoided.
