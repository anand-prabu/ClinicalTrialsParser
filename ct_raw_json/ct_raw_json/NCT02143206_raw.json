The main\n      outcome of participation will be measured by the number of exercise sessions the patient is\n      able to complete during their pulmonary rehabilitation program. In addition, distance walked\n      in six minutes, dyspnea score, rate of perceived exertion (RPE) score, Pain Scale Index\n      score, and finally, the Dartmouth Quality of Life index (DQL) will be assessed in both\n      groups. It is believed that the new machine will provide better overall outcomes compared to\n      the traditional machine."
