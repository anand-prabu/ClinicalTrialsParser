            "textblock": "Background: Most patients suffering from mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI) present\n      persistent symptoms at one week post injury. A systematic review showed a paucity of studies\n      for short term outcomes following mTBI. Among potential treatments for mTBI, ondansetron has\n      shown promising results based on clinical experience and a single retrospective study.\n      Objectives: The primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility of a\n      randomized controlled trial evaluating the effect of ondansetron to decrease post concussion\n      symptoms at one week following mTBI in children. More specifically, this pilot study will\n      evaluate the proportion of participants who complete assessment at one week following\n      intervention. Method: This will be a randomized, double blinded, controlled trial performed\n      among children aged between 8 and 17 years old who sustained a mTBI in the previous 24\n      hours. Participants visiting the emergency department will be randomized to receive one dose\n      of either ondansetron or placebo. The primary outcome of interest is defined as an increase\n      from pre-concussion baseline of at least 3 symptoms from the Post Concussion Symptom\n      Inventory (PCSI) one week following trauma. Secondary outcomes will include time to full\n      recovery, mean PCSI score, and outcomes at one month following head trauma. The primary\n      analysis will compare the proportion of participants with persistence of symptoms at one\n      week in both groups. The full study sample size was calculated to have 90% power to detect a\n      decrease in the proportion of persistence of symptoms from 50% to 30% with an alpha value of\n      0.05. Approximately 126 patients will therefore be recruited in each arm. The investigators\n      plan to recruit 30 participants (10% of the final population) for the pilot study.  Expected\n      results: This pilot study should confirm the feasibility of the randomized controlled trial\n      by showing that 90% of the recruited participants provide data on the primary outcome at one\n      week following intervention. On the long term, the investigator expect that ondansetron will\n      decrease the proportion of patients sustaining persistent symptoms of concussion from 50% to\n      lower than 30%."
