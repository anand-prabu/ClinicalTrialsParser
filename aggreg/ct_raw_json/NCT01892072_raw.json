Another study observed a sequential elevation of VEGF in\n      low-grade dysplasia, high-grade dysplasia and early stage HCC. Clinical analyses have\n      discovered the high expression of VEGF is correlated with tumor progression, vascular\n      invasion, distal metastasis and poor prognosis. However, few studies have been conducted to\n      investigate the VEGF signaling in HCC cells and its possible mechanism in regulating HCC\n      growth.Therefore,we try to clarify the mechanism of VEGF signal in HCC growth,proliferation\n      and apoptosis."
