NSTEMI will be defined as a progressive crescendo pattern of\n             angina or angina at rest, in the absence of ST-segment elevation on the 12-lead ECG,\n             with elevated cardiac markers. UAP will be defined as new onset angina, progressive\n             crescendo pattern of angina, or angina at rest.\n\n          -  Culprit lesion located in a native coronary artery\n\n          -  TIMI flow grade 3 and diameter stenosis < 70% on angiogram\n\n          -  Definite erosion defined by OCT\n\n          -  Patients able to provide written informed consent\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n        Left ventricular ejection fraction < 30%.\n\n          -  Life expectancy < 1 year.\n\n          -  Contraindication to the contrast media.\n\n          -  Creatinine level > 2.0 mg/dL or end-stage kidney disease.\n\n          -  Serious liver dysfunction.\n\n          -  Patients with hemodynamic or electrical instability (including shock).\n\n          -  Any contraindication against the use of ticagrelor.\n\n          -  Investigator considers the patient is not suitable."
