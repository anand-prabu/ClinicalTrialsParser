            "textblock": "Chronic pain affects 9% of Singapore population resulting in major socioeconomic burden.\n      Chronic postsurgical pain (CPSP) that persists for over 3 months could be related to nerve\n      injury making this a strategic model to study the transition of acute to chronic pain. CPSP\n      occurs in up to 50% after surgery and up to 32% after hysterectomy. Over 600000\n      hysterectomies were performed in the US in 2003 making CPSP a significant problem.\n\n      Investigators will perform this prospective cohort study to determine whether increased\n      central sensitization and negative psychological experience are involved in the transition\n      of acute to chronic pain after hysterectomy. Investigators will recruit 444 women undergoing\n      hysterectomy and employ validated physical pain testing including tonic heat stimulation,\n      mechanical temporal summation and wound hyperalgesia which had been shown to be related to\n      central sensitization. Pain catastrophizing (negative thoughts of pain) and state trait\n      anxiety scoring will be assessed for the impact of negative cognitive-affective experience\n      on CPSP. A phone survey will be performed at 4 months to determine the primary outcome of\n      CPSP. Arterial spin labeling will be used to delineate cerebral blood flow using arterial\n      spin labeling, functional connectivity and structural connectivity to evaluate\n      insula-anterior cingulate cortex differences in 30 women with CPSP compared to 30 women\n      without CPSP.\n\n      In addition to evaluating whether central sensitization, negative psychological experience\n      and activation of brain regions are different in women with CPSP after hysterectomy, the\n      results of this study will elucidate potential mechanisms of CPSP development that will\n      guide in future studies on potential novel therapeutic targets."
