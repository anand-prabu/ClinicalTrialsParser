      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the rate of early and intermediate toxicity related
      to accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) delivered in a more convenient 5 fraction
      schedule using non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB) (AccuBoost System) in
      women with resected, early stage breast cancer.

      Non-invasive image-guided breast brachytherapy (NIBB), using advanced image-guided radiation
      technology, has the potential to eliminate the disadvantages of the conventional APBI
      techniques. NIBB facilitates non-invasive partial breast irradiation without the use of
      catheters or implants. Yet by using breast immobilization and precise image-guidance, it
      reduces non-target breast tissue within the irradiated field compared with other
      non-invasive APBI techniques such as 3D-CRT. This has made NIBB an attractive approach to
      deliver APBI.

      We hypothesize that NIBB delivered in 5 treatments will be a more convenient, safe and
      effective modality to deliver partial breast irradiation.

      Anticipated advantages of NIBB protocol treatment include:

        -  Convenient treatment schedule

        -  Short course can allow for increased patient access to treatment

        -  Non-invasive approach

        -  Increased accuracy with precise targeting of lumpectomy cavity using advanced imaging

        -  Reduced irradiation of non-target breast tissue

        -  Reduced skin toxicity

        -  No heart or lung radiation exposure

        -  Reduced late skin or breast toxicity

        -  High rate of good or excellent cosmetic outcome

        -  High rate of ipsilateral breast tumor control comparable to other APBI techniques

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. A confirmed histological diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma or DCIS;

          2. Age greater or equal to 50 years old;

          3. Life expectancy &gt; 6 months;

          4. Treated by breast conserving surgery

          5. Pathologic lymph node negative, which includes (pN0 i-, i+);

             Patients, who are at very low risk for sentinel node involvement and have elected to
             forgo sentinel node biopsy, are eligible if clinically lymph nodes negative (cN0).
             These patients include:

               -  DCIS

               -  Microinvasion only

               -  Pure tubular or mucinous histology

               -  Patients â‰¥ 70yo with T1c; estrogen receptor +

          6. Pathologic tumor size

               1. less than or equal to 2 cm for invasive disease;

               2. less than or equal to 3 cm for DCIS;

          7. Estrogen receptor positive if invasive disease (DCIS can be ER negative)

          8. Negative surgical margins greater than or equal to 2 mm. A margin of &lt;2mm is
             acceptable if at natural boundary, i.e. skin or pectoralis fascia.

          9. No lymphovascular invasion;

         10. ECOG performance status of 0-2 (Appendix 1);

         11. Informed consent signed.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Known BRCA 1/2 Mutation; (BRCA 1 and 2 testing is not required)

          2. Active lupus or scleraderma;

          3. Pregnancy;

          4. Psychiatric or addictive disorder that would preclude attending follow-up;

          5. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (adjuvant chemotherapy is permitted);

          6. Suspicious remaining microcalcification on post-surgery mammogram (unless biopsy
             proven benign);

          7. pN+ on axillary dissection or in the sentinel lymph node biopsy (N0i+ are considered
             node negative and are not excluded);

          8. Multicentric disease;

          9. Paget's disease of the nipple;

         10. Distant metastases;

         11. Lumpectomy cavity not well visualized on AccuBoost imaging;

         12. Lumpectomy cavity with 1cm margin (CTV/PTV) not adequately encompassed by any
             available applicator.

         13. Breast separation with compression &gt; 8cm at time of simulation.
