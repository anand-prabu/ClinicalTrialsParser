Further, common patterns of differential DNA methylation were found in\n      the common genes from placental tissue at time of birth in the same women after diagnosis\n      with PE, suggesting that the epigenomic patterns that predict pregnancy-induced hypertension\n      may also underlie the development of chronic hypertension years after.\n\n      It is unknown whether aberrant DNA methylation in pregnancy-induced hypertension is the\n      mechanism by which chronic hypertension develops in these women remote from pregnancy nor is\n      it known if hypertension remote from PE is as responsive to therapeutic treatment of\n      hypertension compared to women who develop hypertension without history of PE. The\n      investigators plan to objectively test the central hypothesis and attain the objective of\n      this project"
