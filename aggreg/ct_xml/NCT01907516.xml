      To compare compliance and satisfaction between a traditional method of blood glucose
      reporting using voicemail (control) and a novel method using cell phone /internet
      (Confidant) technology in the management of diabetic pregnant women.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Control of blood glucose levels is beneficial during pregnancy, however, the ability to
      effectively monitor patient's blood glucose levels is challenging and time consuming for
      patients and care providers.  Patients must keep track of their own glucose levels and take
      the initiative to check blood glucose multiple times per day.  Traditionally, patients
      record their glucose levels in a logbook, which they bring with them during an office visit
      or use to report their glucose levels over the phone.  Non compliance and factitious
      reporting are not uncommon. Obstetricians and or diabetes program staff spend hours
      communicating with patients to obtain and record glucose values therefore alternatives to
      phone calls are needed.

      We performed a prospective randomized cross over study comparing a conventional voicemail
      (control) system for home glucose reporting with a cell phone/internet reporting system
      (Confidant). The primary outcome measure was compliance with fingerstick blood glucose
      reporting. Compliance was determined by the number of fingersticks reported / expected (%).
      The secondary outcome was patient satisfaction. Subjects were participants in the Kapiolani
      Medical Center for Women and Children's diabetes in pregnancy program known as &quot;A Sweeter
      Choice&quot;. IRB approval was obtained before starting the study and all subjects received
      informed consent. The study was funded by Hawai'i Medical Service Association, a medical
      insurance company in Hawaii. The Confidant equipment was supplied by Hookele Personal Health
      Planners, LLC. None of the Ho'okele or Hawaii Medical Service Association staff were
      involved in data collection or analysis. Subjects were randomized to Confidant or the
      control system at the entry into the diabetes program during consultation with the Maternal
      Fetal Medicine physician. After randomization, subjects performed the assigned monitoring
      system for 3 weeks. After three weeks, they switched to the other monitoring system. A
      satisfaction survey was completed after three weeks on the second system was completed.
