Subjects must be able to provide informed consent and function at an intellectual\n             level sufficient to allow accurate completion of all assessment instruments.\n\n          3. Subjects scoring moderate to severe (>3) on a minimum of one of the five trauma\n             domains of the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.\n\n          4. Subjects must have experienced, witnessed, or confronted an event(s) that involved\n             actual or threatened death or serious injury, or a threat to the physical integrity\n             of themselves, or others and the person's response involved intense fear,\n             helplessness, and/or horror (Criterion A DSM-IV for PTSD), prior to the age of 18.\n\n          5. Subjects must consent to the two study visits.  Each study visit includes an\n             outpatient admission to the CTRC and an MRI scanning session.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n          1. Subjects with evidence of or a history of head trauma, neurological disorders,\n             seizures, unconsciousness or any other major medical disorder.\n\n          2. Subjects with a history of or current (past 90 days) psychotic disorder,\n             substance-dependence except for nicotine dependence, or bipolar affective disorder.\n\n          3. Subjects with any psychoactive substance abuse within the last 30 days as evidenced\n             by subject report or urine drug screen.\n\n          4. Women who are pregnant or nursing.\n\n          5. Women who are post-menopausal or have had a full hysterectomy.\n\n          6. Subjects who have a BMI greater than 35.\n\n          7. Subjects who are unwilling to maintain abstinence from alcoholand caffeine for the\n             24-hour period prior to the study visits and from illicit drug use for the 72 hour\n             period prior to study visits.\n\n          8. Persons with ferrous metal implants or pacemaker.\n\n          9. Subjects who are claustrophobic.\n\n         10. Subjects taking psychotropic, endocrine or cardiovascular medications (other than\n             blood pressure medications) during the 30-day period prior to the study. Subjects who\n             have been free of psychotropic medications at least (the greater of) of 30 days or 5\n             half-lives prior to the study visits will be included.\n\n         11. Subjects who have been in evidence-based treatment for PTSD within the 6 months prior\n             to the study visits.\n\n         12. Subjects with a postive breathalyzer or urine drug screen. Group - Specific\n             Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria Individuals with PTSD Inclusion Criteria\n\n        1. Subjects must meet DSM-IV criteria for current (i.e. last 6 months) PTSD. 2. Subjects\n        must have a CAPS total score of \u226550. 3. Subjects may also meet criteria for a mood\n        disorder (except bipolar affective disorder, see Exclusion Criteria) or other anxiety\n        disorders (panic disorder, agoraphobia, social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, or\n        obsessive compulsive disorder).  The inclusion of subjects with affective and other\n        anxiety disorders is essential because of the marked frequency of the co-existence of mood\n        and other anxiety disorders among patients with PTSD (Brady, Killeen, Brewerton, &\n        Lucerini, 2000; Kessler, Chiu, Demler, Merikangas, & Walters, 2005).\n\n        Exclusion Criteria\n\n        1. As above. Resilient Controls Inclusion Criteria\n\n        1. As above. Exclusion Criteria\n\n        1. Subjects meeting criteria for current or past (i.e. last 90 days) Axis I mood or\n        anxiety disorders (including PTSD and depression)."
