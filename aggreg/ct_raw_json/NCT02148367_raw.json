            "textblock": "-  Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is the leading cause of death and disability in people\n           under age 45 in industrialized countries. Significant numbers of US veterans from the\n           wars in Iraq and Afghanistan return with TBI. However, to date, there are no specific\n           neuroprotective treatment options with proven clinical efficacy.\n\n        -  Erythropoietin (EPO) is approved by the FDA to treat anemia and has comprehensive\n           preclinical data supporting its neuroprotective and neuroregenerative efficacy\n           following traumatic (TBI) and a wide range of other acquired brain insults. Injury to\n           small and medium-sized cerebral blood vessels is a well recognized consequence of TBI.\n           EPO increases production of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and promotes\n           angiogenesis and neovascularization after TBI. EPO also promotes neurogenesis and\n           improves functional recovery in animals after experimental stroke and TBI.\n           Neovascularization is coupled with neurogenesis, and augmentation of both processes by\n           EPO may result in lessened cognitive deficits. Neovascularization by EPO may prevent\n           post-traumatic deficits in cerebrovascular reactivity (CVR), which can be measured\n           noninvasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).\n\n        -  This proposal is for a randomized, placebo-controlled pilot clinical trial designed to\n           obtain data on the effects of EPO in humans with persistent post-concussive symptoms\n           after TBI. The primary objective is to evaluate effect of 4 week administration of\n           recombinant erythropoietin on numbers of circulating endothelial progenitor cells in\n           patients with persistent symptoms during the subacute period after TBI. This\n           information will guide the design of a future definitive study."
