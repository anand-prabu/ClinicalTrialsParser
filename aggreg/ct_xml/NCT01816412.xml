  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To demonstrate the safety and efficacy of  MD02-LDCB for treatment of stenosis or occlusion
      of the femoral and popliteal arteries in the Japanese population.

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll patients presenting with claudication or ischemic rest pain and an
      angiographically significant lesion in the superficial femoral or popliteal artery and a
      patent outflow artery to the foot.  After successful protocol-defined pre-dilatation,
      subjects that are determined not to require stenting based on defined angiographic criteria
      are randomized 2:1 to treatment with either MD02-LDCB (test arm) or standard PTA catheter
      (control arm) using similar techniques. Subjects that do not meet post-predilatation lesion
      criteria are excluded (and treated per standard practice) and followed for safety for 30
      days. Randomized subjects will have ultrasound follow-up through 2 years and are consented
      for up to 2 years clinical follow-up.
