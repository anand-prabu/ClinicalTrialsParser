            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to evaluate the potential effects of a cognitive training\n      program when combined with a particular form of psychotherapy (behavioral activation\n      therapy) for depression. Behavioral activation therapy targets changes in behavior as a\n      method for improving a depressed individual's thoughts, feelings, and overall quality of\n      life. This study is designed to test whether a computerized brain exercise called cognitive\n      control training can enhance the effects of a 5-session behavioral activation therapy\n      program. CCT has been shown to reduce depressive symptoms in two other studies, but it has\n      not yet been combined with behavioral activation therapy. The investigators hypothesize that\n      individuals assigned to the behavioral activation plus cognitive control training condition\n      will demonstrate reduced depressive symptoms from pre to post treatment compared with those\n      assigned to the behavioral activation plus computerized control condition.  The\n      investigators hypothesize that these gains will be maintained at one-month follow up."
