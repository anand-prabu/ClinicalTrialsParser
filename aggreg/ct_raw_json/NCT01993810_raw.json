Specialized radiation therapy that delivers a\n      high dose of radiation directly to the tumor, such as photon or proton beam radiation\n      therapy, may kill more tumor cells and cause less damage to normal tissue. Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, such as paclitaxel, carboplatin, etoposide, and cisplatin, work in different\n      ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from\n      dividing. It is not yet known whether proton chemoradiotherapy is more effective than photon\n      chemoradiotherapy in treating non-small cell lung cancer."

To compare the overall survival (OS) in patients with stage II-IIIB non-small cell lung\n      cancer (NSCLC) after image guided, motion-managed photon radiotherapy (Arm 1) or after image\n      guided, motion-managed proton radiotherapy (Arm 2) both given with concurrent platinum-\n      based chemotherapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To compare 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) between the 2 arms. II. To compare the\n      development of grade 3 or higher adverse events definitely, probably, or possibly related to\n      treatment.\n\n      III. To compare differences between the two arms in quality of life (QOL) based primarily on\n      the development of shortness of breath at 6 months and secondarily on the development of\n      sore throat at the end of chemoradiotherapy (chemoRT) (as measured by the lung cancer module\n      of the MD Anderson Symptom Inventory [MDASI-Lung]), as well as breathing related functioning\n      impairments as measured by the Shortness Breath Questionnaire [SOBQ].\n\n      IV. To compare cost-effectiveness outcomes between the 2 arms. V. To compare pulmonary\n      function changes by treatment arms and response. VI. To explore the most appropriate and\n      clinically relevant technological parameters to ensure quality and effectiveness throughout\n      radiation therapy processes, including imaging, simulation, patient immobilization, target\n      and critical structure definition, treatment planning, image guidance and delivery.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I: Patients undergo photon beam radiation therapy 5 days per week for a total of 35\n      fractions and receive either paclitaxel* intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and carboplatin* IV\n      weekly during radiation therapy or etoposide IV on days 1-5 and 29-33 and cisplatin IV on\n      days 1, 8, 29, and 36.\n\n      ARM II: Patients undergo proton beam radiation therapy 5 days per week for a total of 35\n      fractions and receive either paclitaxel* and carboplatin* or etoposide and cisplatin as in\n      Arm I.\n\n      *In both arms, patients who receive paclitaxel and carboplatin must complete consolidation\n      therapy.\n\n      CONSOLIDATION THERAPY: Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and carboplatin IV on day\n      1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or\n      unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 4-8 weeks, every 3 months\n      for 1 year, every 6 months for 1 year, and then annually thereafter."
