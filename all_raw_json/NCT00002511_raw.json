Local relapse is treated with conventional pelvic\n           radiotherapy.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months during the first postoperative year, every 6 months\n      until the fifth year, and annually thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 1000 patients will be accrued for this study within 7.5 years."
