Combining more than one drug may kill more tumor cells. It is\n      not yet known which regimen of combination chemotherapy is more effective for advanced\n      colorectal cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil combined\n      with leucovorin and either irinotecan or oxaliplatin in treating patients who have\n      unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer."

Patients are randomized to one\n      of five treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I (standard therapy): Patients receive first-line chemotherapy comprising\n           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously\n           over 46 hours on days 1-2 every 14 days. Patients with progressive disease then receive\n           second-line therapy comprising irinotecan IV over 90 minutes on day 1 every 21 days.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive first-line chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients with progressive\n           disease then receive second-line therapy comprising irinotecan IV over 30 minutes and\n           leucovorin calcium IV over 2 hours on day 1 and fluorouracil IV continuously over 46\n           hours on days 1-2 every 14 days.\n\n        -  Arm III: Patients receive first-line chemotherapy comprising irinotecan, leucovorin\n           calcium, and fluorouracil as in second-line therapy of arm II.\n\n        -  Arm IV: Patients receive first-line chemotherapy as in arm I. Patients with progressive\n           disease then receive second-line therapy comprising leucovorin calcium IV and\n           oxaliplatin IV over 2 hours on day 1 followed by fluorouracil IV continuously over 46\n           hours on days 1-2 every 14 days.\n\n        -  Arm V: Patients receive first-line chemotherapy comprising leucovorin calcium,\n           oxaliplatin, and fluorouracil as in second-line therapy of arm IV.\n\n      Treatment continues in all arms in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      Quality of life is assessed at baseline, at weeks 6 and 12, and then every 12 weeks\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 2,100 patients (700 in arm I and 350 each in arms II-V) will\n      be accrued for this study."
