  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and
      treatment effect of BBI-4000 when topically applied to subjects with axillary hyperhidrosis.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, vehicle controlled, double blind study in subjects with axillary
      hyperhidrosis designed to assess the safety, tolerability and the effect on sweat production
      of topically applied BBI-4000 for 14 days.

      Safety will be assessed though vital signs, physical exam, adverse events, local skin
      reactions and laboratory tests (blood chemistry and hematology).

      Efficacy will be assessed though the gravimetrically measured sweat production and the
      Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS).

      Pharmacokinetic information will also be collected.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Male or Female subjects from 18 to 45 years of age in good general health.

          -  Primary axillary hyperhidrosis of at least 6 months duration.

          -  Hyperhidrosis Disease Severity Score (HDSS) of 3 or 4 at baseline.

          -  Gravimetric test at baseline indicating at least 100mg of axillary sweat production
             in a 5 min period.

          -  Use of a medically appropriate contraceptive method.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Prior axillary use of botulinum toxin within 2 years of study entry.

             entry.

          -  Prior surgical procedures for hyperhidrosis or surgical procedures in the axillary
             areas for any reason.

          -  Use of anticholinergic treatment, beta-blocker, alpha-adrenergic or other
             prescription treatment for hyperhidrosis.

          -  History of diabetes mellitus, thyroid disease, malignancy, glaucoma, intestinal
             obstructive or motility disease, obstructive uropathy, myasthenia gravis, prostate
             hypertrophy, neurological conditions or cardiac abnormalities.

          -  Known condition that may cause hyperhidrosis.

          -  Use of an investigational drug within 30 days prior to entry into this study.
