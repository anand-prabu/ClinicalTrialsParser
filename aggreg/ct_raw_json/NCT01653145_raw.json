The following three\n      diets, which vary in dietary fat and energy density (kcal/g), will be used to induce the\n      positive energy balance in a within subjects or cross over design: 1) high fat/high energy\n      density, 2) high fat/low energy density, and 3) high carbohydrate/low energy density. Food\n      intake and activity will be measured for 4 days after each diet to quantify the response to\n      positive energy balance and manipulation of dietary fat and energy density."
