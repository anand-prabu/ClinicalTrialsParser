  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is using a new technology known as high resolution manometry which is used to
      evaluate patients that have trouble swallowing or have chest pain that is not related to the
      heart.  The investigator wants to learn how the different positions of the body, in a lying
      position, semi-recumbent, sitting position or standing up, and the amount of liquid affects
      the outcome of the test.  This will help the investigator to determine a standardized
      protocol for patients with trouble swallowing.

    <textblock>
      The esophageal manometry will be performed in the motility lab at the Shands Endoscopy
      Center by passing a small tube into the patients nose, down the food pipe and into the
      stomach. The participants will be instructed to swallow a determined volume of
      Gatorade,depending on the protocol being followed. All participants will be starting in the
      supine position followed by semi-recumbent,sitting, then standing up. When the esophageal
      manometry is finished, the tube is removed and participation in this study is complete.
