Ethiology of AAA is known to be common with atherosclerotic arterial diseases\n      (coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and carotid artery disease), so the\n      hypothesis is that AAA should be more common among these CAD patients, thus making screening\n      of these patients (for AAA) more cost-efficient.\n\n      Study will be carried out as a multi-center prospective screening study. Data will be\n      collected in North Karelia Central Hospital, Kuopio University Hospital and Tampere\n      University Hospital. Data consists of 200 consecutive coronary angiography patients in each\n      hospital, resulting in 600 patients in total. All male patients with diagnosed CAD will be\n      recruited for the study and screened for AAA with ultrasound. Nevertheless, patients with\n      previously known AAA will be excluded from the study."
