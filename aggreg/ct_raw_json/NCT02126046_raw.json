To expand donor pool\uff0cwe developed a haplo-identical HSCT (Hi-HSCT)\n      platform. But in prior Hi-HSCT using high dose post-transplant Cyclophosphamide in patients\n      with leukemia, cytopenia post-transplant often developed, which was considered as a symptom\n      of GVHD. Therefore, the investigators add unrelated umbilical cord blood (UCB) to the\n      Hi-HSCT. It has reported that, as third-party cells, UCB will reduce GVHD.The purpose of\n      this study is to determine whether unrelated UCB following Hi-HSCT can improve outcomes of\n      Hi-HSCT in patients with \u03b2-thalassemia major."
