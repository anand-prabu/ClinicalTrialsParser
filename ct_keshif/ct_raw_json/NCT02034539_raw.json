After successful revascularization everything should be done to improve wound\n      healing because this regularly takes weeks up to several months. One possibility to speed up\n      healing could be treatment with the VADOplex device which delivers an automatic intermittent\n      painless compression of the sole of the foot thereby increasing perfusion of the leg. This\n      system can be easily operated by patients themselves and at home.\n\n      Our goal is to prove that the VADOPlex system accelerates healing up and improves quality of\n      life."
