In\n      severe cases, nerve regeneration and functional recovery are incomplete even with surgery.\n      The goal of this pilot project is to test a potentially promising medication,\n      acetyl-l-carnitine (ALCAR). We will use a randomized, double blinded, placebo controlled\n      study design. Along with surgery, those in the treatment group will also receive ALCAR while\n      the other half in the control group will be given placebo. To gauge the effects of ALCAR, we\n      will compare motor and sensory nerve growth as well as functional outcomes. The data from\n      this study will provide crucial information when designing a full scale clinical trial. If\n      successful, this will represent an important first step in finding a novel treatment to\n      improve functional outcomes in patients with severe CTS."
