Treatment continues in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with stable disease or partial or\n      complete response (CR) may receive additional courses every 35 days for up to 12 total doses\n      or 2 courses past a CR.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of VNP20009 until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 6\n      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. An additional 6-9 patients are treated at the\n      MTD.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-45 patients will be accrued for this study."
