This period will be\n      followed by a 4 months follow-up period in which treatment with TNFalpha blocker will\n      continue.\n\n      All patients will have an MRI and TRUS examinations to assess the fistulas and also blood\n      tests for CBC, chemistry, inflammatory markers and cytokine analysis. Same evaluation will\n      be repeated at the end of the study."
