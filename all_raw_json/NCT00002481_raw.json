Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage cancer\n      cells. Bone marrow transplantation may allow doctors to give higher doses of radiation\n      therapy and chemotherapy and kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of high-dose etoposide and\n      cyclophosphamide plus total-body irradiation followed by bone marrow transplantation in\n      treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Determine the toxicity and activity of cyclophosphamide, etoposide, total\n      body irradiation, and autologous bone marrow transplantation in patients with relapsed or\n      refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. II. Determine the feasibility of pretransplantation\n      cytoreduction with a regimen of high-dose cytarabine, cisplatin, and dexamethasone in this\n      patient population. III. Determine the feasibility of posttransplantation radiotherapy given\n      to sites of residual disease (involved-field \"boost\" irradiation) in this patient\n      population.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified by disease status (refractory vs relapsed). Autologous bone\n      marrow is harvested before cytoreduction or involved field radiotherapy (IFRT). Patients\n      with marrow involvement who achieve marrow complete response after cytoreduction undergo\n      harvest of bone marrow before IFRT. Patients receive cytoreduction comprising high-dose\n      cytarabine IV over 1 hour every 12 hours, cisplatin IV over 10 hours, and dexamethasone\n      three times daily on days 1 and 2. At 3 weeks, a second course is administered if tumor\n      reduction is at least 25% and in the absence of unacceptable toxicity. Patients with\n      involved sites 2 cm or greater in diameter at evaluation and previously unirradiated active\n      disease sites, at least 90% of which can be treated with IFRT, undergo IFRT 5 days a week\n      for 2 weeks beginning after cytoreduction and 3-5 weeks after harvest of bone marrow. Within\n      10 days after completion of IFRT, patients receive etoposide IV over 26 hours beginning on\n      day -7, cyclophosphamide IV over 2 hours on days -6 to -4, and total body irradiation twice\n      daily on days -3 and -2 and once on day -1. Bone marrow is reinfused on day 0. Eligible\n      patients with residual disease at 3 months after transplantation undergo involved field\n      \"boost\" irradiation to sites of residual disease.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 50 patients (25 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
