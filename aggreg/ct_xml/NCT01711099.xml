    <criteria>

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient with a signed Informed Consent Form.

          -  Patient's current and past medical condition and status be assessed using previous
             medical history, complete physical examination and the physicians (principle
             investigator's) medical opinion.

          -  Patient is diagnosed with chronic angina pectoris for at least 6 weeks.  Diagnosis is
             based on medical history, complete physical examination, and core labs.

          -  Patients who no longer receive benefit from additional revascularization procedures
             (i.e. CABG or Angioplasty).  Certification will be made by Heart Team.

          -  Patient demonstrates Exercise Tolerance Time (ETT) duration &lt; 10 minutes on Modified
             Bruce protocol.

          -  Patient had at least one documented myocardial segment with reversible ischemia.

          -  Patient is under optimum medical therapy for angina for at least 6 weeks. The optimal
             treatment plan is tailored to a person's age, the presence of other medical
             conditions, lifestyle, medication side effects, etc.  Medical therapies for stable
             angina include ACE-inhibitors, Nitrates, Beta Blockers and Calcium Channel Blockers,
             trimetazidine, ivabradin. Combination of any of 3 above mentioned drugs will be
             considered as optimum medical therapy.

          -  Patient has an echocardiographic acoustic window to the target area in the myocardium
             utilizing one of the following views: apical 2 chamber view (2CH), apical 4 chamber
             view (4CH), modified parasternal long axis view (LAX) and parasternal short axis view
             (SAX).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patient who will substantially benefit from additional revascularization procedures
             such as additional CABG or angioplasty therapies. This determination will be made and
             certified by the Heart Team.

          -  Patient has active endocarditis, myocarditis or pericarditis.

          -  Patient with moderately severe or severe valvular disease.

          -  Patient with known intraventricular thrombus.

          -  Patients who have active or non-active implantables, such as pacemakers,
             defibrillators, abandoned leads, or electrodes.

          -  Patient for who shock waves applied over any implanted device that releases
             substances or medications to the periphery (such as insulin pumps).

          -  Patient is pregnant.

          -  Patient with severe chronic lung disease (emphysema, pulmonary fibrosis) with
             difficult access to ultrasonic acoustic window.

          -  Patients for who shock waves applied over the area of healing fracture.

          -  Patients for who shock waves applied over the area of bone growth.

          -  Patients for who shock waves applied to the area of malignancy.

          -  Prior invasive malignancy, except non-melanomatous skin cancer or other malignancies
             with a documented disease-free survival for a minimum of 5 years.

          -  By the physician decision there is underlying concomitant disease or circumstance
             what may negatively influence the management of the patient.
