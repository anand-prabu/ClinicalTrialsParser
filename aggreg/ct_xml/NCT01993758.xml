  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine whether the lower tourniquet pressure, which is set by adding
      120mmHg (millimeter of mercury) on the systolic blood pressure just before tourniquet
      inflation, are efficient and safe during total knee arthroplasty, compared with the
      conventional tourniquet pressure: 150mmHg above the systolic blood pressure before
      tourniquet inflation.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will compare the two groups of patients undergoing total knee arthroplasty, which the
      tourniquet pressure will be set differently: systolic blood pressure plus 120mmHg vs.
      systolic blood pressure plus 150mmHg, the conventional method, in terms of efficacy and
      safety.
