Secondly the investigators want to evaluate the effect of this\n      surgical method on non-affected anterior vaginal compartment as well as patients' outcome.\n\n      This prospective multicenter national study include patients (n=111) with symptomatic\n      posterior vaginal wall with or without apical prolapse with stage II or more. Patients were\n      recruited at four university hospitals and five central hospitals in Finland between\n      September 2010 and August 2013. The study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committees in\n      participating hospitals and all attending patients gave written consent after oral and\n      written counseling. Baseline evaluation include standardized gynecological examination in\n      supine position using the POP-Q system. Detailed information on patients' characteristics\n      and medical history is gathered, focusing on especially gynecological issues. Patients fill\n      in Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory (PFDI-20) and Pelvic organ prolapse/urinary Incontinence\n      Sexual Questionnaire (PISQ-12).\n\n      The operations are performed by qualified surgeons (n=9) familiar with transvaginal mesh\n      surgery. Intraoperative data is collected and immediate postoperative problems are\n      registered.\n\n      The first follow-up visit take place at three months postoperatively. Gynecological\n      examination with POP-Q measurements are performed and complications documented. As\n      preoperatively, PFDI-20 and PISQ-12 questionnaires are filled in by the patients.\n\n      The second visit take place at one year postoperatively. Gynecological examination with\n      POP-Q measurements are performed and possible late complications documented. PFDI-20 and\n      PISQ-12 questionnaires are filled in again by the patients."
