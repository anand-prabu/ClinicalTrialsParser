Excessive body weight can have a profound influence on lower extremities,\n      including pain, degenerative disease, and compromised quality of life.  However, no study\n      to-date has examined the effects of weight change on foot structure and function in\n      individuals over time.  The purpose of this study is to determine the effects of weight\n      reduction on foot structure and function in obese adults.  Improved understanding of the\n      relationship between body weight and foot biomechanics is needed to promote health and\n      healthier lifestyles."
