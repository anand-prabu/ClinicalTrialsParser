  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Randomized trial tests effectiveness of self-administered drug intake by empowered TB
      patients - supervised by a trained family member and supported by medical counseling and
      reminders - to improve treatment adherence and treatment success rates, and thereby
      forestall TB and MDR-TB epidemics.

      The innovative treatment approach integrates several educational, technological, and social
      evidence-based components. The aim of this study is to pilot the innovative approach for
      drug-sensitive TB patients during the outpatient phase of tuberculosis treatment. To test
      the effectiveness of the innovative approach (intervention) a randomized controlled trial
      with two arms will be conducted. The intervention arm will include drug-sensitive
      tuberculosis patients that are treated according to the innovative approach, which includes
      self-administered drug intake supervised by a family member, TB patient and family member
      training (including distribution of a leaflet about TB) and psychological counseling,
      reminder text messages to TB patients, and reminder phone call to TB patient family members.
      The control arm will include drug-sensitive tuberculosis patients that receive the regular
      Directly Observed Therapy recommended by the World Health Organization.
