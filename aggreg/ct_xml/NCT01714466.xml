                  colon neoplasia,or

               2. is aged 55 to 70.

          -  Part A: Subjects need to be without any history of clinically significant
             gastrointestinal symptoms by clinical judgement and without the presence of acute
             abdominal discomfort or symptoms.

             screening or check-in evaluation.

          -  Positive serology for chronic viral hepatitis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
             at screening.

          -  History of drug or alcohol abuse within the 12 months prior to dosing or evidence of
             such abuse as indicated by the laboratory assays conducted during the screening or
             check-in evaluations.

          -  Subjects who are unwilling to comply with the provisions of the study protocol.

          -  Concurrent participation in an investigational drug study or participation within 3
             months of study entry.

          -  Subject has a condition or is in a situation, which in the Investigator's opinion may
             put the subject at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere
