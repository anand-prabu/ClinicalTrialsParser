  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to to see if changes in visual reading function correlate with
      changes in optical and retinal image quality. We hypothesize that changes and deterioration
      in tear film quality and dynamics may have a negative effect on reading function.

      People with or without dry eye syndrome may enroll.

    <description>Measures tear film stability, and visual function will be taken before and after a sustained silent reading task. The reading task will take place over 30 minutes, and a comprehension assessment will be given after reading. After completion of the reading task, measures of corneal sensation and structural imaging will be performed. The results from each of 3 cohorts will be compared to ascertain the differences between those populations with and without dry eye.</description>

        We plan to recruit 30 subjects from 3 populations (dry eye, Sjogren's, and healthy
        controls). Subjects will be recruited regardless of gender, race, or ethnicity; and
        enrollment will based on specific criteria as described below.

    </study_pop>
    <sampling_method>Non-Probability Sample</sampling_method>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        General inclusion criteria for all subjects will include:

          -  Ages 50 to 89 years

          -  Capacity to give informed consent.

          -  Self-reported literacy (i.e. a &quot;Yes&quot; answer to the question &quot;Have you learned how to
             read?&quot;)

        Additional inclusion criteria for the dry eye group will include both of the below:

          -  A previous diagnosis of dry eye syndrome by an eyecare specialist

          -  Ocular Surface Disease Index total scoring of 13 or above

        Additional inclusion criteria for the Sjögren's syndrome group will include:

        - A previous diagnosis of Sjögren's syndrome by an immunology specialist, per ACR criteria
        22

        Additional inclusion criteria for normal control subjects will include:

          -  No previous history of dry eye diagnosis

          -  Ocular Surface Disease Index total scoring of 12 or under

          -  Total corneal and conjunctival staining score of 0

        Exclusion criteria will include:

          -  A binocular vision below 20/25 (with habitual correction)

          -  Any ocular surgery within the last 3 months.

          -  Mental issues, illiteracy, or language problems which might possibly interfere with
             reading ability

          -  History of taking or current use of topical prescription anti-inflammatory eyedrops
             (including, cyclosporine and steroids as well as any glaucoma eyedrops). Subjects who
             are willing to discontinue their treatment for at least a period of 30 days can be
             placed on a &quot;wash out period&quot; as per the discretion of the investigator and subject
             safety, and be eligible at the end of this period, given all other criteria have been
             met. Otherwise, subjects on these medications will be excluded.
