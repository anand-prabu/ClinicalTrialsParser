            "textblock": "Investigators have recently completed a pilot study exploring the safety and efficacy of\n      using a virtual-reality based cue platform to elicit craving in smokers with\n      schizophrenia(SWS)(Wehring et al, unpublished). In this study, participants with\n      schizophrenia (n=16) showed increased attention to cigarettes and changes in craving\n      measures when participating in the VR craving platform. In addition, participants tolerated\n      the VR environment without undue adverse effects or exacerbation of symptoms. Adverse\n      effects from the VR environment did not differ from that in a non-mentally ill population,\n      and included headache, nausea, and dizziness as most commonly occurring factors. Persons in\n      this pilot also showed acceptable rates of Immersion and Presence in the VR environment,\n      showing the potential use of this form of environment for this and other purposes.\n\n      In this study, investigators will examine virtual reality cue-reactivity in smokers with\n      schizophrenia, with a focus on the relationship of cue-reactivity with self-identified\n      triggers/cues. Smokers with schizophrenia often identify specific cues that trigger craving.\n      Many of these are environmental (scent, sight of smoking paraphernalia or cigarettes,\n      related objects, or social situations), however, a significant amount of smokers describe\n      emotionally-based factors (sadness, being upset, etc.) as primary cues and triggers. Most\n      methods used to elicit craving in experimental studies are executed via using environmental\n      cues like sight of cigarettes or smoking paraphernalia. It is not known if smokers with\n      schizophrenia(SWS) who are strongly emotionally triggered will be responsive to\n      environmental triggers in a cue-elicited craving platform. This is an important research\n      question, as the testing of anti-craving interventions should be generalizable for use\n      across SWS with differing triggers to smoking. The VR-based environmental program from our\n      pilot study, which includes sight, scent, and social cues, will be used to test\n      pre-identified environmental cues/triggers and their effects on cue-elicited craving in 30\n      SWS. Subjective reports, mood and emotion measures, and objective physiological measurements\n      will be used to identify and quantify environmental craving responsivity as well as tonic\n      craving.\n\n      Given the high prevalence of smoking among individuals with schizophrenia, understanding\n      some of the environmental factors that serve to maintain nicotine dependence is a critical\n      step in improving smoking cessation treatment outcomes. Establishing and validating a model\n      of cue-elicited responsivity will allow future investigations of craving, and ultimately\n      designs for studying the efficacy of anti-craving medications in people with schizophrenia."
