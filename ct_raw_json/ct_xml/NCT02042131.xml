  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the proposed study is to identify the most effective brief interventions for
      reducing short-term risk for suicide attempts in &quot;real world&quot; military triage settings, and
      to identify potential mechanisms of change underlying the interventions' impact on
      subsequent suicide attempts. We will randomize 360 patients to one of three commonly-used
      crisis interventions delivered as routine care in the mental health triage system: (1)
      Treatment As Usual (TAU); (2) Crisis Response Plan (CRP); or (3) Enhanced Crisis Response
      Plan with Reasons For Living (E-CRP). The following hypotheses will be tested:

        1. The enhanced crisis response plan (E-CRP) intervention will contribute to significantly
           decreased risk for suicide attempts and hospitalization during follow-up relative to
           the crisis response plan alone (CRP) and treatment as usual (TAU).

        2. The E-CRP intervention will contribute to greater ambivalence about suicide and faster
           recall of reasons for living relative to the CRP and TAU interventions.

        3. Greater ambivalence about suicide and faster recall of reasons for living will mediate
           the relationship between intervention and reduced risk for suicide attempt during
           follow-up.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reasons For Living Task (RFL)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The RFL task is a timed procedure in which the participant is asked to verbally list as many reasons for living as they can. Response latency is the primary variable of interest in this task, and is measured as the length of time it takes from initiation of the task (i.e., reading the instructions) to the verbalization of the first reason for living. Response latency will be measured and coded by independent raters who view the recorded interventions.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Suicidal ambivalence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>Ambivalence about suicide will be measured using Item 1 (Wish to Live) and Item 2 (Wish to Die) of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation-Current (SSI-C, described above). The value of Item 1 will first be reverse-scored so that a high score (2) indicates a strong wish to live. The value of Item 2 will remain unadjusted since a high score (2) indicate a strong wish to die. Next, the reverse-scored Item 1 will be subtracted from the unadjusted value of Item 2 to calculate an ambivalence score ranging from -2 (strong wish to live) to +2 (strong wish to die), with scores in the middle of this range indicating the simultaneous presence of both the desire to live and to die (ambivalence). This method of calculating suicidal ambivalence has been found to significantly predict future death by suicide.</description>
