  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General medical hospitals provide care for a disproportionate share of patients who abuse or
      are dependent upon substances. This group is among the most costly to treat and has the
      poorest medical and substance use outcomes. Motivational interviewing(MI) is a
      well-recognized, evidenced-based substance abuse treatment that has been adapted for use as
      a brief intervention in health care settings.MI is applicable to many health-related
      behavioral problems, and can be taught to a broad range of health care clinicians. However,
      it is unclear which implementation strategies will lead to the efficient and proficient
      uptake of MI in general medical settings, such as medical inpatient units.

      Primary care clinicians have multiple practice demands and time constraints. New practices
      have the greatest chance of being implemented if they are simple and compatible with
      existing workflows and systems. Two widely used strategies to bring specialized practices
      into use within general hospital settings are the &quot;see one, do one&quot; apprenticeship model of
      training and use of consultation-liaison (CL) services. &quot;See one, do one&quot; has been a modus
      operandi in medical education for centuries and relies upon a competency-based supervision
      training approach. While it has been empirically validated in the specialty addiction field,
      less controlled testing of this implementation strategy is available in general medical
      settings. The apprenticeship approach requires that appropriate patients and trainers are
      available with high flexibility for teaching and supervision; when applied to behavioral
      counseling approaches, this may be seen as incompatible with the medical role and time
      constraints of clinicians. In contrast, ordering MI through CL is a relatively simple,
      minimally burdensome process and highly compatible with the way clinicians secure other
      specialist services for their patients in the hospital.

      We propose to conduct a randomized controlled trial using mixed quantitative and qualitative
      methods to examine the effectiveness of three different strategies for integrating MI into
      the practice of physician assistants (PAs) working within Yale New Haven Hospital's internal
      medicine hospitalist service. Specifically, we will randomize 30 PAs to one of three
      conditions: (1) a continuing medical education workshop that provides background and &quot;shows&quot;
      PAs how to conduct MI (the control condition, called SEE ONE); (2) a &quot;see one, do one&quot;
      apprenticeship model involving workshop training plus live supervision of bedside practice
      (DO ONE); and (3) ordering MI from CL after learning about it in a workshop (ORDER ONE).
      Following the respective MI trainings, each PA will be assessed for the provision of MI to
      40 study-eligible inpatients, recruited by the research team after admission to our general
      medical units.

        For Physician Assistants

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Assignment to one of the general medical inpatient units at YNHH during day-time
             shifts; intensive care units will be excluded given the morbidity of patients in this
             setting.

          -  Volunteer to serve as study clinicians, attend a workshop about MI, and possibly
             receive live supervision.

          -  Agree to all procedures of this trial (randomization to training condition and of
             assigned patients, audio recording MI sessions, and completing assessments).

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have been formally supervised to use MI with patients on the units.

          -  Only work at night or weekends since other research staff will not be available.

          -  Intend to give notice to YNHH that they plan to leave the hospital or are scheduled
             for medical or family leave such that they will not be able to interview 40 patients
             during the study period.

        For Patients

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Are 18 years of age or older.

          -  Acknowledge use of a substance within past 28 days and meets screening criteria
             consistent with substance (illicit drugs, licit drugs that are used in a
             non-medically indicated fashion, alcohol, or nicotine) use disorder.

          -  Have an expected length of stay of 3 days since this will provide sufficient time for
             the PA or nurse from the psychiatric consult service to conduct a MI interview.

          -  Are willing to consent to audio recording of interview with the PA or CL
             psychiatrist.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Have an altered mental status such as delirium, encephalopathy, dementia or mental
             retardation or a score on the Mini Mental Status Exam that is &lt; 21 since this would
             impair provision of consent and ability to participate

          -  Inability to speak English. Most of the PAs are mono-lingual English speakers, and
             all MI integrity raters only speak English. We therefore do not have the capacity to
             include Spanish-only speaking patients in the study.

          -  Previous participation in the protocol.
