            "textblock": "The purpose of this study is to investigate the usefulness of infusing purified CD34+ cells\n      of donor origin in order to augment graft function in response to declining chimerism after\n      initially performing an allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) for children\n      with primary immunodeficiency diseases. This protocol will be utilized for patients with\n      waning mixed donor chimerism that is inadequate for correction of clinical condition or\n      disease for which stem cell transplant was performed, or for augmentation of immune\n      function.  An infusion of selected CD34+ stem cells will be given without any preparative\n      regimen.  As the children eligible for this protocol have reduced immune function and\n      pre-existing donor chimerism, we hypothesize that stem cells will be able to engraft and the\n      infusion will augment graft function.  This therapy serves as an alternative to a second\n      stem cell transplant that is known to be associated with significant morbidity and\n      mortality.  CD34+ stem cells will be collected from the donor used for initial stem cell\n      transplant.  Cells will be T-cell depleted (TCD) by performing a CD34 selection using the\n      CliniMACS device (Miltenyi Biotec)  in order to prevent development of new or exacerbation\n      of existing graft versus host disease (GVHD), as avoidance of GVHD in nonmalignant diseases\n      is desirable.  There is sufficient data showing that mixed donor chimerism is adequate for\n      reverting disease phenotype in certain primary immunodeficiencies.  Observations from Europe\n      and CCHMC show that donor chimerism might be boosted by CD34+ stem cell infusion alone\n      without any specific preparative regimen.  This therapy is likely to be associated with low\n      toxicity due to the absence of a preparative regimen and lack of exposure to fresh donor\n      cells capable of initiating GVHD, and offers potential significant benefit."
