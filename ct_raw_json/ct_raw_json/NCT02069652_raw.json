For age stratification of patients, the youth (from 15 to 24 years old) comprised of\n      18.5% (4078). Among them, 40% are students. MSM are still the main population (over 80%)\n      from 2009 to 2011. Therefore it is crucial to target the young MSM."

            "textblock": "Purpose: Under the hospital based, and in conjuction with the community, we try to target\n      the young HIV MSM victims and develop the partnership networking to seek for the potential\n      high risk couples to enroll into our intervention.\n\n      Materials & Methods: At hospital, though HIV clinic has case manager, however the limitation\n      of space and privacy, we just focus on the HIV patient itself and have limited time to\n      educate patients' sex partners. Therefore, we aimed at enrolling more of the intimate\n      partners thru young HIV MSM victims thru hospital base. We will provide the saliva OraQuick\n      rapid test service to the partners, thus set up the relationship with the study subjects,\n      and then communicate with them and educate them with knowledge of sexual transmitted\n      diseases and sex health. We plan to enroll 200 study subjects till the end of this year. Our\n      co-PI, Prof. Y.M. Chen will also perform HIV gene clustering analysis thru high throughput\n      ultra-deep pyrosequencing among young MSM HIV victims. The other co-PI Prof. P.I. Chou will\n      train the research assistant adopting MSM HIV victim partner follow-up model to approach the\n      study subjects with structured questionnaires. Prof. Chou also collected the study subjects\n      in the northern Taiwan with her own project, thus we can compare and analyze the difference\n      from the locality (North area v.s. South area).\n\n      Anticipated work: We aim at enrolling 300 young HIV MSM partners to this OraQuick rapid\n      test, setting up the follow-up model and providing the intervention education of safe sex\n      thru individual case management, group meeting, leader-finding plan and interactive MSM web\n      networking to achieve the preventione of sexual disease transmission in the youth."
