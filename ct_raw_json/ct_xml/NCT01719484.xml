        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Between ages 18-50 years old.

          2. Able to read and write.

          3. negative urine toxicology screens during intake appointments indicating no history of

          4. WOMEN: have a regular menstrual cycle.

          5. BMI:   30 &lt; BMI &lt; 35 for obese subjects (upper limit of 35 selected given our
             experience with heavier individuals fitting comfortably in the fMRI scanner) and 18.5
             &lt; BMI &lt;25 for normal weight subjects (Institute, 2006)

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. any major neurological illness or injury and any current or prior clinically
             significant mental health (including PTSD) or substance use disorder (with exception
             of nicotine dependence) as determined by SCID interview;

          2. Regular use of any psychoactive drugs including anxiolytics and antidepressants.

          3. Any significant current medical condition such as neurological, cardiovascular,
             endocrine, renal, liver, thyroid pathology; subjects on medications for any medical
             condition will be excluded.

          4. Any subjects with foreign ferromagnetic metal objects in their body or other MR
             contraindications will be excluded including subjects who work as welders.

          5. Women on oral contraceptives, peri- and post-menopausal women, and pregnant or
