Enrolled subjects will provide a single stool sample for the Exact IBD-ACRN\n      surveillance test, no sooner than 7 days following their most recent pre-enrollment\n      colonoscopy, within 30 days of enrollment and prior to initiating bowel prep for either the\n      post-enrollment colonoscopy (surveillance or repeat), or surgical intervention. Stool\n      samples will be tested using the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test and results compared to\n      the colonoscopy and corresponding diagnostic histopathology results from biopsied, and any\n      subsequently excised, lesions to establish sensitivity and specificity of the Exact IBD-ACRN\n      surveillance test. All post-enrollment colonoscopies or surgical interventions must be\n      performed within 60 days of enrollment.\n\n      The primary objective of this study is to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the\n      Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test for CRC in IBD patients with disease duration of at least\n      eight years or diagnosis of PSC. Tissue diagnosis of CRC will be established by\n      histopathology examination. The secondary objective is to determine the sensitivity and\n      specificity of the Exact IBD-ACRN surveillance test to detect ACRN in IBD patients with\n      disease duration of at least eight years or diagnosis of PSC.\n\n      Enrollment will continue until at least 30 CRC; 20 HGD and 240 negative subject samples have\n      been obtained. There is no specific recruitment goal for IBD associated LGD or LGD\n      associated with advanced adenoma (AA)."
