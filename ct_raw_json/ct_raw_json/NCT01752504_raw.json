SCOs are new or modified policies, programs, practices, laws or changes to the built environment. The mobilization effort will include continual development of the coalitions' infrastructure and capacity for identifying and achieving relevant SCOs to influence risk, regular review of strategic plans and SCOs, and the development of new SCOs to achieve.
