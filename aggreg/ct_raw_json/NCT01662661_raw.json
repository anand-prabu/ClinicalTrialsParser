The study consists of 3 phases, including, a screening phase, an\n      open-label treatment phase, and a follow up phase. The screening phase will be within 21\n      days before administration of the first dose of study medication. After screening,\n      participants will be randomized according to a classical 2 sequence (ie, treatment sequence\n      AB [where the participants will first receive treatment A and then treatment B] and sequence\n      BA [where the participants will first receive treatment B and then treatment A]), 2-period\n      crossover design to receive the study medication in the treatment phase. In each session\n      (Session 1 or Session 2), participants will receive either Treatment A: 200 mg dose of\n      JNJ-47910382 formulated as a suspension, or Treatment B: 200 mg JNJ-47910382 formulated as\n      an uncoated tablet. There will be a washout period (period when participant is not receiving\n      any study medication) of at least 7 to 14 days between the 2 sessions. The follow up phase\n      will include 2 follow up visits after intake of study medication in last treatment session.\n      Safety evaluations for adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, electrocardiogram, vital\n      signs, physical examination, and specific toxicities will be monitored throughout the study.\n      The duration of the study will be at least 11 to 18 days (screening and follow up phase not\n      included)."
