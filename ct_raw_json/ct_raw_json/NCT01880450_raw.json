It\n      emphasizes skills in avoiding risky sexual situations, and provides medically accurate\n      information about sexual development, sexually transmitted infections and pregnancy.\n      Effectiveness is measured by using a randomized control trial design and tracking\n      differences in cognitive factors (HIV/STI (Sexually Transmitted Infections) knowledge,\n      sexual self-efficacy; intention to use a condom); relationship factors (immature romantic\n      beliefs, relationship self-efficacy), gender norms (macho man, powerless female), and\n      resilience."
