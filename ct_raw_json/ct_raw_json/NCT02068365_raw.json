            "textblock": "Chronic hepatitis B is the commonest cause of liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma\n      in Hong Kong. Treatment with interferon and nucleos(t)ide analogues (NA) can reduce the risk\n      of HCC. NA is the commonest used medication in Hong Kong. However, most patients require\n      long-term treatment and premature drug cessation may lead to hepatitis relapse.\n\n      Under the current regional guidelines, patients who have positive hepatitis B e antigen\n      (HBeAg) treated by NA can consider stopping treatment if HBeAg seroconversion has developed\n      for at least 12 months. However, up to 30-50% of patients may develop virological relapse\n      and/or HBeAg reversion after cessation of treatment. On the other hand, interferon-based\n      treatment has a much more durable response. HBeAg seroconversion is maintained in 80% of\n      patients after successful treatment with peginterferon. Upon long-term follow-up,\n      peginterferon-treated patients are also more likely to achieve hepatitis B surface antigen\n      (HBsAg) seroclearance, a condition closest to a cure of chronic hepatitis B."
