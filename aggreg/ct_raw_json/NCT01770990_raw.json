Both interventions consist of\n      one personal session and weekly to bi-weekly 8-10 telephone sessions with a licensed\n      cognitive-behavioral psychotherapist accompanied by the study of educational materials and\n      the completion of regular monitoring questionnaires (total treatment duration:\n      approximately 3 months). Patients are randomized into one of two conditions: Patients in the\n      condition \"Tel-PT including mail\" additionally receive a motivating letter from their\n      psychotherapist after each telephone session, while patients in the condition \"Tel-PT\n      without mail\" receive no further interventions. Patients refusing to be randomized are to be\n      assigned to the condition \"Tel-PT without mail\". This study takes place within a larger\n      study evaluating a stepped care model for depression (01KQ1002B-TP7)."
