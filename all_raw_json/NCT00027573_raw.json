Peripheral stem cell transplantation may be able to replace\n      immune cells that were destroyed by chemotherapy used to kill tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by donor\n      peripheral stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or\n      unresectable kidney cancer."

Allogeneic peripheral blood stem cells\n      are infused on day 0. Patients then receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously daily\n      beginning on day 5 and continuing until blood counts recover.\n\n      Patients receive graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis comprising oral tacrolimus\n      twice daily on days -1 to 90 and methotrexate IV on days 1, 3, and 6.\n\n      After day 120, patients with persistent disease and no signs of active GVHD may receive\n      donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). DLI may be repeated every 8 weeks for a total of 2\n      infusions.\n\n      Patients are followed every 2 months for 1 year and then every 6 months for 4 years OR every\n      2 months for 6 months and then every 6 months for 4.5 years if patient receives DLI.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 36 patients will be accrued for this study within 18-24\n      months."
