It has been known to occur in as many as 40% of patients diagnosed with rheumatoid\n      arthritis (RA).  The cause of the pulmonary fibrosis in patients with RA is unknown.\n\n      Data gathered from previous research studies suggest that genetics may play a role in the\n      development of PF in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  However, the actual genetic\n      factors involved in the disease process have not been identified.\n\n      The goal of this study is to identify the genetic markers in patients with pulmonary\n      fibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis."
