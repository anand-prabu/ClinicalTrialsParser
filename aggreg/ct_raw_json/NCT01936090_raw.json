To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of bortezomib that can be added to high\n      dose melphalan and low dose total body irradiation as part of conditioning chemotherapy for\n      myeloma. (Phase I) II. To determine the efficacy of the bortezomib added to high dose\n      melphalan and low dose total-body irradiation (TBI) in patients with myeloma undergoing stem\n      cell transplantation, as defined by achievement of complete response (CR).\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To examine the toxicities associated with addition of bortezomib to high dose melphalan\n      and TBI in patients with multiple myeloma (MM).\n\n      II. To determine the progression free rate at 1 and 2 years.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine the proportion of patients achieving a minimal residual disease (MRD)\n      negative status.\n\n      II.
