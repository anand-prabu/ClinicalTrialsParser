It has been optimized for an\n      increased binding for CD20 and an enhanced antibody dependent cell medicated cytotoxicity\n      (ADCC) effector function.\n\n      A previous phase I/II study of intravenously (IV) administered ocaratuzumab in\n      refractory/relapsed follicular lymphoma patients has concluded that ocaratuzumab is safe and\n      well-tolerated at doses up to 375mg/ m2 weekly for four weeks.\n\n      In this proposed phase I study, ocaratuzumab will be administered subcutaneously to patients\n      with previously treated CD20+ B-cell malignancies. Three dose levels (40 mg weekly x 4\n      doses, 80 mg weekly x 4 doses, and 80 mg weekly x 8 doses) will be investigated for safety,\n      tolerability, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic analyses."
