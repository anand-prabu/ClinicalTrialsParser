While these\n      additives can significantly increase an individual's daily phosphorus intake, little is\n      known about the effect of dietary phosphorus on kidney health. In this study, the\n      investigators will first lower baseline phosphorus intake to about 1000mg/d by educating\n      participants to avoid foods with phosphorus additives. Then, participants will be randomized\n      to a higher phosphorus period (~2gm/d) and a lower phosphorus period (~1gm/d) by providing\n      unaltered, commercially-available food/beverage products with and without phosphorus\n      additives.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that participants will have higher urine albumin excretion and\n      fibroblast growth factor-23 during the higher phosphorus period compared to the lower\n      phosphorus period."
