  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is investigating the safety and efficacy of a vaccine directed against prostate
      tumor cells.  The researchers are interested in evaluating the safety and tolerability of
      the vaccine, and the effects of the vaccine on survivability, time to measurable disease,
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level  in the blood, and the immune response to the vaccine.

      Eligible patients include those with recurrent prostate cancer as shown by elevated levels
      of PSA, although there is no evidence of tumors that are measurable by imaging studies.  In
      addition, to be eligible patients must have prostate cancer that either has not been treated
      by hormonal therapy or is not responsive to hormonal therapy.

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the prostate

          -  Age greater than18 years

          -  Rising serum PSA levels documented by 3 values over the last 6 months prior to study
             enrollment. Each value must be greater than 2 weeks from the previous value.

          -  Patients with rising PSA must have had either 1) prior definitive therapy including
             surgery or radiation therapy (hormone-na誰ve, defined as hormone-na誰ve patients and
             patients who received hormone therapy in the past who currently have total
             testosterone greater than 50 ng/dL), or 2) hormone suppressive therapy as documented
             by surgical castration or a serum testosterone value less than 50 ng/dL
             (hormone-independent). Patients must have completed these therapies for at least 6
             months but no longer than 20 years prior to enrollment

          -  PSA value within 4 weeks of starting therapy less than 20 ng/mL for hormone-na誰ve
             patients (defined as hormone-na誰ve patients and patients who received hormone therapy
             in the past who currently have total testosterone greater than 50 ng/dL) or less than
             60 ng/mL for hormone-independent patients.

          -  Patients must have the following laboratory values: ANC greater than  1500/mcL,
             platelet count greater than 100,000/mcL, hemoglobin greater than 10 g/dL, bilirubin
             less than 1.5 x upper limits of normal, AST less than 1.5 x upper limits of normal

          -  Patients must have adequate lung function, as defined by oxygen saturation greater
             than or equal to 90% by pulse oximetry

          -  Patients must have QTc interval less than 450 msec

          -  Patients must have adequate EGFR greater than 30 mL/min per 1.73 m2 (per VA formula
             and adjusted for gender and race)

          -  Patients with female partners of childbearing potential must use at least one form of
             Investigator-approved contraception while on-study and for 30 days after their last
             administration of study investigational therapy. Acceptable birth control options
             include: a) surgical sterilization (subject and/or subject's partner), b) approved
             hormonal contraceptives or therapies (such as birth control pills, Depo-Provera, or
             Lupron Depot), c) barrier methods (such as a condom or diaphragm) used with a
             spermicide, and d) an intrauterine device (IUD).

             seropositivity and CD4 lymphocyte count to be eligible for the study

          -  Prior malignancy. Patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer or other cancers with greater

             supplementation

          -  Patients with significant cardiac disease including heart failure that meets New York
