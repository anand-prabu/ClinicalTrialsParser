The list of assignment to\n      ticagrelor or clopidogrel will be generated by a computer according to a 1:1 randomization.\n      Primary Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be performed according to standard clinical\n      practice using femoral or radial artery Judkins approach via six or seven French heath\n      insertion. After crossing the target occlusive Lesion,  coronary stenting will be performed\n      based on standard practice. Patients subsequently will receive heparin for 48 hr, aspirin\n      100 mg daily, and  clopidogrel (75 mg/day) or ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) for at least 12\n      months. Other adjunctive pharmacotherapy in Intensive Care Unit will be administered\n      according to operator discretion. All patients will provide written informed consent before\n      entering the study.\n\n      Before and after the procedure a 12-leads ECG and an echocardiogram will be performed as\n      standard practice. Then, all the pre-, intra-, and post-procedure data patients will be\n      collected in a database.\n\n      Investigators aim to perform a prospective, single-center, investigator-initiated,\n      randomized study to compare the Adenosine-induced coronary vasodilatation after the loading\n      dose of Ticagrelor either Clopidogrel during the Percutaneous Coronary Intervention.\n      Patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome undergoing Percutaneous Coronary Intervention will be\n      enrolled in the study and will be randomized, in a 1:1 ratio, to receive a loading dose of\n      Ticagrelor (180 mg) or Clopidogrel (600 mg). Coronary Flow Reserve will be recorded by\n      intracoronary Doppler Flow Wire before the stent implantation  and  after the procedure at\n      baseline and 2-minute later adenosine intravenous  administration at incremental doses of\n      50, 80, 110 and 140 ug/Kg/min with 2 minutes interval between infusions.\n\n      Coronary Flow Reserve is the ability of  the myocardium to increase blood flow in response\n      to maximal exercise. Doppler Flow Wire allows to measure this increase expressing it as a\n      ratio between maximal vasodilation and flow at rest. Coronary Flow Reserve is routinely\n      measured in patients with Acute Coronary Syndrome, without an increased risk of adverse\n      events for patients neither adjunctive costs for the National Health System.\n\n      Furthermore, Plasma concentrations of Ticagrelor and its main metabolite (AR-C124910XX) will\n      be measured in venous blood collected at the end of the procedure. In patients requiring a\n      second Percutaneous Coronary Intervention, for example for multivessel disease,  all these\n      measures will be repeated in the same manner."
