Despite its spontaneous resolution, EA\n      is still considered as a potentially serious complication because of the risks of\n      self-injury, and because of the stress caused to both caregivers and families.\n\n      Dexmedetomidine, an Alpha2-adrenoceptor agonist with sedative, analgesic, and anxiolytic\n      actions, has been used in pediatric populations.Several prospective clinical trials in\n      children have shown that dexmedetomidine significantly reduces the incidence of EA prior to\n      recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. However, the effect of dexmedetomidine premedication\n      on emergence agitation has not been fully evaluated. The purpose of the present study was to\n      verify the hypothesis that intranasal premedication with dexmedetomidine is effective in\n      reducing emergence agitation after sevoflurane anaesthesia."
