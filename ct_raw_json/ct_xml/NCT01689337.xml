  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, double-blind, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of AS902330 (recombinant human fibroblast growth factor-18
      [rhFGF-18]) as an adjunct treatment to subjects following microfracture (MFx) surgery for
      cartilage injury of the knee.

      Primary Objectives

        -  To evaluate the effect of AS902330 intra-articular knee injections as adjunct to MFx
           surgery on the composition of the refilled cartilage in the target knee, as measured by
           gadolinium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of cartilage (dGEMRIC) T1
           relaxation time at 6 months after MFx surgery

        -  To evaluate the safety profile of AS902330 when administered intra-articular into the
           knee as adjunct to MFx surgery in subjects with cartilage injury of the knee

      Secondary Objectives

        -  To further support the efficacy and safety of AS902330 as an adjunct to MFx  for
           cartilage  injury  repair  through  symptomatic  outcomes  and  quantitative  MRI
           measurement
