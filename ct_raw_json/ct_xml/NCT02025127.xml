  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Septic shock represents the body's dysregulated response to an infection, manifesting as
      persistent hypotension (mean arterial pressure &lt; 70 mmHg) despite intravenous (IV) fluid
      resuscitation. Severe sepsis and septic shock are major healthcare problems, affecting
      millions of people around the world each year In critically ill patients without shock,
      provision of enteral nutrition within 24-48 hours has shown to preserve intestinal
      epithelium, maintain brush border enzyme activity, maintenance of barrier function to
      enhance immune function, and preservation of tight cell junctions to reduce permeability.
      These benefits of enteral nutrition are postulated to prevent downstream complications of
      nosocomial infections and the multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), though direct data
      addressing this question are lacking.

      There is a paucity of data on the timing and role of enteral nutrition in septic shock.

      Specific aim 1: To examine the effect of enteral nutrition of &gt;50 kcal/day but &lt;600 kcal/day
      compared to no enteral nutrition initiated with 24 hours of admission on the number of
      intensive care unit free days' in patients with septic shock.

      Hypothesis 1: The investigators hypothesize that amongst mechanically ventilated patients
      with a diagnosis of septic shock, the initiation of early enteral nutrition of &gt;50 kcal/day
      but &lt;600 kcal/day, as compared to no enteral nutrition, improves the primary outcome of
      number of intensive care unit free days'.

      Specific aim 2: To examine the effect of enteral nutrition of &gt;50 kcal/day but&lt; 600 kcal/day
      initiated with 24 hours of admission on in-hospital mortality, mechanical ventilator free
      days, time to 50% reduction in vasopressor dose, and time to initiation of physical therapy
      in patients with septic shock.

      Hypothesis 2: The investigators hypothesize that amongst mechanically ventilated patients
      with a diagnosis of septic shock, the initiation of early enteral nutrition of &gt;50 kcal/day
      but &lt;600 kcal/day, as compared to no enteral nutrition, decreases mortality, duration of
      mechanical ventilation, time to 50% reduction in vasopressor dose, and time to initiation of
      physical therapy.
