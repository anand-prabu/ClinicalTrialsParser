Participants will be maintained on their prior CIDP therapy during\n      the drug infusions and then followed at regular intervals.\n\n      Phase 3. Alteration of CIDP therapy CIDP therapy may be altered at the discretion of the\n      treating physician - either taper, discontinuation, or increase of current or additional\n      medications. For those participants on chronic corticosteroid therapy, following pulse IV\n      methylprednisolone and alemtuzumab cycle, corticosteroids will be tapered as rapidly and as\n      far as possible according to according to the investigator's discretion. While the aim will\n      be to discontinue corticosteroids, it is recognized that some participants will have a\n      suppressed pituitary-adrenal axis and complete discontinuation may not be possible.\n\n      Phase 4: Extended Follow-up Each participant will be followed per protocol for a minimum of\n      36 months. All participants will undergo safety assessments and monitoring for at least 36\n      months after the last cycle of alemtuzumab. Additional cycles of alemtuzumab may be provided\n      at the discretion of the participants' treating physician with at least a 12 month interval\n      between cycles.\n\n      NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS: Approximately 16 participants will join this study."
