  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High Grade Gliomas, including anaplastic astrocytomas, anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and
      glioblastomas (GBM), are the most common and most aggressive primary brain tumors. Prognosis
      for patients with high-grade gliomas remains poor. The estimated median survival for
      patients with GBM is between 12 to 18 months. Recurrence after initial therapy with
      temozolomide and radiation is nearly universal. Since May 2009, the majority of patients in
      the US with an initial recurrence of high-grade glioma receive bevacizumab, a monoclonal
      antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which is thought to prevent
      angiogenesis in these highly vascular tumors. BEV has response rates from 32-62% and has
      improved overall median survival in patients with recurrent high-grade gliomas1. However,
      the response is short lived, and nearly 100% of patients eventually progress despite
      bevacizumab. No chemotherapeutic agent administered following progression through
      bevacizumab has made a significant impact on survival. Patients progress to death within 1-5
      months after resistance develops. Therefore, patients with high-grade gliomas who have
      progressed through bevacizumab represent a population in dire need of a feasible and
      tolerable treatment.

      NKTR-102 is a topoisomerase I inhibitor polymer conjugate that was engineered by attaching
      irinotecan molecules to a polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer using a biodegradable linker.
      Irinotecan released from NKTR-102 following administration is further metabolized to the
      active metabolite, 7-ethyl-10-hydroxy-camptothecin (SN38), that causes DNA damage through
      inhibition of topoisomerase. The goal in designing NKTR-102 was to attenuate or eliminate
      some of the limiting side effects of irinotecan while improving efficacy by modifying the
      distribution of the agent within the body. The size and structure of NKTR-102 results in
      marked alteration in pharmacokinetic (PK) profile for the SN38 derived from NKTR-102
      compared to that following irinotecan: the maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) is reduced 5-
      to 10-fold and the half-life (t1/2 ) of SN38 is increased from 2 days to approximately 50
      days. This altered profile leads to constant exposure of the tumor to the active drug. In
      addition, the large NKTR-102 molecule does not freely pass out of intact vasculature, which
      may account for relatively higher concentrations of the compound and the active metabolites
      in tumor tissues in in vivo models, where the local vasculature may be relatively more
      permeable. A 145 mg/m2 dose of NKTR-102, the dose intended for use in this phase II clinical
      trial (and being used in the phase III clinical program), results in approximately the same
      plasma exposure to SN38 as a 350 mg/m2 dose of irinotecan, but exposure is protracted,
      resulting in continuous exposure between dosing cycles and lower Cmax. NKTR-102 was
      therefore developed as a new chemotherapeutic agent that may improve the clinical outcomes
      of patients.

                  of investigational drug, or existing serious cardiac arrhythmia).

               6. Patients who require daily use of oxygen supplementation in the 28 days prior to
                  first dose of investigational drug.

               7. Any other significant co-morbid conditions that in the opinion of the
                  Investigator would impair study participation or cooperation.

               -  other chemotherapy, other investigational agents , or biologic agents for

               -  the treatment of cancer including antibodies(eg, bevacizumab,

               -  trastuzumab, or pertuzumab) or any investigational agent(s).

          -  Pregnant or nursing patients will be excluded from the study.

          -  Patients receiving active treatment for HIV will be excluded from this study because
             non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors and maraviroc (a
             CCR5-antagonist) are extensively metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system.
             Interactions with these drugs may induce or inhibit irinotecan or SN38 metabolism,
             leading to over or under-dosing.
