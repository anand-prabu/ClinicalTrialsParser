            "textblock": "The newer antiplatelet agents such as Ticagrelor have demonstrated superiority to\n      Clopidogrel in patients presenting with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). At present Ticagrelor\n      remains a first line therapy as an adjunct to aspirin for patients undergoing primary PCI\n      for STEMI for reducing major adverse events. However, the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor\n      has not been investigated in patients with STEMI post fibrinolysis. Ticagrelor results in\n      significantly higher platelet inhibition than aspirin or clopidogrel and may expose patients\n      to an increased risk of bleeding if administered post thrombolysis. However, fibrinolytic\n      therapy itself results in a prothrombotic milieu with greater activation of platelets, a\n      condition that can be balanced with addition of stronger antiplatelet agents. Similar\n      concerns were initially reflected for clopidogrel as an adjunct to fibrinolytic therapy but\n      were later proven to be unsubstantiated. In fact, adjunct administration of clopidogrel to\n      fibrinolytic therapy reduces major adverse events as shown by multiple studies and has\n      become the standard of care recommended by guidelines. The present study is proposed to\n      study the safety and efficacy of Ticagrelor in patients undergoing PCI post fibrinolytic\n      therapy for STEMI."
