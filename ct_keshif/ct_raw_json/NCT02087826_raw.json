The food the investigators will be studying is specially prepared to contain\n      protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The drug the investigators are studying is metformin. The\n      investigators hypothesize that physiological responses to the meal and to the medication\n      will differ between carriers and non-carriers of genes associated with type 2 diabetes."
