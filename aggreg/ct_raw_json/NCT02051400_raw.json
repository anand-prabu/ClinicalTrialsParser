A blade size of 4 was used on all\n      devices. All intubations using video laryngoscopes were performed according to the\n      manufacturers' instructions. A specialised rigid stylet (the GlideRite\u00ae) was used with the\n      Glidescope\u00ae and a flexible plastic stylet bent with a hockey stick curvature, was used with\n      the McGrath\u00ae MAC and the Macintosh laryngoscope. A size 7.5 endotracheal tube (Mallinckrodt\u2122\n      Hi-Lo Oral/Nasal Tracheal Tube Cuffed Murphy Eye, Covidien, Ireland) was used with all the\n      laryngoscopes.\n\n      All participants were randomly divided into 3 device groups. Each group was allowed to\n      attempt to perform endotracheal intubation five more times using the Laerdal\u00ae Airway\n      Management Trainer (Laerdal Medical Korea Ltd., Seoul, Korea) with the normal airway\n      setting. After completing the normal airway session, the participants performed another five\n      attempts with the neck immobilisation setting using a neck collar.\n\n      The sequence in which the three devices were used was randomly assigned, and all\n      participants performed the same sequence at intervals of five weeks during the study."
