Patients will be randomized to receive LTX-109\n      or placebo at a ratio of 1:1 at each of the doses.\n\n      Patients \u22652 years with non-bullous impetigo will be enrolled in the study. Study candidacy\n      will be determined by a dermatological examination, medical history, clinical diagnosis of\n      non-bullous impetigo and a positive Gram-stain. Patients meeting eligibility will be\n      randomized to one of the treatment groups.\n\n      A safety visit will be performed at Day 4. Clinical response will be evaluated by clinical\n      success, clinical improvement or clinical failure according to definitions in the protocol\n      at one or more of the visits - Day 4 (-1), Day 6 (+2) and Day 12 (+2), and will be derived\n      from the Skin Infection Rating Scale (SIRS) score of the target lesion.\n\n      Bacteriological response will be evaluated by culture of swabs collected from the target\n      lesion. Success or failure will be defined by presence or non-presence of the causative\n      pathogen (bacteria isolated at baseline  considered being the causative pathogen: S. aureus\n      or S. pyogenes). Bacteriological swabs will be collected if pus/exudate is available at Day\n      4 (-1), Day 6 (+2) and Day 12 (+2), if there is exudate/pus available from the target\n      lesion. No pus/exudate will be considered as elimination of the causative pathogen, and will\n      be considered as bacteriological success."
