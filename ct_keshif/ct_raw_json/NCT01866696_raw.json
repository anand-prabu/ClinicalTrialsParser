Twenty  patients have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded oral implant supported fixed full prosthesis. A total of 120 oral implants (Nobel Replace Tapered Groovy; Nobel Biocare AB, Goteborg, Sweden) supporting 23 bridges (8 mandible, 15 maxilla) were placed , 22 of which in fresh post extraction sockets. 117 out of 120 oral  implants were immediately loaded."

Twenty\n      patients have been consecutively rehabilitated with an immediately loaded implant supported\n      fixed full prosthesis. A total of 120 fixtures supporting 23 bridges (8 mandible, 15\n      maxilla) were placed , 22 of which in fresh post extraction sockets. All the implants were\n      inserted  with an insertion torque of 35/45 Ncm. 117 out of 120 implants were immediately\n      loaded the other 3 were delayed loaded.\n\n      Outcome measures were implants survival, radiographic marginal bone-levels and bone\n      remodeling, soft tissue parameters and complications."
