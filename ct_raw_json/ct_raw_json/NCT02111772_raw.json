            "textblock": "In patients with asthma, reactions to allergens in the environment (such as mold, pollen,\n      weed, domestic pets, and dust allergens) play an important role in causing asthma symptoms.\n      However, upper respiratory tract infections, typically those caused by the common cold\n      virus, rhinovirus, can also cause asthma to get worse. In previous studies at the University\n      of Virginia, it was found that mild asthmatics, who had high levels of the allergy antibody\n      (called IgE) in their blood, developed more persistent cold and chest symptoms when they\n      were given an infection with rhinovirus (the most frequent cause of the common cold). The\n      cold symptoms produced by rhinovirus tend to peak during the first 4 -7 days of the cold.\n      These symptoms, including nasal congestion, are similar to what you have experienced with\n      previous colds.\n\n      This study is being done to learn how a common cold caused by a viral infection affects\n      people with asthma. The goal is to learn how to improve the care of asthma symptoms caused\n      by the common cold virus (called rhinovirus). Most adults experience one or two colds caused\n      by rhinovirus every year. In addition, 75-80% of asthma exacerbations caused by viral\n      infections are caused by this virus, primarily in children. Adults are less likely to\n      experience significant changes in their asthma symptoms when they get colds, because they\n      have developed protective immune responses from previous colds which help diminish symptoms."

In\n             keeping with the study design goals of inoculating subjects during periods of\n             allergen exposure, sensitization to other allergens (e.g., cat or dog) will also\n             qualify for enrollment if subjects are currently exposed to these allergens at home.\n\n        Criteria for non-asthmatic subjects (controls):\n\n        \u2022 Subjects without a history of asthma or allergic disorders (e.g., allergic rhinitis,\n        allergic conjunctivitis, atopic dermatitis, or food allergies).
