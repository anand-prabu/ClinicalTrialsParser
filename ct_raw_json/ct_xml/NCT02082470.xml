    <textblock>
      This pilot clinical trial studies survivorship care planning in supporting quality of life
      in ovarian cancer survivors following primary treatment. Survivorship care plans have the
      potential to empower patients and provide them with a plan of care following treatments.
      Survivorship care planning may support patient's overall well-being and quality of life
      after treatment of ovarian cancer.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To assess the feasibility and acceptability of survivorship care planning (SCP) in
      ovarian cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To develop the infrastructure and strategy for a larger comparative intervention study
      (National Cancer Institute [NCI] R01).

      OUTLINE: Participants are assigned to 1 of 2 arms.

      ARM I: Participants receive standard post-treatment care consisting of regular cancer
      surveillance visits with treating oncologists.

      ARM II: Participants complete survivorship care planning in close collaboration with
      treating oncologists.

      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 2 months.
