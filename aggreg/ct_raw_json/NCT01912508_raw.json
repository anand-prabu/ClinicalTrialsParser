Another\n      measurement will be taken after applying moderate cervical pressure.\n\n      The investigators will compere cervical contour and pressure influence between groups and\n      according to cervical length Demographic data will be taken at the time of recruitment  and\n      pregnancy outcome measures in a later telephone interview."
