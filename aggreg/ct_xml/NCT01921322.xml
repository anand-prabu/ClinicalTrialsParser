  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized (open label), multi-center and post-market study. The
      study is to compare effectiveness of sensor-augmented pump (SAP) therapy versus multiple
      daily injection (MDI) therapy in hospitalized patients with insulin treating type 2 diabetes
      in China

      Primary objective:

      To compare the length of time to achieve target glucose range using Self-Monitoring Blood
      Glucose (SMBG), as reference method, with the  722 Paradigm Real-Time insulin pump versus
      MDI

      Secondary Objectives:

      To compare glycemic variability (using CGM as reference method) with the 722 Paradigm
      Real-Time insulin pump versus MDI

      This is a prospective, randomized (open label), multi-center study. The clinical study staff
      will conduct screening tests according to inclusion/exclusion criteria in order to verify
      the subject's eligibility for the study.

      Inpatient Period A patient is admitted into hospital for treatment of diabetes

      Randomization

      Subjects are randomized (at a 1:1 ratio) to group A or B in the study database. A total of
      80 subjects will be randomized into 2 study groups:

        -  Group A will wear 722 Paradigm Real-Time System  (treated with 24h per day insulin
           infusion)

        -  Group B will be on MDI and wear the CGMS-Gold (treated with 4 insulin injections).

      It is anticipated that the total duration for the study will be within one year from site
      initiation to finalization of all data entry and monitoring.

      Each subject will participate in the study approximately 2 weeks.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject is 18 to 65 years old at time of screening

          2. A clinical diagnosis of type 2 diabetes &gt; 6 months prior to the screening as
             determined by the Investigator,

          3. Treating with insulin at least one injection per day prior to participate in the
             study

          4. Glycosylated hemoglobin (A1C) &gt; 8% at screening

          5. Subject needs to be hospitalized to receive treatment for glucose management
             according to Endocrinologists' discretion

          6. Subject is willing to follow protocol and underdo all study procedures

          7. Subject is willing and able to provide informed written consent personally or by
             legal proxy

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has known hypersensitivity to insulin or insulin infusion set

          2. Subject has been treated with drugs with a known effect on BG within 8 weeks before
             enrollment other than diabetes medications such as insulin or oral agents.

          3. random blood glucose is above 33 mmol/L

          4. Subject is currently using real time CGM therapy prior to screening

          5. Subject is currently using insulin pump therapy prior to screening

          6. Female subject who is pregnant, or plans to become pregnant during the course of the
             study

          7. Patients who are critically ill that must go to intensive critical care unit per
             Investigator discretion
