Such therapy is started with the administration of\n      a loading dose in patients which are not yet under treatment with P2Y12 inhibitors\n      (antiplatelet agents). However it is unknown whether a loading dose is needed to maintain a\n      satisfactory inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients who are already treated with a\n      previous generation P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) during the passage to the newer compound\n      ticagrelor. For this reason aim of the present study is to evaluate the levels of platelet\n      aggregation during the pharmacological shift from clopidogrel to ticagrelor performed with\n      or without a loading starting dose of the newer drug."
