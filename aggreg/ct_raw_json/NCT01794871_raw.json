In previous, CNI nephrotoxicity is overstated and considered\n      one of the major causes of CAD, however, recently there has been found most death-censored\n      graft losses to be the result of alloimmune or autoimmune injury, with only a minority of\n      cases attributable to CNI toxicity. Unfortunately, Situation of objective CNI toxicity in\n      CAD in China is not well analyzed. To improve perception of Neo safety with more local\n      evidence, we want to do a retrospective study to identify the cause of chronic allograft\n      dysfunction using a combination of comprehensive clinical and histologic information in\n      Chinese renal transplantation recipients."
