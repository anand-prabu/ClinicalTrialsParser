The pharmacokinetics of darapladib and its metabolites; and safety and\n      tolerability will be evaluated.\n\n      All the subjects will be admitted to the clinic on the evening of Day -1. Subjects may check\n      out of the clinic on Day 2 after all assessments are complete, but must return to the clinic\n      each day (Days 3-8) for dosing and assessments. Subjects will be admitted to the clinic\n      again on the evening of Day 9. After the last dose of the study drug, there will be a\n      follow-up period which will include 2 visits (Day 20-24 and Day 38-52). The total study\n      duration for each subject including the screening, treatment and follow-up periods will be\n      approximately 11 weeks."
