        Inclusion criteria

          -  Patients (men and women) diagnosed with breast cancer stages I-III initiating first
             line adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapy with paclitaxel or docetaxel

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent
             document.

          -  Patients with functional limitations due to musculoskeletal conditions can be
             included, because these conditions are known to remain stable over the relatively
             short duration of the study.

          -  Concurrent standard and investigational agents are permissible with the standard
             chemotherapy drugs.

        Exclusion Criteria

          -  Prior known chemotherapy or targeted therapy (for breast cancer or other malignancies
             that is known to be associated with neuropathy in the last 12 months(platinum
             therapy, bortezomib, vinblastine, etc.)

          -  Prior taxane exposure at any time

          -  Preexisting known diagnosis of any type of neuropathy prior to start of paclitaxel or
             docetaxel chemotherapy

          -  Pregnant or nursing women.

          -  Unable to give informed consent.

          -  Preexisting lower extremity amputation

          -  Inability to walk or stand without assistance due to any condition

          -  Neuropathic pain medications prior to start of study including gabapentin,
             pregabalin, amytriptyline, and duloxetine (but initiation of neuropathic pain
             medications during treatment are permissible)

          -  Patients needing ambulatory assist devices

          -  Back or lower extremity surgery in the last 6 months

          -  Back or lower extremity surgery at any timepoint that interferes with gait and
             balance per patient or provider report
