Patients are stratified\n      according to participating center, histology (follicular (closed to accrual 9/18/00) vs\n      mantle cell), status of disease (de novo vs relapsed vs resistant), response after induction\n      (stable disease vs partial or complete response), and treatment status (treated vs\n      untreated).\n\n      All patients receive induction therapy consisting of rituximab IV over 3-5 hours once a week\n      during weeks 1-4. Patients are then randomized to one of two treatment arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients are observed.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive rituximab IV over 3-5 hours once a week during weeks 12, 20,\n           28, and 36.\n\n      Patients are followed weekly for the first month; every 8 weeks for the next 8 months; then\n      at 12, 18, and 24 months; and then annually for the next 3 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 240 patients (120 per arm) will be accrued for this study\n      within 3-4 years."
