Once consented,\n      eligible patients will be treated by the acute leukemia service on the University of\n      Pittsburgh Cancer Institute inpatient unit.\n\n      Prior to the start of chemotherapy, patients will receive dexamethasone and ondansetron as\n      pre-medication. Clofarabine will then be administered as intravenous infusion on days 1\n      through 5. Patients will be monitored closely with vital signs. Cytarabine will then be\n      given as intravenous infusion, starting 3 (maximum of 4) hours after the completion of\n      clofarabine administration on days 1 through 5."
