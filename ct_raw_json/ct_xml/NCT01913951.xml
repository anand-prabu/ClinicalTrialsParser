  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of vosaroxin when given
      together with azacitidine in treating patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Drugs used in
      chemotherapy, such as vosaroxin and azacitidine, work in different ways to stop the growth
      of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

             treating physician immediately.

          -  Patients may have received up to 3 prior cycles of hypomethylator therapy (i.e.
             decitabine or azacitidine) prior to enrollment and may have received supportive care
             measures (growth factors, erythropoietin stimulating agents, transfusion, etc.

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with
             study requirements

          -  Pregnant and/or breastfeeding.
