  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Auditory verbal hallucinations (AVHs) are speech perceptions in the absence of a relevant
      external stimulation. Some accounts of AVHs claim that a deficit in inner speech monitoring
      would cause the verbal thoughts of the patient to be perceived as external voices resulting
      in AVHs.

      In order to examine whether AVHs correspond to self-generated inner speech, the present
      study aims at collecting speech muscle activity during covert AVHs (without articulation),
      overt speech and rest. Surface electromyography (sEMG) is used on schizophrenia patients and
      control subjects to detect any speech muscle activity during AVH.
