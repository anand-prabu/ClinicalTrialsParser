  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In children with a severe form of spina bifida (which is the consequence of a spinal cord
      defect) it can happen that  the bladder muscle (detrusor) contracts strongly and without
      warning (neurogenic detrusor overactivity) and that the urethra (the passage connecting the
      bladder with outside) does not relax. Those children cannot void but urine leakage can
      happen when the pressure in the bladder is so high that it overcomes the closed urethra
      (overflow at high filling bladder pressure)  and/or when  an overactive contraction is very
      strong. The high bladder pressure before overflow occurs puts those children at risk for
      kidney damage and the overactive contractions decrease the quality of the bladder
      additionally to the fact that they can cause leakage.  Therapy is aimed to decrease the high
      filling bladder pressure and the overactive detrusor contractions.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate long term efficacy and safety of treatment with
      solifenacin succinate (the study drug) and blood levels of solifenacin succinate (the study
      drug) in children with neurogenic detrusor overactivity after multiple dose administration.
