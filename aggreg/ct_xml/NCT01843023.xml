    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare 6-month treatment outcomes for 15-21 year old
      opioid-dependent youth receiving extended release naltrexone (XR-NTX) v. Treatment as Usual
      (TAU).

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This proposed study is a 6-month, two-group randomized clinical trial of XR-NTX v. TAU for
      340 opioid-dependent youth ages 15-21. The study will be conducted at Mountain Manor
      Treatment Center, a community drug treatment program in Baltimore. TAU will consist of
      buprenorphine treatment of opioid withdrawal followed by counseling with or without
      continued buprenorphine.

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to XR-NTX who do not have opioid withdrawal signs or symptoms within 4 hours of administration of the 25 mg oral dose naltrexone will be given an intramuscular injection of XR-NTX [VivitrolÂ®] at a dose of 4cc (380mg of naltrexone)] and will subsequently have the same dose administered to alternating sides of the buttocks every four weeks for up to 6 months. All participants will also receive psychosocial treatment.</description>

    <description>Participants randomly assigned to TAU will participate in the standard youth opioid program at the treatment center which includes either buprenorphine taper or ongoing buprenorphine treatment during the 6 months of the study for as long as they and their physicians think is appropriate. The general target dose will be 12-20 mg buprenorphine per day. All participants in TAU will receive psychosocial treatment.</description>
