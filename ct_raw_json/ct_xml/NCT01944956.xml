  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our objective was to evaluate maturation of sucking and swallowing in preterm infants using
      a non-invasive method: assessment of swallowing sounds. Findings in healthy term infants
      were used as reference values.

    <textblock>
      Successful transition to full oral feeding in preterm infants is important for safe
      discharge from hospital and for facilitating the mother-infant bond. Preterm infants were
      evaluated weekly for sucking and swallowing performance (i.e., feeding performance) from the
      time they began oral feeding (frequency 1-2 oral feedings/day) until they reached
      independent oral feeding (frequency 8 oral feedings/day) at postmenstrual 38-40 weeks. For
      the term infants, we evaluated a single oral feeding during the first week of life.

      The exclusion criteria were major congenital abnormalities, craniofacial malformation,
      intracranial hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, culture-positive sepsis, and
      necrotizing enterocolitis. Each swallowing-sound recording was 2 minutes long and was
      captured in a quiet environment by the same investigator.  The feeding parameters generated
      from the recordings were as follows: total number of swallows (S), total number of rhythmic
      swallows (RS), total number of resting intervals (RI), average time between resting
      intervals (ATRI), average time between swallows (ATS), average time between rhythmic
      swallows (ATRS), maximum number of rythymic swallows (MRS), and volume of milk ingested (VM)
       during the 2-minute evaluation.
