      This pilot phase I/II trial studies the side effects and the best dose of brentuximab
      vedotin and combination chemotherapy work in treating patients with stage II-IV human
      immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as
      brentuximab vedotin, can block cancer growth in different ways. Some block the ability of
      cancer to grow and spread. Others find cancer cells and help kill them or carry
      cancer-killing substances to them. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as doxorubicin
      hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine, work in different ways to stop the
      growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.
      Giving brentuximab vedotin together with combination chemotherapy may kill more cancer
      cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES I. To identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of brentuximab vedotin
      when combined with the doxorubicin hydrochloride, vinblastine sulfate, and dacarbazine (AVD)
      chemotherapy regimen in the treatment of HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma. (Phase
      I) II. Establish an estimate of the two-year progression-free survival for patients with
      HIV-associated stage II-IV Hodgkin lymphoma when treated using brentuximab vedotin plus the
      AVD chemotherapy regimen. (Phase II)

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate the toxicity of AVD and brentuximab vedotin with highly active antiretroviral
      therapy (HAART).

      II. To estimate the partial response (PR) rate, complete response (CR) rate, overall
      survival (OS), and event free survival (EFS) at 2 and 5 years.

      III. To evaluate the effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on cluster of differentiation
      (CD)4 and CD8 counts after cycle 1, 4, at the end of therapy, and every 3 months after
      treatment completion for one year.

      IV. To investigate the prognostic value of fludeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission
      tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) scans at baseline, after cycle 2, and at treatment
      completion, with respect to 2-year progression free survival.

      V. To evaluate HAART status at baseline and to correlate this with tumor response to therapy
      and OS and progression-free survival (PFS).

      VI. To characterize the histologic subtypes in HIV-Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) in the highly
      active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era.

      VII. To assess the neurotoxicity of HAART in combination with AVD and brentuximab vedotin.

      VIII. To evaluate effect of AVD and brentuximab vedotin on viral load after cycle 1, 4, at
      the completion of therapy, and every 3 months after treatment completion for one year.

      IX. To perform pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity studies to determine drug levels during
      therapy.

      X. To perform micro ribonucleic acid (miRNA) profile analysis on the HIV-HL tumor specimens
      and to correlate miRNA expression with OS, PFS, tumor response to therapy, histologic
      subtype of HIV-HL, and HIV disease characteristics.

      XI. To perform tissue microarray analysis on HIV-HL tumor specimens and to correlate the
      markers studied with OS, PFS, and tumor response to therapy.

      XII. To identify Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated tumor derived deoxyribonucleic acid
      (DNA) in the plasma of study patients and to correlate these levels during therapy with
      disease response and OS. (Phase II) XIII. To identify cytokines in the plasma of patients
      during therapy that can be used as tumor and prognostic markers. (Phase II) XIV. To assess
      latent and expressed HIV reservoirs before, during, and post chemotherapy. To understand how
      cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents affect HIV expression.

      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of brentuximab vedotin followed by a phase
      II study.

      Patients receive doxorubicin hydrochloride intravenously (IV), vinblastine sulfate IV, and
      dacarbazine IV on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive brentuximab vedotin IV over 30
      minutes on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 courses in the absence
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years and
      then every 6 months for 3 years.

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by any federally approved, licensed HIV rapid test
             performed in conjunction with screening (or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay [ELISA]
             test kit and confirmed by Western blot or other approved test); a measurable HIV
             viral load alone is not sufficient for documentation of the diagnosis of HIV;
             alternatively, this documentation may include a record that another physician has
             documented that the participant has HIV infection based on prior ELISA and western
             blot, or other approved diagnostic tests

          -  Histologic diagnosis of CD30-positive classical HL as defined by the 2008 World
             Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Hematological diseases; nodular

          -  Stage II, III or IV disease as defined by the Ann Arbor Staging System

          -  Participants must have previously untreated HIV-classical HL (cHL), with the
             exception of up to 14 consecutive days of steroids or 1 prior cycle of
             cyclophosphamide to reduce tumor burden and improve hyperbilirubinemia in the setting
             of lymphoma related liver involvement

          -  Normal baseline cardiac ejection fraction &gt;= 50%

          -  Serum creatinine of =&lt; 1.5 mg/dL; if creatinine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL, creatinine clearance
             must be &gt;= 60 mL/minute

          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt;= 1000/uL

          -  A direct bilirubin level of =&lt; 2.0 mg/dL; if, however, the elevated bilirubin is felt
             to be secondary to antiretroviral therapy, the total bilirubin must be =&lt; 3.5 mg/dL,
             provided that the direct bilirubin is normal and the aspartate aminotransferase (AST)
             and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) =&lt; 3 x the upper limit of normal; also, if the
             elevated bilirubin is thought to be secondary to cHL the patients should not be
             excluded from study participation

          -  Female subjects must have a negative pregnancy test within 1 week of enrollment and
             all subjects must agree to use two reliable methods of contraception simultaneously
             if conception is possible during the study; should a woman subject become pregnant or
             suspect she is pregnant while the subject is participating in this study, she should
             inform her treating physician immediately; the patient will then be removed from
             protocol therapy; subjects who father a child while participating in the study will
             be permitted to continue with the protocol; the subject, however, is required to
             notify the investigator if he fathers a child

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document

          -  Karnofsky performance status &gt; 30% (given the aggressiveness of this disease and the

          -  Measurable or non-measurable (evaluable) tumor parameter(s); non-measurable tumor
             parameters will be defined as not having bi-dimensional measurements (i.e., gastric
             or marrow involvement) but can be followed for response by other diagnostic tests
             such as gallium, PET imaging and/or bone marrow biopsy

          -  Patients already receiving erythropoietin or granulocyte colony stimulating factor
             (GCSF) for treatment of HIV-related cytopenia are eligible

          -  CD4 count &gt;= 50 cells/ul

          -  Subjects are required to be on antiretroviral regimens that are in accordance with

             guidelines concurrently with chemotherapy; the specific agents are at the discretion
             of the Investigator and the use of investigational agents currently available on an
             expanded access basis is allowed; use of experimental antiretroviral agents or those
             containing zidovudine (including Combivir and Trizivir) or ritonavir (including
             Kaletra), cobicistat or similar potent cytochrome P450 (CYP)3 inhibitors are
             prohibited; in order to be eligible, patients taking zidovudine or ritonavir, or
             cobicistat or other CYP3 inhibitors must change to a different regimen 7 days prior
             to therapy initiation; changes to HAART during the study may be made if medically
             necessary (toxicity, failure of regimen, etc.); subjects must be on HAART at least 7
             days prior to therapy

          -  Patients will be required to obtain a pulmonary function test, despite the exclusion
             of bleomycin from protocol regimen; the subject's diffusing capacity of the lung for
             carbon monoxide (DLCO) adjusted for hemoglobin must be greater than 70% predicted to
             enter the study and to continue with brentuximab vedotin

          -  Negative for hepatitis B, or infected with hepatitis B, receiving anti-hepatitis B
             therapy; all subjects will be required to be screened for hepatitis B; per Infectious
             Disease Society of America (IDSA) and American Association for the Study of Liver
             Diseases (AASLD) guidelines, those subjects that show no immunity, defined by the
             lack of hepatitis B surface antigen antibody, and show evidence of chronic infection
             (i.e. hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg]+, HBcore+, HBsAB-) will be required to be
             on anti-hepatitis B therapy, during the study, in order to be eligible; patients will
             be permitted to enroll in the study provided normal liver function tests and no
             evidence of cirrhosis; the exact hepatitis B therapy will be at the discretion of the
             infection disease specialist or investigator; however all patients who present with
             acute hepatitis B or show normal transaminases and are HBsAg+ and immunoglobulin M
             (IgM)+ for hepatitis core antigen will not be eligible for trial enrollment

          -  Patients diagnosed with hepatitis C who are hepatitis C antibody positive, whether
             hepatitis C RNA level is measurable or not, must have no evidence of cirrhosis

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients with prior anthracycline therapy will be excluded

          -  Female subjects who are pregnant or breast-feeding; confirmation that the subject is
             not pregnant must be established by a negative serum beta (b)-human chorionic
