            "textblock": "Intravenous (IV) tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) administration has been shown to be safe\n      and effective for treatment of AIS within 3 hours of symptom onset, and newer evidence has\n      shown potential benefit out to 4.5 hours.  IAT for AIS patients has been shown in clinical\n      trials to be safe up to 8 hours after symptom onset.  The rapid progression of IAT devices\n      over the last several years has resulted in faster recanalization times while maintaining a\n      high degree of safety.  This has resulted in improved patient outcomes, similar to prior\n      randomized trial data showing improved outcomes over medical therapy or earlier devices.\n      Data from the MERCI trial suggests that patients > 85 as well as those with a baseline NIHSS\n      score > 30 are unlikely to benefit from embolectomy. Patients with rapidly improving\n      neurologic deficits likely will have an excellent recovery with conventional care,\n      precluding the ability to detect a beneficial treatment effect of embolectomy.\n\n      Pilot data incorporating physiologic imaging has shown that appropriate patients can be\n      selected for IAT.  This selection methodology has shown the ability to maintain the same\n      level of safety and efficacy as those patients treated in the highly selective environment\n      of a clinical trial, despite presenting far beyond accepted time based standards.\n      Vertebrobasilar occlusion patients are excluded to maintain a homogenous study population,\n      particularly since no data currently is available addressing the comparability of imaging\n      penumbral patterns in the anterior vs. posterior circulation.  This has also been shown to\n      be reproducible at multiple centers and with different imaging modalities. However, all\n      prospective interventional stroke studies performed to date have been restricted by the 8\n      hour time window.  Currently there are no active studies assessing the safety and efficacy\n      of IAT for patients presenting outside of the IV-tPA selection window when selected by\n      physiologic imaging.\n\n      The primary aim of acute ischemic stroke treatment is restoring a patient that is severely\n      neurologically impaired due to a blockage of a major brain blood vessel back to their\n      previous functional status. Identification and selection of appropriate patients is always\n      paramount to good clinical outcomes.  Evidence supports the safety of IAT for patients\n      presenting with AIS within 8 hours.  Pilot data support IAT in some patients after 8 hours\n      based on selection using physiological perfusion imaging.\n\n      The purpose of this randomized trial is to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of mechanical\n      thrombectomy over medical therapy (MT) for treating acute ischemic stroke patients\n      ineligible for IV-tPA with persistent symptoms within a 12 hour time window from symptom\n      onset as selected by physiologic perfusion imaging criteria."
