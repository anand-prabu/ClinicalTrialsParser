Drugs used in\n      chemotherapy, work in different ways to stop tumor cells from dividing so they stop growing\n      or die. Steroid therapy decreases inflammation. Combining chemotherapy and steroid therapy\n      with immunoglobulin may be effective in treating abnormal muscle movement associated with\n      neuroblastoma.  Chemotherapy(cyclophosphamide), prednisone and intravenous gamma globulin\n      all suppress the immune system which may be helpful in treating opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia\n      (OMA)."

Determine if immunosuppressive therapy with cyclophosphamide and prednisone is an\n      effective therapy for neuroblastoma associated opsoclonus-myoclonus-ataxia (OMA) and can\n      constitute a back-bone therapy upon which to build additional therapy.\n\n      II. Determine in a randomized study if the addition of intravenous gammaglobulin therapy to\n      the back-bone therapy of prednisone and cyclophosphamide improves response of neuroblastoma\n      associated OMA.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Determine if intravenous gammaglobulin therapy improves the motor coordination of\n      children diagnosed with neuroblastoma and presenting with OMA syndrome as assessed by\n      neurological examination and the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS).\n\n      II. Determine these regimens improve functional outcome in these patients. III. Investigate\n      the biology of neuroblastoma associated OMA, with specific regard to magnetic resonance\n      imaging (MRI) findings, anti-neuronal antibodies, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings and\n      tumor biology.\n\n      IV. Define better the long-term prognosis for neurologic recovery in the child with\n      neuroblastoma associated with OMA syndrome.\n\n      V.
