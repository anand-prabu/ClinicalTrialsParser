Unfortunately these\n      criteria only seem to select approximately 70% of the patients who might respond to this\n      invasive therapy. Body surface ECG mapping is a new technique that assesses the electrical\n      activation of the heart in more detail than the standard ECG. This study aims to determine\n      whether this new technology may aid current selection criteria in predicting response to\n      CRT."
