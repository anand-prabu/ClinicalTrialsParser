  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with malignant melanoma which has spread beyond the local area
      and cannot be surgically removed, and who have melanoma tumors that are accessible for
      repeat biopsies. This research study is a way of gaining new knowledge about treatment
      options for metastatic melanoma. This research study is evaluating the effects of a drug
      called vemurafenib on the immune system.

      Vemurafenib has been approved by the FDA for treatment of patients with advanced melanoma
      that harbors a B-RAF mutation. Vemurafenib works by blocking a protein called B-RAF.
      Researchers have found that a large number of melanomas have mutations (changes) in the BRAF
      gene. Genes are specific parts of your DNA that contain information on hereditary
      characteristics such as hair color and eye color. The BRAF gene codes for a protein called
      B-RAF, which is involved in sending signals in cells that can lead to cell growth. Research
      has determined that mutations in the BRAF gene at the V600 position cause a change in the
      B-RAF protein that can drive the growth and spread of melanoma cells.

      The purpose of this research study is to determine how vemurafenib may alter the immune
      system's reaction to melanoma, in order to learn how best to combine immune therapies with
      vemurafenib in the future.

    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, multicenter study of vemurafenib in patients with biopsy-accessible
      advanced metastatic melanoma.

      The trial will consist of a screening period, a treatment phase, and one post-study
      follow-up visit occurring about 30 days after the last dose of vemurafenib. Day 1 of the
      study will be defined as the first day a subject receives vemurafenib. During the treatment
      phase, all study assessments will be conducted on Day 1 (Â± 3 days) of each cycle, with the
      exception of computed tomography (CT) and/or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which should
      occur every 6 weeks (+/- 7 days).

      All subjects will have biopsies performed of safely accessible tumors before starting
      treatment and at 1, 2, and 4 weeks later (days 8, 15, 29). In addition, any patient with
      accessible tumor at the time of progression will have a tumor biopsy performed at that time.

      Mixed-effects models will be used to study the change in CD8 T cell counts per mm2 of
      tissue, changes in expression of immunoinhibitory proteins (B7-H1/PD-L1, IDO, arginase), and
      changes in endothelial homing receptor ligands and tumor associated chemokines at
      pre-treatment at pre-treatment and at weeks 1, 2, and 4 after vemurafenib therapy. Subjects
      will be treated as random effects to account for individual variability. Potential
      covariates are age, gender, and ECOG performance status.

      60 ml of blood for lymphocytes will be drawn on days 1, 8, 15, and 29.
