Eight participants (including at least 2 women) will be enrolled and\n      receive 2 treatments: PCI-32765 840 mg will be administered as capsule (Treatment A in\n      Period 1) and solution (Treatment B in Period 2) formulations. All participants will receive\n      both treatments with a 7-day washout period between doses. A high-fat breakfast will be\n      provided 2 hours before dosing. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a\n      drug) samples will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after each dose and safety\n      will be monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be\n      approximately 46 days."
