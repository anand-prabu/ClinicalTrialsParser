            "textblock": "There is evidence that the magnitude of the placebo effect produced by a device is greater\n      than that produced by a pill. If this is the case, it has significant ramifications for all\n      trials involving devices and for our understanding of the role of the placebo effect in\n      randomized controlled trials (RCT). This two phase study 1)investigates the role of the\n      placebo effect in RCT's and 2)conducts two trials of treatments for persistent upper\n      extremity pain secondary to repetitive strain injury (RSI), including carpel tunnel\n      syndrome. In Phase I. 240 patients with RSI are randomly assigned to receive a placebo\n      device (a recently validated sham acupuncture device) or a placebo pill (dummy\n      amitriptyline). Our primary hypothesis is that patients will respond better to the sham\n      device than the placebo pill. A finding that sham acupuncture produces a greater placebo\n      response than a placebo pill has important implications for the interpretation of results in\n      trials that compare devices  to sham devices, devices to pills, and medical management to\n      surgery. Phase II randomly assigns patients from the sham acupuncture arm of Phase I to\n      receive either TCA or continue to receive the sham version. Patients in the placebo pill arm\n      of Phase I will be randomly assigned to receive either AMI or continue receiving the placebo\n      pill. From the patients'perspective, the shift in treatment assignment from Phase I to II\n      should not be noticeable. Phase II will allow us to test whether the active treatments\n      outperform their respective placebos. Both of these treatments have shown promise in small\n      studies, but neither has been prospectively studied in a large trial with appropriate\n      controls. Because Phase I also functions as a run-in period for Phase II, analysis combining\n      both phases will allow us to examine whether a run-in has methodological advantages in a\n      device trial. Moreover, combined analyses permit testing whether patients level of response\n      to placebo in Phase I affects their response to active treatment Phase II. A positive\n      finding here would contribute importantly to our understanding of the role of the placebo in\n      RCTs."
