Colony-stimulating factors such as GM-CSF increase the number\n      of immune cells found in bone marrow or peripheral blood.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of HER-2/neu vaccine plus GM-CSF in\n      treating patients who have stage III or stage IV breast cancer, stage III or stage IV\n      ovarian cancer, or stage III or stage IV non-small cell lung cancer."

Determine the safety of serial intradermal vaccinations of HER-2/neu derived\n      peptides with sargramostim (GM-CSF) as an adjuvant in patients with stage III or IV\n      HER-2/neu expressing breast, ovarian, or nonsmall cell lung cancer. II. Determine whether\n      immunity can be elicited with peptides derived from the intracellular domain of the\n      HER-2/neu protein. III. Determine whether immunity can be elicited with peptides derived\n      from the extracellular domain of the HER-2/neu protein. IV. Determine whether cytotoxic T\n      cells specific for the HER-2/neu protein can be elicited in patients with HLA-A2 by\n      immunization with peptides derived from the HER-2/neu protein.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive one of three HER-2/neu peptide vaccine formulations that also\n      contain sargramostim (GM-CSF) as the vaccine adjuvant. Each vaccine is studied in 20\n      patients. A maximum of 3 patients receive a vaccine each month for 6 months to monitor the\n      potential toxicity associated with sequential immunizations. Patients receive a follow-up\n      evaluation 1 month after the last vaccination. Those patients who have an immune response\n      related to the vaccine will continue to have immunologic evaluations performed every 2\n      months while immune responses can still be detected.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 60 patients will be accrued."
