            "textblock": "Aims of the study:\n\n      The primary purpose of this double blind study is to determine in individuals with\n      pre-diabetes (IGT, impaired glucose tolerance; or IFG, impaired fasting glucose) and\n      drug-na\u00efve type 2 diabetes whether ARA 290 reduces disease activity by improving oral\n      glucose tolerance, and insulin secretion, and thereby improves long-term glucose control.\n\n      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the effects of ARA 290 on insulin sensitivity; serum\n      levels of inflammatory agents, e.g. cytokine levels; serum levels of gluco-regulatory\n      hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucagon; and safety by registering\n      reported adverse events, and by monitoring clinical chemistry parameters related to\n      hematology, kidney function, liver function and lipid levels.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to\n      evaluate the effects of ARA 290 on glucose homeostasis in persons with pre-diabetes or\n      early, dietary treated type 2 diabetes.  The trial has two parallel arms with 12 subjects in\n      each group, and with a 4-week-intervention period.  At screening, a baseline investigation\n      will include a physical examination and the following tests: oral glucose tolerance test\n      (OGTT), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c).\n\n      The investigational medicinal product (ARA 290, 4.0 mg) or placebo will be self-administered\n      by a once daily injection s.c. for 28 days.  Participating subjects meeting inclusion\n      criteria, and not fulfilling any exclusion criterion on screening, will be randomized\n      double-blind within one week following screening 1:1 to either treatment with ARA 290 or\n      with placebo. Before the first treatment, serum for determination of cytokines, adipokines,\n      and hormones will be collected. Participants will be investigated further with OGTT, HbA1c\n      and clinical assessment after 2 weeks and at study end, after 4 weeks. They should also\n      perform a self-monitoring blood glucose (SMBG) curve once weekly during the treatment\n      period, e.g., altogether 6 blood glucose tests during one day.  Four weeks after the last\n      dose, patients will return for HbA1c and fasting blood glucose levels.\n\n      The primary endpoint of the study is to test whether there is a significant difference\n      between persons receiving ARA 290 vs. persons receiving placebo in: glucose tolerance,\n      evaluated by OGTT at baseline, and after 2 and 4 weeks. . The secondary endpoints of the\n      study include effects of ARA 290 on: insulin sensitivity, evaluated by HOMA-IR (homeostasis\n      model assessment of insulin resistance); insulin secretion, examined both by measuring the\n      early insulin response (at 15 and 30 min) in OGTT, and using the HOMA-beta (homeostasis\n      model assessment of beta cell function); and long-term glucose control, determined as\n      glycosylated hemoglobin, HbA1c; assessment of serum levels of inflammatory agents, e.g.\n      cytokine levels; serum levels of gluco-regulatory hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1\n      (GLP-1), and glucagon; and safety by registering reported adverse events, and by monitoring\n      clinical chemistry parameters related to hematology, kidney function, liver function and\n      lipid levels.\n\n      Patients:\n\n      24 patients will be enrolled in one single center; 12 patients will be administered ARA 290\n      active ingredient product as daily doses for 28 days, and 12 patients will be administered a\n      placebo as daily doses for 28 days. Individuals with IGT (impaired glucose tolerance), IFG\n      (impaired fasting glucose) or drug-na\u00efve type 2 diabetes will be included in the study. The\n      population will consist of individuals of either gender, males aged 40-75 years; women aged\n      50-75 years and menopausal."
