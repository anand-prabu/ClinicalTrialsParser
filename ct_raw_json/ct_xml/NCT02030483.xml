    <textblock>
      Our hypothesis is that treating relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma with PD 0332991
      (Palbociclib) in combination with lenalidomide will result will be both effectively inducing
      myeloma plasma cell death as well maintaining a favorable side effect profile.

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is for men and women with multiple myeloma that has returned after
      treatment (relapsed) or did not respond to prior treatment (refractory).

      This is a phase 1 study of the addition of the PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) CDK4/CDK6 inhibitor
      to lenalidomide / dexamethasone treatment in RRMM. The purpose of the study is to determine
      the effectiveness of the combination of PD 0332991, lenalidomide and dexamethasone (PLD) in
      treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma. PD 0332991 (Palbociclib) is an experimental
      drug and is a pill taken by mouth. It works by blocking specific growth signals within
      cancer cells. Lenalidomide (also called Revlimid) is approved for use with dexamethasone for
      people with multiple myeloma who have received prior therapy. Study participants will
      receive different doses of Palbociclib and lenalidomide depending on when they enroll in the
      study. The study will help determine the maximum tolerated dose of the combination of the
      study drugs. Treatment schedule (treatment cycles are 28 days):

        -  Palbociclib daily for Days 1-14 of each cycle

        -  Lenalidomide daily for Days 8-21 (or Days 1-21, depending on dose level) of each cycle

        -  Dexamethasone on Days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each cycle. Participants will continue on
           study treatment as long as they are responding to therapy and not experiencing
           unacceptable side effects.
