Patients were recruited in the regions Basel,\n      Aargau-Solothurn, Waadt in Switzerland and randomised using 1:1 block randomisation.\n\n      Primary outcome focuses on the improvement of adherence and persistence after\n      'Polymedication Check' (using medication possession ratio (MPR), gaps in medicines history\n      records and patient's interviews).\n\n      Second outcomes are time to planned or unplanned consulting with a physician or\n      hospitalisation, knowledge, safety of medicines use and patients management of polypharmacy."
