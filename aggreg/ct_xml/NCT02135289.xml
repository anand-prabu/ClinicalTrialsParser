  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of inflammatory bowel disease is rising in Hong Kong. Anti-tumor necrosis
      factor alpha (anti-TNF)-α is effective and increasingly being used for the treatment of
      patients with refractory disease and complicated disease behaviour. The reactivation of
      latent tuberculosis (TB) is a well-recognised complication associated with the use of
      anti-TNF therapy, and most cases occurred in endemic regions. Hong Kong is a region of
      intermediate TB burden, and the reactivation of latent TB in IBD patients treated with
      anti-TNF can be a serious problem. Screening has been shown to reduce the incidence of TB,
      but it remains unclear whether monitoring during anti-TNF therapy is effective. Despite
      reported efficacy with the current screening strategy, active TB developed in up to 11.4% of
      patients receiving anti-TNF therapy. There is therefore an urgent need for better disease
      monitoring and prevention, particularly in regions where TB is endemic. This study aims to
      investigate the role of IGRA in screening for latent TB in IBD patients and control subjects
