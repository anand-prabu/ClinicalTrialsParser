  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current protocol pertains to the evaluation of the interactive computer-assisted
      screening (iCAS) tool through a pilot randomized control trial. The purpose of this
      evaluation is to determine the efficacy of the iCAS tool in improving clinician's detection
      of common mental health conditions (i.e. major depression/generalized anxiety/post-traumatic
      stress disorder/alcohol dependence), and patients' discussion on mental health.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The iCAS tool is a health-risk assessment survey that is completed by adult patients using
      touch-screen iPad device in their waiting time before seeing their clinician (family
      physician or nurse practitioner). The computer program generates tailored risk-report for
      the clinician and a simple recommendation sheet for the patient, with community resources
      and health information, at the point of care. The iCAS tool currently includes validated
      screening scales for depression, generalized anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and
      alcohol abuse. There are some questions on the social determinants of mental health as well.
      The current versions of the tool are in English and Spanish; a Chinese language version will
      also be developed.
