            "textblock": "Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB) is a rare group of inherited disorders that manifest as\n      blistering or erosion of the skin and in some cases, the epithelial lining of other organs,\n      in response to little or no apparent trama.  There is a lack of effective agents for skin\n      disorders involving blistering and lesion formation.  Current approved therapies are\n      minimally effective and have safety issues.  Scioderm has developed SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%)\n      for treatment of EB.\n\n      This is an open label extension study to assess the continued safety of topically applied\n      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) in subjects with Simplex, Recessive Dystrophic, and Junctional\n      non-Herlitz Epidermolysis Bullosa.\n\n      SD-101 Dermal Cream (6%) will be applied topically, once a day to the entire body for a\n      period of 450 days.  Subjects who successfully complete the entire SD-003 study will have\n      the option to roll over into the SD-004 study.  The baseline visit 1 will occur at the final\n      visit date for SD-003.  The Body Surface Area (BSA) coverage of blisters and lesions\n      assessment made at the final SD-003 study visit will be used as the baseline information at\n      visit 1 for the SD-004 study.  The subject will return to the study site for visits 2, 3, 4,\n      5, 6, and 7 (at 14, 90, 180, 270, 360, 450 days respectively) to have BSA assessed.  For\n      female subjects of childbearing potential, a urine pregnancy test will be performed at\n      visits 4, 6, and 7."
