Increasing the number of times a CT scan is given may improve the\n      ability to detect stage I testicular cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized clinical trial to determine if there is a different result from two\n      different schedules of CT scans in treating patients with stage I testicular cancer after\n      undergoing orchiectomy."

Patients are stratified by center and\n      presence of vascular invasion.\n\n      After orchidectomy, patients are randomized into two schedules (arms I and II) of CT scan\n      follow up.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients repeat chest and abdominal CT scans no later than 3 months after\n           orchidectomy and again at 12 months to confirm that the patient is clear of disease.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients repeat chest and abdominal CT scans at 3, 6, 9, 12, and 24 months\n           after orchidectomy.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for the first year after orchidectomy, then every 2 months for\n      the second year, then every 3 months for the third year, and then every 4-6 months\n      thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: There will be 400-900 patients accrued into this study over 3-6 years."
