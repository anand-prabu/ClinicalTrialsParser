  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, Interactive Research and Development (IRD) in Karachi, Pakistan is evaluating
      the impact of Interactive Reminders on drug compliance and treatment outcomes.  Interactive
      Reminders is an interactive SMS reminder system to help patients remember to take their TB
      medication.  In this system, patients receive daily SMS reminders for the duration of their
      treatment at a pre-specified time, reminding them to take their medication. Patients are
      asked to reply back to the system, either through SMS or a missed call, with the time they
      took their medicine that day.  If a response is not received within two hours, a second
      reminder is sent.  If a response is still not received in a further two hours, a third and
      final reminder for the day is sent.  Non-responsive patients are followed up with phone
      calls and a list of non-responsive patients is shared with clinics based on the parameters
      of non-responsiveness that they specify.

      IRD seeks to determine the impact of this system on treatment outcomes and compliance to
      prescribed medication through administering a randomized control trial among newly diagnosed
      TB patients in Karachi, Pakistan.

    <description>The regularity of treatment will be measured using urinalysis tests that detect the presence of isoniazid or rifampacin, a first line drug for TB treatment, in patients' urine. These results will be collected through monthly &quot;surprise&quot; visits to the participants' houses. The number of negative results will be compared between treatment and control groups.</description>

    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>The investigators will measure physical fitness and mobility through questionnaires conducted with patients during household visits each month that they are on treatment.  The investigators are using two indices.  The physical fitness index will record respondents ability to perform certain tasks.  The mobility index will record the mobility of participants.</description>

    <time_frame>Monthly visits for 6 to 8 months of treatment</time_frame>
    <safety_issue>No</safety_issue>
    <description>In order to gauge the psychological impacts of the system, the investigators will be looking at participants' perceptions on the likelihood of being cured, how they feel on a given day using the pain scale, and  how supported they feel.  This data will be collected through questionnaires conducted at each monthly mid-line visit.</description>
