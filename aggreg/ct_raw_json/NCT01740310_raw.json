While participants are completing the handheld/electronic tablet device-based intervention, the study recruiter will observe them and document dose exposure to the messages being presented. The enrolled women will be contacted a month after the expected date of delivery and a follow up interview will be conducted to ascertain their vaccination status for receipt of influenza vaccine in pregnancy and Tdap during pregnancy or immediately post-partum.",
