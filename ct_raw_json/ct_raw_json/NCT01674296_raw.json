In the\n      present study we will describe the relative contributions of individual psychology and\n      physiology (including metabolism, mood, and sleep habits) and external (season, stressors)\n      contributions to changes in adiposity over a year in free-living individuals.\n\n      This study will illuminate season's role in changes in energy balance related behaviors and\n      body weight and composition. Ultimately, this information will be used to identify factors\n      affecting food consumption and individual activity during seasonal periods to help to\n      segment interventions for obesity prevention in mid-life women."

To identify seasonal changes in %BF of mid-life women.\n\n           Participant's percentage of body fat will fluctuate, and will be highest at the end of\n           the winter season and lowest at the end of the summer season.\n\n        2. To describe predictors of seasonal changes in %BF.\n\n      There will be no intervention other than frequent monitoring of food consumption, individual\n      activity and individual- level factors thought to influence food consumption and activity\n      such as dietary restraint, subjective stress, sleep quality and duration, and physiological\n      stress as measured by allostatic load. The volunteers will be asked to complete a 7-day\n      activity and energy expenditure monitoring period (along with body composition assessment,\n      questionnaires regarding individual factors thought to affect food consumption and activity,\n      blood draw and urine collection to measure allostatic load) in each of the four seasons over\n      a 12-month period; between monitoring periods they will come to the GFHNRC for measurement\n      of weight, skin carotenoids for assessment of fruit and vegetable intake, and to provide a\n      morning urine sample monthly (8 times), and receive emails reminding them to log on to a\n      secure server and complete a 24-hr recall 3 times a month (36 times during the year).\n\n      The ASA-24 will be administered to assess nutritional intake; Actigraph GT3X+, Actitrainer,\n      and QStarz GPS logger will be used to assess physical activity.  Physiological stress will\n      be assessed using the allostatic load index."

Typical weight maintenance behaviors are not an\n             exclusion criterion.\n\n          -  Pregnant, lactating, or planning pregnancy.\n\n          -  Travel plans that do not permit full participation.\n\n          -  Inability to walk without assistance.
