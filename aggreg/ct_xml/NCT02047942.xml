  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular diseases are the main cause of death worldwide. Aerobic fitness is related to
      long-term survival and a reduction in mortality and recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction
      in subjects with cardiovascular disease. However, the majority of cardiac patients do not
      engage in enough physical activity to obtain benefits or in the long-term struggle to
      maintain a physically active lifestyle. There is a need for innovative rehabilitation
      methods aiming at increasing longer-term adherence and hence more sustained effects on
      health related physical fitness. One strategy might be the use of home-based training in
      combination of telemonitoring guidance. Therefore, the main objective of this randomized
      controlled clinical trial is to compare the longer-term (=1 year) effects of a 3-month
      supervised center-based rehabilitation program with a patient-tailored home-based cardiac
      rehabilitation program with telemonitoring guidance in CAD patients (phase III). The primary
      outcome measure  is physical fitness.  It is hypothesized that patients randomized to a
      home-based training program with telemonitoring guidance will demonstrate higher levels of
      physical activity at one year of follow-up, resulting in higher levels of physical fitness,
      compared to patients who have been enrolled to the supervised center-based cardiac
      rehabilitation program or control group. Ninety patients will be randomized to Home-based
      training, a center-based cardiac rehabilitation program or an advice only group (= control
      group). Assessment will be performed at baseline, immediately at completion of the
      intervention and at one-year of follow-up and will include measurements of exercise
      tolerance, cardiovascular risk factors, physical activity, muscle strength, endothelial
      function, health-related quality.
