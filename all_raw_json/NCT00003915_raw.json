Androgens can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.\n      Hormone therapy using bicalutamide and leuprolide may fight prostate cancer by reducing the\n      production of androgens.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel\n      and estramustine plus hormone therapy in treating patients who have previously undergone\n      radiation therapy or surgical removal of the prostate for stage I prostate cancer."

Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for 4 courses.\n\n      Patients receive oral bicalutamide daily beginning on week 12 and leuprolide intramuscularly\n      every 3 months beginning on week 13. Treatment continues for 15 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months for 2 years, every 4 months for 1 year, and every 6\n      months thereafter until disease progression and/or subsequently until death.  Information\n      will be collected on subsequent prostate cancer treatments, time to and nature of first\n      evidence of metastatic prostate cancer, and the date and cause of death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 55 patients will be accrued for this study."
