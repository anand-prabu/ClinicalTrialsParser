II. Determine the\n      toxic effects of this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the pharmacokinetics of this\n      regimen in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients receive oral thalidomide on day 1. Treatment continues daily for 6 months\n      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with complete or\n      partial response or stable disease after 6 months of treatment may continue treatment for an\n      additional 6 months. Patients are followed at 1, 6, and 12 months.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 15-25 evaluable patients will be accrued for this study within\n      3.75-6.25 months."
