            "textblock": "Genomics research is advancing rapidly, and links between genes and obesity continue to be\n      discovered and better defined. A growing number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in\n      multiple genes have been shown to alter an individual's response to dietary macronutrient\n      composition. Based on prior genetic studies evaluating the body's physiological responses to\n      dietary carbohydrates or fats, the investigators identified multi-locus genotype patterns\n      with SNPs from three genes (FABP2, PPARG, and ADRB2): a low carbohydrate-responsive genotype\n      (LCG) and a low fat-responsive genotype (LFG). In a preliminary, retrospective study (using\n      the A TO Z weight loss study data), the investigators observed a 3-fold difference in\n      12-month weight loss for initially overweight women who were determined to have been\n      appropriately matched vs. mismatched to a low carbohydrate (Low Carb) or low fat (Low Fat)\n      diet based on their multi-locus genotype pattern. The primary objective of this study is to\n      confirm and expand on the preliminary results and determine if weight loss success can be\n      increased if the dietary approach (Low Carb vs. Low Fat) is appropriately matched to an\n      individual' s genetic predisposition (Low Carb Genotype vs. Low Fat Genotype) toward those\n      diets."

Commensurate\n      with increasing scientific interest in personalized medicine approaches to intervention\n      development, this would provide an example of the potentially substantial health impacts\n      that could be obtained through understanding specific gene-environment interactions that\n      have been anticipated from the unraveling of the human genome."
