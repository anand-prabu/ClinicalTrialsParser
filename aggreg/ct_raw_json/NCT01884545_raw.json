In short, using a 4-group (2X2) randomized controlled trial\n      (RCT) design, this study will determine whether incorporating multiple-marker genetic\n      testing into risk counseling for CHD and T2D, coupled with a health coaching intervention\n      will lead to greater changes in physical fitness, health behaviors, risk status and clinical\n      outcomes in active-duty Air Force (ADAF), beneficiaries or dependents and AF retiree\n      patients (N=400).\n\n      The study will address the following task objectives:\n\n        1. Determine the main and interactive effects of multiple-marker genetic risk information\n           incorporated into standard CHD and T2D risk counseling (Standard Risk Assessment, or\n           SRA) and an established, structured telephonic health coaching intervention on health\n           behavior change (diet, exercise habits, smoking cessation) over 12 months, with a focus\n           on ADAF patients, as well as their beneficiaries and retirees.\n\n        2. Determine the main and interactive effects of genetic risk information incorporated\n           into standard CHD and T2D risk counseling and a telephonic health coaching intervention\n           on clinical outcomes (fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, LDL, triglycerides,\n           total cholesterol, AF composite fitness scores) over 12 months in this AF cohort.\n\n           Given the lack of RCTs on the effects of differing genetic test results, such as false\n           reassurance and genetic determinism, we will also pursue a third, exploratory task\n           objective:\n\n        3. Examine the differential effects of level of CHD and T2D genetic risk (# of risk\n           alleles) on behavior change (diet, exercise habits, smoking cessation) and AF fitness\n           scores at 12 months post baseline.\n\n      Baseline data collection: After screening and informed consent, height and weight, SBP,\n      waist circumference, current lab results (FPG, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL, HbA1c,\n      and HDL) and current PHA (physical health assessment) data with fitness scores ( for active\n      duty personnel only) will be obtained from the medical records. Subjects randomized to the\n      two genetic arms will have blood collected for testing of investigational CHD and T2D risk\n      markers.\n\n      Randomization will take place to one of the following: SRA only; SRA plus genetic risk\n      information (SRA+G); SRA plus health coaching (SRA+HC); or SRA, genetic risk information,\n      and health coaching (SRA+G+HC).\n\n      Risk Counseling Visit: Within four weeks after the baseline visit all participants will\n      receive risk counseling with trained provider(s) at each clinic site.\n\n      Health coaching intervention: Participants in the two groups that include health coaching\n      will be assigned to a trained health coach for a period of 6 months (n=200). IHC\n      (Integrative Health Coaching) sessions will be provided by telephone using a structure that\n      has evolved in multiple trials and clinical programs at Duke Integrative Medicine.\n\n      Six week, 3-, and 6-month follow-ups: At 6 weeks, 3 months and 6 months after the baseline\n      visit, participants will be asked to complete selected surveys online.\n\n      6month and 12 month study visits: 12 months from the baseline visit, active duty\n      participants will complete their annual PHA, required annual AF fitness testing; and all\n      participants will complete study visits at 6 and 12 months for weight, waist circumference,\n      BP, fasting glucose or HbA1c and lipid panels to be re-assessed. Surveys will be completed\n      at or prior to the final 12 month visit as well."
