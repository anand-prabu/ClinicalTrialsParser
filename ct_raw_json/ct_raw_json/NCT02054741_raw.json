To determine if providing information regarding geriatric assessment (GA) and GA-driven\n      recommendations to oncologists reduces clinician-rated grade 3-5 chemotherapy toxicity in\n      patients aged 70 and over with advanced cancer undergoing first-line chemotherapy.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Proportion of patients who are alive at 6 months after study entry. II. Evaluate whether\n      providing oncologists with information regarding GA and GA-driven recommendations influences\n      clinical care of older patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for advanced cancer.\n\n      III. Compare chemotherapy treatment decisions (as measured by relative dose intensity of\n      chemotherapy administered in the first cycle).\n\n      IV. Compare the number and type of GA-driven recommendations implemented for older patients\n      receiving first line chemotherapy for advanced cancer.\n\n      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To determine whether providing oncologists with GA information and GA-driven\n      recommendations can slow functional and physical decline in older patients with advanced\n      cancer.\n\n      II. To examine the association between patient-reported symptoms (as measured by\n      Patient-Reported Outcomes [PRO]-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]) and\n      geriatric domains (as measured by geriatric assessment).\n\n      III. To compare PRO-CTCAE and physician-rated CTCAE in a sample of older patients receiving\n      first line chemotherapy.\n\n      IV. To examine the association between PRO-CTCAE and chemotherapy decisions. V. To examine\n      the association between PRO-CTCAE and adverse outcomes (early discontinuation of\n      chemotherapy, hospitalizations, and mortality).\n\n      OUTLINE: Treatment sites are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.\n\n      ARM I (GA intervention): Patients complete a geriatric assessment. Patients and physicians\n      are provided with the geriatric assessment information and recommendations.\n\n      ARM II (usual care): Patients complete a geriatric assessment, but information other than\n      clinically significant cognitive impairment and depression is not provided to the oncology\n      teams.\n\n      After completion of study, patients are followed up at 4-6 weeks, at 3 and 6 months, and at\n      1 year."
