This study will accomplish that overarching goal through addressing two specific\n      aims.\n\n      Aim 1.  Triple P's Effect on Pediatric Resident's Practice:  test the effect of Triple P\n      training on practice of pediatric residents in addressing and managing psychosocial\n      problems.\n\n      Hypothesis 1: At the completion of the trial, residents assigned to the intervention group,\n      compared to residents exposed to the control condition, will have:\n\n        1. increased skill levels,\n\n        2. increased confidence, and\n\n        3. increased satisfaction in dealing with and managing psychosocial issues\n\n      Aim 2. Triple P's Effect on Parent and Child Outcomes: test the effect of Triple P\n      interventions on parent's feelings of self efficacy, parent's discipline strategies and on\n      children's externalizing behavior.\n\n      Hypothesis 2:  At the completion of the intervention, parents and children receiving the\n      intervention, compared to those receiving the control condition, will have:\n\n        1. greater reduction in targeted child behavior problems,\n\n        2. greater reduction in dysfunctional parenting practices,\n\n        3. increased use of appropriate discipline and positive parenting strategies, and\n\n        4. greater confidence in parenting ability."
