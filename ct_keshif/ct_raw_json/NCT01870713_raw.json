Recently\uff0cresearchers showed that type 2 diabetes\n      mellitus can be partly reversed by gastric bypassing surgery. However, surgeons are still\n      not clear how to chose the proper diabetes patients for surgery as the mechanism is still\n      not clear, and the remission rate of diabetes mellitus is not the same among different\n      surgical procedures.\n\n      This study will enroll type 2 diabetes mellitus patients follwing Roux-en-Y gastric\n      bypassing surgery and obese persons without type 2 diabetes surgery. The defferent\n      expressions of serum proteins of obese persons without type 2 diabetes and type 2 diabetes\n      patients following gastric bypassing surgery after 10 days or 3 months were detected by\n      serum proteomics. Blood samples and urine will be taken prior to surgery, 10 days after\n      surgery and 3 months after surgery. The long term prognosis of diabetes mellitus for 1 years\n      and the remission rate of diabetes of patients will be evaluated."
