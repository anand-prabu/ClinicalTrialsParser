In the first step, the elderly patients with small or\n      moderately advanced tumours who should routinely receive neoadjuvant chemoradiation (or\n      radiation alone in those unfit for chemotherapy) prior to full-thickness local excision\n      using transanal endoscopic microsurgery or prior to total mesorectal excision will be\n      included. In the next step, only patients with clinical complete response obtained 8-10\n      weeks from completion of (chemo)radiation are selected. Those patients constitute study\n      group and will be observed without further treatment. The remaining patients with residual\n      cancer will proceed to routine management, namely transanal endoscopic microsurgery or total\n      mesorectal excision. Patients undergoing transanal endoscopic microsurgery and having poor\n      response to (chemo)radiation (ypT2-3 disease or positive margin) will proceed to the\n      conversion to total mesorectal excision.\n\n      Neoadjuvant chemoradiation: 50 Gy total dose over 5 weeks with 2 Gy per fraction delivered\n      with simultaneous chemotherapy consisting of three cycles of 5-Fu 200 mg/m2 i.v. bolus and\n      leucovorin 100 mg/m2 i.v. short infusion over 2 days given during 1-2, 15-16, and 29-30 days\n      of radiotherapy. Patients unfit for chemotherapy will receive 25 Gy total dose over 5 days\n      with 5 Gy per fraction.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that in clinical complete responders after (chemo)radiation treated\n      without initial surgery, the local recurrence rate will be less than 25% and results of the\n      rescue surgery (local and distant recurrence rate) will be not worse (or only slightly\n      worse) than that seen after up-front total mesorectal excision in patients with similar\n      stage of the disease."
