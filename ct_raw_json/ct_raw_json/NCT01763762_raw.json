            "textblock": "Conservative therapy could be considered a choice of treatment for stress urinary\n      incontinence (SUI) as it seems to have no side effects and causes significant and long-term\n      improvement in symptoms. Pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) and electrical stimulation are\n      two commonly used forms of conservative treatment for SUI.\n\n      PFMT improves the structural support of the pelvis. However, many patients-especially\n      women-have difficulty identifying and isolating their pelvic floor muscles (PFM) and are\n      unable to perform the exercise effectively. Furthermore, patients who can identify the PFM\n      often find that the required daily exercise routine is burdensome. Hence, the primary\n      disadvantage of PFMT is lack of long-term patient compliance.\n\n      Electrical stimulation (ES) is a non-invasive, passive treatment that produces a muscle\n      contraction. Transvaginal electrical stimulation (TES) has almost no side-effects and\n      patient compliance in published reports is 70-85%. TES will result in PFM contraction by\n      indirect nerve stimulation, mainly by polysynaptic reflex responses. The indirect\n      stimulation and reflexive contraction may be the reason why the effect of electrical\n      stimulation is not as good as that of PFMT when performed correctly.\n\n      By combining the advantages of PFMT and TES and incorporating the technique of deep\n      insertion of long acupuncture needles, we developed electrical pudendal nerve stimulation\n      (EPNS). In EPNS, long acupuncture needles of 0.40 \u0425 100 or 125 mm were deeply inserted into\n      four sacral points and electrified to stimulate the pudendal nerves (PN) and contract the\n      PFM. CT transverse plane at the coccygeal apex has showed that the position of the lower\n      needle tip is similar to where (adjacent to PN at Alcock's canal) the Bion device is\n      implanted for chronic PN stimulation. Besides the radiographic evidence, simultaneous\n      records of perineal ultrasonographic PFM contraction, vaginal pressure and pelvic floor\n      surface electromyogram in our previous study have proved that EPNS can exactly excite\n      PN,contract the PFM and simulate PFMT. Our previous study has also proved that EPNS has a\n      good therapeutic effect on female SUI. The purpose of this study is to compare the efficacy\n      of EPNS to PFMT with TES in treating female SUI."
