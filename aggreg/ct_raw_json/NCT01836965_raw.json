Each cohort will consist of 6 adolescents with Aspergers or high-functioning autism, who will be joined by 6 typically-developing peers for the photography class. During the group therapy session adolescents will discuss and watch video clips addressing social skills topics relevant to their age group. They will have a chance to practice these skills when paired with a typically developing peer for the photography class."
