    <textblock>
      The objective is to expand and refine an intervention for transgender women (TW) into a
      7-session individual- and group-based intervention that is scalable for community settings
      to reduce sexual risk and substance use and to increase stigma-coping and risk-buffering
      behaviors among TW in NYC.  The investigators will pilot test the intervention with 20 TW
      and subsequently, conduct a randomized controlled trial with 240 TW to compare the
      intervention to a wait list control condition.

    <description>The intervention focuses on exploring health goals, creating an action plan, learning about the impact stress, stigma, and substance use can have on health, improving personal growth and social support, and connecting with resources. The first two sessions will be primarily Motivational Interviewing and will explore participants' feelings about their sexual risk, substance use, non-medically monitored hormone and silicone use, and any other issues. Group sessions (Sessions 3-6) will incorporate Cognitive Behavioral Skills Training focusing barriers to physical and mental health. The last session will focus on reviewing progress toward health goals, identifying barriers to change, and generating a plan for connection to ongoing care to reach target health goals.</description>
