As the name describes, HFDs represent the number of days alive and not in an acute care facility. Although this is a simple concept, and provides an outcome measure of obvious importance to patients, the use of HFDs as a primary outcome in an RCT is highly innovative. To bolster confidence in the results, we will evaluate two key variations on the theme. First, we will explore \"Healthcare Facility-Free Days,\" which represents the number of days alive where a patient is in neither an acute care facility, a chronic care facility, or a nursing home. We will also evaluate HFDs within a defined period of follow-up - 6 months in this case. This is analogous to the established outcome of ventilator-free days used commonly in RCTs among ICU patients",
