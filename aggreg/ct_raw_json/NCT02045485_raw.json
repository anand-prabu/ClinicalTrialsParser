P wave dispersion (PWD) is the most important electrocardiographic (ECG) markers\n      used to evaluate the risk of atrial arrhythmias. QT dispersion (QTD) can be used to assess\n      homogeneity of cardiac repolarization and  may be a  risk for ventricular arrhythmias.\n\n      Aim:  To search PWD and QTD in patients with psoriasis. Methods: Ninety-four  outpatient\n      psoriasis patients and 51 healthy people were  evaluated by physical examination, 12-lead\n      ECG and transthoracic echocardiography. Severity of the psoriasis was evaluated by psoriasis\n      Area and Severity Index (PASI)."
