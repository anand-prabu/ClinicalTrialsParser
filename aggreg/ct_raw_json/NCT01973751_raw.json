Only about half of the asthmatic patients have improved lung function\n      after treatment of inhaled corticosteroid. The investigators hypothesize that there are\n      biomarkers such as epithelial cytokines (IL-25, IL-33, TSLP) in airway tissues or plasma of\n      asthmatic patients which could predict the response of asthmatic patients to inhaled\n      corticosteroid. Finding novel asthma biomarker will help the clinicians to choose the\n      optimal treatment for individual asthmatic patient."
