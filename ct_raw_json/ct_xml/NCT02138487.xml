  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are conducting a study to better understand the relationship between
      activity restrictions and women's satisfaction following urogynecologic surgery for
      prolapse.  We hypothesize that women with less stringent postoperative restrictions will
      have higher levels of satisfaction 12 weeks following surgery with no difference in respect
      to anatomic outcome.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic floor disorders (PFD) dramatically affect millions of women's quality of life (QOL),
      and 30% of American women will undergo reconstructive surgery for urinary incontinence or
      pelvic organ prolapse to improve bothersome symptoms and quality of life.  Surgical goals of
      women with PFD is often to resume their normal activities, which they have limited secondary
      to bothersome symptoms.  Yet, traditionally surgeons placed strict postoperative
      restrictions on patient's activity levels for 3 months; sometimes even recommending life
      long lifting and activity restrictions.   Activity restrictions are imposed on the premise
      that exercise can &quot;weaken&quot; surgical healing; however, emerging data from other fields
      suggests that increased activity may actually promote the healing process.   We aim to
      determine whether satisfaction, recovery, and anatomic outcomes after surgery are related to
      type of postoperative activity recommendations (liberal versus restricted).  Women having
      surgery for PFD will be randomized to receive either liberal or restricted postoperative
      activity recommendations and satisfaction, symptoms, QOL and anatomic outcomes will be
      measured after surgery.  We hypothesize that women with liberal activity recommendations
      will recover more quickly and report higher satisfaction and QOL, have fewer symptoms, and
      have similar anatomic outcomes to women with restricted activity restrictions. These data
      will change paradigms of women's health and recovery after surgery.

    <description>Satisfaction will be assessed following reconstructive pelvic surgery for prolapse using a question which assesses a patient's global impression.  Specifically, patients will be asked the question &quot;how satisfied are you with your prolapse surgery?&quot; at 12 wks to assess overall satisfaction.  Possible responses include &quot;completely satisfied,&quot; &quot;mostly satisfied,&quot; &quot;neutral,&quot; &quot;mostly dissatisfied,&quot; and &quot;completely dissatisfied.&quot;</description>
