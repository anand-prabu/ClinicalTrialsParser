PRT-201 is a\n      protein that has been shown in previous research studies to help keep vessels patent when\n      applied to the outside surface of the blood vessels (arteries and veins) in patients who\n      undergo surgery to create an arteriovenous fistula (AVF).  The purpose of this study is to\n      determine whether PRT-201 when applied to a limited segment of your blood vessel (about 2\n      inches) immediately after surgery is safe and improves the patency of your AVF."
