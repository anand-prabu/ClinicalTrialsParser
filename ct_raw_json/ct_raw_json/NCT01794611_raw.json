Cormack-Lehane scores, the time from the start of laryngoscopy to visualization of the vocal cords and the time from the visualization of the vocals from the successful intubation will be recorded. The success of the intubation will be assessed with bilateral chest auscultation. If visualization of the vocal cords or placing of the endotracheal tube was not successful after 60 seconds with a particular laryngoscope, it will be left out and patient will be ventilated for 1 minutes and then pass to other laryngoscopes."
