  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cryotherapy is a resource applied thermal rehabilitation in order to reduce skin temperature
      and muscle as well as nerve conduction velocity, and promotes vasoconstriction of arteries
      and veins resulting in decreased blood flow. Thus, this study aims to evaluate neuromuscular
      and biomechanical assess hemodynamic and autonomic cardiovascular, and investigate the
      occurrence of changes in conduction velocity due to the superficial blood cryotherapy by
      immersion of the forearm. The study will be conducted in 40 volunteers, female, between 18
      and 30 years, university, healthy. They will be divided into two groups of 20 volunteers,
      the group immersion cryotherapy (GI) and control group (CG). For immersion cryotherapy group
      (GI), individuals will be the right arm to the elbow immersed in a container of water at 6°C
      ± 2°C for 15 minutes. In the control group (CG), volunteers will remain at rest with the
      right arm in the same position within a vessel containing water at a temperature indifferent
      for the same period of 15 minutes. The temperature analysis is performed using a infrared
      thermographer, muscular strength and synergism will be evaluated by a load cell connected to
      the electromyograph to examine muscle activation of wrist flexors and extensors, serratus
      anterior, upper and middle trapezius. The records beat to beat blood pressure and heart rate
      for cardiovascular autonomic and hemodynamic evaluation will be carried out by means of
      equipment and Finometer electrocardiogram, respectively, before and after application of
      cryotherapy. In turn, the data of blood flow velocity will be collected by means of Doppler
      Ultrasound. The results will be processed and analyzed using descriptive statistics,
      submitted to a linear regression model with mixed effects (fixed and random effects), with
      p≤0.05.

    <description>The objective of this study is to Evaluate the strength and muscle synergism between wrist flexors and extensors after forearm immersion cryotherapy. Testing grip strength will be carried out 3 times in a row, with 4 seconds of maximum voluntary isometric contraction, with a 1 minute interval between them; before, immediately after, 25 minutes and 50 minutes after immersion. Strength evaluation is conducted using a load cell. Concurrent with this test, the signal will be collected electromyographic extensor and flexor wrist, upper and middle trapezius fibers and anterior serratus.</description>

    <description>The data of blood flow velocity will be collected through the portable Doppler ultrasound wave continues. Immediately before the strength tests will be collected the data from the radial artery blood flow (3 times per collection), so there are no changes due to muscular work required in the handgrip test.</description>

    <description>The skin temperature data will be acquired by a digital infrared thermographer. Immediately before the strength tests will be collected temperature data cutaneous (3 times per collection), so there are no changes due to muscular work required in testing grip.</description>
