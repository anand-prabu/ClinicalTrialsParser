In the other condition clients will receive treatment-as-usual\n      but in addition their therapist will have access to empirical feedback on client progress.\n      Clients in the feedback condition will fill out weekly online questionnaires, and their\n      therapists will have access to a website that feeds back the results of these\n      questionnaires. The purpose of the study is to understand the impact of providing such\n      feedback to therapists. Participating therapists at 4 sites will offer all of their clients\n      the opportunity to participate, and participating clients will be randomly assigned to\n      either condition. This should result in a representative sample of client seeking treatment\n      at these 4 Chicago-area clinics."
