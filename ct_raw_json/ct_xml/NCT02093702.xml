      The objective of this study is to assess whether a structured exercise program compared to
      routine recommendation for exercise has any positive impact on disease outcome in patients
      with type 2 diabetes.

      This study aims to assess whether a structured exercise program has an impact on the
      following determinants of the disease in type 2 diabetes: HbA1C, blood pressure, lipids,
      body mass index and waist circumference. It also aims to assess the compliance and retention
      of patients with type 2 diabetes in a structured exercise program.
