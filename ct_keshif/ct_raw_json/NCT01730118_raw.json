            "textblock": "Background:\n\n      - HER2/neu (HER2) is a tumor protein that appears in almost a third of breast cancers and in\n      several other types of cancers such as colon, prostate and non-small cell lung. Tumors that\n      overexpress HER2 can be associated with a more aggressive cancer, higher recurrence rates,\n      and reduced survival rates. Researchers are testing a therapeutic cancer vaccine designed to\n      stimulate the immune system to recognize HER2. The vaccine, called AdHER2/neu dendritic cell\n      vaccine, is custom-made using an individual   s own immune cells. These cells will be\n      collected and used to produce the vaccine.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      - To test the safety and effectiveness of AdHER2 vaccination.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who have HER2-expressing tumors.\n\n      Design:\n\n        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine\n           samples will be collected. Imaging studies will also be performed.\n\n        -  Participants will have an apheresis procedure to collect immune cells to create the\n           vaccine.\n\n        -  Participants will receive four doses of the vaccine at study Weeks 0, 4, 8, and 24.\n\n        -  Participants will be monitored with physical exams, frequent blood tests and imaging\n           studies...."

            "textblock": "Background:\n\n        -  Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2, also known as c-erbB2 or neu) is a\n           proto-oncogene that encodes a 185-kd transmembrane     tyrosine kinase receptor that\n           participates in receptor-receptor interactions that regulate cell growth,\n           differentiation and proliferation. Its over-expression contributes to neoplastic\n           transformation.\n\n        -  HER2 is over-expressed in up to 25-30% of node-positive or node-negative primary breast\n           cancers and is associated with clinically aggressive breast cancer, a high recurrence\n           rate and reduced survival.\n\n        -  Trastuzumab (Herceptin (Registered trademark)) is a recombinant humanized mouse\n           monoclonal antibody (MAb) that binds to the extracellular (EC) domain of the HER2\n           receptor. Its clinical efficacy is limited to patients with 3+ HER2 tumor expression\n           documented by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or a Vysis fluorescent in situ hybridization\n           (FISH) ratio of greater than 2.2. IHC is a subjective measurement of HER2/neu protein\n           while FISH is an objective measurement of amplification of the HER2 oncogene.\n\n        -  Although the use of trastuzumab has been associated with improved clinical outcomes, a\n           significant number of patients are unresponsive to therapy and most eventually\n           experience clinical progression. At present no vaccine is available that induces\n           patients to make their own anti-HER2 antibodies.\n\n        -  We propose to investigate the use of an adenoviral vector (Ad5f35) expressing human\n           HER2ECTM (Ad5f35HER2ECTM- AdHER2) to transduce autologous dendritic cells for\n           therapeutic vaccination in patients with HER2 expressing solid tumors.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n        -  To determine the safety and toxicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination.\n\n           --Specifically, to determine if the fraction of patients with cardiac toxicity, defined\n           as a decrease in LVEF greater than or equal to 10% from baseline or a decrease in\n           absolute LVEF to less than or equal to 50%, is sufficiently low to warrant further\n           development in subsequent trials.\n\n        -  To determine the immunogenicity of autologous AdHER2 dendritic cell vaccination as\n           measured by a 3-fold increase in anti-HER2/neu antibody concentration or a 4-fold\n           increase in antibody dilution titers over baseline.\n\n      Study Design:\n\n      Open label, non-randomized, two part, phase I/ pilot study of 52 weeks duration for\n      evaluation of primary endpoints with extended follow-up out to 30 months to monitor LVEF\n      cardiac function.\n\n      Part I involves vaccine dose escalation in a population with no prior exposure to\n      trastuzumab or other HER2-targeted therapies to determine if there is a significant, adverse\n      safety signal regarding cardiac toxicity, in addition to preliminary assessment of the\n      vaccine   s immunogenicity and clinical activity. Five doses of 5, 10 or 20 x 10(6) viable\n      cells/AdHER2 DC vaccine will be given intradermally at Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 24 in patients\n      with metastatic solid tumors or high risk bladder cancer in the adjuvant setting\n      characterized by some HER2/neu expression. Re-staging for clinical evidence of stable\n      disease, partial response or better by immune-related response criteria will be assessed at\n      Weeks 8, 16, 24, 36 and 48 with confirmatory scans (if indicated) at Weeks 12, 20, 28, 40\n      and 52. Adjuvant bladder cancer patients will undergo re-staging for evidence of disease\n      recurrence (with confirmatory scans 4 weeks later if recurrence is documented) at Weeks 8,\n      16, 24, 36 and 48.\n\n      Part II is identical to part I, but is conducted in a population with significant prior\n      exposure to\n\n      trastuzumab and other HER2-targeted therapies.\n\n      Eligibility:\n\n      Part I:\n\n        -  Adults greater than or equal to 18 with recurrent, metastatic solid tumors\n           characterized by some HER2/neu expression but for whom trastuzumab is not clinically\n           indicated:\n\n             -  Patients with ovarian, colon, non-small cell lung, renal cell, bladder and\n                prostate cancer that is HER2 1+, 2+ or 3+ by IHC OR have a Vysis FISH result >\n                1.8.\n\n             -  Patients with breast cancer that is HER2 1+ or 2+ by IHC or with a Vysis FISH\n                result of 1.8 - <  2.2.\n\n             -  Measurable disease, with the exception of metastatic bladder cancer patients that\n                have completed first line chemotherapy and may not have measurable disease.\n\n        -  Adults greater than or equal to 18 with HER2+ bladder cancer in the adjuvant setting\n\n             -  Tumor stage T3a, T3b, T4a and T4b or any node positive disease.\n\n             -  Tumors that are HER2 1+, 2+ or 3+ by IHC or have a Vysis FISH result >  1.8.\n\n             -  greater than or equal to 6 weeks status post primary surgery with curative intent.\n\n             -  ECOG 0-1.\n\n             -  Naive to trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatnib, ado-trastuzumab emtansine (TDM1) or\n                other investigational HER2-directed therapies.\n\n      Part II:\n\n        -  Adults greater than or equal to 18 with breast cancer with 3+ HER2/neu expression by\n           IHC or a Vysis FISH result >  2.2.\n\n        -  Recurrent metastatic disease, ECOG 0-1.\n\n        -  Disease progression following 1     2 courses of therapies with known clinical benefit\n           i.e. trastuzumab, pertuzumab, lapatinib, TDM1 or other investigational HER2 agents but\n           NONE in the last 1 week prior to enrollment.\n\n        -  Documented response to HER2-directed therapy for metastatic disease.\n\n        -  Measurable disease."
