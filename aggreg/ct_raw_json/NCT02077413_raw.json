The specific goals include:\n      1) the amount of exercise that causes injury to healthy muscle in the lower leg of healthy\n      people; 2) what is the effect of an intervention (pre-rehabilitation program) on decreasing\n      how easily the muscle of the lower leg can be injured in healthy people; 3a) what amount of\n      exercise causes injury to muscle that has recently been injured and is recovering and 3b)\n      the effect of the new pre-rehabilitation program on the muscles of the lower leg when the\n      muscle has recently been injured and is still recovering.\n\n      For the first goal, the investigators will determine how easily the muscle can get injured\n      from a specific exercise in 6 healthy, conditioned men and women. Participants will perform\n      different amounts of exercise with the lower leg muscles to see how easily the muscle can be\n      damaged. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be used to estimate how much damage occurs\n      with the different levels of exercise. For the second goal, the investigators will examine\n      the effect of a new pre-rehabilitation program on decreasing how easily muscle gets damaged\n      from the exercise we did in the first goal. The investigators will invite healthy people to\n      participate in this goal. The investigators will use MRI, blood markers, and pain as ways of\n      assessing muscle damage in 10 people who do the pre-rehabilitation program before exercising\n      and 10 who do not do the new program. The third goal will focus on a) determining how easily\n      muscle gets injured that has recently recovered from some trauma (5 people will participate\n      in this part of the third goal), and b) determining how a pre-rehabilitation program\n      decreases how easily a muscle that has just recovered from trauma gets injured from exercise\n      (10 people will participate in this part of the third goal)."

The measurement of the peak isometric torque will be taken with the subjects seated in an upright position using a standardized set-up. Assessment of the dorsiflexors will be performed with the ankle in slight plantarflexion and the knee in slight flexion. The subjects will have three to ten maximal trials of ~5 sec which will be performed and the peak torque recorded. A rest time of ~1 minute will be provided between each contraction. A visual feedback display will be used to motivate the subjects to reach their maximum torque output. Peak torque measures may be normalized to maximal cross-sectional area (CSAmax) to assess muscle specific torque.",
