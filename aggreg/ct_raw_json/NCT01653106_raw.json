Patients\n      that receive high dose melphalan for bone marrow transplantation commonly develop\n      significant mouth pain and sores (oral mucositis) unless cryotherapy is utilized. The goal\n      of this study is to scientifically determine (using randomization and a larger sample size)\n      if a short-term schedule is as effective as the standard long-term schedule in preventing,\n      or minimizing the symptoms involved with oral mucositis. The study is also trying to\n      determine the best dose of melphalan and how patient's body breaks down melphalan and will\n      obtain blood through central venous catheter to measure the amount of melphalan in patient's\n      blood at specific times after the melphalan is infused"
