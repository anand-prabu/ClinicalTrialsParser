  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this program of research is to disseminate an effective, brief
      computer-based intervention that can be readily integrated into HIV treatment settings to
      motivate tobacco quitline use among smokers living with HIV. The overall objective of this
      application is to develop this computer intervention, modify it based on initial piloting
      and feedback, and obtain preliminary data supporting the efficacy of the intervention. This
      will be accomplished by pursuing three specific aims: 1) to develop and conduct preliminary
      pilot testing (n=16) of a brief, computer-based intervention intended to motivate tobacco
      quitline use among cigarette smokers living with HIV (Computer Intervention to Motivate
      Engagement in Tobacco Quitline treatment; CI-METQ) and to develop and pilot (n=4) a
      computer-based, time matched nutrition education for PLWH control intervention (NC) equated
      for the offer of a tobacco quitline referral and 8 weeks of free nicotine patch for those
      who engage in quitline treatment, 2) to conduct a preliminary smoking cessation, randomized
      controlled trial (RCT) with 100 people living with HIV (PLWH) who smoke cigarettes,
      comparing CI-METQ vs. NC, with predictions that CI-METQ relative to NC will result in
      increased readiness, higher rates of tobacco treatment engagement, more quit smoking
      attempts and higher rates of 7-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 1-, 3- and 6-month
      follow-ups. Health-related quality of life over this period will also be examined, and 3) to
      examine CI-METQ's effects on key mechanisms during the computer session and their
      associations with tobacco treatment engagement and smoking outcomes at 1-, 3- and 6-month
      follow-ups.
