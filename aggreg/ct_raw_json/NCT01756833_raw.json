The\n      primary outcome is abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) maximum transverse diameter determined by\n      CT scans at two-year follow-up with allowance for baseline (pre-randomization) diameter.\n      Based on an anticipated growth rate of 2.5 mm per year in the placebo group and the current\n      threshold at which surgical intervention will be offered to trial participants, (5.5 cm in\n      men, 5.0 cm in women), the upper limit of AAA size for inclusion has been set at 5.0 cm for\n      men and 4.5 cm for women. Among these subjects, the threshold for repair would be exceeded\n      only by those exhibiting persistent growth. Secondary outcomes will determine if doxycycline\n      affects other measures, e.g., MMP-9 levels in plasma and whether these effects are related\n      to aneurysm growth. Fifteen clinical sites have identified pools of over 900 patients with\n      small aneurysm who meet the proposed inclusion/exclusion criteria. Two hundred forty-eight\n      patients will be randomized to placebo or doxycycline and their aneurysms followed for\n      change in diameter at six-month intervals using CT imaging. The alternative hypothesis is\n      that doxycycline will inhibit the expansion rate by 40% during the two years of observation.\n      Patients enrolling in N-TA^3CT must be able to give consent for their participation\n      themselves and meet study eligibility criteria."
