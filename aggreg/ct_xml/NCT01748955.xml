      This study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the effects of
      two different antidepressant medications (Paxil CR versus Wellbutrin XL) on reward
      processing in depressed patients who have attempted suicide or are currently experiencing
      suicidal thoughts.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and serious psychiatric illness. It is among the
      leading causes of disability and is the psychiatric disorder most often associated with
      suicide. The treatment of MDD with antidepressant medication remains largely trial and
      error. Little empirical evidence exists to guide the treatment of MDD when suicide risk is a
      major factor.

      The study uses functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to compare the effects of
      paroxetine, an SSRI, versus bupropion, a non-SSRI, on brain activity in depressed patients
      with a past suicide attempt and/or current suicidal thoughts. Participants are randomly
      assigned to either paroxetine or bupropion treatment for 8 weeks, with fMRI scans involving
      a reward processing task at baseline and Week 8. Weekly study visits include interviews with
      a psychologist, self-report scales, and medication monitoring. All participants will then be
      offered 4 additional months of open clinical treatment. If original medication assignments
      prove to be ineffective, participants will have the option to switch to another medication.
      After completing the study, participants will be referred for ongoing treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Patient suffering from an episode of major depressive disorder (MDD)

          2. Age range 18-65 years

          3. History of a past suicide attempt or score &gt; 2 on HDRS item #3 (suicide) at in-person
             screening interview. Patients with suicidal plan or intent will only be enrolled as
             inpatients if independent inpatient treatment team agrees with the plan to enroll the
             patient.

          4. Patients 60 years of age and older must score at least 25 on MMSE at screening.

          5. Patients 60 years of age and older must have a normal ECG within the past year.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Bipolar disorder; current psychotic symptoms; bulimia or anorexia that is current or
             within the past year, or current purging at least twice a week for three months;
             persons already taking SSRIs or bupropion for other indications (such as anxiety
             disorders).

          2. Primary disorder is an anxiety disorder such as Panic disorder/GAD/OCD/ Social
             anxiety disorder, with secondary depression.

          3. Drug or alcohol dependence within past six months; persons with current drug or
             alcohol abuse may be enrolled if this is assessed as being of lesser importance than
             the major depressive episode.

          4. Blood pressure reading â‰¥ 140/90

          5. Active and/or unstable medical problems including a significant risk for seizures

          6. Antipsychotic medication required

          7. Patients who have become hypomanic or manic on antidepressants

          8. Contraindication to the use of an SSRI or bupropion, or currently using Zyban.
             Anorexia nervosa in remission at least one year is not an exclusion.

          9. Failure to respond to adequate trials of 3 SSRIs or paroxetine or bupropion in the
             last 2 years (failure to respond to therapeutic trial defined as: at least 2/3
             maximal PDR dose for at least 6 weeks).

         10. Lacks capacity to consent

         11. Pregnancy, lactation, or plans to conceive during the course of study participation.

         12. Patients currently on effective treatment, who require adjunctive antipsychotic or
             mood stabilizing medication, or who are unlikely to respond to single agent treatment
             for depression will be excluded.

         13. Patients with ferrous metal implants in their bodies, or a history of claustrophobia
             that precludes MRI, will be excluded.

         14. Patients assessed as being unlikely to tolerate the maximum 2-week delay to start of
             treatment.
