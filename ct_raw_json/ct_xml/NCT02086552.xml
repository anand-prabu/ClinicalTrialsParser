    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well erismodegib and lenalidomide after stem cell transplant
      works in treating patients with multiple myeloma. Erismodegib and lenalidomide may stop the
      growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth and may delay
      the recurrence of myeloma after a stem cell transplant.

               -  Patients who are not willing to apply highly effective contraception during the
                  study and through the duration as defined below after the final dose of study
                  treatment

               -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable
                  of becoming pregnant, must use highly effective contraception during the study
                  and through 6 months after the final dose of study treatment; highly effective
                  contraception is defined as either:

                    -  Total abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual
                       lifestyle of the patient; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation,
                       symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable
                       methods of contraception

                    -  Sterilization: patient has had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or
                       without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks before taking
                       study treatment; in case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive
                       status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level
                       assessment

                    -  Male partner sterilization (with the appropriate post-vasectomy
                       documentation of the absence of sperm in the ejaculate); (for female study
                       patients, the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner for that
                       patient)

                    -  Use a combination of the following (both a+b):

                         -  Placement of a non-hormonal intrauterine device (IUD) or non-hormonal
                            intrauterine system (IUS)

                         -  Barrier method of contraception: condom or occlusive cap (diaphragm or
                            cervical vault caps) with spermicidal foam/gel/film/cream/vaginal
                            suppository

                    -  Note: hormonal contraception methods (e.g. oral, injected, implanted) are
                       not allowed

                    -  Note: woman are considered post-menopausal and not child bearing potential
                       if they have had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an
                       appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor
                       symptoms) or six months of spontaneous amenorrhea with serum follicle
                       stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt; 40 mIU/mL and estradiol &lt; 20 pg/mL or
                       have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) at
                       least six weeks ago; in the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the
                       reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone
                       level assessment is she considered not of child bearing potential

               -  Male patient must use highly effective (double barrier) methods of contraception
                  (e.g., spermicidal gel plus condom) for the entire duration of the study, and
                  continuing using contraception and refrain from fathering a child for 6 months
                  following the study drug; a condom is required to be used also by vasectomized
                  men as well as during intercourse with a male partner in order to prevent
                  delivery of the study treatment via seminal fluid

               -  Sexually active males who are unwilling to use a condom during intercourse while
                  taking drug and for 6 months after stopping investigational medications and
                  agree not to father a child in this period

          -  Other co-morbidity, which would interfere with patient's ability to participate in
             the trial, e.g. uncontrolled infection, uncompensated lung disease

          -  Concurrent chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or any ancillary therapy for treatment of
             multiple myeloma; NOTE: bisphosphonates are considered to be supportive care rather
             than therapy, and are thus allowed while on protocol treatment

          -  Known allergies to any of the components of the investigational treatment regimen or
             required ancillary treatments

          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks prior to registration

          -  Patients with concurrent uncontrolled medical conditions that may interfere with
             their participation in the study or potentially affect the interpretation of the
             study data

          -  Patients unable to take oral drugs or with lack of physical integrity of the upper
             gastrointestinal tract or known malabsorption syndromes

          -  Patients who have previously been treated with systemic LDE225 or with other hedgehog
             pathway inhibitors

          -  Patients who have neuromuscular disorders (e.g. inflammatory myopathies, muscular
             dystrophy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and spinal muscular atrophy) or are on
             concomitant treatment with drugs that are recognized to cause rhabdomyolysis, such as
             5-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG CoA) inhibitors (statins), clofibrate and
             gemfibrozil, and that cannot be discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to starting
             LDE225 treatment; NOTE: if it is essential that the patient stays on a statin to
             control hyperlipidemia, only pravastatin may be used with extra caution

          -  Patients who have taken part in an experimental drug study =&lt; 4 weeks prior to
             registration

          -  Patients who are receiving treatment with medications known to be moderate and strong
             inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 4
             (CYP3A4)/cytochrome P450, family 3, subfamily A, polypeptide 5 (5) or drugs
             metabolized by cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily B, polypeptide 6 (CYP2B6) or
             cytochrome P450, family 2, subfamily C, polypeptide 9 (CYP2C9) that have narrow
             therapeutic index, and that cannot be discontinued before starting treatment with
             LDE225

          -  Patients unwilling or unable to comply with the protocol
