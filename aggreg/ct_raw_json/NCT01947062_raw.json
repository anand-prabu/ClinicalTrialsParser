While patients with adenocarcinoma of the lung have the feasibility of treatment\n      with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, the patients with squamous cell carcinoma can only be\n      treated with standard chemotherapy due to the ineffectiveness of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.\n      Thus, the current standard is to treat patients of squamous cell lung cancers with standard\n      intravenous chemotherapy, which is mostly delivered once in three weeks.\n\n      Metronomic chemotherapy, meaning the delivery of low doses of chemotherapy, often by an oral\n      approach, on a daily basis so as to maintain a low but definite level of the chemotherapy\n      has received great interest in recent times due to its beneficial effects in terms of\n      extending progression free survival among patients of various malignancies, even after\n      failure with previous conventional therapies. Metronomic chemotherapy is proposed to be\n      active by alternate mechanisms, such as the predominant anti-angiogenic effect, in contrast\n      to the cytotoxic and genotoxic effects of standard chemotherapy.\n\n      Metronomic chemotherapy with oral cyclophosphamide has been shown to extend progression free\n      survival when used as a single agent in various malignancies. Given the fact that\n      progression after varying time spans is a rule (rather than the exception) among patients of\n      squamous cell lung cancer being treated with conventional chemotherapy, we have intended to\n      combine the use of oral metronomic chemotherapy given concurrently with standard intravenous\n      cisplatin-etoposide based chemotherapy. We intend to observe a prolongation of progression\n      free survival."
