Describe and quantitate the clinical toxic effects of combination chemotherapy with\n      paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan with or without G-CSF.\n\n      III. Assess preliminary evidence of antitumor activity of this combination chemotherapy in\n      these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study of topotecan.\n\n      Patients receive paclitaxel IV over 3 hours and cisplatin IV on day 1, followed by topotecan\n      IV over 30 minutes on days 1-3. Patients receive filgrastim (G-CSF) subcutaneously beginning\n      on day 4 and continuing until blood counts recover.
