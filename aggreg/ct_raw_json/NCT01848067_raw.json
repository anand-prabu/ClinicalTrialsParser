Alisertib and abiraterone acetate may stop\n      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Androgens\n      can cause the growth of prostate cancer cells. Drugs, such as abiraterone acetate, may also\n      lessen the amount of androgens made by the body. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as\n      prednisone, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the\n      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving alisertib, abiraterone acetate, and\n      prednisone together may be an effective treatment for prostate cancer."

Phase II: To determine the proportion of patients who have no disease progression after\n           alisertib is added to abiraterone and prednisone.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n        1. Phase II: To determine the prostate specific antigen (PSA) kinetics after alisertib is\n           added to abiraterone and prednisone regimen (this includes the proportion of patients\n           with PSA progression free at 3 months, proportion of patients with 50% PSA reduction\n           after study treatment, maximum PSA decline from baseline during the first 12 weeks).\n\n        2. Phase II: To compare baseline circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enumeration to 12 week\n           post-therapy CTC enumeration.\n\n        3. Phase II: To compare baseline neuroendocrine marker (chromogranin A and neuron-specific\n           enolase [NSE]) levels to 12 week post therapy neuroendocrine marker levels.\n\n        4. Phase II: To further assess overall safety of combination of alisertib with abiraterone\n           and prednisone in the phase 1 portion of the study.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose escalation study of alisertib followed by a phase II study.\n\n      Patients receive alisertib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-7, abiraterone acetate PO\n      daily, and prednisone PO BID. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease\n      progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days."
