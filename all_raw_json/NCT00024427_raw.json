Giving the drugs in different combinations may kill more tumor\n      cells. Chemoprotective drugs such as triacetyluridine may protect normal cells from the side\n      effects of chemotherapy. It is not yet known which chemotherapy regimen is more effective in\n      treating pancreatic cancer.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of fluorouracil plus\n      triacetyluridine with that of gemcitabine in treating patients who have locally advanced or\n      metastatic pancreatic cancer that cannot be treated with surgery."

Patients are stratified\n      according to disease stage (II or III vs IV). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment\n      arms.\n\n        -  Arm I: Patients receive high-dose fluorouracil (5-FU) IV over 30 minutes once weekly on\n           weeks 1-3 followed by 1 week of rest. After each dose of 5-FU, patients receive oral\n           triacetyluridine every 8 hours for a total of 8 doses. Courses repeat every 4 weeks in\n           the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n        -  Arm II: Patients receive gemcitabine IV over 30 minutes once weekly on weeks 1-7\n           followed by 1 week of rest (course 1). Subsequent courses are given on weeks 1-3.\n           Courses repeat every 4 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n           toxicity.\n\n      Patients are followed for survival.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 260 patients (130 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 30 months."
