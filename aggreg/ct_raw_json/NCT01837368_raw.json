Assessment of\n      quality of life and suffering in patients with tinnitus in an observational study using\n      different questionnaires.

Furthermore it has been shown that not only\n      the auditory cortex but other regions of the brain are involved in the perception of the\n      chronic ear noise as well. Among them is the limbic system which is associated with  the\n      emotional processing of the human brain.\n\n      Correlation analysis are used to search for connections between the subjective behavioral\n      outcomes mentioned above and the objective EEG-patterns. Aim of the current study is to\n      provide conclusive models of associated assessments of the psychological strain end\n      emotional stress of individuals suffering from tinnitus  and objective EEG-analysis."
