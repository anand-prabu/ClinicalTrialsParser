            "textblock": "The splenectomized patient is more susceptible to infections because of the lack of specific\n      response to the polysaccharide antigens that compose the capsules of certain bacteria. These\n      very severe infections are known as Overwhelming Post Splenectomy Infections, or OPSI; they\n      are characterized by very rapid onset with no prodrome and carry a high mortality rate. The\n      annual incidence of OPSI is estimated at 0.23-0.42% with a lifetime risk of 5%. The role of\n      pneumococcus in particular has been clearly established in these infections.\n\n      The most effective strategy to minimize the risk of pneumococcal infection is pneumococcal\n      vaccination. Currently there are two types of vaccines available in France: polysaccharide\n      and conjugate, both of which induce the production of anti-capsular IgG with both\n      neutralizing and opsonic activity.\n\n      Since one of the consequences of asplenia is the absence of IgM production elicited by a\n      polysaccharide challenge, due to an absence of splenic B cells, it is difficult to imagine\n      that such patients would mount a satisfactory immune response to PPSV vaccination. And in\n      fact, several studies have described the occurrence of pneumococcal OPSI in patients who\n      were correctly vaccinated.\n\n      The study hypothesis is that a vaccination strategy combining PCV vaccine followed by PPSV\n      vaccine will induce a good immune response in splenectomized patients, with good\n      tolerability. All available data suggest that the optimum schedule consists of a\n      primovaccination with one dose of PCV followed two months later by one dose of PPSV, in\n      order to achieve a T-dependent memory response to the 13 serotypes common to the two\n      vaccines.\n\n      The proposed endpoint is therefore to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of a\n      vaccination strategy comprising priming with one dose of Prevenar13\u00ae PCV vaccine (serotypes\n      4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, 23F, + 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, 19A) to induce a T cell memory response,\n      followed by the classical administration of one dose of Pneumo23\u00ae or Pneumovax\u00ae vaccine\n      (serotypes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19F, 19A, 20,\n      22F, 23F, 33F). Secondary endpoints will evaluate the safety of this strategy in terms of\n      post-immunization local and systemic side effects, frequency of invasive pneumococcal\n      infections, predictors of immunogenicity, and persistence of immunogenicity 30 months\n      post-immunization."
