            "textblock": "One of the most significant problems in  fertilization treatments is Controlled Ovarian\n      Stimulation  low responsiveness . The incidence of low ovarian response  is estimated at\n      around 10-25%.The wide range of prevalence reported in the literature can be explained by\n      the lack of consensus existed as to the criteria for the low response.\n\n      The ovarian response to gonadotropin stimulation is crucial for successful assisted\n      reproduction techniques  .Cycles with low  rates response  was obtained and increased\n      cancellation rate  and  worst pregnancy rates .\n\n      Different criteria for the definition of low response, different tests to assess ovarian\n      reserve and different threshold values \u200b\u200bfor each has been used.\n\n      In 2010 a group of experts from the ESHRE ,achieved consensus on the criteria for low\n      ovarian response to homogenize the study groups and reach meaningful conclusions, are known\n      as \"The Bologna criteria\" ,they defined the \"Poor Ovarian Response\" (POR).\n\n      There is not sufficient to recommend most of the proposed treatments to improve pregnancy\n      rates in poor responders evidence.\n\n      Taking into account the profile of equivalence and safety of CFA (Corifollitropin Alpha ,\n      active  of ELONVA \u00ae ) , different studies  had been  concluded  that CFA can be  an\n      alternative to daily injections of recombinant follicle stimulating hormone ( rFSH) in\n      normal responders patients  in vitro fertilization  cycle with ovarian stimulation.But more\n      research is needed to determine whether long-acting recombinant follicle stimulating hormone\n      ( rFSH) is safe and effective for use in women with low and high response.\n\n      The ovarian  controlled stimulation with  Alpha Corifollitropin produces significantly more\n      oocytes compared to recombinant follicle stimulating hormone  (r FSH ) administrated daily\n      in normal responders patients, For this reason , the use of Alpha Corifollitropin   may be\n      beneficial in patients with poor response   which the number of oocytes retrieved is crucial\n      for successful treatment\n\n      There have been two studies in which the results are compared after ovarian stimulation with\n      daily rFSH vs CFA . In both shows , retrospectively and prospectively , the CFA seems to be\n      at least as effective as hMG recombinant follicle stimulating hormone (  rFSH) daily.\n\n      There are scientific publications showing that the association of luteinizing hormone ( LH)\n      to recombinant follicle stimulating hormone ( rFSH) can improve embryos quality and achieved\n      better pregnancy rate . The pregnancy rate   was not statistically   significant , in normal\n      responders patients.\n\n      Recently reported the beneficial effect in POR  patients treated with CFA and  hMG.\n\n      The IVF treatment is known to affects the physical and mental condition in  patients with\n      infertility , being the excess emotional stress one of the most important reasons for\n      discontinuation of treatment.\n\n      The ovarian stimulation with CFA simplifies treatment , reducing the administration of\n      multiple daily injections ,and may  reduce the emotional burden on patients."
