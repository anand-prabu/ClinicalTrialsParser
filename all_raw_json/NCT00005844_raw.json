Treatment continues in the\n      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of oxaliplatin until the maximum tolerated\n      dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which at least 2\n      of 3 or 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity.\n\n      Once the MTD for dose levels 1-4 is determined, an additional cohort of 3-6 patients is\n      accrued and treated with oxaliplatin as above every 2 weeks (for up to 9 doses).\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 6-20 patients will be accrued for this study within 1-3.3\n      years."
