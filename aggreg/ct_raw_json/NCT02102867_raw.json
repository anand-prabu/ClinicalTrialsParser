            "textblock": "HIV prevention is a global public health priority. Providing efficacious prevention methods\n      that have the greatest likelihood of use will have a profound impact on the public's health.\n      Critical to their use is \"acceptability.\"  However, current conceptualizations of adherence\n      and acceptability fail to fully articulate and account for patterns of use and non-use.\n      Formulation properties are critically important to both drug delivery and the user\n      experience. Microbicide developers thus have the opportunity to directly control a\n      formulation's impact on acceptability and adherence to product use, as well as biological\n      product performance. Microbicide products can and should be developed such that they achieve\n      performance standards for both these behavioral (user experience) and biological (efficacy)\n      functions. By incorporating the user experience early on in the product development process,\n      developers will have the greatest chance of providing at-risk individuals with the best\n      prevention methods science can provide. Developing prevention products that can be used in\n      the vagina and/or the rectum and that optimize the user experience in both compartments\n      increases the likelihood that these products will be used consistently and correctly. The\n      impact on global public health has the potential to be far-reaching, decreasing HIV and\n      sexually transmitted infections (STI) incidence and prevalence in both women and men.\n\n      Methodology and Data Collection: This is a formative mixed methods design in which\n      volunteers (N~20-30; ~8-20 males; ~8-20 Females) will first be prescreened for basic study\n      eligibility using a brief questionnaire. Those who are interested in the study and are\n      eligible based on their responses to the prescreen will then complete a STI/HIV screening\n      and pregnancy test (for females).\n\n      During the course of the study, participants will evaluate 3 study products (i.e., distinct\n      semi-solid formulations that represent a range of physicochemical and rheological\n      properties). Each participant will be randomly assigned to the order in which they will\n      evaluate the 3 products. Participants will be required to complete a brief phone survey (<5\n      minutes) every day, beginning the day after they start their first product evaluation period\n      and continuing until they complete their final study visit (approximately 12-24 weeks). The\n      phone survey includes a short set of questions about sexual behavior and product use during\n      the time since the last phone survey (about 24 hours). After a sexual encounter that\n      includes RAI and study product use, participants will be required to complete a web survey\n      about their experience with the study product. After a participant has evaluated all three\n      products, participants complete an individual in-depth interview and a cognitive interview\n      with study staff about their experiences with the study product and the USPE scale items\n      being developed."
