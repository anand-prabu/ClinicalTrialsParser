Giving\n      interferon-alfa following chemotherapy and peripheral stem cell transplantation may be an\n      effective treatment for Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to determine the effectiveness of interferon alfa-2b\n      following chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have recurrent\n      or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Determine the efficacy of interferon alfa-2b in reducing the relapse rate in\n      patients with recurrent or refractory Hodgkin's disease or non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in second\n      remission following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplantation. II.\n      Compare the time to disease progression and survival in this patient population treated with\n      interferon alfa-2b vs no further treatment. III. Assess the tolerability of these treatment\n      regimens in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to\n      lymphoma subtype. Patients are randomized to one of two treatment arms. Arm I: Patients\n      receive no further therapy following high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem cell\n      transplantation. Arm II: Beginning 4 weeks after high dose chemotherapy and autologous stem\n      cell transplantation, patients receive interferon alfa-2b subcutaneously three times a week.\n      Treatment continues for 18 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity. Patients are followed every 6 months until disease progression.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 360 patients (180 per treatment arm) will be accrued for this\n      study within 4-5 years."
