A clearer understanding of this role and its magnitude, and a means of controlling\n      the effects of outdoor allergen exposures is needed. We propose Poisson time-series and\n      conditional panel studies to test these hypotheses: 1) The incidence of acute asthma\n      attacks, as measured by urgent care inhalation treatments and hospitalizations for asthma,\n      has a dose-dependent relationship with exposure to specific outdoor allergens; 2) Specific\n      sensitization to outdoor allergens is a risk factor for having an acute attack; and 3)\n      Exposure conditions that lead to acute asthma attacks can be forecast, creating an\n      opportunity to reduce asthma morbidity and mortality ny targeting pretreatment and/or\n      exposure controls."
