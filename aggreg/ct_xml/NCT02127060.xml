  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain management remains a major challenge for surgeons. Despite huge
      technological advances in pain management, many researchers have documented that unrelieved
      pain remains common after surgeries, which is estimated that up to 75% of patients do not
      achieve adequate pain relief postoperatively. The major goal in the management of
      postoperative pain is to minimize the dose of medications to lessen the side effects while
      still providing adequate analgesia, because side effects of commonly used pain medications
      are known to be the reasons that could lead to inadequate postoperative pain treatment. This
      goal is best accomplished with multimodal analgesia. One agent that can exert
      antinociceptive and pain reducing effects is vitamin C.

      Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) is water-soluble, found throughout the body and is especially
      highly concentrated in the brain, which has antioxidant and neuroprotective properties.
      Moreover, it has been proven that the plasma vitamin C concentration decreases after surgery
      and the requirement for vitamin C increases in surgical patients, possibly due to greater
      demand caused by increased oxidative stress. Regarding the effect of vitamin C on acute
      pain, a result from a recent study with the aim to evaluate the potential role of vitamin C
      in reducing acute pain after laparoscopic cholecystectomy showed that supplementation with
      oral vitamin C significantly decreased morphine consumption after surgery.

      Although vitamin C has potential for relieving postoperative pain, there has not been
      studied regarding the effectiveness of vitamin C for spine surgery, to date. This trial
      aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of vitamin C for surgery of lumbar spine.
