      Collect de-identified, residual samples to support a clinical trial. Samples may be
      prospectively or retrospectively collected. Overall Study Objective 	Obtain clinical
      performance data to characterize clinical performance of the Respiratory Viral Panel on the
      GenMark Sample-to-Answer Platform.

      The purpose of this investigational study is to collect clinical samples to establish the
      clinical performance characteristics of the in vitro diagnostic (IVD) Respiratory Viral
      Panel on the GenMark Sample-to-Answer Platform. Data obtained from the samples will be used
      to support premarket submissions/registrations for this GenMark product. Samples will be
      aliquotted, characterized by comparator methods and banked until the instrument and assay
      are available for testing.

      Sample collection may be prospective or retrospective. Prospective collection will preserve
      prevalence. Retrospective collection will be used to obtain sufficient numbers of certain
      sample types such as where the organism of interest is of low prevalence. The Sponsor will
      ensure that information identifying samples as prospectively or retrospectively collected is
      documented.
