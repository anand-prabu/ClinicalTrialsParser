            "textblock": "OBJECTIVES: I. Determine the qualitative or quantitative toxic effects and tolerability of\n      liposomal cytarabine (Depofoam encapsulated cytarabine; DTC 101) in pediatric patients with\n      recurrent or refractory meningeal malignancies. II. Define a safe dose of DTC 101 in these\n      patients for future clinical studies. III. Determine the plasma and CSF pharmacokinetics of\n      DTC 101 in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation, multicenter study. Patients are placed in one of three\n      age-related strata: stratum 1, 3 to 21 years of age; stratum 2, at least 2 but less than 3\n      years of age; stratum 3, at least 1 but less than 2 years of age. Patients receive an\n      induction dose of intrathecal liposomal cytarabine (Depofoam encapsulated cytarabine; DTC\n      101) administered once every 2 weeks for 2 courses. Patients who have achieved a partial\n      response or received significant clinical benefit with stable disease may receive a third\n      induction dose of DTC 101, 2 weeks following the second dose. In the absence of progressive\n      disease, patients can proceed to consolidation therapy. During consolidation therapy,\n      intrathecal DTC 101 is administered once every 4 weeks for 2 courses, beginning 4 weeks\n      after the last induction dose. Patients experiencing a complete or significant response can\n      proceed to maintenance therapy. Patients receive a maintenance dose of intrathecal DTC 101\n      once every 8 weeks for a total of 6 doses, beginning 4 weeks after the second consolidation\n      dose. At least 3 patients are evaluated at each dose level. Dose escalation to the next\n      level proceeds when a minimum of 3 patients per cohort has successfully completed induction\n      therapy and been evaluated. Patients will be followed at 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months post\n      treatment, until relapse or death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A minimum of 12-15 patients will be accrued for each stratum over 18 to\n      24 months."
