            "textblock": "Tysabri reduces the relapse frequency, slows progression and preserves cognitive function as\n      compared to placebo as per the AFFIRM trial. The benefit on relapse rate and progression\n      appears to be sustained in longer-term studies such as STRATA. In clinical practice however\n      despite a stable condition on the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) patients often\n      complain of cognitive deterioration. It has yet to be shown that Tysabri will prevent\n      cognitive deterioration after more than 2 years of treatment.\n\n      The Symbol Digit Modalities Test (SDMT) is a sensitive and validated test of cognition in\n      MS. CogState offers a standardized battery of cognitive tests frequently used in clinical\n      research in the fields of dementia and Parkinson's disease. The CogState battery of tests\n      consisting of the Detection test (processing speed), Identification test (attention), One\n      Back test (working memory), International Shopping List test (verbal learning) and the\n      Groton Maze Learning test (reasoning and problem solving) will further confirm and validate\n      the results of the Symbol Digit Modalities Test(SDMT) in MS patients as well as examine\n      other cognitive parameters.\n\n      Together the above tests done prospectively can assess the evolution of cognitive function\n      in Tysabri treated MS patients over the longer term."
