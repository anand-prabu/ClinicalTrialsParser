In addition, it was also known that the level of oxidative stress and\n      inflammatory cytokines tended to be lower in PD patients than HD patients. And hepcidin\n      synthesis is markedly increased during inflammation. Altogether, Lower ESA requirement in PD\n      patients may be associated with lower hepcidin level due to lower inflammatory state\n      compared with HD patients."
