  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ocular hypertension and its fluctuations is a major risk factor of glaucoma onset and
      progression. In normal eyes, IOP presents a circadian rhythm, but in glaucomatous eyes IOP
      circadian rhythm is altered and varied widely between patients. To date, the only way to
      evaluate 24 hour IOP fluctuations is a regular GAT-IOP measurement during a 24-hour
      hospitalization. This method is expensive and does not reflect physiological conditions
      because it requires IOP measurements during sleeping periods that may potentially produce
      artifacts.

      Sensimed AG has developed a new medical device SENSIMED Triggerfish® that enables a 24-hour
      continuous monitoring of IOP fluctuations. As any IOP measurements methods, this medical
      device might be influenced by corneal properties of the cornea as central corneal thickness,
      keratometry or biomechanics. We, therefore, investigate the corneal lens tolerance,
      potential modifications of corneal parameters after a 24-hour wear of the lens, and its
      influence on data collected during the whole period of analysis. Then we will also analyze
      the influence of corneal parameters on continuous IOP fluctuations measured with the contact
      sensor and finally the correlation between data collected and the rate of progression
      (severity) of glaucoma evaluated with visual field test or optic nerve head damages.
