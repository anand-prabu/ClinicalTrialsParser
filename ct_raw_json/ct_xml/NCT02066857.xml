  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective randomized study is to add to the body of knowledge on the
      treatment of minimally displaced distal radius fractures in patients over 60 years of age.
      The investigators believe that treating minimally displaced distal radius fractures in
      people over 60 with a removable splint and early range of motion will provide greater
      patient satisfaction, fewer complications, and earlier functional returns to pre-injury for
      these patients compared to those treated with a short arm cast which immobilizes the limb
      for at least four weeks, and has been shown to lead to longer recovery and possible residual
      stiffness.  The investigators hope to provide sufficient evidence in directing treatment
      that will give the most efficacious and the most satisfactory return of prior function to
      patients.  Since distal radius fractures in the elderly are common because of poorer bone
      quality, the elderly proportion of the population is increasing, and controlling health
      costs is of current concern, answering the question of which treatment produces the best
      results for all these concerns is of increasing importance now.
