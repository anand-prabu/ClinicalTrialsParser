  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mesenchymal stem cells have capability to differentiate into myocardium, vascular
      endothelial cell, vascular smooth muscle cell and will be useful for heart regeneration.
      Adipose tissue is relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cell compared to bone marrow
      tissue. In this trial, eligible ischemic heart failure patients will be proceeded
      intracoronary administration of autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells by cardiac
      catheterization.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The population of the ischemic heart failure patients is enormous in Japan and the only
      radical treatment for them is heart transplantation: however, the number of giving donor is
      extremely limited. Mesenchymal stem cells have been capable to differentiate into
      mesodermal-lineage cells as well as endodermal-lineage cells such as myocardial cell. They
      reside in the mesenchymal tissues such as bone marrows as well as adipose tissues. The
      latter tissues are relatively enriched with mesenchymal stem cells compared to bone marrow
      cells. In this study, the ischemic heart failure patients will undergo intracoronary
      administration of autologous adipose tissue derived stromal cells through cardiac
      catheterization.
