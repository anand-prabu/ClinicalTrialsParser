  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prolactin is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland. Previous studies have revealed that
      elevated levels of the hormone prolactin might be associated with an increased risk of
      breast cancer. Cabergoline has been shown to lower prolactin levels in the blood.

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of cabergoline in treating
      metastatic breast cancer disease in those who test positive for the prolactin receptor.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To evaluate overall response rate (ORR) of cabergoline in women with metastatic breast
      cancer.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. Evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). II. Evaluate
      toxicity. III. Correlate serum prolactin levels during therapy with response. IV. Evaluate
      within-patient changes in computed tomography (CT) and bone scan measurements taken at
      baseline and after 2 cycles of treatment.

      V. Evaluate within-patient changes in prolactin receptor (PRLr) expression from baseline to
      after 1 cycle of treatment in those patients who consent to optional repeat biopsy.

      OUTLINE:

      Patients receive cabergoline orally (PO) twice weekly for weeks 1-4. Courses repeat every 4
      weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6
      months thereafter.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed metastatic breast cancer; tissue (a
             minimum of 3 slides) from the most recent biopsy is required for review and
             confirmation of eligibility; NOTE: material should ideally be from the metastatic
             disease, however material from the primary tumor is acceptable if that is all that is
             available

          -  Patients must have stage IV breast cancer

          -  Patients must have tumors (primary or metastatic) that stain positively for the
             prolactin receptor

          -  Patients may have measurable or evaluable disease

               -  Measurable disease is defined as at least one lesion that can be accurately
                  measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as &gt; 20 mm
                  with conventional techniques or as &gt; 10 mm with spiral CT scan

               -  Evaluable disease is disease that does not meet the criteria for measurable
