    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to meet the respiration rate accuracy specifications for the
      study pulse oximeter monitoring system (study device) in a hospitalized volunteer population
      when compared to established technologies for measuring parameters related to respiration,
      such as Capnograph Respiration Rate (RR)(CO2).

    <textblock>
      Volunteer subjects from a hospital setting (see specific inclusion/exclusion criteria) over
      the age of 18, male and female, who provide written informed consent prior to the procedure,
      and are without any contact skin allergies to adhesives found in standard pulse oximetry
      sensors.  A cross section of demographics - cardiovascular, respiratory, and metabolic type
      cases should be considered for a broad distribution of medical and surgical patients.

      The study consists of measuring parameters related to respiration in hospitalized volunteers
      by means of the Bedside Respiratory Patient Monitoring System with RR V2.0 (Nightingale).
      The production-equivalent Nightingale device and multiparameter reference devices will be
      attached to the subject via sensors, nasal cannulas and ECG leads and the information from
      all devices will be captured continuously for up to 40 minutes to allow for at least 30
      minutes of artifact free data 30 minutes.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Subject is younger than 18.

          -  Subject has severe contact allergies that may cause a reaction to standard adhesive

             electrodes or other medical sensors.

          -  Subject has an abnormality that may prevent proper application of the device.

          -  Subject is in atrial fibrillation.
