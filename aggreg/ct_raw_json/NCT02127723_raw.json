Macrolane VRF30 is a gel product based on hyaluronic acid which is a transparent\n      slow-flowing gel. A similar hyaluronic-acid gel from the same manufacturer, Q-Med AB, has\n      been used for many years for the treatment of facial wrinkles. By injecting Macrolane gel\n      into the skin, the shape of the buttocks can be altered and their volume increased."

Although treatment with Macrolane VRF is well documented\n      in breast enhancement, there is limited documentation on the use in buttocks reshaping.\n      Based on these clinical impressions, this study aims at acquiring information on the\n      efficacy and safety of Macrolane VRF30 in this particular indication. As a result of the\n      reshaping of the buttocks, it is expected that improvement of skin laxity will result in\n      contouring and reduction of cellulite. By using standardised evaluation tools, the results\n      of buttock reshaping reported anecdotally can be confirmed by accurate measurements."
