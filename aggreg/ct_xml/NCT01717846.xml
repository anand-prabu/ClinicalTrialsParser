  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proposal will test the hypothesis that Orencia affects apoptosis and apoptosis related
      genes/biomarkers in vivo in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients.
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Orencia may regulate apoptosis and apoptosis related genes in vivo in rheumatoid arthritis
      (RA) patient's cells. To date, no studies have been performed to evaluate the effect of
      Orencia on apoptosis in RA patients.

      Primary: To determine the effect of Abatacept in the apoptosis of T cells, B cells and
      antigen presenting cells (APC) in RA patients at baseline, 3 months and 6 months.

      Secondary: To evaluate the association between the changes in apoptosis to changes in
      disease activity measures (DAS28/ESR) over 6 months of treatment with subcutaneous injection
      of abatacept.

    <description>Orencia Group is for RA patients who have not received any other biologic treatment, including abatacept previously, and whose doctor has determined that it is appropriate to treat their RA with Abatacept. If you are in Group 1, you will receive the study drug, Abatacept, given in an intravenous (IV - injected into a vein) as well as subcutaneous form. Abatacept, given in an intravenous injection is approved by the FDA for the treatment of RA.</description>
