            "textblock": "Midazolam is almost exclusively metabolized intrahepatically. The methyl-group at position 1\n      of the imidazole ring is oxidized by liver enzymes. The product is a-OH-midazolam. This\n      reaction is catalyzed by a p450-dependent oxidase in the liver.\n\n      Active a-OH-midazolam is inactivated by a biotransformation type II reaction after\n      conjugation. The water soluble, conjugated midazolam can be excreted by the kidney.\n\n      During an intensive care treatment, the p450 dependent metabolization is known to be a\n      \"bottleneck of elimination\" as many drugs are inactivated by this pathway.\n\n      As the phase II (glucuronidation) is non-saturable in practice - the phase I reaction limits\n      the metabolic capacity. This leads to unpredictable prolongation of midazolam effects.\n\n      In contrast, Lormetazepam is glucuronized directly at its OH-group during a phase II\n      reaction. Since the glucuronidation is non-saturable, Lormetazepam is metabolized with\n      nearly constant kinetics even if repeatedly administered.\n\n      Due to the pharmacokinetics we hypothesize that Lormetazepam has an improved controllability\n      compared to midazolam. As this leads to less frequent agitation and over-sedation, we\n      hypothesize that there are multiple beneficial clinical outcomes for patients treated with\n      lormetazepam instead of midazolam."
