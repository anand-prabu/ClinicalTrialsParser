Study included 27 right-dominant women. Demographic data, HV angle,\n      weight-bearing and non-weight-bearing subtalar pronation (SP), and navicular height were\n      recorded. Visual Analog Scale, Foot Function Index (FFI), and the American Orthopaedic Foot\n      and Ankle Society (AOFAS) MTP-IP along with AOFAS Mid foot (MF) Scales, and SF-36 were used.\n      HV angle, weight-bearing SP, and pain intensity of the left foot were higher. HV angle of\n      left foot was correlated with all sub-sections of FFI, pain parameter of AOFAS MTP-IP, and\n      pain and total score of AOFAS-MF Scale ). HV angle of left foot was correlated with physical\n      role, pain, and social function sub-domains of SF-36.  Right HV angles were correlated with\n      right foot pain and non-weight-bearing SP.Increasing HV angle and pathomechanical changes in\n      rear foot were correlated. Besides, although all participants were right-dominant, their\n      left foot problems were more highlighted."
