    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group study
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, efficacy, pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity
      of multiple doses of ABT 122 in subjects with active RA who are inadequately responding to
      MTX treatment.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          1. Adult male or female, 18 years of age or older.

          2. Diagnosis of RA based on the 2010 American College of Rheumatology (ACR)/European
             League against Rheumatism (EULAR) criteria (as defined in the definition of terms).

          3. Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) diagnosis at least 3 months from the date of first
             Screening.

          4. Documented positive Rheumatoid Factor (RF) or Anti-Cyclic Citrullinated Peptide
             (Anti-CCP) Antibody levels prior to or at Screening:

             • If RF and Anti-CCP Antibody tests are negative, documented evidence of prior
             erosions on radiographs or computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) of
             hands is an acceptable alternative for meeting this inclusion criterion.

          5. Have active RA defined by minimum disease activity criteria:

               -  ≥ 6 Swollen joints (based on 66 joint counts) at Screening,

               -  ≥ 6 Tender joints (based on 68 joint counts) at Screening,

               -  hsCRP &gt; Upper limit of normal at Screening.

          6. Inadequate response to Methotrexate (MTX) treatment defined as oral or parenteral
             treatment ≥ 3 months with an unchanged mode of application and stable prescribed MTX
             dose for at least 4 weeks prior to baseline of ≥ 10mg/week and &lt; the upper limit of
             the applicable approved local label. Subject can also be on stable doses of
             sulfasalazine and/or hydroxychloroquine, so long as they are also on methotrexate.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subject has previous exposure to Humira, other Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors
             or other biological DMARDs.

          2. Current treatment with traditional oral Disease modifying antirheumatic drugs
             (DMARDs) (except for concomitant treatment with sulfasalazine and/or
             hydroxychloroquine in addition to MTX). Oral DMARDs must be washed out 5 times the
             mean terminal elimination half-life of a drug apart from MTX prior to Day 1.

             • Subject could have been exposed to prior Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors so long as
             they have been off therapy for 5 half-lives.

          3. Stable prescribed dose of oral prednisone or prednisone equivalent &gt; 10 mg/day within
             the 30 days of first dose of study drug.

          4. Intra-articular or parenteral administration of corticosteroids in the preceding 4
             weeks of first dose of study drug. Inhaled corticosteroids for stable medical
             conditions are allowed.

          5. Laboratory values of the following at the Screening Visit:

               -  Confirmed hemoglobin &lt; 9 g/dL for males and &lt; 8.5 g/dL for females,

               -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt; 1500 mm3,

               -  Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase (ALT) &gt; 1.5 × the
                  upper limit of normal (ULN) or bilirubin ≥ 3 mg/dL,

               -  Serum creatinine &gt; 1.5 × the ULN,

               -  Platelets &lt; 100,000 cells/[mm3] (109/L),

               -  Clinically significant abnormal screening laboratory results as evaluated by the
                  Investigator.
