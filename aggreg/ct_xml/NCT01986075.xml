  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate a treatment strategy in which a computer-assisted behavioral
      intervention will be used to help individuals stop their use of cocaine. A medication will
      be combined with the behavioral treatment among those individuals who do not respond to the
      behavioral intervention alone. The primary hypothesis of the study is that among cocaine
      dependent individuals who fail to respond to an initial trial of behavioral therapy, a
      greater proportion of individuals will benefit from the combined treatment (behavior therapy
      plus medication) compared to individuals in the comparison group.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cocaine Dependence is associated with substantial social, physical, and neurobiological
      problems. Psychosocial treatments can be helpful for many individuals. However, a
      significant proportion of individuals do not benefit from counseling alone. Our research
      group has demonstrated that deficient dopamine transmission, predicts poor response to a
      behavioral treatment and that a regiment that included an agonist replacement strategy with
      stimulants maybe effective for promoting abstinence in severe cocaine dependent patients.

      In this 15-week study 155 treatment-seeking cocaine dependent participants will receive a
      computer-assisted behavioral intervention based on the community reinforcement approach with
      contingency management (CRA + CM). The counseling approach will include both
      computer-assisted life skills training via and counseling. Individuals who fail to achieve
      abstinence will continue the behavioral treatment (CRA + CM) and will be randomly assigned
      to a behavioral therapy enhancement strategy that will include either Mixed Amphetamine
      Salts-Extended Release (60mg) or placebo.
