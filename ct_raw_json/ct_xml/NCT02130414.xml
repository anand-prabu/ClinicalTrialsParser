  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this Phase I, single centre, multi stage study is to evaluate the safety,
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics and relative colonic mucosal concentrations of cyclosporine
      capsules (CyCol®) compared to intravenous cyclosporine in healthy male volunteers.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, multiple-dose, multi-stage pharmacokinetic (PK) study. A maximum of
      40 healthy adult male volunteers aged between 18 and 55 years will be enrolled at a single
      clinical research unit.

      For each CyCol® group dosing will last 7 days, whilst the Sandimmun® IV group will have a
      single dose over 24 hours.

      Single dose pharmacokinetics of different doses of CyCol® will be compared to IV Sandimmun®.
      In addition colonic tissue concentrations will be compared after multiple doses of CyCol® to
      a single IV dose of Sandimmun®. Concentrations of unchanged cyclosporine and it's
      metabolites in the faeces  will also be explored.

      Stage 1 of the study will investigate the 75mg dose (OD and BID) of CyCol® and IV
      Sandimmun®. Then dependent on results Stages 2 and 3 will investigate either lower (37.5mg)
      or higher (150mg) dose levels. The dosing regimens chosen for Stages 2 and 3 will be based
      upon safety and tolerability, systemic exposure and colonic mucosa tissue concentrations
      observed at other doses.
