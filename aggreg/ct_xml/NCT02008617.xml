  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Outpatients scheduled to have ACL surgery typically receive a femoral nerve block to provide
      analgesia for the front of the knee. Postoperatively, these patients will often report pain
      in the back of the knee. Local anesthetic infiltration of the posterior aspect of the knee
      results in blockade of the genicular nerves of the posterior knee. These nerves originate
      off of the tibial and common peroneal nerves and their blockade will result in improved
      posterior knee pain relief and may decrease narcotic consumption compared to patients who
      receive the same infiltration with normal saline.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Femoral nerve blocks are commonly used to provide postoperative analgesia for ACL surgery.
      The limitation of these blocks is the incomplete analgesia they provide of the knee joint
      subjecting the patient to posterior knee pain.  As a result, some of these patients receive
      rescue sciatic blocks in the postoperative care unit to cover posterior knee pain.  The
      sciatic block provides excellent analgesia for the posterior knee; however its blockade
      invariably affects other territories of the sciatic nerve such as the lower leg and foot.
      For ACL surgery, the loss of sensation and/or motor strength to this area is unnecessary and
      may make ambulation more difficult.  The ability to ambulate with minimal assistance may be
      more important for a patient undergoing an outpatient surgery when compared to an inpatient
      surgery.

      At the posterior knee, the sciatic nerve branches off into the tibial and common peroneal
      nerves which give rise to sensory fibers that innervate the posterior knee.  We propose
      targeting these terminal fibers in the popliteal fossa by infiltrating local anesthetic
      between the distal femoral shaft and popliteal artery thereby providing posterior knee
      analgesia without affecting the lower leg.This application of this block has not been
      studied in patients having ACL surgery. A single interim analysis is scheduled after the
      data for 50 cases are available.
