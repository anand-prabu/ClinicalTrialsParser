The treatment is limited to patients that\n      have failed to respond to currently approved methods of treatment.  The study involves a\n      single, intravenous administration of an investigational drug, LS11 (previously studied in\n      approximately 80 cancer patients) and the placement of a novel, flexible light delivery\n      catheter inside the tumor by a minor surgical procedure.  The activation of LS11 by the\n      light delivery catheter over a period of 1-24 hrs may result in destruction of tumor tissue."

In those patients that qualify the entry\n      criteria, a light delivery catheter will be directly inserted in the tumor through a minor\n      surgical procedure.  The patients will then be injected with the photosensitive drug, LS11.\n      One hour following the drug injection, light energy will be delivered from the light\n      delivery catheter for a period of 1-24 hours.  The duration of the light treatment for a\n      given patient may be based on various factors including when a given patient enters the\n      study.  Following the delivery of light energy, the light delivery catheter will be removed\n      from the tumor.  The insertion and removal of the catheter will be carried out under the\n      guidance of CT scan.  The patients will be asked to take precautions from external light\n      exposure for a period of time.  The patients will undergo CT scan and other tests on days 7,\n      14 and 42 to evaluate safety of the treatment, tumor cell death and treatment response.\n      Blood samples will be taken at different time points to examine the clearance of the drug\n      from the body."
