  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A comparative study to test the efficacy of a novel device - the MiniBoxPFT, in measuring
      TLC (total lung capacity) compared to TLC measured by standard body plethysmography using
      the ZAN 500.  The study will be conducted as a prospective two-arm, open, randomized
      comparative study.

      This study is a prospective, multi-centered, randomized, comparative study designed to
      demonstrate substantially equivalence performance of the proposed device, the PulmOne
      MiniBoxPFT, to its predicate device, the ZAN500, for the measurement of total lung capacity
      (TLC).

             ventilatory abnormality.

        Exclusion Criteria:

          1. Subjects who are unable to satisfactorily perform routine, full lung function
             testing(due to non-compliance or claustrophobia).

          2. Subjects unable or unwilling to give informed consent.
