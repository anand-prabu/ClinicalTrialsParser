    <textblock>
      This study is designed to help us better understand the factors that affect the sexual lives
      of women who have been sexually mistreated during childhood. With this study we hope to
      learn about factors that may be promising targets for future treatments of sexual problems
      related to past sexual experiences. The investigators hypothesize that women who have
      experienced early sexual abuse are more likely to have sexual problems in adulthood than
      women who were not abuse in childhood.
