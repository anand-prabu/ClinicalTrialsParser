The primary\n      objective of this proposal is to rigorously examine current state, local government, and\n      child care providers' efforts and barriers to ensuring that all enrolled children are\n      up-to-date for required immunizations and to evaluate strategies to improve immunization\n      coverage in child care programs."

Aims 1 and 2 will guide the\n      design of these strategies. Specific strategies proposed for Aim 3 are to: 1) design and\n      pilot test an intervention to increase child care program use of the Utah State Immunization\n      Information System (USIIS), 2) design an online immunization education module and conduct a\n      pilot randomized controlled trial to determine whether use of the module changes child care\n      providers' knowledge, attitudes, and activities and increases the proportion of children who\n      are up-to-date for required immunizations; and 3) conduct a pilot randomized controlled\n      trial to determine whether a quality improvement intervention implemented in child care\n      programs increases the proportion of children who are up-to-date for required immunizations."
