Also, this study will help us determine the best way to\n      measure the effect of treatment. Finally, the investigators will study how closely the\n      physiotherapists follow the treatment instruction provided in the study protocol and\n      training. In order to achieve these objectives, 12 people will receive manual therapy and\n      exercise at one of twelve different doses. the investigators will have each of these people\n      fill out questionnaires, measure sensation changes, and measure changes in the way people\n      move their necks while walking. This study will help us determine if the study protocol can\n      be carried out as planned. This includes: the training of all people involved in carrying\n      out the assessments and treatments, the willingness and ability of participants to take part\n      in all of the treatment and measures involved. This will provide us with important\n      information to help us plan a larger study with 226 people with whiplash injuries."
