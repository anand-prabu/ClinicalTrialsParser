    <textblock>
      Study population: Patients who have been treated with physiotherapy for a potentially
      repairable rotator cuff tear in the period from 2002 to 2005.

      Study Method: At the time of diagnosis (2002 to 2005) all study patients were examined
      clinically, sonographically and by MRI. Some patients also completed a shoulder score. All
      study patients will now be reexamined, 8 to 10 years after they were diagnosed.
      Reexamination includes history taking, clinical examination, completion of three shoulder
      scores (two shoulder specific scores, one general health score), Sonography and MRI.
      Findings of interest are

        -  the number of relapses during follow-up,

        -  the need for surgical treatment during follow-up,

        -  the deterioration of tear anatomy (tear size, muscle atrophy, fatty degeneration)
           during follow-up

        -  the actual clinical shoulder condition (as given by shoulder scores) at reexamination.

      Study purpose: We want to assess the anatomic and clinical long-term results of
      physiotherapy for potentially repairable rotator cuff tears. We want to find out if tear
      anatomy of unrepaired rotator cuff tears deteriorates over time and if such a deterioration
      is associated with a development of more serious degrees of symptoms.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Full-thickness rotator cuff tear diagnosed between 2002 and 2005 by both sonography
             and MRI.

        At the time of diagnosis (2002 to 2005):

          -  Typical clinical symptoms for a rotator cuff tear including pain laterally on upper
             humerus, painful arc, positive impingement test (Neer or Hawkins)

          -  Potentially repairable tear (tear size up to 3 cm, muscle atrophy not exceeding grade
             2 according to Thomazeau, fatty degeneration not exceeding grade 1 according to
             Goutallier).

          -  Treated by physiotherapy for at least 3 months

        Exclusion Criteria:

        At the time of diagnosis (2002 to 2005):

          -  Full-thickness tears of the subscapularis tendon or of the entire supraspinatus and
             infraspinatus tendons

          -  Other symptomatic shoulder pathology including long head of the biceps tendon
             pathology, acromioclavicular joint pathology, shoulder instability, inflammatory
             diseases, glenohumeral arthritis

          -  Earlier treated with rotator cuff repair in the study shoulder
