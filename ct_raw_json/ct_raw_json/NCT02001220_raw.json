            "textblock": "During weaning the work of breathing is transferred from the ventilator back to the patient.\n      Approximately 40% of the time on ventilators is spent weaning. Studies support the use of\n      screening protocols and tests of patient's ability to breathe spontaneously (SBTs) to\n      identify weaning candidates. Once daily screening is the current standard of care. With\n      respiratory therapists (RTs) in Canadian intensive care units (ICUs), a significant\n      opportunity exists to screen patients more frequently, conduct more SBTs, and reduce the\n      time spent on ventilators and in the ICU.\n\n      The study is seeking to identify the optimal screening frequency to minimize patients'\n      exposure to invasive ventilation. The RELEASE Trial will evaluate a simple a simple\n      construct: more frequent screening will result In earlier identification of weaning\n      candidates, more frequent SBT's, and less time spent on ventilators and in the ICU. More\n      frequent screening is an appealing intervention because it is sensible, low risk, and\n      represents a cost effective use of current resources. This simple intervention holds promise\n      as a strategy that could change clinical practice, enhance the care delivered to critically\n      ill adults, and improve clinically important outcomes."

RTs\n      will conduct weaning readiness assessments either 'once daily' or 'at least twice daily' as\n      per group assignment.\n\n      In the 'once daily screening arm', RTs will screen invasively ventilated patients between\n      approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hours daily. In the 'at least twice daily' screening arm\n      patients will be screened at a minimum between approximately 06:00 - 08:00 hours and 13:00 -\n      15:00 hours daily. Additional screening trials in the 'at least twice daily' screening arm\n      will be permitted at the discretion of the clinical team (RTs and physicians). Regardless of\n      group assignment, if the SBT screening assessment is passed, an SBT will be conducted.\n\n      To pass the 'readiness to wean screen' and undergo an SBT, all of the following criteria\n      must be met:\n\n        1. The patient must be capable of initiating spontaneous breaths on Pressure Support (PS)\n           or triggering breaths on volume or pressure Assist Control (AC), volume or pressure\n           Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation (SIMV) \u00b1 PS, Pressure Regulated Volume\n           Control (PRVC) or Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (APRV),\n\n        2.

Respiratory rate (RR) less than or equal to 35 breaths/min,\n\n        4. Positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) less than or equal to 10 cm H2O,\n\n        5. Heart rate (HR) less than or equal to 140 beats/min,\n\n        6. The ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT) < 105 breaths/min/L during a\n           2 minute assessment.\n\n      The initial SBT will be 30 minutes in duration and may be conducted with any one of the\n      following techniques: T-piece, continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) less than or equal\n      to 5 cm H2O or PS less than or equal to 8 cm H2O with PEEP less than or equal to 5 - 10 cm\n      H2O.
