Interferon alfa may interfere with the growth of cancer cells.\n      Colony-stimulating factors such as filgrastim may increase the number of immune cells found\n      in bone marrow or peripheral blood and may help a person recover from the side effects of\n      chemotherapy. Combining chemotherapy with interferon alfa may kill more tumor cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of combining chemotherapy and interferon\n      alfa followed by filgrastim in treating patients who have gastrointestinal tract cancer."

Determine the objective response rates in patients with unresectable locally\n      advanced or advanced gastrointestinal malignancy treated with intravenous hydroxyurea,\n      fluorouracil, interferon alfa, and filgrastim (G-CSF). II. Determine the toxic effects of\n      this regimen in these patients. III. Determine the reversal of toxic effects of this regimen\n      in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: Patients are stratified according to site of primary disease (hepatobiliary vs\n      gastric vs pancreatic). Patients receive fluorouracil IV over 48 hours and hydroxyurea IV\n      over 48 hours on days 1, 8, 22, and 29. Patients also receive interferon alfa subcutaneously\n      (SC) on days 1, 3, and 5 and filgrastim (G-CSF) SC on days 3-6 of weeks 1, 2, 4, and 5.\n      Treatment repeats every 6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable\n      toxicity.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 31-60 patients (18-33 with hepatobiliary or gastric cancer and\n      13-27 with pancreatic cancer) will be accrued for this study."
