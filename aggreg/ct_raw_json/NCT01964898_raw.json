            "textblock": "The occurrence of Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS; unstable angina, ST and non-ST elevation\n      myocardial infarction) can be conceptualized as a \"teachable moment,\" whereby patients may\n      be more receptive to smoking cessation messages. Continued smoking following ACS is an\n      independent predictor of mortality. Depressed mood post-ACS is also predictive of mortality,\n      and smokers with depressed mood are less likely to abstain from smoking following an ACS\n      hospitalization. Thus, a single, integrated treatment that targets both depressed mood and\n      smoking could be highly effective in reducing post-ACS mortality. Behavioral Activation (BA)\n      may be an ideal treatment for this population as BA can easily integrate both mood and\n      smoking cessation related goals and it focuses on addressing restriction of valued\n      activities, which is common in the post-ACS population.\n\n      Thus, the overall aim of the current study is test a BA treatment manual that integrates\n      smoking cessation and mood management for post-ACS smokers (Behavioral Activation Treatment\n      for cardiac patients who smoke; BAT-CS). We will conduct an RCT (N=72) comparing BAT-CS (1\n      in-hospital session and 5-9 post-discharge sessions) to Standard Care (SC; 1 in-hospital\n      session and 5 mailed packets of printed self-help materials). Differences in smoking\n      cessation, depressed mood, and positive affect will be compared between conditions."
