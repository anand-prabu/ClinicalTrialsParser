Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to damage tumor\n      cells. It is not yet known if chemotherapy plus radiation therapy is more effective than\n      radiation therapy alone in treating patients with advanced cancer of the larynx.\n\n      PURPOSE: Randomized phase III trial to compare the effectiveness of radiation therapy with\n      or without chemotherapy in treating patients with advanced cancer of the larynx."

Compare, in a phase III setting, overall and disease-free survival with\n      preservation of laryngeal function in patients with stage III/IV squamous cell carcinoma of\n      the glottic and supraglottic larynx treated with cisplatin/fluorouracil (CDDP/5-FU) followed\n      by radiotherapy vs. concomitant radiotherapy plus CDDP vs. radiotherapy alone. II. Compare\n      the tumor response after completion of chemotherapy but prior to initiation of radiotherapy\n      with that following completion of radiotherapy and concurrent chemotherapy. III. Compare the\n      patterns of relapse (local and regional recurrence and distant metastasis) with these\n      treatments. IV. Compare the incidence of second primary tumors in patients treated on these\n      three regimens. V. Compare the acute and chronic adverse effects of these three regimens.\n      VI. Compare the morbidity experienced with neck dissection and/or laryngeal salvage surgery\n      following treatment with these regimens. VII. Compare quality of life of patients with\n      laryngeal preservation vs. patients requiring salvage laryngectomies. VIII. Compare the\n      quality of life of patients receiving radiotherapy alone vs. those receiving chemotherapy as\n      well.\n\n      OUTLINE: Randomized study. Patients on any arm, clinically staged N+ undergo neck dissection\n      following completion of radiotherapy. Arm I: 2-Drug Combination Chemotherapy followed by\n      Radiotherapy. Cisplatin, CDDP, NSC-119875; Fluorouracil, 5-FU, NSC-19893; followed by\n      regional irradiation using linear accelerators with photon energies of 1.25-6 MV, electron\n      energies of 8-17 MeV, or Co60. Arm II: Radiotherapy plus Single-Agent\n      Chemotherapy/Radiosensitization. Regional irradiation using equipment as in Arm I; plus\n      CDDP. Arm III: Radiotherapy. Regional irradiation using equipment as in Arm I.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: 546 patients (182/arm) will be entered over approximately 3 years. If any\n      arm is clearly inferior in laryngectomy-free survival after 137 patients have completed 2\n      years of follow-up study, that arm will be closed to further accrual. A second interim\n      analysis will be conducted after 410 patients have completed 2 years of follow-up."
