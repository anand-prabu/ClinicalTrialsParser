Patients with high copeptin levels will be able to\n      participate in the trial, patients with low levels will be excluded. Patients being admitted\n      to the observation unit for acute heart failure and already receiving standard therapy will\n      be randomized to receive either tolvaptan or placebo without consideration of the copeptin\n      level. The hypothesis is that patients receiving tolvaptan will have better improvement of\n      shortness of breath than those receiving placebo, within 9 hours of drug administration."
