          3. Subject has peripheral neuropathy &gt;= grade 2.

          4. Subject has non-squamous NSCLC, or a known Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR)
             mutation of exon 19 deletion or L858R mutation in exon 21, or a known Anaplastic
             Lymphoma Kinase (ALK) gene rearrangement.
