The presence of sedentariness was established in those subjects who were classified as sedentary and all other classifications were grouped as absence of sedentariness. The TMIA referred to the time self-reported by the subjects, weekly, in minutes spent in performing moderate intensity activities , calculated according to the answers to questions 2a and 2b from IPAQ, as follows: TMIA = (n days) x (time in min).",
