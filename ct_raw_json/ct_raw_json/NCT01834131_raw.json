Patients with hypertension from the\n      participating clinics, their spouses, and their adult hypertensive family members will be\n      enrolled.\n\n      Intervention: Eight clinics with approximately 944 participants will be randomly assigned to\n      the comprehensive intervention group and 8 clinics with similar participants to the usual\n      care group. The comprehensive intervention, including health care provider education, a\n      home-based intervention among patients and their families (lifestyle modification and home\n      blood pressure [BP] monitoring) delivered by community health workers, and a mobile health\n      intervention, will last for 18 months.\n\n      Outcomes: BP and other indicators will be measured at baseline and months 6, 12, and 18\n      during follow-up using standard methods. The primary outcome is a net change in systolic\n      (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to month 18 between the intervention and control\n      groups among hypertensive study participants. The secondary outcomes are the proportion of\n      hypertensive patients with adequate BP control (BP<140/90 mmHg or <130/80 mmHg if patient\n      has diabetes or CKD), net BP changes in normotensive participants, and cost-effectiveness."
