  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label, multi-center, Phase II study to evaluate dabrafenib and
      trametinib combination therapy in subjects with BRAF V600-E/K mutation-positive,
      unresectable or metastatic Acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM).  This study will evaluate the
      objective response rate (ORR), progression free survival (PFS), duration of response,
      overall survival (OS), safety and efficacy, to assess single-dose (Chinese subjects only)
      and steady state (all subjects) exposure to dabrafenib, dabrafenib metabolites, and
      trametinib and characterize the population pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD)
      of dabrafenib and trametinib.  Approximately 35 subjects (20 subjects in stage 1 and
      additional 15 subjects in stage 2) will be enroled and will receive dabrafenib 150 milligram
      (mg) orally twice daily and trametinib 2 mg orally once daily.  Treatment will continue
      until disease progression, death, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent, or study
      closure. After treatment discontinuation, subjects will be followed for survival and disease
      progression as applicable.  Survival and new anti-cancer therapy follow-up will continue
      until 70% of the total enroled population has died or been lost to follow-up. At such time
      the study will be closed
