Many\n      techniques have been used to arrive at the final diagnosis such as conventional radiographs,\n      computed tomography (CT), low dose cone beam CT, MRI.The use of ultrasonography has been\n      shown to be important in evaluating the solid and cystic components of jaw lesions. Although\n      ultrasound imaging technology is a safe and a minimally invasive procedure, and has been in\n      use in medicine for many years, its use in dental medicine has been limited and mainly\n      restricted to soft tissue applications. Studies evaluating  the role of ultrasonography in\n      the diagnosis of bone lesions of the jaw are limited."
