Tubeless anesthestic techniques\n      with preserved spontaneous ventilation and total intravenous administration of anesthetic\n      drugs are widely use. Due to its pharmacological profile, propofol anesthesia is often\n      considered as the gold standard for the anesthesia in the diagnostic panendoscopy. Previous\n      studies suggested that adding remifentanil to propofol could improve the conditions for\n      laryngoscopy and tracheal intubation.\n\n      The aim of this study is to assess the impact of propofol remifentanil general anesthesia\n      compared to propofol general anesthesia on the conditions of the diagnostic panendoscopy of\n      the upper airway."
