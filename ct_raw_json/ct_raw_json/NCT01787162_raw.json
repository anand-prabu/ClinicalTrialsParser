In each patient an echocardiography at rest will be\n      performed. In patients without musculoskeletal disease an exercise test (spiroergometry)\n      will be performed. Patients with elevated SPAP at rest or with reduced exercise capacity\n      (peak VO2 < 65%) a right heart catheterization (RHC) will be recommended. Also patients with\n      advanced NYHA functional class (III or IV) or with typical PH findings in electrocardiogram\n      will be advised to undergo a RHC. Additionally for the evaluation of exercise capacity a 6\n      MWD will be performed.\n\n      This work- up of patients allows clinical and hemodynamic evaluation."

However, the exact prevalence of\n      PH in this group of disorders is not known.\n\n      This study is designed to identify the pulmonary vascular changes and describe the\n      prevalence of pulmonary hypertension (defined in this study as mean pulmonary arterial\n      hypertension (mPAP) \u226525mmHg as assessed by right-heart catheterization (RHC) or systolic\n      pulmonary arterial pressure (sPAP) \u226537mmHg (2.9 m/s) assessed by echocardiography."
