  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is designed on the basis of an unmet clinical need, as well as other
      factors including: 1) the ability to identify subjects at high risk of dying early from
      their disease, 2) the fact that hormonal therapy has already been shown to improve survival
      when applied early in the natural history, 3) the availability of chemotherapy such as
      cabazitaxel that can improve survival in subjects with advanced disease and 4) that
      chemotherapy (docetaxel) given concomitant with hormone treatment has proven to prolong time
      to progression.

      It is our hypothesis that a more appropriate group of patients who may benefit from the
      curative potential of systemic chemo-hormonal modality is that with minimal, but detectable
      disease who have a high probability of developing metastatic disease, clinical symptoms and
      eventually death from prostate cancer in a defined time frame.  We hypothesize further that
      the approach is likely to be more effective at a time of minimal tumour burden, resulting in
      minimization of the overall burden of therapy and better quality of life while on treatment.

      This trial will determine whether any benefit is gained by adding chemotherapy before
      hormonal therapy to hormonal therapy alone in the population of subjects with metastatic or
      high risk disease.

    <description>Cabazitaxel 25 mg / m² / day on day 1 every 3 weeks continued if the patient has stable disease or responding to up to 10 cycles. Cabazitaxel will be administered in combination with oral prednisone or prednisolone (Prednisolon 10mg 1x1)
Hormones will be initiated in conjunction with the last cycle of chemotherapy. Consists of the administration of a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist + antiandrogens for 30 days OR surgical castration OR complete androgen blockade (CAB) by LHRH agonist + antiandrogen device. G-CSF treatment according to ASCO guidelines is recommended.</description>
