Clinical intervention studies using dark chocolate in normal volunteers and\n      subjects at risk for or with established cardiovascular disease have demonstrated\n      improvements in peripheral and coronary vascular endothelial function, blood pressure,\n      lipids, glucose tolerance and inflammatory markers.\n\n      Our study intends to examine the hemodynamics effects of purified (-)-epicatechin in\n      subjects with pulmonary arterial hypertension. We hypothesize purified (-)-epicatechin will\n      reduce pulmonary vascular resistance in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension."
