Mounting evidence has demonstrated anti-inflammatory characteristics for vitamin\n      D. Although analogues of vitamin D3 have extensively been used in the treatment of various\n      chronic inflammatory diseases, to our knowledge, no such research is conducted in regards\n      with obesity. The aim of this double blind clinical trial study is to investigate whether\n      alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects can affect the insulin resistance. Moreover, we\n      will evaluate the pathways of Vitamin D receptor (VDR), Peroxisome proliferator-activated\n      receptor gamma (PPAR\u03b3) and eroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- coactivator-1 \u03b1\n      (PGC1\u03b1) gene expressions which may lead to insulin resistance following treatment with\n      either alphacalcidol or placebo."

            "textblock": "Increasing evidence from human population studies and animal research has established\n      correlative as well as causative links between chronic inflammation and insulin resistance.\n      The anti-inflammatory characteristics of vitamin D have been demonstrated in previous\n      studies. In addition to its role in bone and calcium metabolism, vitamin D is demonstrated\n      to be influential in the regulation of different immune system functions and glucose\n      homeostasis pathways. Although low levels of vitamin D have shown to be in close correlation\n      with obesity, whether vitamin D deficiency is the cause or the consequence of obesity\n      remains unclear. It is noteworthy that several studies have demonstrated that vitamin D\n      deficiency is associated with an increased resistance to insulin.\n\n      The biologic effects of vitamin D are primarily mediated via the nuclear transcription\n      factor, vitamin D receptor (VDR), which triggers the expression of vitamin D responsive\n      genes. VDR is expressed on different immune cells such as monocytes, T-lymphocytes, and\n      granulocytes. It is documented that VDR and PGC-1\u03b1 show an overlapping pattern of\n      expression. Furthermore, as the expression of PGC-1\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 are regulated via\n      environmental stimuli such as diet, it could be suggested that the function of VDR function\n      can also be altered in response to external stimuli. PGC-1\u03b1 was demonstrated to be of a\n      particular importance in amelioration of increased insulin sensitivity.\n\n      Accordingly, to evaluate whether alphacalcidol treatment in obese subjects who generally\n      suffer from a low state chronic inflammation could affect the insulin resistance, we\n      designed the current double blind clinical trial study to compare the effect of alfacalcidol\n      with placebo on serum glucose, 25-OH vitamin D, PTH, and lipid profile levels as well as\n      Homeostatic model assessment (HOMA)  and quantitative insulin sensitivity check index\n      (QUICKI) indexes as a markers of insulin resistance. Furthermore, to assess the possible\n      cross talk between VDR and PPAR\u03b3, the gene expressions of these VDR, PPAR\u03b3 and PGC1\u03b1 were\n      evaluated following a course of treatment with either alphacalcidol or placebo."
