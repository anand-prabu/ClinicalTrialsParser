The purpose of this research study is to learn if vitamin D\n      supplementation is safe and effective in patients with focal segmental glomerulosclerosis\n      (FSGS) and to also help establish the treatment guidelines. About 35 patients with FSGS,\n      ages 5-30 years old, will take part in this study. Participants will be asked to take\n      vitamin D supplements each day for 12 weeks and will have 3 study visits."
