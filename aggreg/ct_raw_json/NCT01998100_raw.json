In addition the\n      two strategies (i.e., exercise + therapy and therapy alone condition) will be compared in\n      terms of levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). BDNF is a protein that helps to\n      support the survival of existing neurons and stimulate the growth of new neurons and\n      synapses. BDNF is important to learning and memory in general and therefore may be\n      associated with the learning and memory as it relates to PE and corresponding symptoms PTSD\n      improvement."
