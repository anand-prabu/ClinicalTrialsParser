            "textblock": "Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs) represent 25 to 30% of adult non-Hodgkin lymphomas\n      in western countries. DLBCLs are aggressive cancer but potentially curable with multi-agent\n      chemotherapy. Whereas R-CHOP regimen has led to a marked improvement in survival, this\n      disease remains a biologically heterogeneous entity. New therapeutic strategies are required\n      including identification of patients' subgroups with different prognostic.\n\n      This project is based on BMS_LyTrans and Goelams 075 clinical trial. A study of whole blood\n      transcriptome in 75 DLBCL patients and in 87 controls showed that PD-L1 (CD274) gene was\n      overexpressed in DLBCL patients. Preliminary results demonstrated that PD-L1 is detected in\n      plasma of DLBCL patients with a significantly higher concentration than in controls.  This\n      protein was selected as a potential biomarker because of its established role in\n      anti-tumoral immunity. Interaction between PD-L1 and its receptor PD-1 is known to inhibit\n      activation of immune responses by inducing T-lymphocytes anergy and/or apoptosis. Moreover,\n      a direct involvement of PD-L1 in the protection of cancer cells from lysis by activated T\n      lymphocytes has been demonstrated. PD-L1 expression has been described in several solid\n      tumours, including ovary cancer, breast cancer, colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma,\n      non-small cell lung carcinoma and in hematological malignancies such as T-NHL, MM and\n      Hodgkin's lymphoma.  Furthermore the expression of PD-L1 by tumour cells is associated with\n      poor prognosis. The blockade of PD-L1/PD-1 axis may represent a novel therapeutic approach\n      in aggressive cancers.  These first results incite to identify the cells releasing soluble\n      PD-L1 and to investigate its role in the anti-tumoral immunity in DLBCL patients.\n\n      The aim of this study is to identify cells producing soluble PD-L1 in DLBCL patients at\n      diagnosis in comparison to others tumours known to express PD-L1 (metastatic breast cancer,\n      Hodgkin's lymphoma, non-small cell lung cancer).\n\n      Secondary purposes are :\n\n        -  To confirm the presence of plasma soluble form of PD-L1 in others malignancies\n\n        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating tumour cells with multiparameter\n           fow cytometry and Veridex\u00ae technology in DLBCL and metastatic breast cancer patients\n\n        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on circulating endothelial cells in DLBCL, Hodgkin\n           lymphoma and metastatic breast cancer patients (subpart ended in late 2012)\n\n        -  To study surface expression of PD-L1 on different types of leukocytes (monocytes, B and\n           T lymphocytes)\n\n        -  To separate circulating tumour cells expressing PD-L1 by immunomagnetic or Cell-sorting\n           method\n\n        -  To develop ELISPOT technique to study  the release of soluble PD-L1 in culture\n           supernatants of selected cells (subpart ended mid 2013)\n\n        -  to evaluate the correlation between the expression of PD-L1 in the plasma and *) the\n           expression of PD-L1 in the tumor, **) the expression of PD-L1 and other molecules in\n           the bronchoalveolar liquid (whenever available from routine) in non-small cell lung\n           cancer\n\n        -  to evaluate the response to treatment according to plasma PD-L1 expression in non-small\n           cell lung cancer\n\n        -  to evaluate the susceptibility to develop a disease according to the single nucleotide\n           polymorphisms of the PD-L1 gene in DLBCL and non-small cell lung cancer"
