            "textblock": "As there is no standard of care to evaluate/visualize the effects of radiation therapy (RT)\n      -induced esophageal injury, this is routinely assessed by patient reported accounts, and the\n      symptoms are then managed supportively (e.g. with pain medicines, parenteral nutrition,\n      feeding tubes etc). Manometry has been frequently used to study the effects of RT on\n      gastrointestinal function in the setting of numerous  malignancies, including colorectal,\n      cervical and prostate cancers. What is often seen after RT is decreased sphincter function\n      in the anorectal region leading to problems with continence and fecal urgency, however there\n      has not been as rigorous of an evaluation of esophageal function after RT.\n\n      One study performed more than 15 years ago included only 4 patients with lung cancer and\n      concluded that mucosal irritation was likely the primary cause of RT-associated esophageal\n      injury and no abnormalities in motility were seen. Radiation is known to cause long-term\n      esophageal injury including stricture, and there is manometric evidence of impaired motility\n      long-term after RT. The recent introduction of high-resolution manometry permits more\n      extensive  evaluation of the effects of RT on esophageal function."
