This increases the number of patients with\n      heart disease, and since the vast majority with diabetes die from heart disease, it is\n      extremely important to investigate how these diseases can be prevented and treated.\n\n      Studies in animals have shown that intestinal hormone glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) can\n      expand blood vessels, thus lowering blood pressure, but it is not known whether the effects\n      is found in humans, which we will investigate.\n\n      Studies have also shown that GLP-1 lowers blood sugar, but it is unclear whether this is\n      solely due to increased insulin production, weight loss associated with GLP-1 intake or\n      GLP-1 has an effect on the muscles which increases the uptake of sugar. We investigate\n      whether GLP-1 enhances the absorption of sugar in the leg.\n\n      The investigators also examines whether these effects are greater in people with diabetes\n      then in healthy."
