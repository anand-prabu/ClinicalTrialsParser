The purpose of\n      this research is to develop and evaluate the efficacy of a HT CD-ROM decision-aid in\n      improving the decision making process for women considering the use of estrogen HT.\n\n      Objectives:\n\n      The objectives of the study are to: 1) develop a model of the decision-making process for\n      postmenopausal women considering hormone (HT), based on Multi-Attribute Utility Theory\n      (MAUT); 2) produce an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid for HT; 3) evaluate the effect of the\n      interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on patient satisfaction with decision (SWD) and knowledge\n      about menopause and HT; and 4) test the effect of the interactive CD-ROM decision-aid on\n      women\ufffds decisions regarding use of HT.\n\n      Methods:\n\n      Phase I (completed) used structured interviews and surveys in the development of a decision\n      model for HT.  In phase II, an interactive CD-ROM decision-aid was developed and a\n      randomized controlled trial (RCT) of its effect on decision processes was conducted.\n      Postmenopausal women, aged 45-74 were recruited from the primary care clinics of the four\n      participating Veterans Affairs hospitals: Milwaukee, Madison, Chicago-Hines, and\n      Chicago-Westside.  The primary hypothesis was that women who use the CD-ROM decision-aid\n      would demonstrate increased satisfaction with their decision regarding hormone replacement\n      therapy use compared to women receiving the control intervention.\n\n      Status:\n\n      Enrollment and follow-up assessments have been completed.  The study is in the analysis\n      phase.  The study was presented to the VA HSR&D Combined Monitoring Board on February 5,\n      2003 and the committee voted unanimously to recommend continuation of the trial.  The study\n      has had one publication and several scientific abstract presentations."
