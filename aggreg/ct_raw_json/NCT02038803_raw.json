Patients typically use the inhaled tobramycin for a period of 28 days. Unfortunately,\n      the standard nebulizer method for delivering tobramycin inhaled solution (TIS) is\n      time-consuming and may result in missed therapy doses and suboptimal care. A new inhaled\n      formulation and delivery device, the TOBI Podhaler (TPI), is a quicker, more efficient\n      method of administering inhaled Tobramycin. This new pocket-sized disposable inhaler is\n      maintenance free, requires no refrigeration or power source, and should greatly increase\n      patient mobility and improve time management."

This project will evaluate\n      the potential differences in efficacy, medication adherence, treatment time, side\n      effects/adverse effects, quality of life, and identify patient preferences between the use\n      of TIP and TIS. Measurements after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled solution, first\n      28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler and third 28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler will include FEV1,\n      number of acute pulmonary exacerbations, adherence, cough frequency, sputum characteristics,\n      and side effects or adverse events. The quality of life as assessed by the Cystic Fibrosis\n      Questionnaire-Revised (CFQ-R) will be measured after a 28-day cycle of tobramycin inhaled\n      solution and the third 28-day cycle of TOBI Podhaler. The FEV1 values, number of missed\n      treatments, and total treatment time will be analyzed through a repeated measures analysis\n      of variance. Comparisons of the CFQ-R data before and after the switch to the TPI will be\n      made with the Student's t-test. The chi square test will be used to evaluate differences in\n      categorical data. All tests will be tested at an alpha equal to 0.05. Responses for the\n      adverse reactions or side effects will be listed and categorized. The percentages of\n      patients preferring each inhaled solution will be reported."
