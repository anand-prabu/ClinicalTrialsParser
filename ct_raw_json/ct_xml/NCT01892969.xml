      Project Summary We propose an ancillary study to The Heart and Lung Failure Pediatric
      Insulin Titration trial (HALF PINT), which is investigating the impact of normalizing blood
      glucose using insulin infusions on clinical outcomes among children with hyperglycemia and
      heart and lung failure. In this ancillary study, we will measure plasma levels of
      coagulation and fibrinolysis proteins and genotype DNA for polymorphisms among patients
      enrolled in the HALF PINT trial. The results from this ancillary study will help us to
      understand potential mechanisms through which normalizing blood glucose provides benefit,
      which may lead to development of new therapeutic strategies in critically ill children

      ABSTRACT Hyperglycemia occurs frequently among critically ill children and is associated
      with increased morbidity and mortality. Approximately 25% of critically ill children with
      heart and lung failure (i.e., those receiving mechanical ventilation and/or inotropes)
      develop hyperglycemia within 24 hours of admission, and if the hyperglycemia is sustained
      (lasting for &gt; 50% of PICU stay), it results in a 6-fold increase in the odds of mortality.
      Previous studies have demonstrated that tight glycemic control with insulin, aimed at
      achieving normoglycemia (TGC-NL) can result in improvement in mortality and morbidity in
      selected groups of critically ill patients with hyperglycemia. However, the precise
      mechanism by which TGC-NL leads to improvement in morbidity and mortality is not known.
      Hyperglycemia is known to result in a pro-thrombotic state via activation of coagulation and
      impairment of fibrinolysis. This pro-thrombotic, anti-fibrinolytic state, may lead to
      intravascular fibrin deposition and micro thrombi, which can be a key contributor to the
      pathogenesis of multi-organ failure. We propose to take advantage of The Heart and Lung
      Failure Pediatric Insulin Titration trial (HALF PINT) - an NHLBI-funded randomized,
      controlled trial designed to study the impact of TGC-NL on clinical outcomes among children
      with heart and lung failure - to investigate the effect of TGC-NL on fibrinolysis and
      coagulation and to determine the extent to which improvement in deranged coagulation and
      fibrinolysis by TGC-NL contributes to improvement in clinical outcomes. We propose to enroll
      800 critically ill patients with hyperglycemia and heart and lung failure from the HALF PINT
      study. Since the parent trial will not collect any blood samples other than for confirmation
      of blood glucose, we will approach parents or surrogates of children enrolled in the HALF
      PINT trial and obtain informed consent for participation in this ancillary study.  We will
      collect blood samples (3cc from children 2 years and younger, and 5ml from children 3 years
      and older) at Days 1, 3, and 5 after randomization. We will measure plasma levels of
      selected markers of coagulation and fibrinolysis and genotype DNA for polymorphisms in the
      corresponding genes. We will correlate changes over time in the biomarkers with allocation
      to treatment arm to test whether the beneficial effects of TGC-NL are achieved via
      normalization of coagulation and fibrinolysis. We will also genotype for tag SNPs in the
      corresponding genes and test for association of the plasma and genetic markers with clinical
      outcomes. The results from this study will provide mechanistic insights into the effect of
      TGC-NL on clinical outcome and could lead to the use of anti-coagulant or pro fibrinolytic
      agents as adjunctive therapies among select groups of critically ill children with
      hyperglycemia who may not be amenable to tight glucose control or are at higher risk of
      adverse clinical outcomes from a pro thrombotic environment. Results from this study may
      lead to identification of protein or genetic markers that will identify critically ill
      children most likely to benefit from existing anticoagulant therapies such as activated
      protein C.
