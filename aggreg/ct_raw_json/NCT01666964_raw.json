While the military prevalence of\n      hypopituitarism can be extrapolated from civilian data, a major limitation is the notably\n      different mechanism of injury (i.e., blast) for military personnel compared to civilians\n      (i.e., assaults, traffic accidents and falls).  Little is known about the effect of\n      shockwaves from a blast injury on central nervous system tissue, and due to the unique\n      nature of blast-related TBI, the prevalence of pituitary dysfunction in affected service\n      members may significantly differ from nonmilitary subjects in prior studies."
