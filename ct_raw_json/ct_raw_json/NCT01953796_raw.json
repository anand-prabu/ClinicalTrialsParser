Daily doses of clomiphene citrate were increased by 50 mg in the next cycle up to 3 treatment cycle. In each cycle monitoring of follicular growth was done by tvUSS at day 11-14 of each cycle. First ovulation was used as the endpoint and the duration of follow-up was three treatment cycles (up to 150mg). Ovulation was assessed by tvUSS monitoring of follicle growth."
