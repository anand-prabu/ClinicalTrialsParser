  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate an oral fixed-dose, once daily product that combines pramipexole
      and rasagiline for the treatment of early Parkinson's disease.

      Animal studies support the therapeutic advantage of combining low doses of rasagiline and
      pramipexole and suggest further improvement when both are administered in a sustained
      fashion. Both rasagiline and pramipexole are well known marketed drugs for Parkinson's
      disease with a good safety profile. combining the drugs in low doses and controlled release
      may provide better symptom management than the existing drugs alone or together.
