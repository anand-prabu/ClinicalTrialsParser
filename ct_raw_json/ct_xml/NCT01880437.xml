    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and efficacy of vismodegib in patients with
      relapsed/refractory acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) and relapsed/refractory high-risk
      myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). Patients in Cohort 1 will receive single-agent vismodegib
      150 mg orally daily. In Cohort 2, patients will receive vismodegib 150 mg orally daily in
      combination with cytarabine 20 mg subcutaneously for 10 days.

      Anticipated time on study treatment is until disease progression, intolerable toxicity, or
      patient withdrawal of consent.

             leukemia (APL [M3 subtype]), or relapsed or refractory high-risk MDS (high-risk MDS
             defined as International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS) Int-2 or high and &gt;/= 10%
             blasts in bone marrow)

          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2

          -  Negative serum pregnancy test for women of childbearing potential and use of two

             discontinues from study

          -  Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a
             latex condom and to advise their female partner to use an additional method of
             contraception during the study and for 2 months after the last dose of vismodegib

          -  All non-hematological adverse events of any prior chemotherapy, surgery, or
