      This study tests the effectiveness of a newly developed integrated school-home behavioral
      intervention for behaviors related to Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).  The
      intervention is implemented by school-based mental health professionals within school
      settings.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Attending a participating school and in 2-5th grade

          -  Referral by LSP as a child with apparent ADHD-related problems

          -  ≥ 6 symptoms (item score ≥ 2) of Inattention or Hyperactivity-Impulsivity on the
             pooled parent and teacher Child Symptom Inventory

          -  ≥ 3 on the Impairment Rating Scale by parent and teacher (cross-situational
             impairment)

          -  FSIQ or VIQ ≥ 80 (necessary for cognitive demands of the child skills curriculum)

          -  Caretaker consents to participate in treatment, child assents to participate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  Presence of conditions that are incompatible with this study's treatment.

          -  severe visual or hearing impairment,

          -  severe language delay,

          -  psychosis,

          -  pervasive developmental disorder

          -  Parent or child does not read or speak English or does not read or speak Spanish for
             our Spanish language implementation of CLS (inability to complete assessment measures
             or participate in group treatments).

          -  Child is in an all-day special education classroom (children in these classrooms are
             frequently receiving intensive behavior modification programs such that the
             intervention would be expected to require modification for use in these settings)

          -  Children taking psychotropic medication for any reason other than to treat ADHD

          -  Children planning to change (start or stop) psychotropic medication

          -  Children who have changed a regimen of psychotropic medication (started or stopped)
             within 30 days prior to screening
