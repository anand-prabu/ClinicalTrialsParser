            "textblock": "Metabolic syndrome (MS) is characterized by a series of metabolic and hemodynamic parameters\n      such as hypertension (hypertension), abdominal obesity, dyslipidemia, abnormal glucose\n      metabolism and insulin resistance, resulting in increased cardiovascular morbidity and\n      mortality and the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Metabolic syndrome is\n      a common event after renal transplantation. The prevalence of MS increases post-transplant\n      with weight gain. In renal transplant recipients, the SM is associated with CVD, diabetes\n      after transplantation, worsening renal function and graft loss. Immunosuppressant\n      medications have primary effect on the pathophysiology of MS. Several studies have evaluated\n      the prevalence and impact of metabolic syndrome in renal transplant recipients as obesity,\n      hypertension, dyslipidemia and use of immunosuppressants. The objectives of this study are\n      to determine whether the determination of the metabolic syndrome at 6 months predicts this\n      same condition at 12 months, determine the prevalence of metabolic syndrome at 12 months, to\n      assess the prevalence of obesity and overweight in this population and to assess the\n      prevalence of diabetes mellitus after renal transplantation. Patients who meet the inclusion\n      criteria and did not meet the exclusion criteria will be invited to participate in the\n      study, signing the Instrument of Consent (IC) and informed about the objectives and\n      procedures of the study to be performed, with age between 18 and 60 years, both sexes, renal\n      transplant recipients Renal Transplant Unit, Hospital das Clinicas, FMUSP living donor or\n      deceased and use of immunosuppressive regimen consisting of tacrolimus, mycophenolate sodium\n      and prednisone. Sampling will be conducted laboratory tests, filling out questionnaires on\n      quality of life and anthropometric measures."

But the first comprehensive definition of MS was established only in 1998 , the World\n      Health Organization ( WHO ) , in order to facilitate research in this area and points as a\n      key indicator of SM the presence of hyperglycemia and / or resistance to insulin associated\n      with days or more metabolic abnormalities (hypertension, dyslipidemia , obesity, and\n      microalbuminuria).\n\n      In the general population , the presence of MS is associated with increased risk of\n      developing diabetes mellitus ( DM ) and cardiovascular disease . Some studies have\n      associated the SM to the appearance of proteinuria and reduction in the value of the\n      glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ), suggesting an association SM with chronic kidney disease\n      ( CKD ) .\n\n      Metabolic syndrome (MS) consists of complex disorder that involves assembly cardiovascular\n      risk factors related to abdominal fat deposition and insulin resistance . MS is associated\n      with cardiovascular disease , increasing overall mortality by about 1.5 times and\n      cardiovascular mortality by about 2.5 times.\n\n      In 2001 , the National Cholesterol Education Program - Panel of the National Cholesterol\n      Education Program ( NCEP - ATP III ), prepared another proposal. According to the NCEP ATP\n      III, SM represents the combination of at least three components."
