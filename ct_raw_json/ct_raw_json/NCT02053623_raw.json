At least 10% of this\n      population, that is, 100 million people, also suffers from associated chronic conditions\n      namely, atrial fibrillation (AF), obesity, arterial stiffness (AS), and heart failure (HF).\n      Personal interaction with medical practitioners (doctors) and review of published clinical\n      research confirms that current non-invasive automatic blood pressure (BP) monitors that rely\n      on BP pulse analysis alone cannot provide accurate measurement due to the unpredictable/weak\n      nature of BP pulses in the above-mentioned chronic conditions. Lack of accuracy in BP\n      estimation can lead to wrong diagnoses and hence to complications such as stokes and heart\n      attacks.\n\n      The Sponsor is developing a novel non-invasive BP monitor that is similar to existing\n      automatic monitors yet is capable of acquiring and analyzing electrocardiogram (ECG) data in\n      conjunction with BP pulse data to provide better and more accurate measurements in the above\n      chronic conditions.\n\n      The objective of this clinical trial is to evaluate the performance of this ECG-assisted BP\n      monitor against invasive BP measurements in a small group of patients who suffer from the\n      above conditions."
