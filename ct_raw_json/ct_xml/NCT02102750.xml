      The purpose of the study is to examine how preservative free tafluprost ophthalmic solution
      (0.0015%) is distributed in blood circulation after ocular administration in children who
      have glaucoma or elevated intraocular pressure. Tolerance to the drug and safety in general
      will also be assessed.
