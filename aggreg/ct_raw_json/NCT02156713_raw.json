It is currently part of standard of care for children with unilateral CP, but is\n      typically done one-on-one and with the child wearing a cast 24 hours a day during the\n      duration of treatment. The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of an intensive\n      group-based CIMT summer camp in which participants wear a removable cast on upper extremity\n      function, occupational performance, and patient-specific goals.  The investigators\n      hypothesize that upper extremity skills and occupational performance will increase, and that\n      patients will reach their individualized goals."
