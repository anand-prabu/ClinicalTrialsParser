Despite a\n      variety of treatments, many patients with chronic tinnitus ask for more active ways in\n      coping with their tinnitus. Gold standard treatment in chronic tinnitus is a comprehensive\n      directive counseling explaining the underlying mechanisms leading to the tinnitus percept.\n      Therefore a neuro-music therapeutic treatment based on a bio-psycho-social framework was\n      developed and compared to a counselling-only control group.\n\n      INTERVENTION: two standardized protocols for tinnitus therapy were defined (\"neuro-music\n      therapy\" vs. \"counselling\")"
