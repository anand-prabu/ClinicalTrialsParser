Enrollment into the Registry will be closed once the minimum sample\n      size has been achieved or after 3-years, whichever occurs last.\n\n      Registry Location:  Any hospitals /facilities treating a patient with a confirmed or\n      suspected exposure to botulinum toxin who was treated with BAT from the Center for Disease\n      Control and Prevention Strategic National Stockpile or State stockpiles are eligible for\n      participation.\n\n      Registry Design: Noninterventional, retrospective, observational phase 4 patient Registry.\n\n      All patients treated with BAT will be asked to participate in the Registry; the data\n      obtained aim to better define the absolute risk (incidence rates) of hypersensitivity/\n      allergic reactions, including serum sickness, febrile reactions, hemodynamic instability,\n      bradycardia, and other serious adverse events in patients that are treated with BAT due to a\n      confirmed or suspected case of botulism.\n\n      Clinical outcome data will be collected with informed consent /assent and summarized to\n      further evaluate the safety of BAT, in patients treated with BAT due to a confirmed or\n      suspected case of botulism.\n\n      Assessments: Data will be collected from treating physicians and/or health care\n      professionals involved in the care of BAT treated patient(s) using Cangene Corporation's\n      Botulism Case Report Forms; Form 1-Initial Case Report Form; Form 2-Follow-up Case Report\n      Form.\n\n      Form 1-Initial Case Report Form will collect baseline patient demographic information,\n      including; treating physician(s) and facility; time and date (or presumed time and date) of\n      exposure to botulinum toxin (if known), relevant medical history including neurologic\n      impairment, respiratory and cardiac conditions, and known allergies; clinical signs of\n      botulism at presentation; supportive care, intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation\n      use; concomitant mediations; monitoring details pre- and post-BAT infusion including\n      occurrence of hypersensitivity /allergic reactions, febrile reactions, bradycardia,\n      hemodynamic instability, anaphylaxis and/or serum sickness and information on inadvertent\n      overdoses, medication errors or no drug effect whether or not it leads to an adverse event.\n\n      With informed consent /assent Form 2-Follow-up Case Report Form will collect clinical\n      outcome data including; discharge status, duration of hospitalization and intensive care,\n      death (date and cause); diagnosis at discharge, confirmatory laboratory results for toxin\n      type and source where available; occurrence of adverse events (including but not limited to\n      blood borne infections, any serious labeled or unlabeled events and death),and concomitant\n      mediations.\n\n      All adverse events information reported will be reviewed by Cangene Corporation's\n      Pharmacovigilance department.\n\n      Data Analysis: The analysis will be descriptive and will include frequency tables to\n      summarize the characteristics of patients in the Registry and details of exposure to\n      botulinum toxin, clinical signs of botulism, and details of BAT administration. Incidence\n      rates of adverse reactions overall and by type of reaction (i.e., immediate\n      hypersensitivity, delayed hypersensitivity) will be calculated as the incidence proportion\n      with 95% confidence intervals for all patients treated with BAT and stratified by final\n      botulism diagnosis and by age.\n\n      Clinical outcomes to be tabulated include duration of hospitalization, duration of intensive\n      care unit stay and mechanical ventilation, clinical status at the time of hospital\n      discharge, destination upon discharge, presence of residual disability at time of hospital\n      discharge, death, and cause of death.\n\n      Patients enrolled into the Registry will be stratified according to the time from exposure\n      to BAT\u2122 administration: early treatment (\u22642 days from symptom onset) or late treatment (>2\n      days from symptom onset)."
