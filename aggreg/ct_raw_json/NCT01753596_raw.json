Data from epidemiological studies indicate that DES\n      is a common disease, especially in the elderly population, affecting up to 20% of adults\n      aged 45 years or older. Topical lubricants are a mainstay of therapy, but data on its effect\n      on tear film thickness and the corneal residence time are lacking.\n\n      Recently, a new objective method for assessment of tear film thickness by optical coherence\n      tomography has been developed. The present study aims to investigate the corneal residence\n      time of an established topical lubricant compared to placebo in patients with DES and\n      healthy controls."
