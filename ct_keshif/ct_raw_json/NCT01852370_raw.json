The primary purpose\n      of the study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of performing bilateral orthotopic lung\n      transplantation (BOLT) followed by cadaveric, partially HLA-matched CD3+/CD19+-depleted\n      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) from the same donor for patients with primary\n      immunodeficiency diseases (PID) and end-stage lung disease.  For many patients with primary\n      immunodeficiencies, HSCT is a curative, life-saving therapy, resulting in restoration of\n      function in the immune system. Patients with primary immunodeficiencies often develop\n      pulmonary complications as a result of chronic or recurrent infections, making them\n      ineligible for HSCT due to the high risk of mortality and pulmonary complications. Lung\n      transplant prior to HSCT would allow for restoration of pulmonary function prior to HSCT,\n      allowing PID patients to proceed to HSCT, which would be curative for the patient's\n      underlying immunodeficiency.  As a secondary aim after successful engraftment with donor\n      bone marrow, there is realistic hope for tolerating planned withdrawal of immunosuppression\n      achieving eventual freedom from all immunosuppressive drugs and attaining a tolerant state."
