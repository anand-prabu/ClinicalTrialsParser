The schizophrenia patients will serve as a\n      control population.\n\n      Demographic, clinical and radiographic information will be collected for all patients.\n      Additional data collected only for aplastic anemia patients will include medical therapy,\n      disease duration, blood cell counts, oral problems that developed during treatment and\n      treatment response."

Thus, in the present study, through a retrospective chart\n      review, we document the prevalence of oral complications in AA patients and the risks for\n      oral manifestations in a case-control study.  Schizophrenic patients represent controls.\n      Information includes the following; demographic, clinical and radiographic information for\n      cases and controls.  Additional data collection for only AA patients includes prior medical\n      therapy, CBC and differential, disease duration, new oral manifestations during AA treatment\n      and medical treatment response.  We determine if systemic clinical features of AA predict\n      oral manifestations, and if oral manifestations predict treatment outcomes for AA patients.\n      Finally complications following dental treatment are compiled and reviewed to establish\n      initial treatment guidelines for these patients."
