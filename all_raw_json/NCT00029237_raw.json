The 10-week group interventions are designed to reduce perceived\n      stress and increase coping effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management\n      focused on positively living (+LIVE), focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training, and spiritual growth\n      groups (SPRT). Effects of the interventions will be evaluated immediately upon completion of\n      the group training and at 6 months and 12 months following stress management training."

These three outcome domains, along with\n      neuroendocrine mediation, will be measured by multiple indicators derived from the\n      psychoneuroimmunology (PNI)paradigm. The interventions are designed to reduce perceived\n      stress and increase coping effectiveness and include cognitive-behavioral stress management\n      focused on positively living (+LIVE), focused Tai Chi (TCHI) training, and spiritual growth\n      groups (SPRT). The primary aim of this randomized clinical trial is to compare the +LIVE,\n      TCHI, and SPRT interventions to each other and to standard care received by a control group\n      of wait-listed participants (WAIT) for effects on psychosocial functioning (perceived\n      stress, coping patterns, social support, psychological distress), quality of life (including\n      spiritual well-being), neuroendocrine mediation (cortisol, DHEA levels), and somatic health\n      (disease progression, HIV-specific health status, immune status)."
