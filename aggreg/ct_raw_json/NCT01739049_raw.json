            "textblock": "Malaysia has increasing challenges in lifestyle related diseases, which is related to eating\n      habits and disorders. According to the National Health & Morbidity Survey in 2011; it was\n      reported the prevalence of obesity is 15.1% in 2011; or 2.5 million of the population,; an\n      increase of 7/9% when compared to the 14% prevalence in 2006. Binge eating is a symptom\n      described in various eating disorders. It is an under-diagnosed medical condition closely\n      linked to higher body mass index (BMI) or obesity as well as personality psychopathology,\n      psychiatric and psychological disturbances. Meta-analysis has demonstrated that extremely\n      strict restriction in dietary calorie and fat intake is needed to achieve meaningful weight\n      loss. Appetite and satiety are influenced by extremely complex central and gut-related\n      hormonal systems which modulate the regulation of food intake Centrally acting hormones\n      include Neuropeptide Y (NPY), agouti gene-related peptide, orexin which are\n      appetite-stimulating, melanocortins and alpha-melanocortin-stimulating hormone which promote\n      satiety.\n\n      Gut-related peptides include ghrelin secreted by the stomach and the duodenum has orexigenic\n      (appetite stimulating) effect;  leptin secreted by adipose tissue has anorexic (appetite\n      inhibiting) effect, cholecystokinin, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secreted by the\n      proximal gastrointestinal tract which has slight anorexic effect, and peptide YY (PYY).\n\n      Appetite and obesity have also been commonly related to stress and may influence\n      binge-eating episodes. Previous studies have demonstrated that high stress hormone cortisol\n      is associated with increased appetite and cravings, with preference for high carbohydrate\n      content, thus leading to weight gain.\n\n      In the previous study performed by our group on 738 normal subjects who were staffs of the\n      Ministry of Health, Putrajaya, we found a prevalence of 19% binge eating behaviour, 83% of\n      whom were either obese or overweight.\n\n      GLP-1 analogue used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and is also shown to produce and\n      maintain weight loss. Liraglutide, which provides a supra physiological amount of GLP-1 may\n      cause appetite inhibition thus may benefit in reducing binge eating. The aim of this study\n      is to closely observe the extensive profile of neuropeptide Y, ghrelin, leptin and GLP-1,\n      influenced by a standard meal in binge eaters in comparison to non-binge eating controls. In\n      addition, we aim to determine the association between binging and the respective\n      appetite-related hormones and also cortisol. Finally we will also be assessing the efficacy\n      of novel hormonal treatment of Liraglutide in reducing binge eating."
