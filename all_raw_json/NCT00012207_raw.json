Drugs used in chemotherapy use different ways to stop cancer\n      cells from dividing so they stop growing or die. Combining biological therapy with\n      chemotherapy may kill more cancer cells.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase I trial to study the effectiveness of biological therapy after chemotherapy\n      in treating patients who have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma."

Selected CD20-specific CD8+ cells are\n           cultured to expand the cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), which are then cloned.\n\n        -  Chemotherapy:\n\n      Patients receive oral cyclophosphamide and oral prednisone on days 1-5 and vincristine IV on\n      day 1. Courses repeat every 3-4 weeks for a total of 6 courses.\n\n        -  Immune cell infusion:\n\n      Beginning 4 weeks after the last course of chemotherapy (and lymph nodes \u2264 5 cm diameter or\n      \u2264 5,000 circulating CD20+ lymphocytes/mm^3), patients receive autologous CD8+ CTL clones IV\n      over 30 minutes. Courses repeat every 2-5 days for a total of 3 courses in the absence of\n      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. The last 6 patients receive interleukin-2\n      subcutaneously every 12 hours for 14 days, beginning 2 hours after the last infusion of CD8+\n      CTL clones.\n\n      After course 2 or 3 of immune cells, all patients undergo surgical lymph node biopsy to\n      determine if immune cells are moving to the lymph nodes.\n\n      Patients are followed monthly for 1 year and then annually for 2 years.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 12 patients will be accrued for this study within 4 years."
