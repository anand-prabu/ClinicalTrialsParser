  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reconstitution of a functioning immune system after allogeneic stem cell transplantation
      takes months to years. Particularly memory B-lymphocytes reconstitute poorly with the
      current conditioning regimes. During the period of intense immune suppression the patients
      are extremely susceptible to bacterial, fungal and, most importantly, viral infections.The
      adoptive transfer of B-lymphocytes from the stem-cell donor might significantly enhance
      humoral immunity for the patient. Aim of the study is to evaluate a new cellular therapy
      with B-lymphocytes regarding safety. A booster vaccination after B-lymphocyte transfer will
      evaluate the functionality of the transferred B-lymphocytes in the patient.
