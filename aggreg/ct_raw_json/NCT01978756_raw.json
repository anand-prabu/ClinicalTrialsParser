The first purpose is evaluating the\n      results of the radiation treatment by mapping A) late toxicity and B) tumour control and\n      survival.\n\n      The second purpose is that this outpatient clinic for late outcome will also function as a\n      pilot for a new CAT (Computer Assisted Theragnostics, abbreviated CAT project) in which\n      multiple late outcome variables will be recorded. In this pilot we want to investigate\n      whether physical presence of the patient on the outpatient clinic, allowing physical\n      examination, has any added value to the questionnaires filled in by the patient at home.\n\n      The ultimate aim of this new CAT project is to use these multicentric data to develop models\n      for predicting both oncological outcome and late side effects. Insight in the beneficial and\n      adverse effects of a certain treatment using these predictive models, will be required\n      choose the optimal treatment for the individual patient using a shared decision making\n      process."
