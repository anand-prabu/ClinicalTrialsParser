            "textblock": "Since 1995, preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) has been performed in The Netherlands\n      for couples at high risk for transmitting severe or lethal genetic conditions or who have\n      experienced multiple miscarriages due to chromosomal translocations. Approximately 260\n      children have been born after PGD in The Netherlands. Follow-up data on children born after\n      PGD are scarce. Long-term studies on PGD children have not been conducted in The\n      Netherlands. Results of studies in other countries on 2-year old PGD children are\n      reassuring. These children and their parents have normal scores on relevant parameters such\n      as general health, cognitive and socioemotional development, parent-child interaction and\n      parental stress. Studies of good methodological quality of older children have not yet been\n      published.\n\n      Objective: Long-term follow-up of children who have been born after PGD in The Netherlands.\n      The primary aim is to assess the safety of PGD with regard to the health and development of\n      the children.\n\n      Study design: A cohort study. Study population: 5-year old children born after PGD in The\n      Netherlands for various indications and their parents. Control groups consist of 5-year old\n      naturally conceived (NC) children of parents who have considered PGD treatment and 5-year\n      old children born after in vitro fertilisation/intracytoplasmatic sperm injection\n      (IVF/ICSI), and the parents of the two latter groups of children."

No invasive interventions will be performed. The risks associated with the\n      study procedure are very small. The results provide more information about the risks of PGD\n      to prospective parents who are considering PGD and to healthcare providers involved in PGD\n      treatment."
