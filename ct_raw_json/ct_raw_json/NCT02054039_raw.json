            "textblock": "- Postoperative pulmonary complications in patients undergoing cardiac surgery are a major\n      clinical problem, presenting negative impact on morbidity, mortality , length of hospital\n      stay and health care costs. Although physical therapy has been widely used as a resource to\n      improve lung function in the postoperative period, the adoption of routine procedures of\n      physical therapy needs be discussed.\n\n        -  Incentive spirometers are mechanical devices used to reduce postoperative pulmonary\n           complications. In general, they are activated by an inspiratory effort, visualized by\n           an uplifted plate or ball in a transparent cylinder during sustained inspiration.\n\n        -  Breath Stacking is a technique allowing the patient inhale a greater volume of air,\n           kept for a longer period of time using a one-way valve, thus promoting the accumulation\n           of successive inspiratory volume and preventing exhalation.\n\n        -  The objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two different techniques\n           of respiratory therapy on both reducing postoperative pulmonary complications and\n           improving lung function.\n\n        -  Type of study : randomized clinical trial\n\n        -  Hypothesis\n\n             1. Both techniques Trifllo II Incentive Spirometry ( IS) (Trifllo \u00ae - II ) and Breath\n                Stacking ( BS ) may present similar effectiveness on reducing pulmonary\n                complications, improving lung function and respiratory muscle strength ( MIP and\n                MEP), as well as reducing  hospital stay .\n\n             2. Trifllo II Incentive Spirometry ( IS) (Trifllo \u00ae - II ) may be more effective than\n                Breath Stacking on reducing pulmonary complications, improving lung function and\n                respiratory muscle strength, as well as reducing  hospital stay."
