Treatment continues for at least 12 months in the absence of disease\n      progression. Patients achieving complete response (CR) continue treatment for at least 8\n      months after reaching CR.\n\n      Tumors are measured at least every 2 months for 1 year and then every 3 months for 1 year.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 20-40 patients will be accrued for this study."
