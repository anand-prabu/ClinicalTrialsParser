One of the\n      reasons result in these situations is the patent visits hospital for treatment in late stage\n      of oral cancer. Recently, the government makes effort in oral cancer screening to find oral\n      potentially malignant disorders (OPMD) early. However, there is no conscience in treatment\n      strategies of OPMD up to now. In this study, we will set a OPMD data bank, and use the cases\n      to find out the potential biomarker, which is able to predict the oral cancer malignant\n      transformation. Sixty OPMD with oral cancer transformation will be recruited, and 60 OPMD\n      with no oral cancer malignant transformation will also be enrolled as the disease control\n      group. Besides, 20 normal cases and 60 oral cancer cases resulting from previous OPMD will\n      be collected. All those groups will detect the expression of p62/SQSTM1 to investigate the\n      possibility that p62/SQSTM1 as a biomarker to predict the malignant transformation of OPMM,\n      and a guideline to treat or not to treat OPMD."
