There will be 3 dosing periods in\n      the study, one for each formulation and one for the test formulation + meal.  The subjects\n      will be asked to fast for at least 10 hours before taking the capsule formulations.  During\n      one of the periods, the subject will be asked to eat a high-fat meal 30 minutes before being\n      given the capsule to swallow. Subjects will be randomly (by chance) assigned to a treatment\n      sequence which will determine the order in which the subject will receive the reference\n      formulation, the test formulation, and the test formulation + high-fat meal. Blood samples\n      will be taken at intervals during the study to assess the amount of drug at those time\n      points. Blood samples will also be collected at certain time points to determine the levels\n      of special proteins that may help explain how CC-122 work."
