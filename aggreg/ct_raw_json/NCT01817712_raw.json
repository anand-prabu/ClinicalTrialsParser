A steady\n      worker is defined as holding a competitive job for greater than or equal to 50% of the\n      18-month study follow-up period (i.e., greater than or equal to 39 of the 78 weeks).  All\n      participants will be followed for 18 months post-randomization."

            "textblock": "Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) affects more than 600,000 US Veterans and is the most\n      common psychiatric condition for which Veterans seek VA disability benefits, making up a\n      substantial proportion of the $23 billion pensions and disability annual budget.  Although\n      many Veterans with PTSD are college educated, few have jobs, almost 40% are impoverished,\n      and most report work, role and social functioning scores below those of persons with serious\n      mental illness.  Veterans returning from the Gulf War-era II conflicts, defined as having\n      served in the military since Sept 2001, often experience PTSD and confront unemployment upon\n      their military discharge.  According to a March 2011 report from the U.S. Department of\n      Labor, the 2010 unemployment rates were 11.5% for these Gulf War-era II Veterans, 21% for\n      service-connected disabled Gulf War-era II Veterans, 13% for all service-connected Veterans\n      of all eras combined and 9.4% for non Veterans.  The current methods used by the VA\n      Compensated Work Therapy (CWT) programs do not sufficiently meet the employment\n      rehabilitation needs of Veterans with PTSD.  In a VA Northeast Program Evaluation Center\n      (NEPEC) study evaluating administrative data of 5,862 Veterans from 122 CWT programs,\n      Veterans with PTSD were 19% less likely to be employed at discharge from the VA CWT program\n      compared to those without a diagnosis of PTSD.  The rate of competitive employment at\n      discharge was only 30% for Veterans with PTSD.  Similarly, another VA study found that\n      Veterans with PTSD involved in CWT were no more likely to be employed at 4 months follow-up\n      compared to those who participated in a specialized PTSD treatment program.\n\n      Over the past two decades of studies, the Individual Placement and Support (IPS) model of\n      Supported Employment has yielded remarkably robust and consistent employment outcomes for\n      individuals with serious mental illness (defined as schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder,\n      bipolar disorder, and major depression with psychotic features).  Overall, approximately\n      two-thirds of participants in clinical trials with serious mental illness who received IPS\n      achieved competitive employment.  However, Veterans with PTSD have very different clinical\n      characteristics and employment challenges compared to Veterans with SMI.  Serving as the\n      first study in a PTSD population, a recent single site pilot study found superior outcomes\n      from IPS compared to the conventional VA vocational rehabilitation program (VRP) in\n      unemployed Veterans with PTSD (n=85).  During the 12-month study follow-up period, 76% of\n      the Veterans with PTSD randomized to IPS gained competitive employment, compared to 28% of\n      those randomized to VRP.  Together with the evidence base accumulated in the serious\n      mentally ill population, the positive results of the pilot study in PTSD support a VA\n      Cooperative Study to definitively test the effectiveness of IPS in Veterans with PTSD.\n\n      As the primary outcome, the two groups will be compared in terms of the proportion of study\n      participants who met the definition of steady worker, i.e., hold competitive employment for\n      at least 50% of the follow-up period.  Competitive employment is defined as a job receiving\n      regular wages in a setting that is not set aside, sheltered, or enclaved, that is, the same\n      job could be held by people without a mental illness or disability and is not a set-aside\n      job in the TWP program.  Secondary outcomes will include change in other occupational\n      outcomes, PTSD symptoms, self esteem, community integration, and quality of life.  We will\n      explore the differences between groups in terms of occurrences of negative health outcomes.\n\n      These findings would provide generalizable evidence of the effectiveness of differing\n      employment support to the VHA stakeholders who inform policy and service delivery for\n      Veterans with PTSD.  Given the number of Veterans with PTSD, it is of critical importance\n      for the VA to offer employment service programs based on the best evidence-based\n      recovery-oriented model for this group.  Conducting a large multi-site study is the next\n      logical step in confirming IPS as an evidence-based employment service for Veterans with\n      PTSD."
