The limited efficacy of pharmacological interventions stimulates the search for\n      other options, in order to increase the therapeutic success. Acupuncture is widely used for\n      pain control in several pathologies. A modality of intramuscular stimulation to quantify the\n      intensity of the stimulus is electro acupuncture (EAC) that the intensity of 2 Hz\n      accelerates the release of enkephalins, endorphins and beta-endorphins. The application of\n      electric currents to modify brain function is a very old technique. The transcranial direct\n      current stimulation (tDCS) is based on applying transcranial direct weak current (usually\n      above 2mA) through electrodes in a non-invasive, simple and painless. Other advantages\n      include low cost and the possibility of a placebo reliable. The purpose of this study is to\n      evaluate the ability to reduce pain and improve functionality in chronic pain for knee\n      osteoarthritis with two techniques, one that promotes a bottom-up approach (EAC) and other\n      top-down (tDCS). We will seek to analyze the efficacy of them separately and together,\n      seeking summation of results."
