Together they afflict many Americans, mostly young women, who are\n      prevented from gainful employ or school attendance.  The underlying mechanism is not known.\n      Our past work suggests that a simple molecule, nitric oxide, acts to subvert normal blood\n      flow controls causing blood to pool in the gut when standing.  Our proposal will show the\n      mechanism behind this problem and will indicate effective medical treatments.  Patients will\n      be compared to healthy control subjects."

            "textblock": "Vasovagal Syncope (VVS,simple faint) is the most common cause of transient loss of\n      consciousness and is the acute episodic form of orthostatic intolerance(OI).  Postural\n      tachycardia syndrome (POTS) is the common chronic form of OI.  Both are defined by\n      debilitating symptoms and signs while upright relieved by recumbency.  Pathophysiological\n      mechanisms have remained elusive although our past work shows that excessive upright central\n      hypovolemia results from splanchnic pooling due to defective splanchnic arterial and venous\n      constriction.  Preliminary data support the hypothesis that production of nitric oxide (NO)\n      is enhanced in these patients resulting in reduced sympathetic noradrenergic\n      neurotransmission at pre-junctional and post-junctional sites.  Our approach is two-fold: 1)\n       We will use intradermal microdialysis and laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) to delineate the\n      microvascular mechanisms of NO modulation of noradrenergic neurotransmission free of\n      confounding systemic reflex changes.  2)  We will systemically apply this mechanism to a\n      model of orthostatic stress, lower body negative pressure(LBNP), while measuring cardiac\n      output by inert gas rebreathing, regional blood volume, and regional blood flow using\n      plethysmographic techniques focusing on splanchnic changes, and muscle sympathetic nerve\n      activity by peroneal microneurography.  We will study synaptic peripheral neurotransmission\n      of Norepinephrine and how it is affected by supplemental NO and by nitric oxide synthase\n      inhibitor."
