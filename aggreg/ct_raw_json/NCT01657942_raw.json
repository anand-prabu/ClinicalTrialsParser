The risk of ExAblate\n      treatment-related incontinence and impotence will also be assessed in this study.\n\n      Effectiveness: determine the tumor control effect of ExAblate's MRgFUS focal treatment of\n      low risk organ-confined prostate cancer (confirmed by TRUS-guided mapping biopsy results)."
