            "textblock": "This is a prospective randomized control trial to investigate an optimal method for\n      discontinuing NCPAP therapy in preterm neonates. Neonates \u226432 weeks gestational age (GA) who\n      require NCPAP in the delivery room or following extubation and are delivered in or\n      transferred to Parkland Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) will be enrolled. The\n      study team will approach the parents for verbal consent once neonates are stable on\n      mechanical ventilation with a goal of extubation to NCPAP or once they are placed on initial\n      NCPAP therapy. Neonates will be randomized to the high or low NCPAP arms and managed by\n      their primary care team until they meet stability criteria as defined for a minimum of 12\n      hours. At that time they will be removed from NCPAP using two approaches: Group 1 will be\n      decreased to 5cm H2O by the primary care team at which time NCPAP is removed if the neonate\n      is clinically stable and the neonate placed in room air or on low-flow nasal cannula at\n      \u22641L/min; Group 2 will be gradually weaned to a NCPAP of 3cm H2O at which time NCPAP is\n      removed if the neonate is clinically stable for the prior 24 hours and the neonate placed in\n      room air or on low-flow nasal cannula. Failure criteria will consist of clinical signs and\n      laboratory results demonstrating the need for escalation of support, e.g., increasing apnea\n      of prematurity (AOP) or need for increasing O2 supplementation. When a neonate has been\n      stable for 5 days off NCPAP, they will complete the intervention arm of the study. All\n      neonates will be followed until discharge, at which time the primary outcomes, e.g., days on\n      NCPAP, duration of hospitalization and need for O2, will be determined for each group and\n      compared. The calculated total sample size will require 322 neonates; i.e., 153 neonates per\n      arm with a 5% drop-out rate will give a power of 0.80 and alpha value of 0.05 to detect a\n      30% difference in NCPAP days.\n\n      Stability Criteria:\n\n        1. NCPAP 5cm H2O\n\n        2. Supplemental oxygen <25% and not increasing\n\n        3. Respiratory rate \u226460 b/min\n\n        4. No significant respiratory distress, e.g., retractions, dyspnea\n\n        5. <3 episodes of apnea (>20 seconds), and/or bradycardia (<100 beats/min), and/or\n           desaturations (<87%) in 1h for preceding 6h\n\n        6. Average oxygen saturation >86% with stable inspired O2\n\n        7. Tolerate time off NCPAP during routine care procedures\n\n      Failure Criteria:\n\n        1. Occurrence of \u22653 apneas and/or bradycardia and/or desaturations within 1h\n\n        2. Increasing need for supplemental O2 >25% to maintain O2 saturation >86%\n\n        3. Increase in the PaCO2 >65 mmHg\n\n        4. Increased work of breathing with respiratory rate >75 b/min for >2h\n\n        5. AOP requiring resuscitation\n\n        6. Initiation of nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) for respiratory\n           support"
