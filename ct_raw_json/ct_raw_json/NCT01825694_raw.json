The investigators aim to develop a\n      treatment approach that is community-friendly, well-tolerated, and deliverable by substance\n      abuse counselors (SAC) in outpatient settings.  The proposed Trauma-Focused Substance Abuse\n      Treatment (TFSAT) aims to reduce PTSD symptoms and substance use and build coping skills.\n      The investigators propose to adapt an evidence-based trauma program, Cognitive-Behavioral\n      Intervention for Trauma in Schools (CBITS), for adolescent substance abusers (ASAbusers); to\n      assess the acceptability and feasibility of the integrated approach; and to pilot test the\n      new program against standard care.\n\n      The investigators hypothesize that the intervention group, compared to the control group,\n      will reduce substance use and symptoms for traumatic stress."
