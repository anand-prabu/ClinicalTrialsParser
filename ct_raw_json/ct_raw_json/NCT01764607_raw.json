The  calcineurin\n      inhibitor (tacrolimus or cyclosporine) will be discontinued once the  transplant doctors\n      find that the participants Sirolimus is therapeutic by checking blood tests once a week x 3\n      weeks. Approximately 5 weeks after starting Sirolimus, the  squamous cell skin cancer  will\n      be removed by a surgeon. Participant next follow up  visit for  the study is scheduled one\n      year post-operatively. .The study will look at your squamous cell skin cancer under the\n      microscope to see if sirolimus had any effect at treating your squamous cell skin cancer."
