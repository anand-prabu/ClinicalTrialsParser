The compound VX-770 (Ivacaftor \u00d2) is hoped to be the first milestone along this\n      way. Progression of lung disease is now so gradual in many centres that sensitive indicators\n      of early lung disease (small airways disease) are critically needed to assess the effects of\n      such new treatments. In this context, assessment of ventilation inhomogeneity by the\n      measurement called Lung clearance index (LCI) seems to be the most promising tool. However,\n      to get approval by health authorities, new measures used in drug evaluation need to fulfill\n      strict criteria.  For LCI, the investigators still need to prove its long term significance:\n      How well does the LCI measurement  predict the long term lung disease course? Therefore, in\n      this study the investigators want to measure LCI at baseline in a large patient cohort and\n      establish how well it predicts the patients' disease course over the next 2 years."
