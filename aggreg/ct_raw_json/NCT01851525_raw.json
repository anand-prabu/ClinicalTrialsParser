            "textblock": "Catheter ablation has emerged as an effective therapy for atrial fibrillation (AF).\n      However, achievement of complete& durable isolation of the pulmonary veins (PVs) is\n      challenging, primary limited both by operator experience and also the limits of currently\n      available ablation technology. Direct contact force sensing (CFS) is a novel technology that\n      may help to ensure adequate lesion delivery.  CFS may also help to improve the safety\n      profile of catheter ablation.  The purpose of this study is to compare two strategies of\n      wide antral PV isolation plus linear ablation for persistent AF:\n\n        1. guided by contact force sensing (CFS) OR\n\n        2. blinded to contact force sensing (CFS) - i.e. standard approach"
