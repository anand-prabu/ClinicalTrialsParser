            "textblock": "Children with type 1 diabetes face complex self-management regimens, making adherence\n      challenging and ultimately resulting in poor blood sugar control. Several common barriers\n      interfere with diabetes control such as limited knowledge or challenges with staying\n      motivated. Efficacious strategies exist to improve diabetes self-management including but\n      not limited to diabetes education or family therapy.  Patients and families often do not\n      access these strategies, in part due to healthcare systems-based issues such as\n      accessibility, provider availability, or insurance coverage.\n\n      A family-centered approach has been suggested to tailor diabetes care to provide improved\n      outcomes for each child.  Family-centered care engages the family in the decision-making\n      about the child's health and well-being. In this study we will take a family-centered\n      approach to providing diabetes self-management by identifying families' unique\n      self-management barriers through a 10-minute survey tool called PRISM (Problem Recognition\n      in Illness Self-Management). Based upon the results of PRISM, we will provide tailored\n      self-management resources (interventions) to meet the family's needs.  We will coordinate\n      group-based delivery of the resources with routine diabetes clinic visits.  These\n      group-based resources will be delivered in four 75-minute sessions over a year.\n\n      The primary goal of this study is to compare the effectiveness of family-centered tailoring\n      of diabetes self-management resources with the untailored approach of usual care.  We\n      hypothesize that the family-centered model of care with tailored resources will improve the\n      outcomes of glycemic control and quality of life among children with type 1 diabetes and\n      their parents."

Over 175,000 US children have type 1 diabetes and face a lifetime of\n      self-management decisions in an attempt to delay or prevent complications, avoid\n      hypoglycemia, and maintain quality of life for themselves and their parents. Although\n      efficacious self-management resources exist, most children with diabetes struggle to manage\n      their disease. Several barriers to diabetes management exist, including knowledge,\n      motivation, and family interactions. Because barriers are unique for each child and family,\n      family-centered approaches are recommended. Currently, no systematic approach exists to\n      identify and address each family's self-management barriers. Information from PRISM (Problem\n      Recognition in Illness Self-Management), a 10-minute survey tool, could help families and\n      clinicians make better decisions to address these barriers, ultimately improving outcomes,\n      fostering family-centered diabetes care, and optimizing resource use.\n\n      This randomized pragmatic trial will compare outcomes from PRISM-based, family-centered\n      tailoring of self-management resources (intervention) to outcomes from the untailored\n      approach of usual care. Our specific aims are to assess the effect of family-centered\n      tailoring of diabetes self-management resources on outcomes that matter to the children and\n      parents: glycemic control (A1c and fear of hypoglycemia) and child and parent quality of\n      life.\n\n      Children 8-16 years old with diabetes (100 each in usual care and intervention groups) and\n      their parents will be enrolled at two large pediatric diabetes clinics. We will 1) use PRISM\n      to identify families' unique self-management barriers; 2) tailor self-management resources\n      to identified barriers; and 3) coordinate group-based delivery of the resources with routine\n      diabetes visits. The group-based resources will be delivered in four 75-minute sessions over\n      12 months. A1c will be assessed after sessions, and fear of hypoglycemia and quality of life\n      for the child and parent will be assessed. Outcomes will be compared with mixed effects\n      models."
