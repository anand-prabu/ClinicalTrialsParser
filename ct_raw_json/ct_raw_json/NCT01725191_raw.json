To define and describe the toxicities of tivantinib administered on this schedule.\n\n      III. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of tivantinib (capsule as well as powder\n      formulation) in children with refractory cancer.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. To preliminarily define the antitumor activity of tivantinib within the confines of a\n      phase 1 study.\n\n      II.
