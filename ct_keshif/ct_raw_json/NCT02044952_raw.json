Patients commonly experience abdominal pain, diarrhea\uff0cmalnutrition and malaise which\n      result in decreased quality of life and an increased risk of chronic disability and\n      unemployment.\n\n      Tripterygium Glycosides(T2) is a chloroform/methanol extract Tripterygium wilfordii Hook F\n      (TWHF), the traditional Chinese medicine, used in rheumatoid arthritis and nephritis. It has\n      both immune-modulatory and anti-inflammatory activities. Our previous animal studies have\n      revealed that the major component of T2, triptolide, could prevent the development of\n      chronic colitis in interleukin-10 deficient mice. The phase I clinical trial in our\n      institute also demonstrated that T2 is efficient for induction of remission in patients with\n      mild to moderate active crohn's disease. The common adverse effects of T2 are leucopenia,\n      liver renal toxicity, oligospermia and amenorrhea.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to assess the effect and safety of Tripterygium Glycosides in\n      the treatment of Crohn's disease for induction remission and compare the therapeutic effect\n      with patients who only received mesalazine."
