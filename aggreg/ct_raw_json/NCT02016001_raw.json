But there has been no such data reported in our part\n      of the world. This indicates the need to determine the effective concentration of fluoride\n      in locally manufactured tooth pastes for accomplishment of the goal of prevention against\n      dental caries.\n\n      This will be a Parallel Group, Double-Blind, Randomized Controlled Trial, over a period of\n      18 months. The study will be conducted in a randomly selected school of Karachi city.\n      Participants will be the cohort of regular school children aged 12-14 years. Sample size for\n      the present study attained was 330 (165 in both groups), expected attrition rate will be\n      kept as 15%, so the total sample size is 330 + 50 = 380 (190 in each group)."
