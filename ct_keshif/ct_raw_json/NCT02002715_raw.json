First Visit (Visit 1, day -3):\n\n           A full medical history and physical examination to be undertaken to determine whether\n           patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.\n\n           After the informed consent has been signed, the following samples are obtained from all\n           patients: blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology,\n           biochemistry and chest x-ray). A urine pregnancy test will be performed in women of\n           childbearing potential.\n\n           Bronchial provocation test by methacholine inhalation are performed to determined\n           whether it presences of bronchial non-specific hyper-responsiveness.

Second Visit (Visit 2, Week 0):\n\n           A physical examination was to be performed. All laboratory tests results are obtained\n           to determine whether patients meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria.

During Treatment (Week 0 to Week 4/8/16,every 4 weeks):\n\n           Patients were to take study medication for 4 weeks in 4-week group,8 weeks in 8-week\n           group,16 weeks in 16-week group.

Third Visit (Visit 3, Week 4/8/16):\n\n           A physical examination were to be performed. The Diary Card were collected and\n           reviewed. Adverse events, secondary complications, concurrent medication will be\n           recorded.Hypertonic saline induced sputum samples for cell differential is taken from\n           enrolled patients.Blood samples for routine clinical laboratory tests (haematology and\n           biochemistry) were obtained\n\n        5.
