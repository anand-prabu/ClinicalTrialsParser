    <textblock>
      Approximately 3,000 of clinically significant isolates of different species from respective
      respective sources  in geographically distinct Russian cities will be collected and tested
      on ceftaroline and other antimicrobials.

        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  Isolates derived from patients' clinical material will be included in the study

          -  Isolates collected retro- and prospectively will be included in the study (from
             01.01.2008 till 31.12.2012)

          -  Isolates, allocated of a clinical material of adult patients (&gt; 18 years), should
             make not less than 70 % from total number of included isolates)

          -  All included isolates should be unique:  only one isolate can be included in the
             study of each biological type from each patient

          -  All isolates should correspond to clinic-laboratory criteria of the etiologic
             importance, i.e. should be derived from patients with infection symptoms from the
             corresponding clinical material

          -  Case report form (CRF) (Appendix 1) should be correctly completed for each isolate

        Exclusion Criteria:

          -  ESBL-producing representatives of Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL-Extended-spectrum
             beta-lactamase)

          -  Isolates, arrived in the central laboratory contaminated or unviable
