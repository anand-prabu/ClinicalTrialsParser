      The study will be an open-label, pilot study in virologically suppressed patients comparing
      the efficacy, safety and tolerability of two Antiretroviral regimen strategies:

      Arm A: &quot;Immediate switch&quot; Rilpivirine/Emtricitabine/Tenofovir (single tablet formulation
      (STF))at randomization

      Arm B: &quot;Delayed switch&quot; Continue Nevirapine/Lamivudine/other Nucleoside reverse
      transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI)through 24 weeks then switch to STF of
      Rilpivirine/emtrictabine/tenofovir and followed through 48 weeks.

      The current study is designed to be the first study to compare a continued nevirapine-based
      regimen to a switch to the FDC of rilpivirine/emtricitabine/tenofovir. Rwanda is a model
      country for implementation of newer approaches to more innovative ART strategies with an
      excellent National HIV Treatment program in place but has limited experience with clinical
      trials and as with most African countries has no clinical experience with Rilpivirine in
      treating HIV infected adults.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:

          -  HIV-1 infection, as documented by any licensed ELISA test kit and confirmed by
             Western blot at any time prior to study entry. A second antibody test by a method
             other than ELISA is acceptable as an alternative confirmatory test or a previous
             detectable HIV RNA level

          -  HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification of the viral load assay in use
             in-country within the last 12 months

          -  Screening HIV RNA level below the limit of quantification as defined by the local
             assay

          -  At least twelve months of stable first-line antiretroviral therapy consisting of
             nevirapine and 2 nRTIs approved by the Rwandan HIV Treatment guidelines. (No prior
             changes in ART are allowed)

          -  Enrolled in the Rwanda National ART Program with no in-country transfer within the
             program.

                       should consist of at least 400 total kcals and 117 kcals of fat (13 grams)
                       to be assessed at screening.

                    -  For women of reproductive potential, negative serum or urine pregnancy test
                       within 4 weeks of initiating study medications and a negative urine

          -  &quot;Women of reproductive potential&quot; is defined as women who have not been
             post-menopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., who have had menses within
             the preceding 24 months) and have not undergone surgical sterilization (e.g.,

             mucocutaneous herpes simplex, and other non-serious illnesses (as judged by the site
             investigator) have no restriction.

          -  Known allergy/sensitivity to study drugs or their formulations.

          -  Active drug or alcohol use or dependence that, in the opinion of the site
