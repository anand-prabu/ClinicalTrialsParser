      A study to assess the Effects of MEDI4736 in Patients With Locally Advanced or Metastatic
      Non Small Cell Lung Cancer in terms of efficacy, safety and tolerability
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the efficacy, safety, tolerability of a new drug,
      MEDI4736, in patients with Locally Advanced or Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer.
      MEDI4736 will be investigated in patients who have received at least two prior treatment
      regimens including one platinum-based chemotherapy
