Progressive patients will be referred to\n      radiotherapy.\n\n      Radiation guidelines:\n\n      30.6 Gray (Gy) will be applied  in 1.8 to 2Gy fractions in conformal radiation to tumor bed.\n      Radiation will be done in standard  accelerators and according to standard guidelines used\n      in treatment for all brain tumor patients."

Diagnosis of DIPG based on short classic history, clinical signs (long tract signs,\n             cranial nerve deficits and ataxia) and classic MRI features (more than 2/3 of the\n             tumor is located within the pons and tumor encompasses more than 60% of the pons)\n\n          4. A patient will be eligible for reirradiation if progression is diagnosed following a\n             period of at least 4 months of stable disease after first irradiation.\n\n          5. Progression may be either clinical (new neurological deficit or worsening of an old\n             deficit in two separate physical examinations) or radiological (tumor growth of >25%)\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          1. Radiation necrosis post first irradiation\n\n          2. Unstable vital signs\n\n          3. Less than X months since previous irradiation"
