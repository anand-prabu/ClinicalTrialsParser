Based on the results , the patient will be sent\n      in rheumatology consultation for implementation of treatment if necessary .\n\n      Therefore included women hospitalized in medical services , gynecology, surgery and\n      orthopedics Hospital Departmental Vendee , aged 50 to 80 years. Will not be included women\n      who could answer a simple questionnaire and those previously treated for osteoporosis or\n      have already received a bone density there is less than 3 years old ."
