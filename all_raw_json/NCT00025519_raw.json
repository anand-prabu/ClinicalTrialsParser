Sometimes\n      the transplanted cells can be rejected by the body's tissues. Mycophenolate mofetil,\n      tacrolimus, and donor white blood cells may prevent this from happening.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II trial to study the effectiveness of chemotherapy followed by peripheral\n      stem cell transplantation in treating patients who have metastatic or recurrent kidney\n      cancer."

Patients receive tacrolimus IV over 24 hours or orally\n      daily on days -3 to 35 and oral mycophenolate mofetil twice daily on days -3 to 28 as\n      graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. Patients undergo allogeneic peripheral blood stem\n      cell transplantation over 1-2 hours on day 0.\n\n      Patients maintaining a mixed chimerism with no evidence of grade III or IV GVHD receive\n      donor lymphocyte infusions (DLI) on days 60, 90, and 120. Patients may receive additional\n      DLI as needed. Patients with limited chronic GVHD receive oral thalidomide daily beginning\n      after day 80 and continuing for 1 year or until disease progression or resolution of chronic\n      GVHD.\n\n      Patients are followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months and then every 6 months thereafter.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A maximum of 20-40 patients (10-20 per stratum) will be accrued for this\n      study."
