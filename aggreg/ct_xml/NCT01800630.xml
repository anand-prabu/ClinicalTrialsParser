      Open-label Phase 1 sequential dose-escalation study of 10 increasing doses (3 to 6 patients
      each)to determine and characterize the DLTs and MTD of gemcitabine HCl oral formulation
      (D07001-F4). Patients will be assigned to receive oral D07001-F4 on Days 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and
      12 of 4 21-day cycles each to further characterize safety and tolerability.
