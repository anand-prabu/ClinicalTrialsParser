Given betaine's reported beneficial\n      effects on fatty liver and lipid profile, A-F Betafood\u00ae may have a beneficial effect on\n      gallbladder function.\n\n      The objective of the study is to assess the effect of A-F Betafood\u00ae on gallbladder and liver\n      function as measured by gallbladder ultrasounds and liver function tests.  The hypothesis is\n      that A-F Betafood\u00ae will improve gallbladder and liver function after the 12 week treatment\n      period.\n\n      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group study\n      with two arms.  This study will consist of a single 12 week treatment period. The planned\n      sample size for this study is 50 overweight female subjects, with 25 subjects randomized\n      equally to each of the two study arms in double-blind manner at a ratio of 1:1"
