            "textblock": "Postoperative ileus is generally referred to as the transient impairment of bowel motility\n      after abdominal or other surgery and diagnosed by postoperative abdominal pain vomiting\n      constipation and distension.\n\n      The potential complications of prolonged POI include increased postoperative pain, increased\n      nausea and vomiting, pulmonary complications, poor wound healing, delay in resuming oral\n      intake, delay in postoperative mobilization, prolonged hospitalization, and increased\n      health-care costs. The estimated economic impact of POI in the United States is $7.5 billion\n      per year, excluding the expenses of work loss.\n\n      In view of these complications and economic burden a number of pharmacologic and\n      non-pharmacologic strategies have been adopted by the doctors all over the world to reduce\n      the burden of postoperative ileus.These programs involve transverse or curved surgical\n      incisions, removal of nasogastric tubes at the end of anesthesia, intraoperative and\n      postoperative analgesia, early postoperative feeding, mobilization, and gum chewing.\n\n      The use of gum chewing has emerged as a new and simple modality for decreasing POI. And\n      reviews have concluded that there is consistent benefit for patients from gum chewing after\n      the intestinal surgery; colonic surgery and gynecological surgery.\n\n      This study is based on the hypothesis that postoperative gum chewing is beneficial in\n      prevention of postoperative ileus after reversal of ileostomy."
