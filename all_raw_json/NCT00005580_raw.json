Patients are assigned to one of two\n      treatment groups.\n\n        -  Group I: Patients receive bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours followed by fludarabine IV over\n           30 minutes daily on days 1-5.\n\n        -  Group II: Patients receive fludarabine IV over 30 minutes daily on days 1-5 followed by\n           bryostatin 1 IV over 24 hours.\n\n      In both groups, courses repeat every 4 weeks for patients with stable or responding disease.\n\n      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of fludarabine and bryostatin 1 until the\n      maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at\n      which 2 of 6 patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. Once the MTD for fludarabine is\n      determined, the dose of bryostatin 1 is escalated.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: Approximately 30-60 patients will be accrued for this study within 3\n      years."
