During the\n      healing process, swelling and/or bruising is likely to occur. A drug called ARTISS Fibrin\n      Sealant may or may not lessen these effects. This study is looking to see the effects of\n      ARTISS on adhering tissue and improving wound healing in an external rhinoplasty. The\n      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of rhinoplasty using\n      ARTISS compared to rhinoplasty without using ARTISS in patients undergoing rhinoplasty\n      performed through an external approach."
