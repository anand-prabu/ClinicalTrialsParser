Twenty to 30 percents of patients treated for\n      periodontal diseases display more or less pronounced persistence of periodontal tissue\n      infection, inflammation, and destruction. The therapeutic additional value of photodynamic\n      anti-infectious treatment remains controversial. The objective of this study is to evaluate\n      the mid-term effect of the photodynamic device Fotosan\u00ae630 on severe periodontitis treatment\n      outcomes and to define its specific therapeutic indications."
