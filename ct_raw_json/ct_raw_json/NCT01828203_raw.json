ASIA) neurological examination\n      measured between 3 months and 1 year post-injury, compared to placebo.\n\n      The secondary hypotheses are that the above minocycline treatment will also results in\n      improvement in ASIA sensory improvement, in ASIA grade and in functional outcome as assessed\n      by Spinal Cord Independence Measure (SCIM) and Short Form 36 (SF-36), compared to placebo.\n      In addition the effect of minocycline on neurological and functional outcome after SCI is\n      expected to be more pronounced in those subjects with motor incomplete SCI compared to those\n      with motor compete SCI. A subgroup analysis will be undertaken to examine this hypothesis."
