            "textblock": "Previous research has suggested that earlier intervention may contribute to better outcomes\n      in autism. Answering the question \"how early?\" has significant health and educational\n      implications for age of screening for autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and age of entry into\n      early intervention for children with ASD. With the increased number of young children\n      identified with ASD, there is a pressing need for evidence-based, manualized intervention\n      that is accessible to and implemented by parents within their natural environments. This\n      collaborative project is directed by Dr. Amy Wetherby at Florida State University and Dr.\n      Nathan Call at Emory University  to compare the effectiveness of parent implemented\n      intervention for toddlers with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The major objective is to\n      directly compare two parent intervention conditions: 1) a parent-implemented intervention\n      (PII) offered in a 2-3 weekly sessions to teach parents treatment strategies to support\n      social communication skills within everyday routines, activities, and places for 25 hours a\n      week; and 2) an information, education and support group (IES) offered twice monthly.\n      Ninety-two children who 12 months of age and are at risk for developing an ASD because they\n      have an older sibling who has an identified ASD will participate.  Participants will be\n      recruited from those children who are part of prerequisite studies on ASD in infancy that\n      are also being conducted at Emory University. Families will be randomly assigned to either\n      PII or IES at 12 months of age for a total of 9 months of intervention. The effectiveness of\n      PII and IES will be examined with growth trajectories of social communication and autism\n      symptoms and group outcomes on developmental level and adaptive behavior. The findings of\n      this study will provide evidence of the effects of parent implemented intervention beginning\n      at 12 months of age and substantiate that autism screening for toddlers is crucial for\n      families to access early intervention."
