The groups are as follows:\n\n        -  Group 1: Insulin and sitagliptin\n\n        -  Group 2: Insulin and metformin\n\n        -  Group 3: Insulin and combination of sitagliptin and metformin\n\n        -  The study is a randomized open label design. All subjects will undergo a screening\n           visit; if inclusion and exclusion criteria are fulfilled they will be enrolled in the\n           study. At the time of enrollment the subject will continue their home insulin regimen\n           and will be randomized to an add an oral hypoglycemic agent(s) : metformin, sitagliptin\n           or combination therapy (metformin and sitagliptin). The total duration on study\n           medication will be 6 weeks. All subjects will undergo a baseline mixed meal tolerance\n           test (MMTT) in their standard or usual insulin Each subject will undergo a total of two\n           studies. Blood draws will be necessary."
