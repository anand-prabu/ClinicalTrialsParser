In the recent years the Visible Ear Simulator has been used as an introduction to\n      mastoidectomy in the Danish temporal bone course curriculum before letting the participants\n      move on to dissection training in order to maximize the yield from the dissection training.\n      Instructors have the impression that participants perform better in dissection after the\n      simulator training session has been introduced. Our pilot study suggests that participants\n      perform better in the simulator compared to traditional dissection training. This could be\n      due to a reduction of the cognitive load in the virtual simulator.\n\n      These observations lead to the hypothesis that virtual simulation training of mastoidectomy\n      provides an effect that improves performance in traditional dissection training."
