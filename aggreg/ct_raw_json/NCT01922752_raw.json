The metastases must\n             be neurologically stable, on or off corticosteroids. Patients can have low level,\n             asymptomatic brain lesions that do not require surgical/radiation intervention\n             acutely. Patients with symptomatic lesions with impending neurologic compromise\n             should be appropriately treated with high dose steroids/radiation and may be\n             re-evaluated for this study when neurologically stable.\n\n          -  Patients must have completed any prior anticancer treatment and must have recovered\n             from any acute toxicities. The period between the last dose of prior treatment and\n             the first dose of study drug treatment must be at least 1 week for radiotherapy and\n             at least 2 to 3 weeks for all other modalities of therapy including chemotherapy,\n             monoclonal antibody therapy, immunotherapy, other investigational drugs, or other\n             kinase inhibitors.\n\n          -  Other criteria apply.\n\n        Exclusion Criteria:\n\n          -  The patient has ongoing or active infection requiring parenteral antibiotics.\n\n          -  The patient has uncontrolled hypertension despite adequate therapy (ie, systolic\n             blood pressure higher than 150 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure higher than 90 mm Hg\n             found on 2 separate occasions separated by 1 week).\n\n          -  The patient has uncontrolled diabetes mellitus (despite therapeutic intervention) and\n             occurrence of more than 2 episodes of ketoacidosis in the 12 months prior to the\n             first dose of study drug.\n\n          -  The patient has an active second malignancy other than curatively resected basal cell\n             carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, in situ carcinoma of the\n             cervix, or other cancers for which they are treated with curative intent, and no\n             known active disease in the 3 years prior to enrollment.\n\n          -  The patient has a primary brain tumor. Patients may have brain metastases from\n             another primary site.\n\n          -  The patient has QTcF interval greater than 450 msec, has a known history of QTcF\n             prolongation, is taking medications known to prolong QTcF, or has a history of\n             torsade de pointes.\n\n          -  The patient has a prior ALK-inhibitor-related toxicity or any other prior\n             therapy-related acute toxicity that has not resolved prior to the first dose of study\n             drug.\n\n          -  Other criteria apply."
