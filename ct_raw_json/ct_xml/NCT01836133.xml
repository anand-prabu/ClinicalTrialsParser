      This multicenter, observational study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of Tarceva
      (erlotinib) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic adenocarcinoma non-small cell
      lung cancer and an ECOG performance status of 0-1. Eligible patients receiving Tarceva
      according to the Summary of Product Characteristics and local label will be followed for the
      duration of their treatment.
