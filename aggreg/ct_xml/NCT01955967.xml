    <textblock>
      The aim of this randomized double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study is to
      investigate in a prospective way the effect of lidocaine in patients with trigeminal
      neuralgia. Included patients will undergo four weekly sessions, two of which with lidocaine
      (5mgs/kg) and two with placebo infusions administered over 60 minutes. Effect will be
      measured with pain diaries and visual analogue scales.
