      The purpose of this study is to:

        1. Compare the pharmacokinetics profiles of pregabalin sustained release tablet (300mg) to
           immediate release capsule(150mg * 2).

        2. Evaluate the effectiveness of food to pharmacokinetics profile of Pregabalin sustained
           release tablet.
