  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a 3 months, single site, prospective randomized clinical study of patients diagnosed
      with a chronic wound, to assess changes in healing rate, by measuring differences in wound
      area when treating chronic wounds with the Next Science Wound Gel compared to a Triple
      Antibiotic Ointment (Standard of Care, SOC).

          -  Male or female less than 18 years old

          -  Presence of a full-thickness wound for less than one month

          -  Periwound TCpO2 is less than 40 mmHg

          -  Subjects with bleeding dyscrasia or with medical conditions that would make a
             bleeding complication likely
