Using the one-stage Fleming's design, in order to\n      reject the null hypothesis in a one-sided test with a type I error of 5% and power 80%, 73\n      patients will be needed to enter the study.\n\n      Analysis population:\n\n        -  Intent-to-treat (ITT) population: all patients who will have given their informed\n           consent and who will have been correctly registered to the study\n\n        -  Evaluable population for tumor response: all treated patients, without major protocol\n           deviation, with at least one tumor evaluation while on treatment (except for early\n           disease progression or death) and evaluable for response\n\n        -  Safety population: the subset of the ITT population that took at least one dose of\n           study medication\n\n      Primary analysis:\n\n      The primary efficacy parameter will be PFS rate at 1 year and it will be calculated in the\n      ITT population.\n\n      Analysis of secondary endpoints:\n\n      Response to treatment will be described in a frequency table along with the corresponding\n      percentages and 95% exact confidence intervals.\n\n      Kaplan-Meier method will be used to estimate median PFS and overall survival (OS) values and\n      95% confidence intervals.
