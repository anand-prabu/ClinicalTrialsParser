  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the nearly 75% of patients living with type 2 diabetes (T2DM) that do not use insulin,
      decisions regarding self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) are unclear. SMBG testing is a
      resource intensive activity without firmly established patient benefits. While SMBG holds
      great promise for sparking favorable behavior change, the potential for no benefit or even
      patient harm must be acknowledged. Possible negative effects on patient quality of life must
      be more closely examined along with the speculative benefits of SMBG in non-insulin treated
      T2DM. Among studies examining this issue a general consensus is evolving; while SMBG may or
      may not be useful, its value can only be fully appreciated when the SMBG results are
      provided to patients in a useful manner. The overarching goal of this proposal is to assess
      the impact of three different SMBG testing approaches on patient-centered outcomes in
      patients with non-insulin treated T2DM within the real-world, clinic setting. In this
      pragmatic trial, 450 patients will be randomized to one of the following three SMBG testing
      regimens: 1) no SMBG testing, 2) once daily SMBG testing with standard patient feedback
      consisting of glucose values being immediately reported to the patient through the glucose
      meter, and 3) once daily SMBG testing with enhanced patient feedback consisting of glucose
      values being immediately reported to the patient PLUS automated, tailored feedback
      messaging. The first two arms represent common SMBG testing approaches. The third arm is an
      enhanced, patient-centered approach to SMBG testing. SMBG values will be evaluated at
      routine clinic visits over 52 weeks.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the context of a controlled and randomized but pragmatic trial, we seek to answer the
      following question: does SMBG testing make sense for Non-insulin treated (NIT) diabetes
      mellitus (DM) patients in terms of either A1c values or QOL. We will also examine whether or
      not patients with different baseline characteristics might see different outcomes from three
      SMBG testing approaches. To achieve our goal of testing SMBG options in community-based
      primary care practices, the study has been designed to minimize as much as possible any
      interruptions in or alterations to standard daily patient care. We will recruit 450 patients
      from five primary care practices. Patients will be followed for one year. During routine
      clinic visits, their health care providers will be guided to modify therapies based on ADA
      guidelines, which focus on A1c values and SMBG values if available.

      Study Arms Two of the three study arms were chosen to reflect existing, widely used options
      for patients with NIT DM. Arm 3, described below, of this trial is particularly novel in
      that it tests the potential benefit of new technology now available to these patients;
      namely, wireless transmission of blood glucose test results accompanied by instantaneous
      tailored feedback. While this option may hold great promise for patients and their
      providers, data supporting this are lacking. The results of this study will inform consumers
      and providers about whether this new technology can support efforts to alter behaviors in a
      way that results in improved A1c values or better quality of life. Particularly appealing is
      that this approach employs technology that supports more efficient use of SMBG values by
      both patients and their providers. In terms of their pragmatic 'fit', all three groups fit
      easily into current practice at the participating practices. For example, they do not
      require extra clinic visits (other than possibly the initial recruitment assessment), and
      while staff will need to download glucose reports for patients in Arms 2 and 3, this will be
      a very simple, streamlined procedure. In terms of risks to patients, none of the three
      groups puts patients at any additional risk, because all three are versions of 'standard
      practice' for this patient population and doctors are free to alter therapies and testing
      schedules as they normally would.

        -  Arm 1: No SMBG Testing This group represents an approach to SMBG that is supported by
           research and followed by many primary care providers. Patients randomized to this group
           will not be provided a meter, but will receive standardized education detailing the
           signs and symptoms of hyper- and hypoglycemia and information regarding lifestyle
           approaches for the maintenance of normoglycemia. If they have previously been obtaining
           SMBG values, they will be asked to discontinue. Healthcare providers and staff will be
           alerted that these patients are in the no testing arm and will be encouraged to
           maintain treatment fidelity except where patient safety is a concern. Study
           coordinators will provide patients with both written and oral educational information
           supporting the approach of no SMBG testing, with a view toward reconciling any messages
           they may have received in the past or will receive in the future regarding SMBG. This
           education will recur every 3-6 months at routine clinic visits (the recommended
           follow-up frequency for persons with T2DM) by their health care providers. A1c will be
           obtained during these visits as per usual care and providers will adjust medication and
           lifestyle recommendations as they see fit. Providers will be given an algorithm based
           on current ADA recommendations relating to A1c results to use as a guide for treatment
           modification.

        -  Arm 2: Once Daily Testing with Standard Feedback This group represents an approach
           taken by a large proportion of NIT DM patients in the US. At the assessment visit,
           patients will be given the study glucose meter and testing supplies, along with
           instruction for their use. They will be asked to test once daily and at different times
           of the day on a rotating basis, in order to obtain a representative distribution of
           blood glucose values over time. The meter will have wireless capability such that it
           will transmit both the SMBG result and the time of testing to a secure server. Subjects
           will also note the circumstances of their test times on the glucose meter (e.g.,
           fasting, 2 hours post meal, etc.) and this information will also be sent to the server.
           As with Arm 1, Arm 2 patients will receive training in hyper- and hypoglycemia and
           approaches for maintaining normoglycemia. They will also receive training and written
           material instructing them in how to interpret their SMBG readings and actions they
           might take in response to those values. SMBG results will be reviewed at all clinic
           visits (3-6 month intervals) by the primary care provider using a print out of glucose
           meter values downloaded and analyzed wirelessly. During the early phase of the project,
           a streamlined system will be developed to allow participating clinic staff to download
           the SMBG values with minimal effort and create the accompanying SMBG report for the
           patient's provider. This customized report, detailing blood glucose averages, ranges
           and standard deviations, will be generated for all group 2 participants and given to
           their provider prior to each routine clinic visit. The report will identify problematic
           glucose values (hypo- and hyperglycemia) and suggested approaches for addressing these
           problems. Providers will review the results with the participant and make appropriate
           treatment recommendations based upon blood glucose trends. The recommendations in the
           report will be driven by an algorithm for treatment modification based upon ADA
           guidelines which will include suggestions for both lifestyle and pharmacotherapy
           adjustments. At the end of each clinic visit, patients will be instructed by their
           primary care provider to continue once daily testing. Using shared decision-making and
           standardized testing recommendations, the health care provider and the patient will
           jointly determine the testing approach (e.g., timing of once daily testing) the patient
           will employ over the next monitoring period.

        -  Arm 3: Once Daily Testing with Enhanced Feedback This Arm represents an enhanced,
           patient-centered approach. Participants randomized to Arm 3 will, like the Arm 2
           participants, be instructed to test once daily and at different times of the day, and
           their glucose values will be transmitted wirelessly to a server. However, for Arm 3
           participants, the blood glucose values will be analyzed automatically each time a value
           is transmitted. Based upon the value, instantaneous personalized feedback will be
           provided via wireless messaging to the patients' glucose meters. These messages will
           not include suggestions for pharmacological therapy modification but will be
           motivational in nature, including suggestions to enhance efforts at lifestyle
           management and adherence to pharmacologic therapy if prescribed. At weekly intervals,
           an analysis of the SMBG values from the previous week will be sent to the glucose meter
           highlighting trends and identifying specific problematic times. Subjects will also
           receive messages reminding them of upcoming clinic visits (beginning 1 week prior to
           their scheduled visit). As with Arm 2, SMBG results and customized reports will be
           downloaded and reviewed at all clinic visits by the primary care provider. In addition,
           a summary of the messages sent wirelessly to the patient since the most recent visit
           will be included. Like the glucose values report, this message report will be given to
           all providers at the beginning of the clinic visit and providers will be asked to also
           review these results with the patient. Providers will make appropriate treatment
           recommendations based upon blood glucose trends and messages. Report recommendations
           will be driven by an algorithm for treatment modification based upon ADA treatment
           guidelines and include suggestions for lifestyle and pharmacotherapy adjustments. At
           the end of the clinic visit, patients will be instructed by their primary care provider
           to continue testing their blood glucose once daily and collaboratively determine the
           testing approach (e.g., timing of once daily testing)  the patient will employ over the
           next monitoring period.

      Potential Alterations to the Testing Recommendations: Providers will be strongly encouraged
      to maintain SMBG testing fidelity based upon the treatment arm to which a patient is
      randomized; however, if a provider believes that testing should occur more frequently due to
      concern for serious unrecognized hypo- or hyperglycemia or for any other reason, testing
      recommendations may be modified. This approach provides for patient safety and preserves the
      pragmatic nature of the trial. Glucose testing strips will be provided to participants on a
      quarterly basis. If a provider deems that SMBG testing should occur more frequently than
      what is recommended to the patient based on the study arm to which he or she has been
      randomized, the health care provider must write the prescription for the additional test
      strips and the strips must be paid for out-of-pocket or through insurance. Following an
      intention to treat model, patients who opt not to follow the testing regimen to which they
      were randomly assigned will be encouraged to remain in the study. Any deviations from the
      assigned SMBG testing protocol will be readily known via the glucose meter reports.

      Mixed methods approach. A mixed methods approach in which both qualitative and quantitative
      data are collected provides advantages when exploring complex research questions such as the
      ones posed in this proposal. The quantitative data will allow us to assess changes in
      objective measures, while the qualitative data will provide a deeper understanding of
      patients' and providers' experiences with the various components of the SMBG testing arms
      (e.g., the meters, SMBG results, personalized messaging, downloadable reports, treatment
      algorithms, etc.) It is also the case that, while some patients are interested in seeing
      hard facts and figures, others prefer testimonials from patients like themselves. The mixed
      methods approach enables us to provide both types of information, increasing the
      effectiveness and uptake of our dissemination efforts.

      Recruitment and randomization procedures. Patient Recruitment: All potentially eligible
      patients expressing interest in the study will complete an initial screening phone call. The
      call will take about 15 minutes, during which a member of the study team will describe the
      study, answer questions, and conduct a short set of simple screening to determine
      eligibility. Eligible patients who remain interested in participation will complete an
      assessment visit with a research coordinator. To decrease patient burden and further engage
      participating practices, assessment visits will occur at the patient's primary care office.
      Assessments will be separate from their appointment with their primary care provider, and
      may or may not occur on the same day as a regularly scheduled clinic visit, though for
      patient convenience we will make every effort to coordinate the assessments with a regular
      clinic visits. During these assessments, the research coordinator will review the study
      details in greater depth, verify all inclusion and exclusion criteria, and obtain written
      informed consent.

      Patient Randomization: After providing informed consent, baseline A1c, and completing all
      baseline study questionnaires, participants will be randomized to one of the three treatment
      arms using sequentially numbered, opaque, sealed envelopes. The research coordinator will
      then review the treatment assignment with the patient, using a standardized script, provide
      the initial training and supplies necessary for participation in that study arm  and answer
      any remaining questions.
