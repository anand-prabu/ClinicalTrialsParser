            "textblock": "Technetium-99m (99mTc) is the most widely used radionuclide in diagnostic nuclear medicine\n      studies. It is used in 20 million diagnostic procedures worldwide annually. It became\n      popular as a radioisotope because of its easy availability from a 99Molybdenum (99Mo)/99mTc\n      generator, historic low costs, and previous high availability.\n\n      The National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Chalk River Laboratories (Ontario, Canada)\n      was shut down unexpectedly in May 2009 following a leak of heavy water. The NRU reactor\n      supplied approximately a third of the world's demand of 99Mo for 99Mo/99mTc generators used\n      diagnostic nuclear medicine tests. Given the fragility of 99Mo supply, alternative\n      radiopharmaceuticals, such as 18F-Sodium Fluoride (18F-NaF), are attractive options to\n      replace 99mTc bone scans. Several studies suggest that 18F-NaF may be more accurate and more\n      sensitive in the detection of bone metastases than 99mTc bone scans.\n\n      The purpose of this study is to compare, in patients with prostate or breast cancer, the\n      accuracy of 18F-NaF PET imaging to 99mTc whole body bone scans with single-photon emission\n      computed tomography (SPECT)."
