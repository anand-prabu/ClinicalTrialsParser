            "textblock": "In this study, investigators aim to evaluate 20 community coalitions and 7,200 participants\n      by: testing passive and active approaches to disseminating the Educational Program to\n      Increase Colorectal Cancer Screening (EPICS) to increase screening rates for colorectal\n      cancer; measuring the extent to which EPICS is accepted and the fidelity of implementation\n      in various settings and estimating the potential translatability and public health impact of\n      EPICS. This four-arm cluster randomized trial (five community coalitions plus 1,800 African\n      Americans, 50-74 years of age, who are not current on colorectal cancer (CRC) screening per\n      arm) compares the following implementation strategies: (1) web access to facilitator\n      training materials and toolkits without technical assistance (TA); (2) web access, but with\n      technical assistance (TA); (3) in-person access to facilitator training materials and\n      toolkits without TA and (4) in-person access with TA. Primary outcome measures are the reach\n      (the proportion of representative eligible community coalitions and individuals\n      participating in the trial) and effectiveness (post-intervention changes in CRC screening\n      rates).  Secondary outcomes include adoption (percentage of community coalitions\n      implementing the EPICS sessions) and implementation (quality and consistency of the\n      intervention delivery).  The extent to which community coalitions continue to implement\n      EPICS post-implementation (maintenance) will also be measured.  Cost-effectiveness analysis\n      will be conducted to compare passive to active dissemination costs. Investigators believe\n      that implementing this evidence-based colorectal cancer screening intervention in\n      partnership with community coalitions will result in more rapid adoption than traditional\n      top-down approaches, and that changes in community CRC screening practices are more likely\n      to be sustainable over time. With its national reach, this study has the potential to\n      enhance understanding of barriers and enablers to the uptake of educational programs aimed\n      at eliminating cancer health disparities."
