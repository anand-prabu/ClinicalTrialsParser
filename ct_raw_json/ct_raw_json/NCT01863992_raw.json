Data\n      will be collected using two age-specific questionnaires of QOL plus a third one validated\n      for assessing chronic health care costs. Questionnaires will be administered at an initial\n      face to face meeting, supplemented by two telephone follow-up calls, to monitor medical\n      expenses, one and two months later."
