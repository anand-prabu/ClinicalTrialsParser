  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to improve the performance of neuroprosthesis for standing
      after SCI by developing and testing new advanced methods that use multiple contact
      peripheral nerve electrodes to slow the onset of fatigue and increase standing duration.
      The new advanced methods will take advantage of the ability of multiple-contact nerve cuff
      electrodes to selectively activate portions of a muscle that perform the same action.
      Alternating activation to multiple muscles (or parts of the same muscle) rather than
      continuously activation the entire muscle group constantly should allow them to rest and
      recover from fatiguing contractions.  This should allow users to remain upright for longer
      periods of time to perform activities of daily living, reduce the risk of falls due to
      fatigue, and increase the potential of receiving the health benefits of standing.

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroprostheses for standing after SCI currently rely on continuous activation of the hip
      and knee extensor muscles, which results in rapid fatigue and ultimately compromises elapsed
      standing time.  The primary objective of this study is to improve the performance of
      neuroprostheses for standing by developing and implementing advanced stimulation paradigms
      that use multi-contact peripheral nerve electrodes to delay fatigue onset and prolong
      standing duration. The new stimulation paradigms will take advantage of the ability of
      multi-contact nerve cuff electrodes to selectively activate independent portions of a
      muscle, or independent muscles that perform the same action.  Such a capability will allow
      one or more muscles (or parts of the same muscle) to rest while the others continue to
      contract to keep the knee extended and the user upright.  Stimulation waveforms that
      alternate activation to multiple muscles performing the same function, rather than
      continuously activate the entire muscle group constantly, should allow muscles to rest and
      recover from fatiguing contractions.

      In addition to these important clinical benefits, the project is also of high impact and
      significance because the methods to be developed will not be specific to any single
      electrode technology or stimulation system. Any clinical or therapeutic application that
      requires a sustained muscular contraction or the production of constant joint torques for
      prolonged periods of time will benefit from the successful completion of this project.

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive an implanted device (IRS-8 or IST-16) and surgically implanted electrodes to excite muscles that move paralyzed muscles.  These electrodes are connected to the implanted stimulator that delivers electrical pulses to the nerves.  These pulses cause the muscles to contract to perform functional movements or to exercise.</description>
