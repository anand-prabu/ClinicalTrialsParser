      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of lumacaftor in
      combination with ivacaftor in subjects with cystic fibrosis aged 6 to 11 years who have the
      F508del-mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene.

          -  Acute respiratory infection, pulmonary exacerbation, or changes in therapy for
             pulmonary disease within 28 days before Day 1 of the study

             an investigational drug study within 30 days prior to Screening

          -  Evidence of lens opacity or cataract at the Screening

          -  Colonization with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status
             at Screening
