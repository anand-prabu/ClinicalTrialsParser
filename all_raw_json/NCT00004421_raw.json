            "textblock": "RATIONALE: Dystonia is a disorder in which the muscles that control voluntary movements are\n      persistently or intermittently contracted (not relaxed). Deep brain stimulation is provided\n      by a small, battery operated implant placed under the skin of the chest that delivers low\n      voltage electrical pulses through a wire under the skin that is connected to a specific area\n      of the brain. Deep brain stimulation may help lessen the symptoms of dystonia.\n\n      PURPOSE: Phase II/III trial to study the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation in treating\n      patients who have dystonia."

After the lead has been implanted, the brain stimulation system is tested.\n      Patients are examined at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after surgery.  A double blinded\n      evaluation, during which the IPG is either off or on, is carried out at 3 and 6 months.\n\n      Patients are followed every 3 months as long as the brain stimulation system remains in\n      place."
