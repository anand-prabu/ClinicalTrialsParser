This study will investigate this approach in a cross section of\n      advanced cancers to examine timeliness, deliverability, rate of actionable targets\n      identified, and our ability to expand this approach into a larger clinical trial setting."

Recognizing genetic\n      mutations that promote disease facilitates targeted treatment; this has been demonstrated in\n      several small subgroups of cancers in which specific genetic mutations or translocations\n      have been successfully treated with targeted chemotherapy agents.\n\n      Analyses of individual patients demonstrate unique molecular signatures for every cancer\n      examined. Frequently, multiple different pathways are involved in disease growth and\n      progression and the dominant process varies from person to person and perhaps even within\n      different sites of disease within one person. As well these variations evolve in response to\n      treatment. With many recognized mutations personalized evaluation of the genetic signature\n      encoded in DNA and RNA may enable directed therapy to the appropriate oncologic pathway\n      thereby providing information to help guide chemotherapy choices."
