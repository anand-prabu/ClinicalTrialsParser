The nasopharyngeal probe will then be withdrawn 2 cm and after a 3-minute equilibration period, nasopharyngeal temperatures will again be recorded. The nasopharyngeal probe withdrawal sequence will be repeated, 2 cm at a time, until only 2 cm remains in the nostril. There will be a total of 10 sets of nasopharyngeal temperatures obtained."

            "textblock": "Low body temperature (hypothermia) is often observed in anesthetized patients.  Mild\n      hypothermia increases complications such as surgical blood loss, postanesthesia recovery and\n      the duration of hospitalization. To assess body temperature and minimize hypothermia-related\n      complications, it is important to have accurate and reliable methods of measuring\n      intraoperative core temperature.  Common practice is to insert a nasopharyngeal (back of the\n      throat from the nose) probe through one of the nostrils. However, there is no consensus or\n      guideline regarding how deep the nasopharyngeal probe needs to be inserted. This study is\n      being done to determine the insertion depth (or range of depths) that best approximates core\n      temperature, which is temperature of the vital organs, e.g. heart, liver and lungs.\n\n      Participation in the trial will occur on the day of surgery.  The subject will be asked to\n      breathe through one nostril and then the other before receiving anesthesia.  The less\n      congested nostril will be selected for study. If there is no difference, then the\n      investigator will use the right nostril.\n\n      Once under anesthesia, an esophageal temperature probe will be inserted to serve as a\n      reference core temperature, which is used routinely in surgery.  Then the nasopharyngeal\n      probe will be inserted into the nostril.\n\n      Both nasopharyngeal and esophageal temperatures will initially be recorded 45 minutes after\n      anesthetic induction.  The nasopharyngeal probe will then be withdrawn 2 cm and after a\n      3-minute equilibration period, nasopharyngeal and esophageal temperatures will again be\n      recorded.  The nasopharyngeal probe withdrawal sequence will be repeated, 2 cm at a time,\n      until only 2 cm remains in the nostril. There will be a total of 10 sets of nasopharyngeal\n      and esophageal temperatures obtained."
