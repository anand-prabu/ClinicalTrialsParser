To examine whether delivering at-home professionally-led breast cancer support using\n      group video calling is feasible, acceptable and satisfactory for women in rural northern\n      California.\n\n      II. To evaluate the feasibility of using on-line tools to recruit, screen, treat, and assess\n      this population for a subsequent randomized clinical trial.\n\n      III. Assess whether the rate of recruitment of women in this region in this study using\n      predominantly on-line means of recruitment can be improved over that of the previous study\n      using predominantly face-to-face means of recruitment.\n\n      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:\n\n      I. Estimate effect size changes in measures of quality of life (post-traumatic stress\n      disorder symptoms, depression symptoms, perceived stress, and positive states of mind),\n      satisfaction with social support, and self-efficacy for coping with cancer.\n\n      II. Prescribe sample size. III. Perform I and II for all of these outcomes.\n\n      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.\n\n      ARM I (experimental arm): Participants complete at-home group video calling sessions for 1\n      1/2 hours once weekly for 8 weeks.\n\n      ARM II (control arm): Participants receive an educational workbook journal.\n\n      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up for 1 week."
