Determine the toxicity of this treatment regimen in this patient population.\n      III. Study pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 in these patients. IV. Determine the relationship\n      between pharmacokinetics of MGI-114 and clinical outcomes including toxicity and response to\n      therapy in these patients.\n\n      OUTLINE: This is an open label, multicenter study. Patients receive\n      6-hyroxymethylacylfulvene (MGI-114) IV over 5 minutes daily for 5 days. Courses are repeated\n      every 4 weeks. Treatment continues for a minimum of 2 courses in the absence of unacceptable\n      toxic effects or disease progression. Patients are followed until death.\n\n      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 14-35 patients will be accrued for this study within 6-12\n      months."
